<HEAD>Navy: Junior Officer's Errors Caused Destroyer Grounding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A junior officer who ignored advice
from a lower-ranking navigator was to blame for the January
grounding of the Navy destroyer USS Spruance on a reef off the
Bahamas, a Navy report says.
   The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville published the report
Tuesday after obtaining it through a Freedom of Information Act
request. The report contains the final results of the Navy's
investigation.
   ``The grounding of Spruance was not an act of God, was not due
to equipment failure and was not the result of bad weather,'' the
report said.
   ``It was caused by a combination of personnel errors and
misjudgments which, when compressed into a short period of time,
created a situation that put Spruance aground.''
   Though the Mayport-based Spruance was performing maneuvers with
another ship and a submarine, neither the ship's commanding officer
nor the executive officer was on the bridge when the 7,800-ton ship
hit bottom, the report said.
   Shortly after the accident, the Navy removed Cmdr. Travis W.
Parker Jr. as the ship's skipper and reassigned the executive
officer, Lt. Cmdr. J.M. Braeckel. The junior officer in command
when the grounding occurred, Lt. W.T. Hicks, was discharged from
the Navy.
   The Spruance's hull, propellers, sonar dome and forward mast
were damaged in the accident and required $1.4 million in repairs.
   The Spruance was preparing to join an anti-submarine warfare
exercise with the guided-missile frigate Boone and the
nuclear-powered submarine Atlanta off Andros Island in the Bahamas
last Jan. 15.
   In the late evening, Hicks, in command on the bridge, ordered a
series of course and speed changes to proceed with the rendezvous.
The destroyer was just over a half-mile off the reef when the
maneuvers began.
   When Hicks considered a course change that would move the ship
closer to the reef, the report said he was advised against it by
Petty Officer 1st Class E.G. Yeargin, a quartermaster. Another
officer, Lt. j.g. J.S. Lindgren, agreed.
   Hicks ordered the course change but agreed to slow the ship to
just over 3 mph. He then ignored four recommendations from Yeargin
and Lindgren to change course to avoid the reef, according to the
report.
   An officer and an enlisted man in the ship's combat information
center then recommended another course change to expedite the
rendezvous, but that would have led the ship ``directly through the
shoal water,'' the report said.
   Yeargin objected and demanded a course change, but Hicks ignored
him again. Four minutes later, the ship ran aground.
   Among other findings, the report found that charts used aboard
the Spruance had not been properly updated and reefs were not
highlighted as they should have been.
   In addition, the report faulted the Spruance's staff for failing
to calculate the effects of rough seas on the ship at slow speeds.

   Kieko Hara has attended a ``cram school'' for
months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams. She's
5, and her parents hope Kieko will make it into a top-ranked
private elementary school.
   She attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten
and on weekends.
   Some days, Kieko makes rice balls or crafts, or is drilled in
the Japanese alphabet. Once a week, she takes a practice test like
those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they
accept.
   ``We wish she didn't have to go to cram school, but if she gets
into a good private ... system now, then she'll be able to enter
the school's junior high automatically,'' said Yuko, her mother.
   Japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the
high scores of students on achievement tests, but as public schools
have become more equal, parents have sought an edge elsewhere.
   Children are being sent at ever-younger ages to cram schools,
called jukus, or are going to private rather than public schools in
hopes of gaining ground in the merciless college-entrance
competition.
   The Education Ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior
high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons, in
effect creating an entire second school system. It is a booming
business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen, or $7 billion,
a year.
   Some Japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in
education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the
public school system. Others feel public schools have concentrated
on educating the mass of students, neglecting the bright and
creative.
   Getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering
amount of money, as well as work.
   Kieko's parents pay about 65,000 yen ($460) a month for her juku
classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten. Some
classmates began attending a juku at age 3, to prepare for the
kindergarten entrance exam, and now have daily cram sessions before
kindergarten and again in the afternoon.
   Such devotion to schooling has a long history in Japan and some
other Asian nations, but the intense competition is largely a
postwar development that grew with economic prosperity.
   Japan spends less on public education than the United States,
both in total amount and percentage of gross national product.
   In the last fiscal year, the government allocated 16 trillion
yen ($112 billion) to public education, compared with $353 billion
this year in the United States.
   An Education Minstry study in 1987 said 4.2 percent of Japan's
GNP went to public education, compared with 4.8 percent in the
United States, 4.4 percent in Britain and 4.2 percent in West
Germany.
   Spending on education in the United States varies greatly by
school district and region, but Japan has followed a policy of
equal distribution of resources. It also does not ``track''
students, separating them according to ability.
   In the United States, the federal government provides about 6
percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school.
Japan's central government pays 43 percent, much of it in subsidies
to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20
percent, according to government figures.
   The Education Ministry approves textbooks and curricula, so all
students study essentially the same material at the same time.
   In high school, Japanese students cram for college entrance
exams that determine not only what schools they will attend, but
their chances for a good job afterward.
   Companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only
the top universities.
   College entrance exams have become more difficult as competition
has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the
public school curriculum, according to Education Ministry studies.
   With craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten, ``by
junior high school many students feel their life has already been
ordained,'' said Naomi Kikuchi, who has two children in school.
   In the past, a leading public high school was considered the
best preparation for college entrance. That changed as the high
schools became more equal.
   Many parents and students now see jukus, with their
single-minded emphasis on preparing for exams, as more helpful than
public schools in gaining admission to good universities.
   About 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they
disapproved of jukus, but most said they enrolled their children as
``a necessary evil.''
   Other families try to get their children into top private
kindergartens or elementary schools, especially those of respected
private universities that automatically admit graduates of their
own lower schools.
   The first year of Aoyama University's kindergarten, one of the
most sought-after schools, costs about 1.4 million yen ($9,500),
more than the 980,000-yen ($6,800) for the first year of university.
   A survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses
account for 13.4 percent of after-tax earnings for an average
Japanese family in a metropolitan area.
   That did not include salary forgone by the ``kyoiku mama,''
mothers who devote themselves to their children's education until
the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before
entrance exams.
   ``For people without money and mothers who have to work, it's
hard to get children into a good school,'' Mrs. Kikuchi said.

<HEAD>Andy Young: Playing Down Race in Campaign for Governor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew Young doesn't play up the milestone
victories of two black candidates in New York City and Virginia,
but he does share one strategy in his quest to become governor of
Georgia _ he rarely mentions race.
   There's little doubt race will be a factor in many voters' minds
next summer as they size up Young, who is finishing eight years as
Atlanta's mayor. Some pundits already have predicted he will fail
in his bid to become the state's first black governor.
   But others are talking about momentum from the successful
campaigns of Virginia Gov.-elect L. Douglas Wilder and New York
Mayor-elect David Dinkins.
   Young isn't jumping on that bandwagon.
   ``I think it feels good to be a respectable candidate, and
that's all I think I am at this point,'' he said.
   Young says he doesn't have much in common with Wilder and
Dinkins ``other than the fact that we all went to the same college,
Howard University, and we all happen to have the same skin color.''
   But lately, he has done at least one thing both Dinkins and
Wilder did: dismiss race as a factor.
   His campaign chairman is Griffin Bell, a former U.S. attorney
general and federal judge who is white and conservative. Bell was
U.S. attorney general in Jimmy Carter's administration; Young was
ambassador to the United Nations.
   Young also is aggressively pursuing the white vote in mostly
rural and conservative south Georgia, pushing his record for
business development and economic expansion. His campaign manager
is a white former small-town south Georgia mayor, Hobby Stripling
of Vienna.
   ``I would suspect that the Young organization has been studying
carefully the Wilder campaign,'' said Merle Black, a political
science professor at Emory University.
   But unlike Wilder, Young has stuck to his bent for the off-beat.
His latest escapade came last week, when he ate dinner in a rustic
juke joint where two racially offensive songs are featured on the
jukebox.
   ``I'll go anywhere and talk to anybody,'' Young said. ``The
world is made up of different people, and the only way we're going
to survive is to learn to co-exist and respect one another.''
   While there, he played down race in an obviously racially
charged situation and took the opportunity to give the restaurant's
owner a Ray Charles record for the jukebox.
   Political watchers say Young is taking pains to put himself
forth as a racially palatable black candidate.
   ``The fact that Douglas Wilder now has won shows it can be done.
To that extent, it helps Andrew Young be seen as a more credible
and realistic candidate,'' Black said. ``It would have been a
setback for Young's campaign if Wilder had lost.''
   Wilder said his campaign was successful because it appealed to
mainstream values. Although his candidacy was closely watched by
black leaders, Wilder deliberately kept liberal two-time
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson at arms length and did not
invite Jackson to campaign for him.
   Young also will not include Jackson in his campaign, Stripling
said Tuesday.
   ``We don't have any plans to ask Mr. Jackson for any help,'' he
said. ``Our campaign is a Georgia-based campaign, and we will
handle it from within the state.''
   Young was booed loudly by Jackson supporters at the 1984
Democratic National Convention in San Francisco; the Jackson
forces, frustrated over their failure to win concessions from the
Walter Mondale camp, yelled at Young when he rose to speak on
behalf of a Mondale position.
   Young was stunned, his wife cried and a press aide collapsed.
Still, Young and Jackson have remained cordial.
   Atlanta political pollster Claibourne Darden predicts Young's
campaign will be troubled by race, whether he likes it or not.
   Young could come in first in the first round of the Democratic
primary on the strength of his name recognition and the black vote;
24 percent of Georgia's voting-age population is black, Darden
said. But Young wouldn't get the 50 percent he would need to win,
Darden said.
   ``He will be in the runoff regardless'' Darden said. ``But we
are still at a place where a tremendous number of white people in
Georgia are not willing to vote for a black candidate.
   ``It's not like Virginia. You're in the Deep South here, and the
black population is significantly larger. That's unfortunately a
pretty good correlation for prejudice. The larger the (minority)
group, the more prejudice there is.''
   Young, however, discounts that.
   ``I always felt that white folk in Georgia are way ahead of
white folk in New York or Virginia already,'' he said. ``I used to
kid Dave Dinkins that if he could get 30 percent of the white vote
in New York, I know I can get 45 or 50 in Georgia.''
   In the Democratic primary, Young faces Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, two
powerful state legislators, Sen. Roy Barnes and Rep. Bubba
McDonald, and a wild-card entry, former Gov. Lester Maddox.
   The front-runner for the Republican nomination is state Rep.
Johnny Isakson.

<HEAD>Buried Treasure Was in Colorado, Puzzle Solvers Say</HEAD>

   An FBI agent and a deputy prosecutor in Los
Angeles were too late for the gold, but they get the glory. They
have solved the mystery of the $500,000 Golden Horse treasure
contest.
   Alone among the tens of thousands who sought the buried
treasure, they deduced that the Golden Horse was buried in
Tennessee Pass, 10,400 feet above sea level, along the Continental
Divide in Colorado.
   Nick Boone and Anthony Castaneda, who spent more than five years
working separately on the puzzle, told The Associated Press on
Tuesday they had solved the riddle and the people who ran the
contest don't disagree.
   ``We have no comment about the site, but we will acknowledge and
confirm that he's given us totally convincing proof that he found
the exact location,'' Thomas Conlon, president of D.L. Blair, said
after speaking to Boone. Blair, the national sales promotion
company that oversaw the contest, has refused to divulge the
solution.
   Boone, 45, an FBI agent for 18 years, was the FBI's case agent
for planning and security at the 1984 Olympic games.
   ``I know what it is to have a letdown after a long haul,'' Boone
said. ``Tom and I are looking to see if we can find another good
contest.''
   Castaneda, 44, a prosecutor for 16 years, said he was not drawn
to working puzzles before the Golden Horse challenge, ``unless you
count solving murders.''
   The puzzle was offered to the public in 1984 as a story titled
``Treasure: In Search of the Golden Horse,'' which was released as
a book, videotape and laser disc. The story contained arcane and
complex clues to the puzzle.
   Contestants had until midnight of May 26 to find a statuette of
a horse buried somewhere in the United States. The horse was made
of 2.2 pounds of pure gold and contained a key to a safe deposit
box containing a 20-year annuity for $25,000 a year.
   The deadline passed with no claimant. As stipulated by the
rules, the treasure was dug up and turned over to a charity _ Big
Brothers and Big Sisters of America _ but the site was not revealed.
   Many frustrated treasure hunters who spent years, money and
sweat on the puzzle clamored for the solution. Some maintained the
contest was a fraud and that no trove was ever buried.
   Conlon, Big Brothers and the authors of the story, bound by the
contest rules, kept mum.
   ``I would love to have seen them retrieve this seven months ago,
not only for their benefit but ours, so we would not have had to
endure six months of slander,'' Conlon said.
   The partners won't reveal yet the step-by-step path that led
them to Tennessee Pass. That will come in an article they are
preparing for publication in the March issue of Treasure magazine.
   ``You really can't work from the site backward,'' Boone said,
``because there's nothing that points to Colorado and Tennessee
Pass. You have to solve the ciphers to find it.''
   Boone said the puzzle jelled on Nov. 1 and he and Castaneda flew
to the pass two days later to dig up whatever evidence of the stash
remained.
   Amid snow, cold and gathering darkness, they missed the spot by
18 inches, Boone said.
   Returning to Los Angeles, the collaborators realized that they
should have had a Polaroid camera with them to photograph the site
and exactly align a landmark with a map from the book on which the
spot was marked with an ``X.''
   They returned on Nov. 18 and this time found proof positive that
they were right. They dug up a vial containing a parchment that
began: ``Dear seeker. Congratulations. Your travails are over,''
Boone said.
   They also found the remains of the crate that had contained the
horse and a coat that the crate had been wrapped in, said Conlon.
   Then, following instructions on the parchment, Boone telephoned
Conlon and read him a coded message: ``165-69 INF.'' The code
referred to the two numerical designators of Conlon's old Army
unit, the ``Fighting 69th'' infantry regiment.

   Lebanese authorities have released
a Dutch journalist who spent two months in a Beirut jail on
espionage and drug charges, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said.
   Charles van der Leeuw was freed Tuesday and accompanied to Syria
by an official from the Dutch embassy in Damascus, a ministry
spokesman said.
   Van der Leeuw had been detained since Sept. 28 in what the Dutch
Journalists' Union said was a move to stop him from criticizing the
Lebanese Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The ministry spokesman, who asked not to be identified, in line
with ministry policy, would not comment on the circumstances of Van
der Leeuw release.

capability, said the authors of the 1989-1990 edition of ``Jane's
Armored Fighting Vehicle Systems.''
   ``Few countries are at present installing new armament which is
required to penetrate the latest Soviet MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) or
to install more armor to increase their battlefield
survivability,'' wrote Christopher Foss and Tony Cullen in the
authoritative yearbook.
   They said the installation of a larger caliber gun and
additional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles'
suspension and reduce the power-to-weight ratio.
   NATO's next tank gun is likely to have a caliber of 140mm and be
fed by an automatic loader that will enable the crew to be reduced
to three, they said.
   The new gun could be mounted externally with the crew seated
inside the hull. The authors said this provides a number of
advantages, including a significant weight saving, as the turret on
current main battle tanks can weight 20 tons.
   ``The weight saved could be used to make the vehicle more
compact or to increase protection levels, especially against top
attack weapons,'' the authors said.
   ``In addition, it would present an enemy with a much smaller
target.''
   The authors said much development work is taking place on
conventional tank guns and ammunition, but ``there is little doubt
that in the longer term the future is in other types of weapon
systems for the main armament.''
   Liquid propellant is the most likely route for artillery, they
said. For the main battle tank, the electromagnetic or
electrothermal gun is showing ``much promise.''
   The United States is the leader in both areas, they said, in the
latter because of a spinoff from the Star Wars program, formally
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.

<HEAD>New Eastern Europe Fits Gorbachev Vision of Changing World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   By encouraging Eastern European allies who punched
holes in the Berlin Wall and sacked aging leaders, the Soviet Union
is declaring the Cold War over and trying to ensure security in the
new world to follow.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his top advisers believe the
whole world, including post-war Europe, has been changed forever by
an explosion of technology mastered by the other side.
   Looking grimly at the backwardness of his own country and his
neighbors, the breathtaking changes that have gripped Eastern
Europe this fall nevertheless offer Gorbachev two opportunities:
   _ To renew and salvage at least part of a socialist system in
which he sincerely believes, before stagnation and dissatisfaction
blow the lid off.
   _ To achieve economic reform by redirecting his own economy away
from the military and drawing the East into the West's
technological revolution. Military security might be assured
through economic interdependence that makes confrontation
unprofitable.
   When he echoes the call of Alexander Dubcek 21 years ago for
socialism with a ``human face,'' _ Czechoslovakia's reform ground
under the treads of Warsaw Pact tanks _ Gorbachev seems to aim at
keeping half a loaf, rather than risking it all later in
unpredictable fury.
   The move has won Gorbachev respect in the West and support in
Eastern Europe. Poland's non-Communist government has pledged
support to the Warsaw Pact and continued friendship with the Soviet
Union.
   While acknowledging the West's technological superiority and
economic might, Gorbachev is far from declaring surrender in the
Cold War. He and his advisers say they have a clearer idea of how
to use Western muscle to build a new world.
   ``Politically the world has entered a new phase _ it is moving
out of the Cold War into a period of peace,'' Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the U.S. Foreign Policy Association in
October.
   ``Today we need a consensus, an international approach to global
problems _ not because it is a moral imperative, but for objective
reasons, because the world is a single and interdependent whole,''
he said.
   In a world of buyers and sellers criss-crossed with satellite
communications and computer technology, Gorbachev sees his land
that has been sealed off and content with the abacus as the
ultimate loser.
   ``Now we have to make up for lost time, and this requires a more
rapid pace of change,'' he said last week who asked about reforms
in Eastern Europe.
   It also requires peace. Gorbachev is cutting 500,000 men out of
the armed forces, about half of them from Eastern Europe. Some
missiles are being taken out of Eastern Europe. The defense budget
was cut 8.3 percent this year and defense factories are being
retooled to make consumer goods.
   Negotiations continue on sharp cuts in strategic nuclear
weapons, conventional forces in Europe, and chemical weapons.
   ``To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment
for our domestic work,'' Gorbachev told former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt in October.
   The Soviet Union and the czarist empire before it was fearful of
a powerful Germany in the heart of Europe. But the betting now
appears to be that if Germany is absorbed in being Eastern Europe's
rich uncle, it will have little incentive to rock the boat. The
area also may become an area of ``cooperation and understanding''
between the superpowers, the government news agency Novosti said.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former military chief of staff
and a Gorbachev adviser, indicated in an article in the Communist
Party daily Pravda that the army may consider a land buffer is less
important now.
   What worries the Soviet military is being surrounded by U.S.
Navy firepower, Akhromeyev said. The United States has 2{ times
more large surface ships, 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for
the Soviets, 2{ times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more
Marines, he said.
   ``The U.S.A., most likely, intends to continue using these
forces to put pressure on us and threaten the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   If Gorbachev and his advisers believe they have a clear idea of
the future, they are concerned that short-term instability in
Eastern Europe could ruin it.
   ``Any deep changes, especially those in key regions of the
world, are accompanied by instability and difficulties. This is
only natural. The most dangerous thing at such moments is that
someone may be tempted to use them for their own selfish
interests,'' he said on Nov. 21.
   The Berlin Wall, however many holes it has, must remain standing
for the time being, the Soviets say. Too much is changing in Europe
for the region to cope simultaneously with the elimination of the
political structure that kept the peace, however tense, for more
than 40 years.
   Gorbachev's fear of Eastern Europe spinning entirely out of
control may be why he has so firmly supported reform in Poland,
Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Gorbachev was
in China earlier this year just before authorities cracked down on
pro-democracy demonstrators and killed hundreds of them.
   An Eastern Europe with no hope of catching up or enjoying the
fruits of the West's technological revolution could be more likely
to explode. Some reports in East Germany say orders to shoot at
protesters had been given before Erich Honecker was forced out by
Egon Krenz.
   The alternative to reform _ tighter borders and more stagnation
_ would mean abject defeat in the Cold War.

<DATELINE>OBSERVATION POST ALPHA, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American soldiers
who watch the East German frontier don't relax their guard now that
the barriers are down, but some have been deeply moved by the
experience.
   ``At some points north and south of here, there were so many
people coming across, it was like they were getting out of jail. It
choked me up,'' said Sgt. Michael Harris, 26, of Battle Creek, Mich.
   Sgt. 1st Class Joe Osterfeld of Dayton, Ohio, said: ``The
greatest thing in the world is to be a part of it. I was standing
there when they tore a piece of this fence out a few miles away
from here.''
   Harris and Osterfeld are stationed with the 11th Armored Cavalry
Regiment at this post, which they call OP-Alpha, 75 miles northeast
of Frankfurt and a few feet from what used to be a heavily
fortified border.
   U.S. soldiers say they have not relaxed, because increased
Soviet helicopter patrols near the frontier show ``they're still
there,'' but seeing the free flow of people across the line has
been affecting.
   ``You didn't have to be at the border. You could go downtown and
see those people buying things we take for granted, like fruit and
coffee,'' said Sgt. Brad Hanson, 23, of Atlanta.
   The 11th helps keep watch and gather intelligence through
surveillance of Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops on the East German
side. Officials say more than 380,000 Soviet soldiers are based in
East Germany.
   If an attack occurred, the 5,000-man regiment would try to delay
it long enough for other NATO forces to move up. Included in the
unit's sector is the the Fulda Gap, a traditional wartime invasion
route through central Germany.
   For those who watch the 196-mile stretch of border, the dramatic
relaxation of travel restrictions on the East Germans has not
altered the routine very much.
   Osterfeld, 31, led a motorized patrol of men in green camouflage
fatigues along the rusty 10-foot-tall steel mesh fences that mark
the border near OP-Alpha.
   The soldiers, some armed with .45-caliber pistols, others with
M-16 rifles, sometimes patrol on foot, stopping to peer through
binoculars into East Germany and reporting in by radio.
   Since Nov. 9, East Germany has opened 14 new crossings along the
stretch of border guarded by 11th Armored Cavalry soldiers. There
used to be only two.
   None of the crossings are visible from OP-Alpha, and the chilly
landscape of hills and valleys 15 miles northeast of Fulda is
unchanged from before the dramatic changes in East Germany.
   As American soldiers looked across the border with binoculars,
East German guards could be seen in a watchtower 200 yards away,
peering through their own binoculars at the GIs.
   Command Sgt. Maj. Jake Fryer, the outfit's ranking
non-commissioned officer, said ``more than 100,000 well-equipped
Soviet troops'' are stationed directly across from the Americans in
central East Germany.
   ``The Soviets have not shown a willingness to move back; that's
why we're still here and ready to react,'' said Fryer, 38, of
Coburn, Pa.
   ``The East Germans who are coming here are welcome,'' he said,
but ``we are still doing our job and our surveillance.''
   Fryer said the Soviets appeared to have increased their air
patrols along the border, using MI-24 attack helicopters for
missions formerly flown primarily by East Germans in Polish-made
resupply and observation choppers.
   ``We see about one a day, depending on weather and flying
conditions,'' he said. ``I think it's their way of showing that
they're still there and ready too.''
   Over coffee in OP-Alpha's small dining hall, Sgt. Marlon
Thornston, 24, of Niagara Falls, N.Y., said some rookies question
why they still patrol a frontier millions of East Germans crossing
freely.
   ``We now have to explain to our young guys, who have met some of
these nice East German people, why we're still here,'' he said.
``The only thing I don't feel good about is that all of them, even
the bad ones looking for intelligence, also now have more free
access.''
   Staff Sgt. Stephen Torak, 31, of Elkhart, Ind., said: ``We have
to stay here, just in case'' the Soviets and their allies ``haven't
put all their cards on the table.''
   Now and then, an East German guard will wave at the Americans
across the border, Hanson said.
   Do they wave back? ``No,'' he said. ``They're still there, armed
just like we are. Our guys ignore it and carry out their jobs like
professionals.''

<TEXT>
   The seven men were not priests
or human rights campaigners, so their deaths have gone largely
unnoticed.
   But according to relatives and neighbors, including a young man
who barely escaped the slaughter, six of them were lined up against
a peach-colored masonry wall and shot to death on Nov. 18. A
seventh youth who happened upon the killings by chance also was
slain.
   The relatives, neighbors and the young escapee all saw
government soldiers a block away from the killing site in the poor
suburb of Cuscatancingo minutes before the seven were slain. The
young man said he heard the fatal gunshots while hiding from the
soldiers.
   The dead were identified as Walter and Raul Zetino, Oscar Lopez,
Jose Crespin, Jorge Campos, Raul Castro and Emanuel Medrano.
   The killings occurred two days after the slaying of six Jesuits,
their cook and her daughter at Central American University.
   The Central American University killings, carried out by men who
a survivor said wore military uniforms, stunned El Salvador and
caused an international outcry. There was no international outcry
for the seven slain in Cuscatancingo.
   Spokesmen for the Salvadoran armed forces press office were
unavailable for comment on the Cuscatancingo killings.
   Raul Zetino was found ``with his social security card in his
hand. He was still trying to identify himself when they shot him,''
said a neighbor, standing in front of the blood-spattered,
bullet-riddled wall where the six bodies were found the morning of
Nov. 19 in Cuscatancingo at the end of the dusty, partially cobbled
Pasaje El Gringo _ ``Gringo Alley.''
   Medrano, 14, was the only victim not from the neighborhood. His
mother, Alicia, said he was there trying to buy bread. Medrano
appears to have had the bad luck to stumble on the killings as they
were being carried out, or just afterward. His body was found 10
yards away.
   Because his family did not have the $35 for a proper burial, he
is the only one still buried at the end of the alley.
   Relatives and neighbors had buried the seven in a common grave
at the end of the alley on Nov. 19, when much of the capital was
still convulsed by the biggest guerrilla offensive of the
10-year-old civil war.
   The six local men were exhumed with approval of Justice of the
Peace Jesus Cordoba on Nov. 23 and taken to cemeteries.
   ``They were not guerrillas,'' said the coach of the soccer team
on which three of the slain men played. ``They had jobs, families.
Everybody around here knew them. A guerrilla doesn't have time to
work, take care of his family and play soccer.''
   Three of the six were day laborers. One worked at a glass
factory and another at a brewery. Lopez, a 23-year-old illegal
immigrant waiter in Los Angeles, had arrived only two weeks earlier
to visit friends from his neighborhood.
   Cuscatancingo, like other working class districts along the
capital's northern fringe, was the scene of combat in the Nov. 11
offensive's first days. Pasaje El Gringo had come through
relatively unscathed, although fighting was more intense a few
blocks away. Air force strafing and rocketing had come too close
for comfort.
   ``We decided to evacuate,'' said Crespin's sister, Rosa Maria.
``But one always worries about leaving the house completely
abandoned. So the guys decided to stay, to keep an eye on things,
even though we begged them to come too.''
   ``The muchachos (guerrillas) had come through a few days before.
But we had no problem with them, and they didn't stop to stay
here,'' said a neighbor.
   ``We were just sitting around, talking, when someone threw a
rock at a dog in the street in front of us and made it bark and
run,'' said the young man who escaped.
   For days he had refused to meet with any journalist and was only
persuaded to tell his story after the strictest assurances,
delivered through relatives, that he would not be identified.
   ``Here, out of fear, one abstains from saying important
things,'' said a relative. ``Sooner or later, they catch up to
you.''
   ``The soldiers saw Oscar and yelled for him to come out into the
street,'' said the young man who escaped the Cuscatancingo
killings. ``He went out with his hands in the air, saying `We're
civilians.' Jorge and I were sitting with our backs to the wall and
they hadn't seen us. I felt something bad was going to happen and
said to him, `Let's get out of here.'
   ``He said, `We haven't done anything, so why should we run?' and
stood up to take out his identification. The soldier in charge of
the patrol swore at Oscar out in the street: `You, SOB. What the
hell are you doing here?'
   ``I stayed crouched down and took off along the wall and around
the corner,'' he said.
   ``I ran a few blocks and hid. About 10 minutes later there was a
long burst from an M-16. Then the coups de grace, one by one.''
   Cordoba said: ``The only thing I can attest to is that the
bodies of those seven were found at that place on that date, that
six were exhumed on Nov. 23 and that they all died of bullet
wounds.''
   ``Who killed them, I don't know,'' he said.
   Cordoba said he will send the Supreme Court his monthly report
of all official business and the case will be pursued if an
offended party, such as a relative, files a complaint, or if the
attorney general's office decides it merits pursuit, even in the
absence of a complaint.
   The attorney general's office would then make a preliminary
investigation, which probably would include another exhumation and
autopsies, and assign the case to a criminal court judge.
   Meanwhile, Josefina Crespin, Jose's mother, continues to live in
the green house next to her son's, the one whose facade served as
the firing squad wall.
   Three-year-old Carolina, one of Jose's two daughters, played in
the sand in front of the house.
   ``She doesn't even know what happened,'' the grandmother said.
``She just keeps asking, `Where's papi?'''

<HEAD>Despite Vasectomy, Man Fathers Triplets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sam and Julie Morter thought their family
was complete after having three sons, so Sam had a vasectomy.
   Then came the Morters' daughters _ triplets.
   ``We just tell everybody we hoped and prayed for a little girl
and we must have prayed too hard, because now we have three,'' said
Morter, a technical sergeant stationed at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base.
   The Morters always wanted a girl.
   Their first-born was a boy, Jeffy. Then came Johnny, then Jimmy.
   The Morters decided three was enough, and in July 1987, while he
was stationed in Korea, the vasectomy was performed.
   Morter, 29, said a follow-up test performed by an Air Force
surgeon confirmed that the vasectomy was successful.
   Then came Samantha, Stephanie and Sarah, who celebrated their
first birthday Nov. 19.
   Last year, before prescribing birth control pills as treatment
for an ovarian cyst, Ms. Morter's doctor gave her a routine
pregnancy test, even though Mrs. Morter insisted she couldn't
possibly be expecting.
   ``They said, `Not only are you pregnant, you're very pregnant,'
'' Morter said. ``We didn't know what that meant.''
   ``We found out, though,'' his wife said.
   After the pregnancy was confirmed, Morter had his vasectomy
re-examined. A test showed that his sperm count was 30 percent of
normal, instead of zero.
   Doctors aren't sure why the vasectomy failed, Morter said.
   ``They said they'd have to go back in and look,'' he said. He
told them not to bother.
   After the triplets arrived, Mrs. Morter, 28, had her Fallopian
tubes tied. Dr. Jan Bernie, a Dayton urologist, said vasectomy
failure is ``not very common at all. I've done them for 20 years
and maybe one or two in all that time (has failed). It's a very
effective method of birth control.''
   In Morter's case, one of the tubes that carry the sperm from the
testicles probably grew back together, Bernie said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second night in a row, Coast Guard
searchers spotted a flare Tuesday in their hunt for five lobsterman
who disappeared a week ago off the Massachusetts coast.
   The sighting, about 250 miles south of Nantucket, is in a remote
area where Coast Guard rescuers believe a life raft might have
drifted.
   ``The flares are coming from somewhere,'' said Lt. Paul Wolf of
the Coast Guard office in Boston. ``There are no other boats out
there except the Coast Guard.''
   ``We're going to search as long as there's a reasonable
possibility that someone is alive and needs help,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Brannan.
   The 72-foot Heidi Marie, out of Stonington, Conn., was reported
missing by its owner on Nov. 22. The boat's last transmission was
the previous day, the same day officials received a distress signal.
   The jet that spotted the flare Tuesday night continued
searching. Two Coast Guard cutters were also sent to the scene.
   A red flare had been spotted in the area Monday night. Both
orange and red flares are used to signal an emergency, Wolf said.
Flare lights last about two minutes.
   The jet that spotted the second emergency flare was due to
return to land for refueling at about 10 p.m., Wolf said. But a
second aircraft was sent to the area to take its place.
   ``We're so far off shore that it's difficult,'' Wolf said.
   On Friday, rescuers turned up a floating radio beacon and
fishing markers bearing the Heidi Marie's name. The fishing boat
was equipped with a life raft big enough for the entire crew.
   On Tuesday, three aircraft and two cutters searched an
8,000-square-mile area, some of which had been covered before.
   Brannan said the search concentrated around the area where a red
flare was seen Monday night. Coast guard officials said the person
who lit the flare could have been anywhere from 6 to 30 miles from
where it was spotted.
   ``Where the flare was seen is where our trajectory was
predicting the raft would be,'' Brannan said.
   The manufacturer of the boat's life raft told Coast Guard
officials that the craft contained three orange smoke flares, three
red distress flares, plus an unspecified number of parachute
flares, such as the one seen Monday.
   Brannan said she could not speculate about whether the crew
members could survive a week at sea in the life raft.
   ``It depends _ were there provisions? Were they wearing survival
suits?'' she said. The lobster boat carried survival suits for
seven people.
   Seas last Tuesday were reported to be 26 feet high with wind
gusts to 45 knots in the area where the Heidi Marie was lobstering.
   But fishermen in Stonington said it was not unusual for a boat
to stay out in rough seas.
   ``That boat has weathered worse weather,'' said fisherman Skip
Babin.

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Gets Thanksgiving Ratings Boost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC-TV's ``Roseanne'' was back on top of the
Nielsen ratings because of the Thanksgiving holiday as NBC's
Thursday night shows got the turkey leftovers.
   ``The Wonder Years'' placed second for last week as all of ABC's
Tuesday night comedies landed in the top 10. None of NBC's Thursday
shows made it into the top rankings because of a 20 percent
Thanksgiving tune out.
   ABC's ``Whose the Boss?'' was fourth and ``Coach,'' in its
premiere appearance in place of the canceled ``Chicken Soup,'' tied
for eighth. Its other Tuesday show, ``thirtysomething,'' tied for
36th.
   NBC had only two shows in the top 10, ``The Golden Girls'' in
fifth place and ``Empty Nest'' tied for sixth.
   The highest-rated NBC Thursday show was ``Cheers,'' in 13th
place. A rerun of ``The Cosby Show,'' first in recent weeks, was
14th. ``L.A. Law'' tied for 17th, ``A Different World'' tied for
22nd, and ``Dear John'' tied for 25th.
   NBC still won the week with a prime-time ratings average of
13.8, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. The previous week, NBC had
an average of 16.0.
   ABC was second last week with 12.9 and CBS had 12.3. Each
ratings point represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1
million television households tuned to a show.
   The top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' CBS'
``60 Minutes,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' tied,
CBS National League Football Sunday and ABC's ``Coach'' tied, ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' and ABC's NFL Monday Night
Football tied.
   NBC is ahead in the season-to-date ratings and in the November
sweeps, which are used to help determine local advertising rates.
In the first 10 weeks of the season, NBC has averaged a 15.0 rating
to ABC's 13.5 and CBS' 12.4.
   The ratings for the sweeps: Arbitron for 26 days, NBC 15.0, ABC
12.8, CBS 12.0. Nielsen for 25 days, NBC 15.1, ABC 12.6, CBS 12.1.
   ABC and CBS tied for first place among the evening news shows,
although ABC had a slightly higher audience share. Each had a
rating of 10.0, which also represents a slight viewer tune out for
the holiday week. NBC was third with 9.3.

<HEAD>Survey Of Americans And Japanese Finds Mutual Trust Flagging</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and Americans trust each other less and
less and an increasing number are pessimistic about the
relationship between their countries, according to a new poll.
   Japanese still trust the United States more than any other
country, but Japan ranks only No. 11 among countries Americans
trust, according to the poll published Tuesday by Japan's largest
daily newspaper.
   According to the survey, former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan
have left strong impressions on many Japanese but nearly eight in
10 Americans cannot name a single Japanese individual who has stuck
in their minds.
   The poll was conducted by the paper Yomiuri Shimbun and the
American Gallup polling organization. The Yomiuri said 3,000
Japanese were surveyed in late September and 1,025 Americans in
mid-October. A margin for error was not given.
   With trade tensions between the two countries on the rise, more
Americans than ever before in annual poll's 11-year history called
relations between the United States and Japan ``bad.''
   Among Americans, 9.3 percent said relations were bad, compared
to 6.0 percent last year. Among Japanese, traditionally more
pessimistic on the issue, 18.4 percent said relations were bad,
slightly up from 17.5 percent in 1988.
   Many Americans still feel relations are ``good'' or ``very
good'' _ 45.6 percent, compared to 38 percent of Japanese. Among
the Japanese polled, just 31 percent believed relations will
improve, compared to 52 percent of Americans.
   Only 15.1 percent of Americans named Japan among the five
countries they most trusted, up slightly from last year but far
below the 23.4 percent in 1984. Nearly 54 percent of Japanese said
they trusted the United States, down from last year and lower than
the 57.4 percent in 1984.
   Americans in the poll expressed the most trust for Canada,
Britain, Australia and Switzerland. Japanese gave top
trustworthiness rankings to the United States, Britain, Australia
and France.
   Asked if their government should protect domestic industries by
restricting imports, 66 percent of Americans said yes, compared to
43 percent of Japanese.
   On agriculture, 64 percent of Americans said their government
should restrict imports, compared to 60 percent of Japanese. Both
figures were up from last year.
   Among the Japanese polled, 82 percent said they would choose a
domestically made product over an import, compared to 73 percent of
the Americans.
   Asked to name a Japanese person who had made an impression on
them, most of the Americans came up blank.
   The late Emperor Hirohito was the most prominent Japanese in
American minds, although he was named by just 6.6 percent of those
polled.
   Next was Sony Corp. chairman Akio Morita. Considered an
unusually high-profile figure in Japanese business circles, he
still left an impression on only 1.6 percent of the Americans
polled.
   By contrast, 33.8 percent of Japanese said John F. Kennedy made
an impression on them, followed by 23.3 percent for Reagan and 17.0
percent for Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who was supreme commander of
U.S. forces occupying Japan after World War II.
   Americans saw their own leaders somewhat as the Japanese did,
ranking Kennedy and Reagan highest, followed by Martin Luther King
Jr.
   President Bush ranked eighth most impressive to Americans, and
ninth to Japanese.

   President Bush sought to reassure European
allies Tuesday about his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, promising ``I'm not going to surprise them'' with any
agreement to cut nuclear weapons or reduce U.S. troops overseas.
   Bush said he and Gorbachev may discuss possible military
cutbacks ``in a general way'' when they meet off the coast of Malta
on Saturday and Sunday.
   But he added, ``In writing, I have made clear to Mr. Gorbachev _
in my handwriting, so he knows it comes from me, not the
bureaucracy _ that this is not a summit for arms control
agreement.''
   Meanwhile, budget constraints at home are forcing cuts in the
U.S. armed services _ whatever troop withdrawals are negotiated
with the Warsaw Pact. As of Nov. 1, there were 2.13 million men and
women in the armed services.
   The services have drafted plans for a reduction of 275,000, with
about 135,000 to be trimmed from the Army, 100,000 from the Air
Force and 40,000 from the Navy and Marines, defense sources told
The Associated Press.
   Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney will make a decision on the
service chiefs' proposal when he returns Thursday from a NATO
meeting in Brussels, Belgium, and reports to President Bush.
   The sources, declining to be identified, said Richard Darman,
the director of the presidential Office of Management and Budget,
was pushing for even deeper cuts in the armed forces.
   Pentagon officials recommended cutting 23,000 jobs involved in
weapons procurement for the Army and Air Force, according to a
report in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post. A final
decision has not been made, but members of Congress have complained
that the cuts are aimed mainly at workers and field-level positions
while not reducing the ranks of management.
   Bush said it was very important for the allies to know ``I'm not
going to go off and prematurely jump out there and try to
grandstand by committing them to something. That's not the way you
keep an alliance strong.''
   After the two-day summit, Bush will fly to Brussels on Dec. 4 to
brief NATO leaders on the discussions.
   The allies were aghast to learn in 1987 that then-President
Reagan and Gorbachev had come close to a deal at a summit in
Reykjavik to abolish all nuclear weapons in spite of the fact that
NATO regards some of those arms as vital to deter Soviet attack.
   Now, with the collapse of hard-line communist regimes in Eastern
Europe, and massive budget deficits in the United States, the Bush
administration is considering major cutbacks in troops and weapons.
   Gorbachev is facing similar pressures at home.
   However, Bush said, ``There are no arms control proposals'' for
the summit.
   ``So the surprise will be, if you're looking for a surprise,
there won't be a surprise. That may come as a surprise,'' he said.
   He said there had been ``frantic speculation'' and ``hyped
speculation'' that the superpowers would reach a deal on arms or
troops.
   ``Now if we want to talk in a general way with the Soviet
leaders about our aspirations for how a defense system will look 10
years from now, of course, we'll do that, we want to do that,''
Bush said.
   In particular, Bush said, he would like to talk with the Soviets
about curtailing their defense spending.
   ``But that's not what I'm referring to when I talk about
euphoric expectations of some deal,'' Bush said. ``There isn't
going to be such a deal. It takes two to make a deal.''
   Separately, the State Department said the United States has
little interest in a possible Soviet proposal to restrict naval
power.
   ``The Soviet Union, a land power, would be less constrained by
such proposals,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler. ``We are not aware of naval arms control measures that
enhance stability.''
   Despite criticism at home that he has reacted too cautiously to
changes sweeping Eastern Europe, Bush said his approach was solidly
supported by NATO leaders.
   Saying he had consulted with each NATO chief, Bush said, ``I
don't want to sound self-centered here but almost every one of
those leaders told me, `We think the United States is handling this
properly. We appreciate the way you're handling these changes, the
prudent approach you are taking.'''
   Moreover, Bush said, it should be the people of Eastern Europe
who lead the way toward change. ``It doesn't come from somebody
halfway across the world dictating how fast change should be or
what change should encompass.''
   Bush also promised that he would press Gorbachev at the summit
over the behavior of Moscow's Central American allies _ Cuba and
Nicaragua, which the United States accuses of shipping Soviet-made
weapons to leftist insurgents.
   The president said he was asked in a telephone call from Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias to ask Gorbachev to ``stop feeding
Fidel Castro.'' Arias has spearheaded a drive for a regional peace
accord in Central America.
   Bush said the Soviets have not cut off arms deliveries to Cuba.
   ``And as Mr. Arias said, there is one person most responsible
for support of the FMLN (leftist rebels) to deny democracy to
Central America, deny democracy to El Salvador, and that is Fidel
Castro,'' Bush said. He said Arias mentioned Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega in the same connection.

   A New England Airline commuter plane with
eight people aboard was feared missing in the Atlantic Ocean after
it vanished on a Tuesday night flight from Block Island,
authorities said.
   Coast Guard rescue teams were dispatched to the waters off
Westerly to search for the twin-engine airplane.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Joseph Coughlin said the aircraft left
the airport on Block Island at 6 p.m. He said the flight to
Westerly is about 17 miles, and should take 15 minutes.
   ``They had an hour and 45 minutes of fuel on board, and an
emergency locator transmitter,'' he said.
   Coughlin said two airplanes flying in the area ``saw something
in the water a half-mile south of Weekapaug Point,'' and picked up
a distress signal, but the airplane had not been found.
   Coast Guard searchers from New London, Conn., Point Judith and
Block Island searched the water near Westerly, and Coughlin said a
helicopter from the guard's Cape Cod Air Station was en route.
   Searchers found a piece of luggage on the shore of Block Island,
prompting the Coast Guard to expand the search, said Seaman Roger
Anderson.
   Coughlin said the search was extended to Watch Hill, about five
miles from Westerly in the state's southernmost tip.
   Airline spokesman Dean Martin said the British Norman Islander
aircraft was a chartered flight with seven passengers and one pilot
on board.
   Michael Ciccarelli, the regional Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman in Burlington, Mass., said the FAA Flight Service Station
in Bridgeport, Conn., also picked up the emergency signals.

<TEXT>
   It was to be a casual ``feet up'' meeting with
neither expectations nor an agenda. But since this weekend's
superpower summit was first announced, the White House is gradually
defining items it expects to broach at Malta.
   The administration is seeking to shape an agenda that seems
guaranteed to keep the feet of both Soviet and U.S. leaders firmly
planted _ even as President Bush insists his shipboard summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will yield no deals and no
surprises.
   ``So the surprise will be, if you're looking for a surprise,
there won't be a surprise. That may come as a surprise,'' Bush told
reporters Tuesday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater recently observed
that the Soviets tend to overplay advance expectations for summits,
Americans tend to minimize them; and that the truth lies somewhere
in between.
   So, a week after Bush told a Providence, R.I., audience the
summit would be ``historic,'' the president complained to reporters
during an Oval Office picture-taking session Tuesday about ``all
kind of hyped speculation.''
   Bush insisted he would cut no deals with Gorbachev on arms
control nor do anything else that would give allies pause. And he
said the meeting remains ``without a fixed agenda.''
   Still, in an effort not to be caught off-guard as the United
States was at the 1987 Reagan-Gorbachev summit at Reykjavik, the
Bush administration has been compiling a list of subjects that Bush
is prepared to discuss.
   It also has suggested ground rules on how some of the subjects
will be handled.
   That looks an awful lot like an agenda.
   For one thing, the president has made clear he will confront
Gorbachev on the issue of continued Soviet bloc arms shipments to
rebels in El Salvador, by way of Nicaragua and Fidel Castro's Cuba.
   The administration has said the continued shipments threaten
improved U.S.-Soviet relations in other areas.
   ``I'm not the sort of man that will go there and not raise it,''
Bush said.
   Bush also has vowed to ``seek his (Gorbachev's) active
cooperation in cleaning up the world's environment.''
   ``A world solution can begin with the United States and the
Soviet Union,'' the president told a Republican fund-raising
audience several days ago.
   The unraveling of the Soviet Union's East European dominion, of
course, will set the tone for the Bush-Gorbachev talks and dominate
any agenda-setting efforts.
   Bush has said he intends to discuss the upheaval in detail with
the Soviet leader and will delve into such issues as U.S. trade
with Soviet bloc nations.
   But he has been careful to assure the United States' European
allies that he and Gorbachev will not discuss any future European
boundaries, that the fate of Eastern bloc nations should be theirs
alone to decide.
   White House officials also indicated this week that Bush is
prepared to talk with Gorbachev about arms reductions in Europe,
even though the administration earlier played down this aspect.
   U.S. officials have suggested that the breakup of the Warsaw
Pact could provide a golden opportunity for deep cuts in U.S.
defense spending _ much of which is earmarked for waging a war in
Europe.
   Fitzwater said that ``certainly the two presidents in Malta will
talk about arms control and military force structure.''
   But Bush emphasized Tuesday that he would not ``enter into an
arms control agreement'' at the summit, and would not catch U.S.
allies off guard. Bush is to brief allies in Brussels at the
conclusion of the summit.
   If the low-key projections issuing from the White House this
week follow an old mold for summitry, they also adhere to a pattern
Bush has set in his political life.
   Bush and his lieutenants did their best to lower expectations
about Bush's 1988 acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention; and yet the intensely practiced speech he gave was one
that many analysts viewed as the best of his career.
   The Bush camp sought to play down expectations of the
candidate's performance potential before both of his campaign
debates with Democratic contender Michael Dukakis.
   And, more recently, Bush and his lieutenants voiced low
expectations before May's NATO summit in Brussels that the session
would produce anything dramatic or lead to a resolution of the
alliance's intramural dispute over short-range arms based in West
Germany.
   However, Bush produced a breakthrough compromise that unified
NATO on the arms issue.

   Mikhail Gorbachev wants assurances from President
Bush this weekend that the United States will not exploit the
Eastern European reform movement, say government officials who add
the Soviet leader hopes for improved trade ties from the superpower
summit.
   Gorbachev also will be seeking progress on an array of arms
control issues as he and Bush hold their first summit Saturday and
Sunday on U.S. and Soviet warships in the waters off Malta.
   ``To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment
for our domestic work,'' says Gorbachev, whose economic
restructuring program of perestroika has yet to produce measurable
improvements in the daily life of Soviet citizens.
   The 58-year-old Soviet leader will be attending his sixth summit
with an American president, and in circumstances that scarcely
seemed imaginable a few weeks ago _ much less when he first sat
down with President Reagan in Geneva.
   Gorbachev has encouraged and endorsed the political changes that
have brought reformers to power in every Eastern bloc nation except
Romania. But in the days leading up to the summit, he has spoken
openly of fears that the West may try to exploit the situation.
   ``The most dangerous thing at such moments is that someone may
become tempted to use them for their own selfish interests,'' he
said recently.
   Bush seemed to reply in a speech on Nov. 22 in which he said,
``We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this process of
reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him our
word that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking
advantage, but as a people offering support.''
   There seems little doubt that Gorbachev will underscore his
commitment to reform.
   ``Moscow observers say in jest that Gorbachev will possibly
carry to Bush on board the cruiser Belknap a fragment of the ruined
Iron Curtain,'' the official Novisti Press Agency quipped.
   Gorbachev says the Kremlin will no longer impose its views on
its allies and may seek a pledge that Washington will not, for
example, try the sort of end-run the Soviets staged by aiding Fidel
Castro's Cuba. To bar potential unrest, the Soviets may even
endorse massive U.S. assistance; Poland, for example, is seeking $1
billion in Western cash.
   Bush's Thanksgiving eve invitation to Gorbachev to end decades
of East-West confrontation was seized on by the Soviets as proof
the superpowers are on the threshold of a ``new stage of broad and
open cooperation,'' in the words of Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   The Soviets are writing a law allowing virtually unrestricted
emigration of Jews and others that Bush wants before recommending
that the Soviets be granted ``most-favored nation status,'' to ease
access of their goods to U.S. markets.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze flushed with anger when
asked whether the summit was called so the Kremlin could seek U.S.
aid for its shortage-plagued economy. ``It offends our national
pride,'' he said.
   But pride or not, the Soviets want U.S. know-how, computers and
management techniques.
   Shevardnadze says the Soviets want ``mutually beneficial
economic and trade cooperation.'' However, even if Bush agrees to
loosen controls on high-tech exports and upgrade the Soviets'
trading status, it's uncertain how much their state-run enterprises
could benefit.
   As of now, they can offer U.S. customers only ``petroleum and
vodka and caviar and not much else,'' says Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   Arms control _ the centerpiece of past summits _ is now
overshadowed by the momentous changes in Eastern Europe. For
Soviets, however, weapons cuts would be tangible proof that
Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' is paying off.
   The Soviet ideal, says Viktor A. Kremenyuk, would be a timetable
fixing goals for the Geneva talks on strategic weapons cuts and the
Vienna negotiations on conventional arms in Europe. Kremenyuk is
the deputy chief of a Kremlin think tank studying the United States.
   At the last round of Geneva talks, ``the two sides' approaches
were so far apart that no convergence was discernible,'' Novisti
charged in frustration. The Soviets cleared the way for progress by
dropping their condition that Washington agree not to deploy the
Strategic Defense Initiative, and now are hinting Malta could break
remaining logjams.
   Kremenyuk said the Soviets want the 30 percent to 50 percent
cuts in superpower arsenals envisaged by the proposed Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, plus a cooling-off of regional conflicts
like Afghanistan, so they can shift more resources to the civilian
economy.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Aid Plan for Poland and Hungary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, while telling a Poland-bound
delegation of prominent Americans ``dollars alone won't make the
difference,'' is sending nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid to Poland
and Hungary.
   Bush used a Tuesday evening sendoff reception for the U.S.
mission to sign legislation providing $938 million for the two East
bloc nations over the next three years.
   In addition, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who heads
the mission, said he will announce a new $20 million installment in
U.S. food aid on Thursday in Warsaw.
   Bush told the presidential panel, as it prepared to leave
Washington on its four-day tour of Poland, that it should give him
an initial report by phone while he is in Malta this weekend for
his shipboard summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I want to know how this goes. I'd like to hear it there, in
Malta. It will give me flexibility in my talks with the general
secretary,'' Bush said.
   He said the upheavals sweeping Poland and other Soviet bloc
nations would be ``high on our agenda'' at the summit.
   Bush signed the legislation, which provides more aid than he had
sought, at a reception for the presidential mission at Blair House,
the official guest residence across the street from the White
House. The mission left Washington later Tuesday night and was to
return on Saturday.
   The legislation, which Bush called ``a major and positive step
in bipartisan foreign policy,'' includes programs for Poland with a
value of $846.5 million. Hungary would receive benefits with a
total value of $91.5 million.
   He said both nations had ``stirred the imagination of the
world.''
   ``We are nearing the end of a year that future generations will
remember as a watershed, a year when the human spirit was lifted
and spurred on by the bold and courageous actions of two great
peoples, the people of Poland and Hungary,'' Bush said.
   However, he said that ``we've got to recognize the fact that
dollars alone won't make the difference.''
   He said the ``economic miracle'' of Western Europe came only
after ``full engagement of our private sector in shaping the free
market system that has generated unprecedented prosperity across
Western Europe.''
   ``That lesson holds true for Poland today,'' Bush continued.
``Our aid must be seen as seed money for free market reform and for
the involvement of our private sector.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chief sponsor of the Poland aid bill,
said in a statement after the bill-signing, ``Now we're a partner
with the forces of freedom in eastern Europe. We're giving
Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed.''
   Yeutter voiced some pessimism on short-term prospects for
improved conditions either in Poland or in its fast-changing East
bloc neighbors.
   ``Economic reform is not an overnight proposition. It will take
time. It would be tragic indeed if all the magnificent emotion of
the moment is channeled into frustration,'' he told a White House
news briefing.
   The delegation includes Yeutter, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, chief White House economist
Michael Boskin and 20 representatives of business, labor and
academia.
   Another two dozen government officials also were expected to
accompany the delegation.
   Bush named the delegation last month to ``focus on those
economic sectors where U.S. expertise and experience can be of
greatest assistance.'' He said other missions, targeting more
specific areas, would follow.
   Mrs. Dole, who with her husband Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
visited Poland in August, predicted a period of ``some pain'' as
Poland moves from a state-owned economy to a market economy.
   ``There'll be a loss of jobs for some people. Also, as subsidies
are removed from certain areas, there will be an increase in
prices,'' the labor secretary said.
   She said the U.S. government could help the new Solidarity-led
government ease the pain by establishing some form of social safety
net to ``help workers make it through the inevitable dislocations.''

<HEAD>Reduced Use of Chlorofluorocarbons in '70s Slowed Global Heating:
Expert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major climate changes that may result from
global warming are being delayed by 20 years due to less use of
chlorofluorocarbon gases in the United States and other nations, a
NASA scientist says.
   James Hansen, a researcher at NASA's Institute for Space
Studies, said that chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, make up about 25
percent of the so-called ``greenhouse gases'' thought to be causing
the Earth to slowly heat up.
   But if production of CFCs had not been reduced in 1974, he said
Tuesday, the compound by now would have made up more than half of
the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the planet would be
heating faster.
   ``If the growth of CFC production in the early 1970s had
continued to date,'' Hansen says in a paper published in Journal of
Geophysical Research, ``the CFCs would now cause a much larger
greenhouse effect, greater than that for CO2 (carbon dioxide).''
   In an interview, Hansen said that with an unchecked use of CFCs,
``we would get to the large climate changes caused by greenhouse
forcing (or heating) in 20 years rather than in 40 years as most
models (theories) now predict. The CFCs would provide a forcing at
least as large as CO2.''
   The greenhouse heating effect of CFCs would be three times
larger now if production of the chemical had not been reduced in
the 1970s, Hansen said.
   CFCs once were used as a propellant in cans of such products as
hair spray, paint and household cleaners. When studies showed that
the chemical compound could harm the atmosphere, the use of CFCs as
a propellant was stopped in the United States, Canada and in some
European countries. Starting in 1974, there was a sharp reduction
in the production of CFCs.
   The chemical, however, continues to be used as a refrigerant and
in some industrial applications.
   In addition to contributing to the greenhouse heating of the
atmosphere, some CFCs also cause a depletion in the ozone layer of
the stratosphere. High level ozone blocks solar ultraviolet rays, a
principle cause of skin cancer. As a result of this ozone problem,
the United States and some other nations have agreed to stop
production of some CFCs in the 1990s and to develop other chemical
compounds to use as refrigerants.
   Hansen said that manmade gases, principally carbon dioxide, in
the atmosphere are thought to have caused the Earth to retain an
additional 2 watts of heat energy per square meter since 1890.
   He and other scientists predict that this heat retention will
increase to about 4 watts per square meter in about four decades if
the rate of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere by human
activities continues at its present, increasing rate.
   Exactly how and when this will affect the Earth's temperature is
a matter of controversy, Hansen said, ``because of the uncertainty
in climate sensitivity.''
   But some experts have expressed fears that increasing the
temperature of the Earth by only a few degrees could force a rise
in ocean levels and seriously affect food production by changing
the climate in major farm areas.
   The greenhouse effect is caused by atmospheric gases that act
rather like a blanket by keeping heat from radiating from the Earth
into space. This could gradually force the globe to warm.
   Carbon dioxide, the principle greenhouse gas, is produced by
combustion, such as in the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood.

<HEAD>Investigation Planned Into Handling of Barry Drug Allegation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia investigators plan to
question police officials who in 1983 reviewed allegations that
Mayor Marion Barry was hospitalized for drug overdoses, a published
report says.
   Barry released a statement Tuesday night calling the allegations
``outrageous'' and adding, ``I went to the hospital because I had a
sharp pain across my chest ... I wasn't using illegal drugs then or
at any other time.''
   The Washington Post today quoted unnamed police sources as
saying that Police Chief Isaac Fulwood Jr. has ordered an internal
investigation into the handling of the allegations.
   WUSA-TV reported Monday that Barry was hospitalized for cocaine
overdoses at Howard University and D.C. General Hospital in 1983,
according to allegations made to police nine months later by Dr.
Alyce Gullattee, a Howard University drug abuse specialist.
   On Tuesday, former police chief Maurice T. Turner said Gullattee
came to him with the allegations and he turned them over to the
department's Internal Affairs Division, which was then unable to
verify her account.
   ``Basically the investigation revealed it was unsubstantiated
allegations,'' said Turner, a Republican who is an unannounced
candidate for mayor in next year's election.
   Turner confirmed that Barry was not treated by Gullattee in
either instance. He also said Gullattee's information came from her
patients and she had no firsthand knowledge of the mayor's medical
treatment.
   Donald C. Thomas, a physician who was then the director of the
D.C. General Hospital's emergency room, said Barry underwent a
checkup for several hours before he was released and was told to
take it easy. Thomas, who supervised Barry's care, said there was
no indication that Barry had been using drugs.
   Turner scoffed at suggestions that either he or the police
officers handling the case might have muddled the investigation to
protect the mayor.
   ``Why waste 32 years (on the police force) to cover up something
like this?'' Turner told WRC-TV. ``It's just not worth it.''
   At the time, officials said Barry had been hospitalized for
flareups of a hiatal hernia problem.
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday there
was insufficient evidence to open an investigation.
   Barry's activities already are under federal grand jury
investigation in connection with convicted drug dealer Charles
Lewis, who said in open court that he bought drugs for Barry.
   Turner said he has known Gullattee for about 12 years. He told
WUSA-TV on Tuesday that she told police investigators she knew a
7-year-old boy who was a drug addict. That story was the subject of
a Washington Post article by Janet Cook, which won a 1981 Pulitzer
Prize. The newspaper was forced to return the award when Cook
admitted that the boy was fictional.
   Police ``exhausted a lot of resources'' trying to find the boy,
whom Gullattee said she knew, Turner added.
   Gullattee did not return several telephone calls to her office
on Tuesday.

   Edward Cook got a bit unglued when the U.S. Postal
Service refused to accept its own newly issued no-lick stamp.
   Not only did it return his letter. The postman charged him 25
cents to return it. And to make matters worse, the stamps cost an
extra 3 cents each.
   ``I didn't want to pay 28 cents for a stamp I could get for 25
cents, but my wife wanted to try them,'' Cook said.
   Cook, a 57-year-old airline consultant, was trying to send a
letter to his daughter at Stanford University, but it never got
past the San Francisco post office, which didn't recognize the
Postal Service's latest invention.
   Dick Able, director of marketing for the Postal Service in
Denver, which was chosen as the test market for the stamps, said
somebody apparently didn't get the word.
   ``We probably did our usual terrible job of internal marketing,
and didn't let our employees know we were test marketing this,''
Able said.
   He said there has been a recent surge in demand for the stamp,
adding: ``We don't know if it's because they like them, or they
think these will be the first, last and only version, and they'll
become a collector's item.''
   Meantime, the Postal Service is getting out of the sticky
situation by offering Cook free delivery of his letter and an
apology.
   Cook, however, said, ``I'm sure not buying any more.''

   Comedian Redd Foxx said he would have asked his
show-business friends for help had he known the Internal Revenue
Service was going to raid his home and seize his property to pay
past-due taxes.
   ``I could have gotten in touch with Eddie Murphy or Richard
Pryor or Frank Sinatra or somebody who knows that, you know, I have
been helpful to a lot of people,'' the star of the old TV series
``Sanford and Son'' said Tuesday after IRS agents left him with
only a bed at his home.
   Agents seized at least seven cars and even took jewelry that
Foxx was wearing, said his business manager, Prince Spencer.
   ``It looked like a rock house raid,'' Spencer said. ``They
really played it kind of rough.''
   The IRS said the seizures were made to pay $755,166.21 in taxes
Foxx owed for 1983, 1984 and 1986. It said Foxx had ignored four
payment notices.
   IRS spokeswoman Norma Lalley refused to say whether Foxx's house
was seized, but Spencer said agents told the entertainer he could
continue staying at the home until it was sold. The home was valued
at $200,000 in a 1983 court filing.
   Foxx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that year,
citing $1.6 million owed the IRS from taxes before 1983 and more
than $800,000 owed other creditors. A bankruptcy judge ordered Foxx
to sell several Southern California properties.
   Spencer said Foxx had cut his latest tax bill by a few hundred
thousand dollars, paying the IRS everything he has been making from
shows at the Hacienda casino since August.

   A judge ruled that the latest sports
videotape featuring comedian Tim Conway's diminutive ``Dorf''
character can be shipped to stores despite a distributor's claim
that it was unfairly cut out of the deal.
   Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled Tuesday that J2
Communications Inc. has first right of refusal for distribution of
``Dorf'' videos only when they are produced by Longshot Enterprises
Inc., of which Conway is the majority owner.
   Lewin cited a contract between J2 and Longshot, which began
producing the ``Dorf'' series in 1986. Conway's costumed character,
Derk Dorf, is supposed to be 4 feet tall.
   J2 distributed the first three ``Dorf'' videos, ``Dorf on
Golf,'' ``Dorf and the First Games of Mt. Olympus'' and ``Dorf's
Golf Bible.''
   Lewin said the story idea and production of the new ``Dorf Goes
Auto Racing'' came from Liaison East Inc., so the distribution
contract between J2 and Longshot does not apply.
   J2 filed suit Nov. 8 against Conway and Longshot, alleging
breach of contract and good faith.
   The next day, Lewin temporarily barred distribution of ``Dorf
Goes Auto Racing,'' which had been scheduled for release Nov. 15.
Liaison attorney Deborah Drooz said the company now will negotiate
with its sponsors for a new release date.

   Demonstrators protesting U.S. policy in El
Salvador drowned out much of former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's comments at a news conference in which he focused on
Eastern Europe.
   ``Go to Washington and argue with the people in Washington,''
Kissinger told one protester who had gotten into Tuesday's news
conference.
   Kissinger, in town for a speech at the University of Minnesota,
refused to discuss El Salvador, except to say that protesters don't
have ``the foggiest idea of what I support.''
   About 30 student protesters chanted ``Stop the killing. Stop the
war. U.S. out of El Salvador'' outside the hall where Kissinger was
speaking.
   Protester Jennifer Leazer of Minneapolis said Kissinger's
appearance was being opposed because of his ``history of
involvement as an architect of American policy.''
   At the news conference, Kissinger called the recent reforms in
Eastern Europe ``one of the most important and, in many ways,
pregnant moments'' since the end of World War II.
   ``Now we are in a world in which major parts of what was under
communism can join and overall international order which is going
to be less dangerous, more peaceful and maker a greater
contribution to progress,'' he said.
   ``That sort of opportunity comes along only once in a century.''

<HEAD>Report: Some Farm Operators Collecting Subsidies in Excess of Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report by the Agriculture Department's
watchdog agency says some big farm operators are still collecting
crop subsidies in excess of limits set by Congress.
   In one case, the department's Office of Inspector General said
Tuesday, a single farm operation collected about $2.8 million in
subsidies, 56 times the $50,000 limit set by law.
   The report did not identify the recipient of the huge payment,
and inspector general officials refused to provide further details.
   However, the report's appendix showed a ``maximum payment
limitation'' for Jackson County, Ark., with an audit figure of
$2,867,614 in ``questioned costs and loans.''
   The entry also showed that $2,788,077 of the total as
``unsupported costs and loans'' by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, the agency that handles
commodity subsidy programs.
   Other areas of abuse also were cited in the agency's semiannual
report to Congress on investigative and audit activities during the
six months that ended Sept. 30.
   Those abuses included crop insurance overpayments, loopholes in
debt restructuring by the Farmers Home Administration and flaws in
the export subsidy program.
   By law, the crop subsidies, called ``deficiency payments,'' are
not supposed to exceed $50,000 per person per year. These are
direct payments to help make up the difference between depressed
market prices and higher ``target'' prices set by the government.
   For example, last month the price of corn at the farm was $2.20
a bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $2.84.
   A ``person'' can be an individual, a joint stock company, a
corporation, an association, a trust or some other legal entity.
   The report said ``abuses in the program continued'' despite
efforts by Congress in the 1987 Omnibus Reconciliation Act to close
loopholes. Overall, in 1987, an estimated $66 million was paid to
farmers who dodged the $50,000 limitation.
   Investigators have found that big operators often reorganize to
qualify additional ``persons'' for the purpose of collecting larger
payments.
   In one case, an individual used relatives, employees and
business associates as ``persons'' under the program, the report
said. Those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987. Payments
totaled about $2.8 million for the two years, plus more in 1988 and
1989, which are under review by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   ``We have recommended that ASCS improve its review procedures
and withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined,''
the report said.
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said of the report:
   ``Outrageous payments such as these undermine public support for
farmers. A few bad apples are giving all farmers a bad name.''
   A spokesman for the National Farmers Union, Michael V. Dunn,
said loopholes are ``something we've been concerned about'' for a
long time.
   ``We end up with subsidies going to all types of corporations
and corporate investors,'' Dunn said. ``We have long advocated
targeting those payments to family sized operations.''
   Other findings of the inspector general's report included:
   _Loss adjustment errors by the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. and
reinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at
$91 million out of $716 million paid out in claims. Underpayments
totaled $1.6 million.
   _Under Farmers Home Administration debt-restructuring
procedures, borrowers were able to sell off security property and
still qualify for ``buyout'' benefits. Buyouts allow borrowers to
have debts written off by FmHA after buying back the note at 30
cents on the dollar, based on the value of the remaining property
held as collateral.
   ``For example, one borrower improperly disposed of a portion of
collateral securing outstanding debt totaling $160,000,'' the
report said.
   ``However, since the borrower qualified for the buyout, FmHA
allowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30 cents on the
dollar, a loss to the government of $112,000.''
   The report recommended FmHA seek legislation that would deny a
``buyout'' to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith under
the debt-restructuring program.
   _Subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreign
countries are provided under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. Private exporting companies collect the subsidies, or bonuses,
in the form of surplus commodities held by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   The subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customers
lower prices than otherwise would be the case. That enables U.S.
products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers,
notably the European Economic Community, which has export subsidy
programs of its own.
   But investigators said they found that ``some countries in the
program do not show strong competition with U.S. commodities.''
Overall, the report questioned EEP bonus payments of $151 million
for transportation costs, which ``may not be allowed'' by federal
law, and payments of $89.8 million that resulted from ``a possible
miscalculation of world prices.''

   The actor stuck out his chin, pursed his lips and
flipped his wrist in a questioning gesture _ and the laughter that
exploded from the disbelieving audience proved everyone knew who he
was supposed to be.
   Only one person, a young woman in third row center at Moscow's
Satire Theater, bent her head and appeared more traumatized than
amused by the parody of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   She was his daughter, Irina.
   Clearly upset, she left Friday night's performance of emigre
writer Vladimir Voinovich's courtroom comedy, ``The Tribunal,''
before the curtain call.
   But if she could not laugh at her father, the rest of the
audience could, in a way they could never publicly laugh at a
Soviet leader before.
   In one of the ironies of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
greater openness, he has become the butt of jokes by a growing
group of fearless comics, who once could not have dreamed of
mocking the country's leader _ at least not in public and not while
he was alive.
   ``The Tribunal'' is not especially biting. The new ``court
chairman,'' played by Vyacheslav Bezrukov, speaks with a southern
Russian accent that turns g's into h's, darts his eyes constantly,
and proposes a commission as the best solution to festering
injustice.
   The light mockery would roll off the back of a Western leader
accustomed to unflattering caricatures and tasteless scatalogical
jokes. But it is still scandalous in Moscow.
   Even the outspoken host of one of Soviet television's most
daring programs, ``Vzglyad,'' or Glance, said in a recent broadcast
that when he heard a mild joke about Gorbachev on the nightly news,
``my heart jumped.''
   ``It's hard to get used to relating to state leaders without
standing at attention,'' Alexander Lyubimov said.
   The broadcast featured Moscow comic Mikhail Grushevsky, who
performed a telephone imitation of Gorbachev that captured not only
his throaty timbre and homey style but his habit of speaking in
fits and starts and veering off from phrases before finishing them.
   ``Telephone is not the best way to communicate,'' Grushevsky's
Gorbachev said. ``Although, you know, sometimes it's also a way to
solve some kind of knotty problem and some, so to speak, to move
ahead ...''
   Grushevsky said his audiences seem to laugh partly because they
are so unaccustomed to hearing the voices of political leaders
coming from the stage.
   ``And some laughter comes from relief, that it's OK, that the
concert is going on and no one will come afterward and take me
away,'' he told Lyubimov. ``Now people have started to get used to
it, and thank God for that.''
   The Satire Theater's 80-year-old artistic director, Valentin
Pluchek, said authorities have closed him down often in the past
when shows were too politically salty, but he didn't expect that
kind of trouble any longer.
   ``That's all over,'' Pluchek said after Friday's performance of
``The Tribunal.''
   Told that Gorbachev's daughter was in the audience, Pluchek's
wife, Zinaida, warned, ``Now Papa will come and forbid it.''
   But Pluchek dismissed her worries.
   ``He shouldn't be offended,'' he said. ``We respect him. In a
democratic society, an artist should have the right to make a
friendly caricature of the leader.''
   Several days later, the theater director, Alexander Levinsky,
said he had not received any reprimands from above.
   Not all imitations are quite so innocuous.
   Another Moscow comic, Mikhail Zadornov, does a routine that
appears to highlight the Soviet leader's occasional lapses in
grammar and speech.
   ``Comrades, comrades, comrades,'' he said in a recent
performance. ``Despite this responsible speech I will speak without
a little paper. Yes, I'll give you all a lesson on literate
speaking. I will, I will, yes.''
   The speech that follows contains a variety of exaggerated
grammatical errors and malapropisms typical of uneducated Russians
and includes a pledge that ``We won't let just anyone who wants to
dirty up our mother tongue, we have our head behind our shoulders.''
   For all the public parodies, many jokes about Gorbachev still
have not made their way onto the airwaves or into print.
   When he first came to power in 1985 and introduced an
anti-alcohol campaign, wits turned his title of ``General
Secretary'' into ``Mineral Secretary'' _ a reference to the mineral
water resorted to by drinkers deprived of wine and vodka.
   Many jokes have focused on his close relationship with his wife,
Raisa, portraying her as ever-present and domineering.
   An anecdote now making the rounds in Moscow has a well-known
psychic thrown into prison because he made Gorbachev's hair grow
out and cover his birthmark, and ``now he can only be recognized
because his wife is with him.''
   Far more devastating anecdotes abounded about former leaders but
circulated only by word-of-mouth or in emigre publications.
   ``The Tribunal'' broke new ground in its public mockery of past
leaders as well, such as Leonid I. Brezhnev and other members of
the pre-Gorbachev gerontocracy. It depicts Brezhnev as a doddering,
senile old man who unzips his pants near a marble statue because he
can't distinguish it from a urinal.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
he'll be looking for ways to make Poland a paying customer for
American goods as he leads an economic assistance mission there
this week.
   ``A lot of the focus on Poland has been on aid and assistance,''
Yeutter said Tuesday. ``But that kind of help is transitory.''
   The U.S. delegation arriving in Poland today will look for ways
to keep the country from becoming overly dependent on others, said
Yeutter, adding that Poland should be helped to ``stand on its own
two feet.''
   If all goes well, Poland and other East bloc countries that are
opening to the West will be better customers, Yeutter said.
   Congress has approved a $533 million aid package for Poland and
Hungary, $125 million of which is food aid.
   Yeutter's remarks came at Outlook '90, an annual conference
sponsored by the Agriculture Department to examine farm policies
and factors that affect them.
   He left Tuesday night for four days in Poland with a delegation
of 20 private-sector representatives, Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Michael Boskin,
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
   Boskin, who also spoke at the conference, was asked if the
changes in the East bloc will affect the U.S. economy.
   ``The United States has a $5 trillion economy with a very small
amount of trade with Eastern Europe,'' Boskin said. ``We believe we
will be able to help with restructuring their economies.''
   He said the outlook for the U.S. economy was strong, predicting
that interest rates would decrease, thereby helping the
agricultural sector.
   Questions also were raised about progress of international trade
talks, known as GATT. Yeutter said the United States had submitted
its final proposal and received positive reaction, except from the
European Community.
   However, he said that didn't bother him because he expected the
United States would reject the European proposals as well. He said
a negotiated agreement would be reached eventually.
   Yeutter and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills emphasized
that the United States is not trying to remove all subsidies
internationally.
   ``The question is how those supports are designed,'' Yeutter
said. ``They ought to be designed to minimize distortions in
trade.''
   Hills said the United States was working to open roadblocks to
free trade worldwide. In response to a question, she criticized
Japan for its closed trade policies.
   ``No one has gained so much from an open market system as the
Japanese,'' Hills said.
   She praised Japan's expertise in exporting and investing, but
said other countries could begin to shut out Japan if it doesn't
increase its imports.
   As for the effect of GATT on the 1990 farm bill, Yeutter and two
members of Congress said legislation could be passed and then
revised to accommodate agreements stemming from the trade talks.
   Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., said that while Congress would not
be willing to change its subsidy policies without reciprocation, it
might pass legislation calling for adjustments ``if other countries
were to embrace the U.S. proposal'' at GATT.
   ``It remains to be seen what we are handed after the GATT
talks,'' said Rep. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.
   Yeutter said he didn't think Congress' debate on the 1990 farm
bill would effect the GATT talks.
   ``I see it working out just fine as long as Ambassador Hills can
convince our trading partners we can take back the agreement and
get it approved (by Congress),'' Yeutter said.
   Meanwhile, a paper presented at the conference predicted next
year's food prices would rise at a slower pace as farmers continue
expanding crop production.
   James R. Donald, chairman of the Agriculture Department's World
Agricultural Board, said record meat production, bigger crops and
slowing inflation will hold the retail food prices increase to 3
percent to 5 percent.
   Food prices this year are rising nearly 6 percent, the sharpest
annual increase since 1981. Part of the reason for this year's
runup _ prices gained 4.1 percent on the average in 1988 _ were the
lingering effects of last year's drought.
   ``World crop production is recovering from last year's reduced
level,'' he said. ``But for most crops, production (in 1989) will
not match continued high levels of use.''
   Next year, Donald said, world commodity consumption will reach a
record level ``in response to larger output, continued economic
expansion and population growth.''

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Base Closings Won't Save As Much As Expected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government won't realize as much as
originally estimated in annual savings from closing or realigning
15 U.S. military bases, a lawmaker says.
   Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., said Tuesday that a study by the
General Accounting Office found that the shutdown or scaling back
of 15 bases will result in $453 million in savings instead of the
$622 million per year estimated by a federal commission.
   Among the bases are Fort Dix in New Jersey, Chanute Air Force
Base in Illinois and the Presidio in California.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was scheduled to
release the report today.
   ``The incredible fact of the matter is that we are even farther
away from realizing the $2 billion to $5 billion a year that
Congress was looking for when it started this base closing
process,'' Saxton said in a statement.
   Overall, the congressionally established Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure recommended in January closing 86 military
bases and scaling back five more, a proposal accepted by
then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Congress overwhelmingly backed the plan but a handful of
lawmakers complained that the commission had used faulty data in
the cases of some of the bases. The closings and realignments are
to be completed by Sept. 30, 1995.
   Members of Congress asked the GAO this summer to determine the
cost and long-term savings of closing or realigning 15 of the bases
and moving military personnel. Congressional efforts to stop the
closings if the GAO found that the savings will not exceed the
shutdown costs failed.
   Saxton, whose district includes Fort Dix, said the GAO
determined that the elimination of basic and advanced training at
the base will result in only half of the $84.5 million savings
estimated by the commission.
   He also said that the GAO found that the changes at the base
would eliminate only 54 percent of the 2,167 jobs projected by the
commission. Fort Dix will lose 613 military personnel, not the
1,306 originally estimated, and 554 civilian jobs, instead of the
861 anticipated by the commission, Saxton quoted the GAO as saying.
   ``To the GAO's credit, it has been able to account for some
savings of taxpayers' dollars from the realignment of Fort Dix,''
Saxton said, noting, however, that the GAO study underscored his
contention that earlier estimates were flawed.
   ``The GAO's work indicates that inaccurate data was used and
that personnel cuts and savings were grossly exaggerated,'' he said.
   Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney ``stands by the work that was done'' by the commission.
   ``The GAO had pretty much already hinted that their report would
say something like that,'' Flood said. ``There was more than one
criterion that the commission looked at, not just the payback in
savings. We looked at many different things.''
   The 15 bases are the Presidio, George Air Force Base, Mather Air
Force Base, Norton Air Force Base and Hunters Point Naval Station,
all in California; Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; Fort
Sheridan and Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois; Jefferson Proving
Ground in Indiana; Fort Dix in New Jersey; Lexington Army Depot in
Kentucky; Fort Meade and Fort Holabird in Maryland; Fort Devens in
Massachusetts; and Fort Huachuca in Arizona.

<HEAD>Hearing Looks at Civil Rights Enforcement</HEAD>

   Government civil rights officials say they
will respond by mid-December to complaints that the Bush
administration is not committed to ensuring equal education
opportunities.
   ``I come here proud of this record,'' William Smith, temporary
head of the Education Department's civil rights efforts, told the
House Education and Labor Committee on Tuesday.
   ``I believe that (the Office of Civil Rights) has done a good
job of enforcing these civil rights statutes and ensuring an equal
educational opportunity for all Americans.''
   But Smith conceded that he had failed to respond to committee
queries, some dating to late October. He promised written responses
by Dec. 16.
   ``After almost one year in office, there seem to have been no
substantive efforts to improve the Office of Civil Right's dismal
enforcement record, and there has not even been a nomination for
permanent assistant secretaries of civil rights enforcement in
either the Department of Education or the Department of Justice,''
said Rep. Major R. Owens, D-N.Y.
   Members of the committee cited a year-old staff report that
found ``an apparently deliberate and very effective system'' by
which civil rights laws were not enforced.
   Although the reporting period was during the Reagan
administration, panel members insisted the Bush administration had
done little to correct the situation.
   ``Apparently ensuring equal education opportunity for all
American children is not very high on our education president's
list of priorities,'' Owens said.
   ``Many black people and organizations have given up on OCR,''
said Phyllis McClure of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund Inc.
   ``I have personally encountered individuals who believe that it
would be pointless to file a ... complaint against their school
system because OCR would not do anything to correct the violations
or because doing so would subject black school officials to
retaliation,'' she said.
   According to the report issued last December by the committee's
Democratic staff, 58 percent of investigations closed between
fiscal years 1983 and 1988 were concluded with a finding of ``no
violation.''
   Between 1981-1988, the civil rights office initiated 9,768
complaint investigations, the majority of which related to handicap
discrimination.
   Only 15 percent of the complaints involved allegations of race
discrimination, 17 percent related to gender discrimination and 3
percent to national origin discrimination.
   The report also pointed to major cuts in budget and staff for
civil rights activities, and to ``confused policy directives,
administration mismanagement, numerous changes in leadership and
severe reductions in resources.''
   ``In recent years, we have been in the vanguard in our efforts
to eliminate dual systems of higher education,'' said James P.
Turner, temporary head of the civil rights division at the Justice
Department.
   Committee members were not impressed.
   Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., said that all three major higher
education cases handled by the departments are still pending.
   ``One of the best defenses that this nation can ever have is not
found in whether or not we can explore the outer space or build a
new bomber but in whether or not we can educate our young
irrespective of their race, creed, color or sex or financial
status,'' Hayes said.
   Committee Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said he was
disappointed in the agencies.
   ``You seem to be proud of your record,'' he said. ``I haven't
read any report that commends you or says that you're doing a good
job. You seem to be operating on the theory that you can do more
with less, which is a lot of baloney. You know that. It's nothing
but double talk.''

<HEAD>Critics Praise Kohl's Vision of One Germany, But East German Leaders
Wary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helmut Kohl dazzled his countrymen
with his vision of a united Germany within a united Europe. But
East Germany's leaders apparently see Kohl's ideas as something of
a Trojan Horse laden with suspicious cargo.
   Kohl on Tuesday outlined a 10-point plan to gradually unite the
two German states, saying he wants reunification but acknowledging
it could take time.
   The chancellor wrapped his ideas into a far-reaching concept of
overcoming the overall divisions of Europe, stepping up disarmament
and forging closer links between the European Economic Community
and Eastern Europe.
   Kohl's proposals are specific in some areas but appear general
enough to save him from criticism at home that he is being too
meddlesome in East German domestic affairs.
   His speech is already being hailed as probably the greatest of
his political career, even by some usually severe critics.
   ``During Kohl's years in office, seldom has there been the
opportunity to praise the chancellor for a speech,'' the newspaper
Stuttgarter Nachtrichten said in a commentary today.
   But the newspaper said of Tuesday's address to Parliament:
   ``Helmut Kohl has given an important speech, if not a historic
one.''
   Kohl's speech even won praise from opposition politicians who
have steadfastly maintained in recent weeks that while East Germany
was falling apart, the chancellor has been too slow in producing
needed assistance for the embattled Communist neighbor.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, Kohl's arch foe as head of the opposition
Social Democrats, presented his own plan for closer ties with East
Germany. It had much in common with Kohl's. The chief difference
was, Vogel spoke out for a loose German confederation and said
nothing about formal reunification.
   Karsten Voigt, an important Social Democrat lawmaker, said he
agrees with the chancellor ``on all 10 points'' and offered to help
fulfill them.
   Nonetheless, Voigt cautioned Kohl against telling the East
Germans what sort of future they should choose for their country.
   Even though Kohl made it clear he still wants formal German
reunification at some point, his vagueness on what he foresees in
the short-term has annoyed East Germany's Communist leaders.
   Kohl proposed that the two German states set up ``confederative
structures'' such as joint government bodies for regular
consultations.
   East Germans might be interested in a confederation if it
ensures their country would not be swallowed up into a single
German federation, but that would be at odds with Kohl's proposals.
   Wolfgang Meyer, spokesman for the East German government, said
Kohl's mention of ``confederative structures'' was heard ``with
interest.''
   But Meyer said Kohl ``avoided saying clearly that it could only
concern a confederation between two sovereign nations.''
   ``Reunification is not on the agenda and no one in the East or
the West is earnest about changing European stability,'' he said.
   East German Communist Party leader Egon Krenz said a united
Germany would raise thoughts of Nazi Germany of 1937, ``and I know
no one in the world who would like such a Germany.''
   Kohl also repeated his view that without a total overhaul of
East Germany's planned economy, massive West German assistance
would be throwing money away.
   ``We do do not want to stabilize conditions which have become
indefensible,'' Kohl said.
   And on that point as well, Kohl's 10-point plan earned him
little trust among East German leaders who fear disappearance of
their Socialist system could increase their vulnerability to
reunification.
   ``We are ready to cooperate with the Federal Republic (West
Germany), but we are not to get into conditions or
pre-requisites,'' Krenz said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 10-point
proposal for forming a federation with East Germany, as summarized
from his German-language speech translated by The Associated Press:
   1. West Germany offers immediate aid in humanitarian areas,
including medical assistance. Additionally, West Germany offers to
contribute to a special fund to finance foreign travel for East
Germans, provided the East German government also contributes
substantially. East Germany also must drop its requirement that
West German tourists exchange at least 25 marks ($13.50) in hard
currency per day while visiting East Germany.
   2. Existing areas of cooperation of mutual benefit should be
expanded, particularly in economics, technology, culture and
environmental protection. East Germany's telephone network should
be upgraded. Talks on expanded rail ties and connection of the East
German system to other European states should be opened.
   3. Joint-venture projects should be legalized and encouraged.
Electoral reforms should be implemented to allow free elections and
secret ballots. The Communist Party must give up its guaranteed
power monopoly. Bureaucratic planning and administrative practices
must be phased out. Private businesses should be established and
Western investments solicited.
   4. Joint institutions and committees in economics, transport,
ecology, science and technology, health and culture shouldbe
established.
   5. West Germany is willing to develop, step by step, the
structures of a federation with a legitimate, democratically
elected East German government. Envisioned is establishment of
joint government committees for continuous consultations and
political decision-making, joint special committees and joint
parliament commissions.
   6. The future design of Germany must fit in with the future
design of a whole Europe, with full respect for the integrity and
security of each state, full respect for human rights, including
the right of self-determination.
   7. West Germany recommends a speedy decision on a trade and
cooperation agreement with East Germany that expands and ensures
East German access to the European Common Market.
   8. The confidence-building process in Europe is the heart of the
design of a whole Europe, and must be energetically pursued.
   9. Overcoming the division of Europe and the division of Germany
requires wide-ranging energetic steps in disarmament and arms
control, which must keep pace with political advances. This applies
particularly to the Vienna negotiations on conventional arms in
Europe, agreement on confidence building measures, and a ban on
chemical weapons. It also requires reducing the nuclear potential
of the superpowers to strategic minimums.
   10. The political approach aims to foster peace in Europe in
which the German people can achieve unity through
self-determination.German unity remains a goal of the federal
government. Only in a climate of mutual trust can the division of
Europe and Germany be overcome.

   Barbara Bush's nettlesome Graves disease,
which causes teary eyes and double vision, isn't getting any
better, but doctors say it isn't getting any worse.
   ``It's fairly stable,'' Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman Anna Perez told
reporters after the first lady returned Tuesday evening from the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   ``The eyes have not gotten worse. She's not out of the woods
yet. She's not cured. She's still got the disease,'' Ms. Perez said.
   The doctors examined Mrs. Bush for two hours, performing tests
and putting two doses of drops in her eyes. They decided to vary
the doses of prednisone she is taking for the condition, Ms. Perez
said.
   Otherwise, there was to be no treatment change.
   ``Believe me when I tell you, nothing is worse, everything is
better, I'm going home with very good news for George Bush,'' the
first lady told the Rochester Post-Bulletin.
   The long-range prognosis is unclear, Ms. Perez said, adding that
Mrs. Bush was in ``fine spirits'' but acknowledged annoyance with
the disease.
   ``These are some of the best times of her life and sometimes it
is a pain to have to see everything twice,'' Ms. Perez said.
   Mrs. Bush's condition, which initially caused a noticeable
weight loss, was diagnosed earlier this year. She has regained some
weight through water retention due to the prednisone.
   She underwent a radiation treatment in April to treat the excess
hormone levels produced by her thyroid. That treatment was
successful and the hormone levels are now fine, Ms. Perez said.
   Two Mayo Clinic ophthalmologists _ Dr. Robert Waller and Dr.
John Dyer _ were on the team of physicians who earlier examined and
treated Mrs. Bush for the eye condition.
   Graves disease, thought to be related to the immune system,
brings on an overactive thyroid, which in turn produces excessive
amounts of certain hormones. Symptoms include fatigue, insomnia and
swelling of eye tissues, causing irritation.
   The cause of the disease is unknown, but it can be controlled
with drugs.
   After the tests Tuesday, Mrs. Bush stopped by a Rochester
library and read a story to a group of children before returning to
Washington.

<HEAD>Labor's Hopes of Sending Delegation to Soviet Union This Week Dashed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO says its hopes of sending a
delegation to meet with striking Soviet miners this week were
dashed when Soviet officials refused to issue visas.
   Federation officials said Tuesday that the Soviets told them it
wasn't an appropriate time for an American delegation to visit the
striking miners in the Arctic Circle city of Vorkuta.
   ``We are hopeful that it will be put together for another day,
another time,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty. ``We are
continuing to talk with the Soviets, but we have abandoned the
timetable.''
   The AFL-CIO requested visas for the five-member delegation after
receiving a telegram from the striking Soviet miners two weeks ago.
The miners praised the federation's efforts to help Poland's
Solidarity and requested help in forming a free trade union.
   ``They (Soviet officials) gave us the standard response, that
this would not be a good time, that this would not be a beneficial
time given the sensitive situation,'' said Eric Chenoweth of the
AFL-CIO's international affairs department, one of those who
requested a visa.
   ``Our intent was not to exacerbate the situation but to respond
to the requests of the workers who invited us to investigate the
conditions that brought them to strike,'' he said. ``It is our
position that just because there are sensitive conditions doesn't
mean that a delegation should not be allowed.''
   Calls to the Soviet Embassy for comment were not immediately
returned.
   The telegram from the miners requested that the AFL-CIO provide
information on U.S. labor laws and union organizing and said the
workers were struggling not only for their rights but to end the
Communist Party's leading role in Soviet governance.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland's request for the visas also
asked that the delegation be allowed to travel to Moscow and
Vorkuta and to meet privately with the miners. He asked for a
response in time for the trip to begin by the end of this week.
   The delegation was to be led by Albert Shanker, president of the
American Federation of Teachers. It was to include John T. Joyce,
president of the Bricklayers union; John Banovic, secretary
treasurer of the United Mine Workers; Ken Young, a top aide to
Kirkland; and Chenoweth.
   Official Soviet media have described the miners and other
strikers as threats to President Mikhail Gorbachev's economic
reforms. Gorbachev last month proposed a law banning strikes in
some vital industries, including coal mining.

   A would-be Santa says he lost one of his
``reindeer'' to a hunter on the first day of deer season.
   One of the dozen European fallow deer at Santa's Cottage escaped
from its pen on Thanksgiving, said owner Fred Kreig.
   A hunter thought the 70-pound deer was wild and shot it, said
Kreig, who gives tours and holds holiday events at the farm 50
miles southeast of Syracuse for needy children.
   The hunter realized his mistake and offered to pay for the deer,
valued at $800.
   ``I told him the idea of his calling to apologize was plenty,''
said Kreig, who invited the hunter to bring his family to Santa's
Cottage whenever he wants.

<TEXT>
   It's official: The Smithsonian Institution
will build a National Museum of the American Indian as the newest
attraction on the Mall.
   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday night clearing the way
for officials to start designing the museum, which will draw most
of its artwork and artifacts from a world-famed collection in New
York City.
   The measure also outlines the policy for returning American
Indian and native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects to
the tribes and organizations for burial. It requires the
Smithsonian to inventory all human remains in its collections.
   Bush expressed ``great pleasure'' in signing the legislation,
the result of a political compromise after New York lawmakers
fought to keep the Indian museum in New York.
   The heart of the museum's collection will come from the Museum
of the American Indian, run by the Heye Foundation in New York City.
   The compromise includes the opening of a $25 million satellite
facility in the old U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan, which
will be called the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum
of the American Indian.
   The Smithsonian will build the $106 million museum on the Mall
between the Air and Space Museum and the Botanical Gardens _ near
the foot of Capitol Hill _ and build a $44 million storage and
conservation center in Suitland, Md., for the Indian artifacts.
   ``From this point, our nation will go forward with a new and
richer understanding of the heritage, culture and values of the
peoples of the Americas of Indian ancestry,'' Bush said.
   The Heye Foundation's collection is considered priceless, but
the museum in New York has not attracted the crowds _ or the
financial backing _ that the Smithsonian museums in the nation's
capital garner.
   Indian tribal leaders and native Hawaiian groups for years have
demanded the return of human remains kept in museum collections.
   Bush said the Smithsonian ``will attempt to identify the origins
of such remains and objects and will notify the appropriate tribes
and organizations of its findings.''
   The ultimate plan, he said, is for ``repatriation'' of the
remains.
   ``This has been a difficult and complex issue to address,
involving traditional values of American Indian people, the medial
and scientific research value of the remains and objects and the
trust responsibilities of the Smithsonian,'' Bush said.
   The law authorizes $10 million in planning and design
expenditures for fiscal 1990, which began two months ago. The
Department of the Interior's 1990 appropriation includes $5.5
million in actual funds to start the work.
   The federal government will split the cost of revamping the
Customs House in Manhattan with New York City and New York state.

<HEAD>Court: Pittston Violated Laws in Voting Against Union Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the Pittston Co. violated
securities regulations by voting proxies against three proposals
submitted by striking miners at its annual meeting.
   ``Pittston did not have discretionary authority to vote
management's proxies against the union's proposals,'' U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson said Tuesday.
   The judge upheld the United Mine Workers challenge on grounds
the union proposals weren't mentioned on the cards shareholders
signed to give management proxy power.
   Johnson rejected Pittston's arguments that it had
``discretionary authority'' to vote the proxies against the union
proposals in May because it had indicated in other material sent to
shareholders that it intended to oppose them.
   ``Nowhere in these letters did Pittston actually disclose what
the three proposals were,'' Johnson said.
   The judge said Pittston's argument ignored regulations promoting
``an informed shareholder electorate'' and, if accepted, could lead
to ``a world where shareholders could be misled and where corporate
suffrage could be circumvented by way of overbroad claims of
discretionary authority.''
   UMW President Richard Trumka called the decision ``a resounding
blow for shareholder rights at every American corporation.''
   Attempts to reach Pittston officials late Tuesday afternoon were
unsuccessful. Calls to the company's Connecticut headquarters were
unanswered.
   Pittston, whose Pittston Coal Group subsidiary is locked in a
bitter labor dispute with about 1,700 miners in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky, used its proxies to defeat union proposals
to submit a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan to shareholders, to
allow shareholders to vote by secret ballot and to form a committee
to study possible divestiture of some assets.
   Had Pittston not usedthe 15.5 million management proxies it
held, union officials say the first two proposals would have been
approved.
   Johnson said reaching a remedy would prove to be a ``difficult
task'' because shareholders have changed since the vote six months
ago, and ordered company and union attorneys to suggest possible
remedies within two weeks.
   The miners struck Pittston Coal Group in April, largely in a
dispute over Pittston's intention to withdraw from an industrywide
contract to provide medical and retirement benefits to UMW retirees.
   The union has been fined more than $30 million for violating
picketing laws during the sometimes violent strike, and Pittston's
coal production is off significantly despite its use of replacement
workers and some miners who refused to honor pickets.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole last month appointed former Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery Jr. to mediate. Usery has met repeatedly with
both sides and talks are scheduled to resume this week.

   The Energy Department says it will be 2010
before the nation's first permanent dump for highly radioactive
nuclear waste opens _ seven years later than the original date.
   ``The plan I'm announcing sets the operating date for a
repository at 2010 and assumes that there will be no unexpected
setbacks in the program's progress and that the science proves that
Yucca Mountain is a suitable site,'' Deputy Energy Secretary Henson
Moore said in a speech Tuesday night.
   ``I am convinced that the 2003 date was driven more by a
political desire than by science or engineering,'' Moore told the
American Nuclear Society and the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness,
a nuclear industry group, in San Francisco. A copy of the speech
was released in Washington.
   Moore also said the department would:
   _Seek to sue Nevada to force granting of permits for certain
tests at the Yucca Mountain site near Las Vegas that the department
is considering.
   _Delay sinking exploratory shafts at Yucca Mountain.
   _Ask Congress to let it build an interim storage facility before
the permanent depot is in hand.
   The department is required by law to take title in 1998 to the
highly radioactive spent fuel stored at more than 100 operating
civilian nuclear power plants.
   The 1982 legislation establishing the waste repository program
envisioned that a waste depot able to hold spent fuel for 10,000
years would be in operation in 1998.
   The department has long wanted a plant, capable of temporary
storage, to package the waste for permanent storage and ship it to
the permanent repository.
   A temporary storage depot is called ``monitored retrievable
storage,'' or MRS. Congress, fearing an MRS plant would end up
being the permanent repository, has forbidden construction of such
a plant until the permanent repository is too far along to be
stopped.
   ``By decoupling the MRS option from the permanent repository,
the department could be able to accept spent fuel from utilities in
1998, or soon thereafter,'' and would be able to show that it can
package, ship and handle the spent fuel safely, Moore said.
   He said the department will delay shaft-sinking until 1992 and
``perform only surface-based testing,'' starting in 1991, to make
sure there is nothing that would rule out Yucca Mountain before the
expensive shafts are undertaken.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the department this
summer that it should delay sinking the shafts until it understood
better the earthquake and volcanic potential of the site.
   Moore said the department had not received its first state air
and land use permits two years after requesting them, and the state
was refusing to consider the federal applications. The state
Legislature has passed a bill forbidding the storage of nuclear
waste in the state.
   ``This is not a reasonable response but one we can only conclude
is driven by politics and a lack of desire to cooperate in the
proper scientific evaluation of the site. Court is not our
preferred course of action, but enough is enough,'' Moore said in
announcing that the department had asked the Justice Department to
sue for the needed permits.
   If Nevada does not respond to the required 30-day notice of a
suit, ``Justice will file in January, and we will get on with the
program,'' Moore said.
   Congress in 1982 ordered the department to study three possible
sites. Later, in what some Nevada officials called an ``everybody
gangs up on Nevada'' bill, Congress instructed the department to
study the Yucca Mountain site on the government's nuclear weapons
test range in detail first, and make that the waste repository if
nothing turned up to rule it out.

<HEAD>Justice Moves to Quash Pan Am Subpoenas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is moving to quash
subpoenas issued by Pan American airlines for documents in
government files about the investigation of the explosion of Flight
103.
   The airline wants the information to defend itself against
lawsuits filed by relatives of those killed in the Dec. 21 bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 people dead.
   In a brief statement Tuesday night, the Justice Department said
it moved in a sealed court request last week to quash the subpoenas
served on six government agencies, including the FBI and CIA.
   While federal judges in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Washington declined
to grant the government's request, Pan Am was directed to narrow
its request for information.
   The department said Pan Am lawyers were told to submit a draft
court order seeking information about how the suitcase with the
bomb made its way aboard the flight.
   The department reserves the right to challenge the request for a
court order, said agency spokesman David Runkel.
   Runkel said the department moved to quash the subpoenas on the
grounds that information in government files was part of an active
criminal investigation and thus did not have to be produced.
   Meanwhile, a government source says that clothing fragments from
the suitcase containing the bomb that destroyed the flight have
been traced to a store in Malta.
   The fragments found at the crash site were linked to a suitcase
that held the radio cassette player believed to have contained the
explosive device, the source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A multinational team of investigators have traced the clothing
fragments to a store in Malta, lending credence to information that
the bomb passed through that Mediterranean island, the source said.
   British newspapers had previously reported the Malta clothing
link.
   The investigation is trying to identify the person who placed
the suitcase on the flight from Malta to Frankfurt, West Germany,
where it was transferred to the Pan Am jetliner.
   The Pan Am plane flew to London, where it became Flight 103. It
exploded en route to New York City.
   An insurance investigator hired by the airline said the U.S.
government learned a bomb had been placed aboard the flight but did
not tell Pan Am. A CIA spokesman has denounced the investigator's
report as outrageous.
   Investigators are focusing on a possibility the terrorist group,
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is responsible for
the bombing.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed for the
first time above 37,000 points Wednesday, while the dollar closed
lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar finished trading at 143.53 yen, down 0.12 yen from
Tuesday's close of 143.65 yen. The currency opened lower at 143.27
yen and rose toward the end of trading while ranging between 143.27
yen and 143.58 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 36.16 points, or 0.10
percent, closing at 37,021.46, yet another high. The index had set
its previous record only the day before when it gained 103.77
points.
   The index rose from 36,000 to 37,000 points in only five trading
days.
   ``The Nikkei's performance is stronger than we expected,'' said
Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``There were no specific economic factors making the market so
strong, except for its strength itself, which seemed to be
reassuring and encouraging investors' buying incentives,'' he said.
   Participants also were eager to buy issues to increase year-end
profits, Umemori said. December transactions started Tuesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was gradually rising from its
lower start as investors bought it back to take profits on short,
or oversold, positions following its overnight declines overseas,
traders said.
   The dollar tumbled against most major currencies Tuesday when
the West German mark surged on enthusiasm over the prospects for a
united Germany.
   Yen-dollar trading was less active than that between the dollar
and European currencies, especially the mark, said a dealer with
the Bank of Tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The mark has been strong against the dollar and other currencies
since East Germany symbolically opened the Berlin Wall Nov. 9.
Market participants believe that West Germany will be one of the
principal beneficiaries of recent democratic and economic reforms
in Eastern Europe.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug that quickly dissolves blood clots
to prevent permanent damage after a heart attack has been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration.
   Anistreplase, the third clot-dissolving drug to be approved, can
be administered in five minutes or less while the other two drugs
must be administered continuously for one to three hours, said
SmithKline Beecham, which will market the drug as Eminase.
   Clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and limit damage
from heart attacks, but are used in only about 20 percent of the
estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients who could benefit from
treatment each year, the Department of Health and Human Services
said Tuesday.
   More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heart
attacks each year die before getting to the hospital and an
additional 300,000 get there too late for treatment with
clot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the FDA
action.
   A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the
most common cause of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood from
carrying oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heart
failure and death.
   The other two approved clot-dissolving drugs are alteplase, or
TPA, and streptokinase.

<NOTE>Judge Denies Hinckley Request for News Interviews</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential assailant John Hinckley won't be
allowed to be interviewed by news organizations, a judge ruled,
saying Hinckley's mental illness could worsen with public exposure.
   U.S. District Court Judge June Green on Tuesday rejected
Hinckley's request for up to two interviews per month with the news
media.
   A directive at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington prohibiting
personal interviews between maximum-security patients and the news
media ``embodies a reasonable and constitutionally valid'' approach
with regard to Hinckley, Green said.
   The directive, the judge noted, permits patients to correspond
with reporters by mail. Hinckley has done so in the past.
   Hinckley, found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March
1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, has been a patient
at St. Elizabeths since August 1982. Three months ago, he filed a
motion saying his First Amendment right of free speech was being
violated.
   Hinckley's attorney, Mark Lane, said he would consult with his
client before deciding whether to appeal.
   White House press secretary James Brady was left partially
paralyzed in the 1981 shootings, in which a Secret Service agent
and Washington police officer were wounded as well as the president.

<NOTE>FBI to Begin Random Drug Testing of Employees Soon</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William S. Sessions says random
testing for possible use of illegal drugs by employees may begin
early next year.
   Sessions told the bureau's 9,700 agents and nearly 13,000
support personnel of the random testing program in a notice dated
Nov. 14, FBI spokesman Mike Kortan said Tuesday.
   The random testing is expected to begin after Jan. 14, Kortan
said.
   A computer program will be used to randomly select the names of
employees who will be required to undergo urine testing to
determine if they have used illegal drugs, Kortan said.
   Employees who test positive could be suspended or dismissed, but
``each case would be evaluated individually,'' Kortan said.
   Refusal to provide a urine sample would also result in
disciplinary action that could include dismissal, he said.
   The random testing is being started under a 1986 executive order
by President Reagan. A number of federal agencies have instituted
similar programs, which have met with mixed reviews in court
decisions resulting from lawsuits filed by affected employees.

<HEAD>Gandhi Resigns After Election Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPGRADE attribution. Picks up 6th pvs,
`Congress Party ...' ADDS 5 grafs with Gandhi re-elected to Parliament.
^By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Rajiv Gandhi resigned as prime minister
today, having failed to lead his Congress Party to decisive victory
in elections for a new Parliament.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman accepted the resignation but
asked Gandhi and his Cabinet to remain in office until a new
government is appointed, the presidential palace announced.
   Gandhi's resignation had been expected and is a formality that
clears the way for the opposition National Front alliance to try to
form the next government _ provided Venkataraman asks it to do so.
   The president normally would ask the party that won the most
seats to attempt to form a government, but the constitution does
not specifically require this.
   Gandhi, who has served in Parliament since 1980 and became prime
minister in 1984, spent a half-hour with Venkataraman and drove
away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray Mercedes
Benz. He did not stop to speak to reporters.
   Congress Party leaders said Tuesday they were ready to enter
into the secondary role of an opposition party for only the second
time in India's 42 years of independence.
   Lawmakers from the National Front scheduled a meeting later
today to choose the man they claim will be the next prime minister
of the world's most populous democracy.
   The leading candidate was former Gandhi ally Vishwanath Pratap
Singh, although he has said repeatedly he does not want to become
prime minister.
   Other possible contenders included Chandra Shekhar, one of the
architects of the movement that ousted Gandhi's mother and
predecessor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, from power in 1977.
   Mrs. Gandhi's defeat in elections that year relegated the
Congress Party to the role of opposition for 29 months until its
election comeback in 1980.
   National Front leaders said they planned to call on Venkataraman
later in the day and tell him they were ready to form a government.
   Under the Indian Constitution, it is up to the president to
decide who should be asked to form a government. In the past, the
decision was clear-cut, because the Congress Party had always won a
comfortable majority except for 1977, when the Janata Party
defeated Mrs. Gandhi.
   The situation this time was more confused.
   While the Congress Party and its small party allies had the most
seats, their combined total was far short of the 263 required for a
majority.
   The National Front lagged even farther behind, but it enlisted
the post-election tacit support of other opposition groups and
buoyed its hopes of forming a government.
   With 486 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided, the Congress
Party had 186 and its allies 17 for a total of 203.
   The National Front has 122, and its allies had 132 for a total
of 254.
   The rest went to small parties and independents.
   Gandhi was swept into power in December 1984 on a wave of
sympathy following the assassination of his mother two months
earlier.
   But support for him declined in the face of allegations of
government corruption. Gandhi has denied any wrongdoing.
   While Gandhi was closeted with the president today, election
officials announced that he had been elected to Parliament from his
Amethi constituency for the third consecutive time.
   He defeated his nearest rival, Raj Mohan Gandhi, grandson of
Indian independence leader Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi by 197,000
votes, United News of India said.
   The news agency did not give the vote totals, delayed by a
partial re-vote Monday after authorities evidence of voter fraud in
the initial Nov. 22 voting. Raj Mohan Gandhi, who is not related to
Rajiv Gandhi, had charged Congress Party activists with stuffing
ballot boxes and resorting to violence.
   Gandhi, who has served in Parliament since 1980 and became prime
minister in 1984, spent a half-hour with Venkataraman and drove
away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray Mercedes
Benz. He did not stop to speak to reporters.

   A crane plummeted from the 16th story of a
building under construction Tuesday, flattening a school van, cars
and smashing into an office building across the street. At least
five people were killed and 21 were injured, authorities said.
   ``It felt like an earthquake,'' said Merrill Lynch Vice
President Joe McLaughlin, who was in the damaged office building.
``I looked out and saw two bodies. One construction worker's boots
were sticking up through a mass of jagged metal.''
   In the aftermath of the accident that rained concrete and
twisted steel on one of the busiest intersections in the financial
district, a prosecutor said criminal negligence charges twice
previously had been filed against the project's general contractor
for accidents on Los Angeles construction sites.
   There were conflicting statements on what was happening before
the crane fell. Fire Chief Fred Postel said it was hoisting steel
beams, but the general contractor said the crane was being
repositioned from the 16th to the 20th floors.
   A piece of the crane at least three stories long dangled from
the side of the building under construction two hours after the
8:30 a.m. accident. Police roped off the area and ambulances rushed
in and out.
   The street was littered with flattened cars and a mangled
motorcyle. Gas was cut off to the damaged 21-story office building
for fear of an explosion.
   ``The wreckage looks absolutely incredible _ steel beams look
like pickup sticks,'' said Acting Mayor Angela Alioto, sitting in
while Mayor Art Agnos tours the country urging tourists to return
in the wake of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   At an afternoon news conference at the scene, Alioto said
experts could not immediately determine the cause of the collapse.
She also said streets in a four-square-block area would be closed
for at least a week for cleanup and repairs, and the California
Street cable car also was shut down.
   Alioto said the dead were four construction workers, all from
the Seattle area, and the woman driving the school van, operated by
Laidlaw Transit Inc.
   ``It's pretty rough,'' said Laidlaw Senior Vice President Howard
Wallack. ``They (other employees) are pretty upset, and we are
arranging a chaplain and psychologist to go over to our offices.''
   The fire chief said five people were listed as missing in the
twisted steel and broken concrete. However, police Capt. Tom Murphy
said later that everyone had been accounted for.
   Three hospitals reported receiving 21 victims, four in serious
condition. Most of the rest had minor injuries.
   Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co. of San Francisco, the general contractor
on the job, said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th
story to the 20th story, the second such repositioning of the
project.
   The crane, model No. SN355 manufactured by American Pecco of
Millwood, N.Y., had a capacity of 17 tons. The site was last
inspected by the state Occupational Safety and Health
Administration on Aug. 11. The project, which began in January, has
not been cited for safety violations, the company said in a news
release.
   Criminal negligence charges were twice filed against Swinerton
and Walbert in 1981 and 1986 for separate accidents on the Los
Angeles sites, said Los Angeles Deputy City Attorney MIchael
Guarino.
   In 1981, charges were filed after a crane collapsed and an
unknown number of people were killed, Guarino said. The case was
dropped because prosecutors could not get the kind of charges they
wanted to the jury, he said.
   Prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence in the
case, Guarino said, but the state labor code requires that
prosecutors prove wanton and willful disregard for human safety, he
said.
   In the 1986 case, Guarino said, Swinerton and Walberg was a
co-defendant in a case stemming from a construction site accident
that killed three ironworkers after the steel superstructure of a
21-story office building was overloaded.
   That case resulted in a civil compromise in which Swinerton and
Walberg agreed to sponsor a safety seminar for downtown Los Angeles
contractors and to donate an unknown amount to a labor safety
board, Guarino said.
   According to Washington state Department of Labor and Industries
records, the San Francisco project's crane sub-contractor, The
Erection Co. of Kirkland, Wash., was fined for safety violations at
least four times before 1987, three times in 1987 and once in 1988,
said department spokesman John Akins.
   The company is appealing the last reported fine, which was
imposed after a worker fell to his death while working on the
Pacific First Center in downtown Seattle in August 1988, Akins said.
   Attempts to reach Adam Jones, president of The Erection Co.,
were not successful and telephone calls to company offices were not
returned.
   In Tuesday's accident, debris rained down on a taxi driven by
Issa Massarweh, who had two passengers at the time. The cab's back
window was smashed.
   ``I don't know where my passengers are,'' he said. ``I threw
myself under the dashboard.'' He told his passengers to duck and
when he next looked, they had left. He was unharmed.
   ``I heard a loud bang and stepped up and saw the tail end of a
crane,'' said stockbroker Don Trabert, who saw the accident from
his office in the Bank of America Building.
   ``It sounded like a Chinese New Year, only twice as loud. The
crane was swinging and dangling in the air and people were
scrambling away from the scene.''
   A small fire broke out but was quickly extinguished.
   In 1988-89, the construction site yielded close to 1 million
artifacts dating to a Chinese settlement in the 1800s.

<HEAD>Army Fights Terror With Brutality, Amnesty Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peruvians are caught in savage crossfire between
leftist rebels and government troops who have become equally
ruthless, killing hundreds of people as they try to end the
insurgency, Amnesty International said today.
   The international human rights group said in a report that the
Peruvian government's attempt to defeat the Shining Path rebel
movement has raised the level of ruthless and indiscrimate violence.
   ``Torture, mutilation, `disappearance,' murder and rape have
become a hallmark of the armed forces' `campaign against
terrorism','' the international organization said in the report on
human rights in Peru.
   It said the armed forces have singled out young people as
suspected supporters of the Shining Path.
   ``The killing, torture and `disappearance' of hundreds of
children and young people has been one cost of a strategy of
`terror to fight terror' adopted by the armed forces in Peru,'' it
said.
   The government must uphold the law and not resort to the terror
tactics of its enemies, Amnesty said. It called on the government
to investigate all alleged abuses and bring those responsible to
justice.
   But Amnesty also stressed the extensive and continuing
massacres, mutilations and torture by opposition forces such as the
Shining Path.
   As a result, it said, peasants in areas where the government has
declared a state of emergency have been ``caught between two
fires,'' victims of massive abuse by both government forces and
armed opposition.
   ``Many people have relatives who have been killed in cold blood
by both anti-government guerrillas and government forces,'' the
group said.
   More than 3,000 detainees have disappeared in the past seven
years and at least 3,000 more are estimated to have been killed by
security forces, individually or in mass executions, the report
said.
   It said targets for human rights abuses by government forces are
being drawn from increasingly broad sectors of society.
   Local government officers, community leaders, trade unionists,
journalists, lawyers, academics and people considered critics or
opponents of the government have been threatened, killed or had
their homes and offices bombed, Amnesty said. Many killings were
carried out after the victims had been detained and tortured, it
said.
   The report focuses on violations in the emergency zones, where
more than half of Peru's 21 million people live under
political-military command.
   In these zones, many killings appear to have been carried out to
punish communities for rebel activities in their areas, it said.
   Amnesty said few males between 14 and 40 remain in these zones
and women have been subjected to increasing abuse by government
forces.
   Rape by troops is widespread, and women of all ages are at risk,
Amnesty said, adding that it knows of no convictions for this crime
in the emergency zones.
   The report said it is common for women to be raped after
soldiers have entered villages and taken the men away. Other women
have been raped while in detention, it said.
   It cited the case of Maria Guinarita Pisco Pisango, 26, a farmer
from San Martin de Alao in Lamas province, who was raped, tortured
and killed by soldiers after she reported her husband's
disappearance in January 1988.
   Children appear to be most at risk during raids by government
troops, Amnesty said.
   ``Children and young people are under threat for their real or
supposed sympathies in the emergency zones. The place they live in,
the school they attend or the books they read may result in their
secret detention, torture or murder,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Iran has ended its rejection of outside
investigations of its human rights practices and invited a U.N.
official to visit its prisons, according to Western diplomats.
   They said Iran reversed its policy as a political deal with a
U.N. subcommittee, which on Tuesday adopted by consensus a
resolution that did not criticize Iran's human rights situation.
   Iran has barred U.N. investigators since the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights expressed concern in 1984 over reports of torture,
summary executions and political and religious persecution in the
country.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said Ambassador Kamal Kharrazi of Iran has invited the commission's
representative, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, to Iran.
   Galindo Pohl is expected to visit the country before February,
when the U.N. commission is to meet in Geneva to consider his final
report.
   The diplomats said that in letters of understanding exchanged
between Galindo Pohl and Kharrazi, Iran said the U.N. inspector
will be able to bring his own translators and travel freely.
   Kharrazi's letter invited Galindo Pohl to Iran so he could
prepare his report ``based on realities rather than allegations.''
   In an interim report released two weeks ago, based on interviews
with Iranian exiles and reports in the Iranian media, Galindo Pohl
said torture, political executions and other human rights abuses
were continuing in Iran.
   It said punishments include flogging, whipping the soles of feet
with cables or barbed wire, sexual abuse, mock executions, burning
with cigarettes or hot metal rods and confinement of prisoners in
``small closed rooms with high temperatures and insufficient
oxygen.''
   Galindo Pohl also wrote, ``The Iranian press has reported few
political executions so far in 1989. However, many allegations have
been received that the large number of executions for drug
trafficking masks political executions.''

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, setting a
record high for the sixth consecutive trading day, closed above
37,000 for the first time today, while the dollar eased down
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 36.16 points, or 0.10
percent, closing at 37,021.46.
   It took the Nikkei index just five trading days to rise from
36,000 to 37,000 points. The index closed above 36,000 for the
first time on Nov. 21, when it ended at 36,059.87.
   Wednesday's session was marked by wide fluctuations as
institutional investors traded large amounts of shares, said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a Daiwa Securities dealer.
   The index fell by 49 points at mid-afternoon, he said, then
recovered as investors picked up issues that had fallen earlier.
   Suzuki said the overall rising trend was slowing as market
players became wary over the recent speed of the index's increase.
   Trading was hectic, with some 1.7 billion shares changing hands
on the first section, up from 1.5 billion Tuesday. Among gainers
were steel, shipbuilding and pharmaceutical issues.
   In currency dealing, the dollar closed at 143.53 yen, down 0.12
yen from Tuesday's close of 143.65 yen. It opened at 143.27 yen and
ranged between 143.27 yen and 143.58 yen.
   Following a downswing on overseas markets overnight, the dollar
gradually strengthened as it was bought back for profit-taking,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities, Co.
   Japanese investors sold West German marks and Swiss Francs and
bought back the U.S. currency to take profits on short, or
oversold, positions following overnight declines overseas, he said.
   The mark has been a focus of recent trading. Market players
believe West Germany will be a major beneficiary of recent
democratic and economic reforms in the East bloc.
   The West German mark has been strong against the dollar and
other currencies since Nov, 9, when East Germany began allowing its
citizens to travel freely to the West.
   In contrast, the dollar-yen rate has been ``stuck between 142
yen and 144 yen'' without fresh market-affecting news, Kanai said.
   Fluctuations will remain small while the market awaits the
release of a series of economic data later this week and the
results of U.S.-Soviet summit talks starting Saturday, he said.
   Among economic figures to be announced later this week are U.S.
individual income and consumption for October and the Japanese
consumer price index for October.

   Gerry Smith heard rumbling and threw
himself down onto the floor of his taxi just before the cab was
crushed. Then he kicked out a window and walked away.
   ``I thought it was another earthquake. It didn't enter my mind
that a crane fell on me,'' Smith said of Tuesday's collapse of a
construction crane that killed five people in downtown San
Francisco.
   His two passengers, Richard and Andrea Bronson, were among those
injured. Mrs. Bronson, 41, was listed in serious condition with a

was treated and released.
   Smith, 55, said no one at the scene could believe anyone in the

   ``I said, `Hey, I'm the guy who was driving that cab.' The cops
seemed fascinated. They called me Mr. Lucky. Some woman called me
Mr. Miracle,'' Smith said.
   He called the Luxor Cab office a few hours after the accident.
   ``The operator answering the phone said, `My God! You're alive.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has dropped
charges against a newly elected Parliament member who is accused of
masterminding the 1984 assassination of Gandhi's mother, officials
said today.
   Simranjit Singh Mann, a member of the Sikh religious sect and a
former police officer, was elected to the lower house of Parliament
from the northern state of Punjab by an overwhelming majority this
week.
   The order to drop charges against Mann was one of the last acts
as prime minister by Gandhi, the son and successor of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi. A court must actually order Mann's release,
but that is considered a formality.
   Gandhi failed to lead his Congress Party to a decisive election
victory this week. He tendered his resignation today, but is to
remain in office until a new government is appointed.
   He asked Home Minister Buta Singh to ``take steps to withdraw
the case'' against Mann, a ministry spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said: ``The Home Ministry is examining the prime minister's
directions, but the release can only be ordered by the relevant
court.''
   The shots that killed Mrs. Gandhi on Oct. 31, 1984, were fired
by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them was shot to death on the
spot by other bodyguards.The surviving gunman and a Sikh government
clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in January.
   The government said the assassination was masterminded by Sikh
extremists fighting for a separate homeland in the Punjab. Mann,
who has been jailed for the past five years on sedition charges,
was charged with conspiracy when the assassination case was
re-opened in April.
   United News of India, in a dispatch today, quoted Gandhi as
saying: ``I will hold no ill-will or rancor. I have always striven
to heal wounds. At times I have succeeded. Sometimes I have been
disappointed.
   ``If there is any more step that can be taken to bring down the
curtain on the unfortunate past, and to ring in the future, that
step should be taken now. The conspiracy case ... will not heal
wounds,'' Gandhi was quoted as saying.
   United News of India and Press Trust of India said Gandhi
decided to seek Mann's release because Mann had sworn allegiance to
the constitution.
   Mann, 44, was elected from the Tarn Taran constituency in
Punjab, campaigning from a jail more than 850 miles away in Bihar
state.
   Mann, a senior officer in the prestigious Indian Police Service,
resigned soon after Mrs. Gandhi ordered an army attack on the
Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhdom's holiest shrine, to flush out
Sikh militants entrenched there.
   More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the 1984
army operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of Mrs. Gandhi.
   Another Sikh charged with conspiracy in the Gandhi murder,
Attinder Pal Singh, also was elected to Parliament while in jail.
There has been no word on whether he, too, may be freed.
   Bimal Khalsa, widow of Beant Singh, the assassin who was killed
on the spot, and his father, Sucha Singh, also were elected.
   All three belonged to Mann's Akali Dal party.
   More than 7,500 people have died in the 8-year campaign for the
homeland that Sikh extremists propose to carve out of Punjab, a
farming state bordering Pakistan.
   Sikhs, whose religion is rooted in both Islam and Hinduism,
comprise just 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but they
have a slight majority in Punjab.

<HEAD>Dallas Judge Censured Over Controversial Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homosexual activists are applauding a state
judicial panel's decision to censure a judge who said he gave a
lighter sentence to a killer because the two victims were
``queers.''
   Attorneys for District Judge Jack Hampton of Dallas said they
were disappointed that ``the commission must have succumbed to
pressure from the media and from uninformed special interest
groups.''
   Members of the Dallas Gay Alliance say they still want Hampton
to step down.
   ``I believe that it's certainly a step in the right direction,''
said William Waybourn, president of the group. ``But Judge Hampton
remains on the bench. What is to happen now to gay men and lesbians
who come into his courtroom?''
   Bill Nelson, an attorney for the alliance, said the group
intends to file a petition with the Texas Supreme Court calling for
Hampton's removal.
   The State Commission on Judicial Conduct issued its censure
Tuesday for Hampton, whose remarks to reporters in December ignited
a yearlong storm of criticism.
   Last December, Hampton said he sentenced Richard Lee Bednarski
to 30 years in prison _ instead of life _ for the slaying of two
men in a park because the victims were homosexual.
   ``Those two gays that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
Hampton told reporters at the time.
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy.''
   The commission said Hampton's comments ``were destructive of
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary.''
   Public censure is the strongest action the commission could take
short of recommending the 57-year-old Republican's removal from the
bench.
   The commission ruled that Hampton's statements violated the Code
of Judicial Conduct, which prohibits judges from making public
comments on a pending case and requires them to promote public
confidence in the judiciary.
   ``The hostility and distrust generated by this judge's
irresponsible statements created an additional burden for the
entire judiciary,'' it said.
   Hampton hasn't spoken to reporters since December. Hampton's
office said Tuesday he would not comment.
   But a statement issued from Hampton's attorney, David Kidder,
was sharply critical of the commission's move:
   ``The commission has ignored most of the findings and
conclusions of the special master, who was appointed by the Texas
Supreme Court and is the only neutral arbiter in this entire
proceeding.''

<HEAD>Jury Reaches One Verdict in 2{-Year-Old Molestation Trial; 64 to
Go</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury in the 2{-year-old McMartin
preschool molestation trial returned its first sealed verdict after
more than three weeks of deliberations, but still has 64 counts to
decide.
   The jury also indicated Tuesday it was deadlocked on another
count.
   Concerned that the longest criminal trial in U.S. history could
end in a mistrial, the judge has taken the unusual step of having
jurors return verdicts under seal one at a time, instead of waiting
until decisions are made on all counts.
   There are no more alternate jurors, so if one panel member drops
out, a mistrial would have to be declared on any unresolved charges
against Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
63.
   ``Taking them one at a time is an insane process. But waiting
for all of them is just as insane because we may lose a key juror
before that time and thus lose all of those verdicts,'' Superior
Court Judge William Pounders said Tuesday.
   Pounders said he could find no precedent to support his plan,
but added that circumstances required it.
   He planned a meeting with attorneys Friday to decide when the
verdicts should be read, but said that if two or more decisions are
returned by then, an announcement could come as early as next week.
   The Buckeys are charged with conspiracy and child molestation at
their family-owned Manhattan Beach preschool. The trial has cost
Los Angeles County more than $15 million.
   Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, objected to the procedure Pounders
set down, saying jurors should have the chance to change their
minds about any count as their talks proceed.
   But the judge said, ``I'm not going to tell them they should
take sealed verdicts and redecide them.''
   Before returning the sealed verdict, the jurors indicated they
were deadlocked on one count.
   ``They've said only that they've taken several ballots and
cannot reach a verdict on a count,'' Pounders said. ``Given the
fact there are 65 counts, that is not too significant.''
   The judge said the jury's questions led him to believe the
deadlock involves a boy whose mother set off the McMartin
investigation six years ago with a complaint that her son had been
molested.
   The mother since has died and the boy did not testify. Jurors
had only medical evidence on which to consider the charges
involving him. The defense called that evidence inconclusive.

<HEAD>California Measure Would Double Business Taxes for Social Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest California ballot measure seeks to
shelter the homeless, provide affordable housing, improve
education, repair roads and reduce residential property taxes.
   There's a catch, of course: The Split-Roll Property Tax
Initiative raise the business property tax from 1 percent to 2.2
percent.
   The measure has survived an important court challenge, and its
author predicted Tuesday it will appear on the ballot either in
June or November 1990, depending on how fast signatures on the
petition are verified.
   Proponents say the measure is needed in large part because
California's Proposition 13, the property-tax slashing measure that
launched a national tax revolt in 1978, has left state and local
governments without the money for basic services.
   It is sponsored by Voter Revolt, the group whose Proposition 103
was approved by voters last year and is among the nation's most
radical of attempts to control insurance rates.
   Homeowners have a major incentive to vote for the new measure: a
$500 yearly reduction in their residential property tax.
   Opponents, however, say most businesses will just pass on their
extra costs to consumers. They say such sweeping changes should be
enacted by the Legislature as a part of a general tax increase.
   ``It's a thinly disguised tax increase for every person who
lives in the state,'' said Martyn Hopper, the state director for
the National Federation of Independent Businesses, one of many
business groups who oppose the measure.
   But the measure's author, Bill Zimmerman, said it was needed
precisely because lawmakers have been ineffective.
   ``The only reason we have to bring such a complex initiative to
the ballot is that we have a paralyzed state Legislature that can't
address the major problems of the state,'' he said.
   Opponents, including the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce
and the California Farm Bureau Federation, asked the state Court of
Appeal to invalidate it, arguing it violates California's
constitutional ban on initiatives dealing with more than one
subject.
   ``On the one hand, it changes property tax methods, and on the
other it creates new social programs relating to the homeless and
housing,'' said John Hodgson, a lawyer for the opponents.
   But the court, in a decision received this week, refused to
review the case. Hodgson said opponents will appeal to the state
Supreme Court, but Zimmerman said the high court has never
intervened in such a case.
   And Tony Quinn, another official of the National Federation of
Independent Businesses, acknowledged the measure would probably
make the June ballot.
   Under the initiative, business property would be taxed at 2.2
percent instead of the 1 percent now standard in California.
   Residential property would still be taxed at 1 percent, with the
first $57,000 in value exempt, compared versus $7,000 today. Homes
assessed at $1 million or more wouldn't get the increased exemption.
   Voter Revolt says 842,119 Californians signed the petition by
October; 595,485 valid signatures are needed to qualify it for the
ballot. Zimmerman said it will appear on either the June or
November ballot, depending on how fast the signatures are verified.
   The state legislative analyst estimates the measure would
generate $7.9 billion a year when fully operative in 1991. Of that,
$5 billion would go to homeowners and to increased rental-tax
credits, the rest to state and local governments for affordable
housing, shelter for the homeless, better education and repair of
crumbling roads, sewers, bridges and the like.
   Zimmerman said that in the long run, such improvements would be
good for business. Many businesses already are finding it
impossible to locate in a state plagued with astronomical housing
costs, clogged roads, mediocre schools, and infrastructure problems.
   ``Business will be more profitable if we solve problems of law
enforcement, zoning, streets, education and housing,'' he said.
``All of that has an impact on the long-term business prospects.''

   Space shuttle Discovery
sustained little damage to its heat shield tiles and had few other
problems during its five-day military mission, a NASA official said.
   ``The basic orbiter system itself looks like it's just maturing
as everybody promised it would and I think the hardware is starting
to prove itself,'' said Tip Talone, Discovery's overseer between
flights.
   Discovery was on schedule to begin a two-day flight back to
Kennedy Space Center atop a jumbo jet Saturday, Talone said Tuesday.
   Talone said he tried to avoid the cliche of reporting that
Discovery had come back as ``the best and cleanest one yet,'' but
``it really is.''
   Initial inspection indicated fewer than 10 thermal tiles would
need replacement because of damage.
   The tiles are typically damaged by debris hits during launch and
landing.
   Discovery landed Monday on a concrete runway rather than a clay
runway on Edwards' dry lakebed, which reduces the amount of debris
kicked up by the tires.
   Talone also said the brakes were in good condition and the right
side tires had more wear than the others but that was not
considered worrisome.
   The amount of damage to an orbiter determines how long it will
take to make it ready for its next flight and affects the schedule
for facilities shared by all the orbiters at Kennedy Space Center
in Florida.
   At Cape Canaveral, Fla., the space shuttle Columbia was
transported to a refurbished launch pad Tuesday for a Christmastime
mission to deploy one satellite and retrieve another the size of a
bus before it falls to Earth.
   Discovery's next mission is to carry the Hubble space telescope
into orbit in late March.
   ``The bottom line is we think that we've got a really good start
... to get the Hubble out,'' Talone said.
   Discovery's toilet broke and had to be fixed by the crew, but
few other problems showed up during the mission.
   ``The inflight anomaly list was extremely clean,'' Talone said.
   Its five astronauts reportedly achieved their main goal on
Thursday by releasing a $300 million spy satellite, but there was
no confirmation of the mission's purpose because of Defense
Department-mandated secrecy.

<TEXT>
   Singer-composer George Harrison says three
out of four Beatles equals no reunion.
   Such a gathering would be a hollow exercise without John Lennon,
the former member of the ``Fab Four'' who was slain by a fan.
   ``What good are three Beatles without John?'' Harrison told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It's too far in the past.''
   Harrison made his comments after Paul McCartney was quoted as
saying a reunion with Harrison and drummer Ringo Starr was possible
now that litigation between the former band members has been
settled.
   ``We might get to play together after all this time,'' McCartney
was quoted in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times as saying. The former
Beatle is ending a five-night solo concert at the Forum in
Inglewood tonight.
   Harrison, 46, said the future is more interesting than the past.
   ``Let sleeping dogs lie,'' said Harrison, who has become
involved in the British film industry and has a movie scheduled for
U.S. release early next year.
   It's a comedy and is called ``Nuns on the Run.''

   The dollar fell in early European trading today
and currency dealers said there were no elements in sight to break
the downward slide.
   Gold prices rose.
   ``Even though the dollar is entering an oversold range, people
are still selling,'' said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``We have had a downward movement since last night, and the
trend is still lower,'' said a dealer at a bank in Dusseldorf, West
Germany.
   The West German mark continued to be bolstered by an
increasingly positive view of the accelerating pace of change in
Eastern Europe, which is likely to present huge business
opportunities for West German companies, he said.
   Rumors that the Deutsche Bundesbank might raise its key interest
rates again Thursday to starve off inflationary pressures
associated with the influx of East German refugees also helped, he
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.12 yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.44 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7780 West German marks, down from 1.7880
   _1.5885 Swiss francs, down from 1.5950
   _6.0725 French francs, down from 6.1035
   _2.0075 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0270
   _1,314.00 Italian lire, down from 1,319.50
   _1.1663 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1674
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5635 to buy one pound, slightly more expensive than $1.5625 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.10 a troy ounce, up
from $411.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $410.75.
   ``Gold has risen so far so fast that one has got to look for a
pullback,'' said one London bullion dealer, predicting gold would
drift back down to 405 dollars before attempting another climb.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.70, up from $410.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.16 to close at a bid $411.35.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.64 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday.

   A baker has been sentenced to six
months in prison for the fatal shooting of his best friend, who
identified his killer by blinking his eyes.
   Frank Zollbrecht wept as he apologized for the death of his
friend, Frederick Sannicandro.
   ``I would never hurt Freddy,'' said Zollbrecht, 45. ``I'm sorry
for what happened. ... I'm sorry I touched the gun. I'm sorry.''
   Sannicandro, 38, died more than six hours after Zollbrecht shot
him in the abdomen on June 3, 1988, while both men were working in
a Yonkers bakery.
   As he was being wheeled into surgery, detectives and an
attending physician questioned Sannicandro and urged him to respond
to the questions with eye blinks. One blink meant ``yes''; two
blinks ``no.''
   According to trial testimony, Sannicandro blinked ``yes'' when
asked if Zollbrecht had shot him and blinked ``no'' when asked if
the shooting was accidental. He was unable to speak because he had
a breathing tube in his throat.
   ``God brought him back for a few moments to communicate with
detectives,'' Westchester County Court Judge John LaCava said.
   Zollbrecht also admitted when he placed the emergency call to
police that he had shot his friend, Assistant District Attorney
Michael Romano said.
   LaCava also sentenced Zollbrecht to five years' probation and
1,000 hours of community service and ordered him to get treatment
for alcoholism and psychological problems.
   According to testimony during the trial, Zollbrecht had a
history of alcohol abuse, and his boss had hidden the gun on the
night of the shooting.
   But Zollbrecht went and got the gun, and the shooting occurred
when both were drunk.
   The defense maintained that Sannicandro's deathbed testimony
never should have been allowed into evidence, since Sannicandro
also was drunk at the time of the shooting.

<HEAD>Late Season Tropical Depression Heads for Yucatan Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare, late-season tropical
depression headed for the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba
today, and forecasters said it could become this year's 11th named
storm.
   At 5 a.m. EST, the depression's poorly-defined center was near
20.4 north latitude, 85.7 west longitude, about 105 miles
south-southwest of Cape San Antonio in western Cuba.
   It was moving north at about 10 mph with highest sustained winds
estimated at 35 mph. It was expected to maintain that motion
through today, said National Hurricane Center forecaster Hal
Gerrish.
   He added that he didn't think the system would become a
hurricane because it is likely to run into a cold front moving down
the Florida peninsula. It appeared this morning that the clash
between the two would most affect the Florida Straits off the
peninsula's tip.
   ``There'll be rain and some wind,'' he said. ``It'll be
primarily a concern for our marine interests.''
   The depression formed Tuesday about 500 miles southwest of the
lower Florida Keys.
   If its winds reach 39 mph, it would become Tropical Storm Karen.
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Poindexter Seeks Help to Pay Legal Fees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, facing trial in the Iran-Contra case, has begun a
fund-raising drive to pay for his legal fees, according to a
published report today.
   Poindexter wrote a four-page letter saying liberal special
interests want him ``silenced ... bankrupt or imprisoned,'' The New
York Times reported.
   He said that after having put five sons through college on a
Navy salary, he cannot meet his expenses alone.
   ``There is only one reason why I am being put through this
ordeal: political revenge,'' wrote Poindexter, who describes
himself as ``one man, alone against the massive onslaught of
liberal special interests who want to imprison me for serving my
country.''
   He went on: ``The liberals in Congress wanted to destroy the
Reagan presidency any way they could. When they found that they
were going to be unsuccessful, they turned on me.''
   Poindexter faces five criminal charges in a trial scheduled to
begin Jan. 22. The charges include conspiring to obstruct
congressional inquiries in August 1986 about whether National
Security Council aide Oliver L. North was making false statements
to Congress and secretly helping to arm the Contras.
   Poindexter's lawyer, Richard W. Beckler, called the former
admiral's legal fees ``substantial'' but would not disclose how
much they were. Some of those involved in the fund-raising appeal
suggested the fees would be $3 million to $4 million, the Times
said.
   Poindexter was unavailable for comment, the newspaper said.
   Poindexter wrote he has ``always done what I thought was in the
best long-term interests of the country,'' but ``because I care
more about the long-term security of America than I do about
myself, I must now face the liberals' accusations surrounding the
`Iran-Contra affair.'''
   Retired Adm. Clarence A. Hill Jr., one of three retired admirals
who set up a defense fund for Poindexter, said they were concerned
his legal fees would be about the same as North's but he would not
attract as many contributors as the former Marine.
   The other two former admirals are James L. Holloway III and
Gerald E. Miller.
   The letter asks for contributions of $35, $50, $100 and $500.
   Hill would not say how much money the drive has raised.

   Despite the reforms sweeping the East
bloc, NATO defense ministers agreed today to refrain from
unilateral reductions in conventional arms until a formal agreement
with the Warsaw Pact can be reached.
   The ministers, ending two days of talks, said in a statement
that they welcomed the changes in the East but issued a word of
caution.
   ``There has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the
threat which confronts us, but not yet a significant change in the
military capability of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact,'' NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the United States will
not bring home any troops from Europe without first consulting NATO
allies.
   ``We will not act unilaterally,'' he said, referring to a
Pentagon study of troop cuts in the early 1990s that would exceed
those now being negotiated at East-West conventional arms talks in
Vienna.
   In their statement, the ministers noted the start of unilateral
reductions in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms by the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   But they insisted, ``we cannot ignore the fact that, even after
completion of these reductions, the Warsaw Pact will retain
well-equipped forces which substantially outnumber those of the
West.''
   As a result, the statement said the ministers would take a
``pragmatic, step-by-step approach'' to changes in the East, where
Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have
embraced democratic reform to varying degrees.
   The ministers also renewed their ``determination not to make any
unilateral reductions that could risk undermining the prospect of
reaching a (conventional arms) accord.''
   The 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
seven Warsaw Pact members are currently negotiating cuts in
non-nuclear arms and troops in Vienna, Austria.
   In those talks, Washington wants the Soviet Union and the United
States cut their forces in Europe to 275,000 soldiers each. That
would mean a cutback of 300,000 Soviet and 30,000 American troops.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebel
negotiators shook hands today on an agreement to hold formal peace
talks, then came out fighting in a display that bodes ill for
future negotiations.
   At a news conference ending nearly three weeks of preliminary
talks, the two sides disagreed on the exact meaning of their
agreement and accused each other of foot-dragging and
misrepresentations.
   A weary former President Jimmy Carter, who mediated the
negotiations, sat between the Ethiopian and Eritrean
representatives as they exchanged accusations and commented: ``I've
heard this kind of talk for 20 days.''
   But Carter, while cautioning that he was ``not naive enough to
predict certain success,'' said he was ``more optimistic than I
have been at any time'' that the sides could find an end the
28-year-old war between the government and Eritreans fighting to
create a separate homeland in the north.
   The preliminary negotiations, which began in Atlanta in
September and resumed in Nairobi on Nov. 20, ended with no
agreement on a date or place for the main peace talks.
   They also ended with the Eritreans accusing Ethiopia's Marxist
government of obstructing the talks and contesting Carter's
statement that the United Nations had declined to act as an
observer in further talks.
   ``During the Atlanta and Nairobi talks in general, and last week
in particular, the Ethiopian regime, some of its allies and certain
individuals have resorted to lies, blackmail and sinister
manipulations to obstruct the participation of the U.N. as an
observer,'' said Alamin Mohamed Saiyed, the chief Eritrean
negotiator.
   Alamin insisted that the United Nations had not rejected an
invitation to act as an observer in the main talks, although Carter
said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar had turned down the
offer in a telephone conversation Friday.
   Alamin also took issue with an informal comment by Carter
following his reading of the closing communique. The former
president said observers chosen for the main talks ``shall witness
all negotiating sessions without directly participating in the
discussions.''
   The Eritrean negotiator said ``mediation cannot be limited to
the co-chairmen'' and noted that the role of observers was not
spelled out in the joint communique. Carter conceded that ``there
is some disagreement about the role to be played by observers.''
   Alamin also said the government delegation had refused to
discuss a drought in northern Ethiopia that he said threatens 1.5
million people with starvation in Eritrea alone.
   The United Nations has estimated that up to 4 million people
risk starvation in Eritrea and three other northern Ethiopian
provinces, Tigre, Wollo and Gonder. The government has disputed
that forecast.
   The Eritrean rebels took up arms against the government in 1961
in an attempt to gain independence for Ethiopia's northernmost
province, a former Italian colony that was federated with Ethiopia
under a U.N. mandate in 1952.
   The war and associated famines are estimated to have claimed
more than 1 million lives.

<HEAD>West Would Be Warned Well in Advance Of Soviet Attack: Study</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 2 grafs with Cheney comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet-bloc forces would need so much
preparation to attack Western Europe that U.S. intelligence would
detect the activity months in advance, according to a report
published today.
   The ``intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to
44 days of warning time,'' and possibly six months, The Washington
Post said in today's editions, quoting a study prepared for Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
   NATO war plans had been based on the assumption that the West
would have only 10 to 14 days' warning, the newspaper said. A short
expected warning time led to decisions to invest large sums in
airlift capability and forward storage of ammunition and supplies.
   The study said that while it remained possible for the Soviets
to launch a quick attack that would allow the West less than two
weeks' warning, such a move would be ``quite risky'' for the
Soviets.
   The study also found that during the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Moscow was so worried about possible
intervention from the West that it put its battlefield nuclear
rockets on 10-minute alert, even though ``Moscow clearly wanted to
avoid a general war in Europe.''
   In Brussels, Belgium today, Cheney told reporters, ``I haven't
seen any such planning document. That doesn't necessarily mean
there isn't one. Occasionally, I receive documents after they
arrive at the New York Times, The Washington Post.''
   Cheney was attending a two-day meeting of defense ministers of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

   Tom Carvel, the gravelly voiced pitchman for
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss and other Carvel Corp. confections,
has sold his ice cream empire to an investment bank.
   Carvel, 83, who founded the Carvel Corp. in 1938, sold his 99
percent share to Investcorp for more than $80 million, the bank
announced Tuesday.
   Based on annual sales, Carvel, based in Yonkers, is the
third-largest ice cream store chain in the country after Dairy
Queen and Haagen-Dazs, said Robert Glaser, a member of Investcorp's
management committee.
   Carvel has more than 700 stores, most of them in New York,
Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and other East
Coast states.
   Carvel will stay on as a consultant but will no longer make the
commercials promoting Fudgie the Whale and Cookie Puss ice cream
cakes, Flying Saucers ice cream sandwiches and Thinny Thin dietary
frozen dessert, Investcorp said.
   With the purchase of Carvel, Investcorp also acquired control of
two other food businesses owned by Carvel: Nedick's hot dogs and
Dugan's bakery products.
   Investcorp said it hopes to expand Carvel's business by
increasing the number of franchises, modernizing its image and
introducing new products.
   ``Carvel has a good name and we want to build on that,'' Glaser
said.
   Thomas Shick, a spokesman for Carvel, referred all questions to
Investcorp.
   Investcorp has offices in Bahrain, New York and London. Its
other investments have included Tiffany &amp; Co., Gucci and yacht
manufacturers Bertram &amp; Trojan.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Cabinet ministers today
studied an official report about alleged police death squads, and
the state radio urged a public inquiry to erase any doubts about a
possible cover-up.
   Neither Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee nor Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok commented publicly on the contents of the
report.
   It was completed Tuesday by a provincial attorney general and a
police commander after a five-week investigation of claims by three
former policemen that they served in death squads which
assassinated government opponents.
   Vlok and Coetsee were expected to forward the report to
President de Klerk promptly so he could determine what further
steps should be taken.
   New allegations about death squad activity were made in the
Netherlands on Tuesday by a 27-year-old South African who
identified himself as Mervyn Malan and said he was a cousin of
South Africa's defense minister, Gen. Magnus Malan.
   The general said today that he had no knowledge of a relative
named Mervyn. But the Defense Ministry said it was not ready to
comment on the man's allegations that his former army unit had
carried out attacks on civilians.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp., which closely reflects
government thinking, said today that ``the very idea of a police
assassination squad operating in South Africa is so monstrous as to
be almost unbelievable.''
   ``It is absolutely essential that the facts are established ...
in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been
done,'' the commentary said. ``Unless justice is not only done, but
seen to be done, those allegations will be believed, and exploited
for propaganda, in quarters hostile to South Africa.''
   De Klerk, in a speech to a police parade Tuesday, said strong
action would be taken against any officers implicated in death
squad activity. He said most police officers behaved ``in an
impeccable manner'' and did not deserve to be ``dragged through the
mud.''
   De Klerk also announced major steps to reduce the influence of
military and police officials over national security policy.
   He abolished the controversial National Security Management
System, established under former President P.W. Botha to coordinate
a counterrevolutionary strategy that included suppression of
activists and upgrading of black communities.
   Several newspapers suggested today that abolition of the
security system was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the
state of emergency, declared by Botha in June 1986.
   The system was dominated by security force officers and reported
directly to the powerful State Security Council, consisting of
generals, police commanders and selected Cabinet ministers.
   Critics said the system usurped the powers of Parliament and
municipal governments while setting policies on the international,
national and local level.

<HEAD>Police Order Reinforcements Into Embattled Black Township</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officials today ordered
reinforcements into a Natal Province township where political
violence has claimed at least a dozen lives this week, including
three men killed by police.
   Scores of homes have been burned and numerous street battles
have occurred in Mpumalanga, near the provincial capital,
Pietermaritzburg. The violence has included clashes between rival
black factions and a wave of attacks on police.
   Mpumalanga has been the center of an upsurge of political
violence throughout Natal. More than 30 people have been killed in
unrest in the province this week, according to police _ one of the
bloodiest periods during a three-year power struggle in which more
than 3,000 blacks have died.
   The conflict is between members of Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu political organization headed by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, and supporters of the banned United Democratic Front, a
militant anti-apartheid coalition.
   Maj. Gen. J.C. Van Niekerk, police commissioner for Natal, said
today that additional security forces would sent into Mpumalanga.
He gave no details, but there were unconfirmed reports the
reinforcements would include army units.
   Police headquarters said six people were killed in Mpumalanga in
the 24-hour period ending at daybreak today. These included three
men shot and killed by police who were fired on after arriving to
break up a clash in which two other men had been killed.
   Five other unrest deaths were reported in the same period
elsewhere in Natal.
   Police officials have insisted their forces seek to remain
neutral in the factional conflict. However, a delegation of lawyers
and human rights activists which visited Mpumalanga on Tuesday
contended that police were assisting Inkatha vigilantes.
   Both Inkatha and the United Democratic Front oppose apartheid,
but they differ sharply over strategy.
   Buthelezi condemns the front's use of boycotts and encouragement
of economic sanctions against South Africa. He also opposes the
guerrilla tactics of the outlawed African National Congress, which
is aligned with the front.
   Some United Democratic Front leaders depict Buthelezi as a
government collaborator because of his position as chief minister
of the tribal homeland of KwaZulu.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A college student who smuggled
footage of the Tiananmen Square massacre out of China for NBC has
been been found guilty by a Wake Forest University honor court of
lying in order to go near the square.
   Timothy W. Bell, a business major, was convicted by the Honor
Council on Tuesday night and put on probation until the end of the
term.
   Bell, who had gone to China last spring as part of a group of 28
students, was also ordered to write letters of apology to each of
the other participants.
   Two professors who led the group said Bell lied in telling them
he would not go near the square when he left their hotel on the
outskirts of Beijing.
   Bell, 22, said he watched the struggle the night of June 3 from
a foreign correspondent's hotel room about three blocks from the
square. Before the students left Beijing, an NBC crew gave Bell
tapes to take to Hong Kong.
   The tapes were seen on a June 4 report on the massacre. NBC
officials told him 20 million to 30 million people saw that
broadcast, Bell said.
   Bell was supposed to graduate in August, but his graduation was
held up by the Honor Council investigation. He said he will appeal.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's state-controlled newspapers
today joined Communist leaders and some dissidents in rejecting
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call for eventual German
reunification.
   ``What Does Bonn Want: Anschluss or Real Partnership?'' asked
the Junge Welt newspaper in a headline. Anschluss is the German
word for annexation and is used to describe the Nazi takeover of
Austria in 1938.
   After Kohl made his proposal on Tuesday, Communist Party leader
Egon Krenz said reunification could conjure fears of a Nazi-era
Germany, ``and I know no one in the world who would like such a
Germany.'' But Krenz welcomed Kohl's call for closer cooperation
between the Germanys.
   Many Europeans worry that with its economic and political might,
a reunited Germany of 80 million people would dominate the
continent. Germany was divided into two states after the Nazi
defeat in World War II.
   The prospect of reunification seemed distant less than a month
ago, but sweeping changes in East Germany have revived the idea.
   With East Germans disillusioned with Communist rule fleeing in
droves and taking to the streets bythe hundreds of thousands, the
party leadership ousted hard-liner Erich Honecker last month and
launched a radical program of reforms with the promise of free
elections.
   The opening of the country's borders on Nov. 9 gave East Germans
unrestricted freedom to travel to West Germany for the first time
since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
   Some people in both countries have called for reunification, an
idea consistently rejected by East Germany's leaders.
   Krenz emphasized the need for two ``sovereign, independent
German states.''
   ``A unity of Germany isn't on the agenda,'' he told West
Germany's ARD television network.
   However, he did not rule out a confederation, or partnership,
between the two Germanys, that Kohl promoted. Krenz said talk of
such an arrangement ``requires more time.''
   Wolfgang Meyer, the East German government spokesman, said
Kohl's proposal for eventual reunification went ``beyond realities
and could easily lead to irritation ... by not observing the
sovereignty and independence of the two German states.''
   In a statement carried by the official news agency ADN, Meyer
also said Kohl's proposals for cooperation contained ``interesting
starting points for negotiations.''
   A group of leading East German intellectuals also rejected
reunification and expressed fear of their country ``being
pocketed'' by West Germany. They said East Germany should remain a
separate socialist state.
   The dissidents, including prominent authors Stefan Heym and
Christa Wolf, started a petition drive Tuesday calling for a
national ``vote of confidence'' in socialism.
   ADN said today that Krenz had signed a petition and told the
dissidents in a letter: ``We have the historic duty to preserve
this country with its anti-fascist ideals and traditions as a
socialist alternative within German development.''
   In his speech to Parliament on Tuesday, Kohl sought to allay
fears about a reunited Germany, saying: ``The Germans ... will be a
dividend for a Europe that is coming together, and never again a
threat.''
   He did not offer a timetable and made it clear it could take
years to form a federation. Kohl said German reunification can only
occur as the overall East-West division of Europe is overcome.
   Kohl proposed creation of joint governmental and parliamentary
committees whose purpose would be ``permanent consultation''
between the two Germanys on economic, environmental, cultural, and
scientific matters.
   In other developments Tuesday, ADN outlined a new travel
proposal that is aimed at controlling some of the economic damage
East Germany faces by having an open border with its richer
neighbor.
   Since East Germany opened the borders, illegal currency trading
has intensified and black-market dealings have been rampant.
   Under the proposal, East Germans can have their passports
revoked if they are found to be working abroad or earning any
income without the consent of the East German government.
   ``Every citizen of East Germany has the right to travel abroad
any time and to obtain a passport for this purpose,'' states the
proposed law that will be discussed at a parliamentary session
beginning Friday.
   The government last week imposed new customs controls aimed at
intercepting huge stashes of currency or subsidized consumer goods
headed West in the bags of East German travelers.
   In the first publication of official figures, the Communist
Party newspaper Neues Deutschland said today that 3.4 million
people had left East Germany during 40 years of Communist rule.
West German estimates say the number is far higher. East Germany's
current population is about 16.5 million.

<HEAD>Catholic Newspaper Requires Anti-Abortion Vow from Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper of the Roman Catholic
Diocese of Providence has told politicians that if they want to
advertise holiday greetings, they'll have to sign a declaration
supporting a constitutional amendment against abortion.
   So far, politicians are refusing to sign. A spokesman for one,
Warwick Mayor Francis X. Flaherty, a Democrat considering a run for
governor, said he was offended despite his anti-abortion stance.
   Rhode Island politicians traditionally buy Christmas greetings
ads in the Providence Visitor.
   The paper previously has barred campaign ads from pro-choice
politicians, but in a recent letter told officeholders and office
seekers that congratulatory ads and holiday greetings also would be
rejected unless the politicians signed the declaration.
   ``The Providence Visitor holds the view that abortion
constitutes the greatest single outrage being waged against
humanity in America today,'' the letter said.
   The policy was decided on at a meeting last month of the
Visitor's board of directors, said the Rev. John W. Hunt, the
newspaper's executive director.
   The publisher, Bishop Louis E. Gelineau, did not attend but
supports the decision, Hunt said.
   Gelineau recently chastised Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., for
her view that a woman's decision whether to have an abortion is her
own, although Schneider personally opposes abortion.
   Circulation figures were not immediately available for the
weekly paper, but it is an influental publication in a state where
the population is two-thirds Catholic.
   Hunt said the paper could lose as much as $5,000 in revenue a
year. He would not identify the politicians to whom the letters
were sent but said no forms had been returned. Dec. 15 is the
deadline for the Christmas ads.
   Among those who have refused to sign are Johnston Mayor Ralph
Russo and Cranston Mayor Michael A. Traficante, both of whom oppose
abortion.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said Russo. ``I'm an administrator.
I don't set laws.''

   A 21-month-old girl who received the nation's
first living-donor liver transplant was recovering today after a
complication, and her father hoped to have her home for Christmas.
   Alyssa Smith underwent a second operation Tuesday to stop
internal bleeding detected 12 hours after she received a piece of
her mother's liver. She was in critical but stable condition at
University of Chicago Medical Center this morning.
   ``She was very stable through the night,'' hospital spokesman
John Easton said. ``She rested comfortably.''
   ``She's looking much better,'' her father, John L. Smith, said
Tuesday.
   ``Even with the surgery and everything, she looked great,'' he
said, his voice trembling. ``Her eyes were kind of open and she saw
me and ... her face kind of lit up a bit.''
   Doctors removed the left lobe of 29-year-old Teresa Smith's
liver for the transplant. Mrs. Smith was in fair condition today.
She was moved out of intensive care and was expected to be released
in about a week, doctors said.
   John Smith said the sudden return to the operating room caused
some tense moments for him and his wife.
   ``It really scared me when they came up and told me the doctor
of the hospital wanted to talk to me,'' he said.
   In the Smiths' hometown of Schertz, Texas, a suburb of San
Antonio, the girl's grandfather, D.C. Morgan, also felt
apprehension as he awaited updates from his wife, Ada, who had
traveled to Chicago.
   ``As you're waiting, thoughts can go through your mind,'' he
said. ``Some thoughts are good, some are bad.''
   The surface of Alyssa's new liver _ about the size of a man's
fist _ had begun to bleed, a complication that occurs in about 30
percent of all liver transplants, and she was returned to the
operating room about 4:40 a.m. Tuesday, said Dr. Peter Whitington,
the hospital's director of pediatric transplant services.
   Doctors corrected the problem in a few minutes but kept her in
surgery for nearly five hours for observation, said Dr. Christoph
Broelsch, who headed the surgical team.
   Alyssa may undergo another exploratory operation within a few
days to examine the liver, doctors said. But John Smith was looking
further ahead.
   ``The only plans we really have (are) ... to have a Christmas at
home with our kids, get back to our jobs and get on with our
lives,'' the father said. ``With this liver, she can live the rest
of her life.
   ``Her whole future is ahead of her now.''
   After the second operation, Alyssa was awake, active and moving
around, although she remained on sedation and a ventilator,
Broelsch said.
   ``The transplant is definitely functioning and for now things
are back on a smooth course,'' he said.
   Alyssa suffered from an often-fatal liver disorder called
biliary atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving
children. She had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver
transplant when her parents asked to participate in the hospital's
living-donor program.
   The procedure was complicated when Mrs. Smith's spleen was
damaged and had to be removed, but doctors predicted she would
recover fully.
   Liver transplants from living donors have been performed only
three times _ in Brazil, Australia and Japan. All have been done in
emergency situations, and at least one child has died.

<TEXT>
   The legislature today passed a motion urging
the forced return of Vietnamese refugees, and several lawmakers
condemned U.S. opposition to the idea.
   The Legislative Council vote reflected the strong local
sentiment to rid this British colony of the nearly 57,000
Vietnamese languishing in squalid detention centers after fleeing
their Communist homeland by boat.
   ``Mandatory repatriation is a must, and it should have been
implemented yesterday,'' lawmaker Rita Fan said during the debate.
   The measure was merely a resolution urging that Great Britain
secure an agreement for repatriation with Vietnam. Britain is
responsible for the negotiations.
   Vietnam's official news agency said today that Vietnam continues
to reject forced repatriation but will work toward reaching a
settlement ``on the basis of respect for the humanitarian spirit.''
   The nearly 12,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong camps who arrived
before June 1988 automatically received refugee status and will be
resettled overseas.
   But under a tough new policy, the more than 44,000 boat people
who sailed into the colony later are considered illegal immigrants
subject to repatriation against their will unless they can prove
they fled political or religious persecution.
   Of the nearly 7,000 screened, only 687 have been granted refugee
status.
   The United States has been among the most vocal opponents of
forced repatriation, saying conditions must first improve in
Vietnam.
   Some lawmakers attributed Washington's position to a ``guilty
conscience,'' a reference to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War.
   They also argued that U.S. economic sanctions were preventing
Vietnam from escaping poverty, thereby contributing to the stream
of Vietnamese fleeing to seek a better life abroad.
   ``There is no reason for the United States to oppose mandatory
repatriation of (Vietnamese) illegal immigrants when they are
practicing this every day at the U.S.-Mexican border,'' lawmaker
Allen Lee argued.
   Boat people already have staged hunger strikes and
demonstrations in their detention centers to protest forced
repatriation.
   The Legislative Council motion was overwhelmingly approved by
voice vote.

<HEAD>Auction Record Set for Modigliani Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A world auction record in sterling was set for the
work of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani when a Japanese gallery
bought a painting by him for the equivalent of $7.89 million,
Sotheby's said.
   The sale of ``Fillette au Tablier Noir'' was part of an auction
Tuesday night of impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture
that together brought in $104 million.
   Twenty-two works, including ones by Claude Monet and Paul
Gauguin, each fetched more than $1.56 million.
   The Fujii Gallery paid 5,060,000 pounds for ``Fillette au
Tablier Noir,'' a painting of a girl in a black dress.
   The previous highest auction price for Modigliani was 4.4
million pounds in March 1988, then the equivalent of $7.9 million
against a stronger dollar.
   The seller was not identified but the picture last belonged to a
private collection in Baden, Switzerland. It was painted in 1918 in
Paris.
   Modigliani, whose portraits were characterized by deep oval
faces, only became famous after his death at age 36 in 1920 from
tuberculosis, aggravated by poverty, drink and drugs.
   The top price, paid anonymously by a telephone bidder, was $8.9
million for one of Monet's famous paintings of water lilies.
   Aksa International, a Japanese conglomerate, paid $6.8 million
for Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy in a landscape. The
company owns 7 percent in Christie's auction house, a Sotheby's
rival.
   The Gauguin was one of five works that together brought nearly
$17 million for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.
   The museum recently sent 15 works to Sotheby's for auction,
saying they represented the private taste of the oil billionaire,
who died in 1976. The museum said it will use the proceeds to
acquire other works better suited to its collection and public
display.

   A man infected with the AIDS virus was
convicted of knowingly selling tainted blood and sentenced to six
years in prison.
   Assistant Solicitor Francis J. Cornely said Hank R. Mosely's
trial was the first clear test of a 1988 law making it a felony to
knowingly sell, donate or exchange blood or body fluids infected
with the virus without informing others.
   Earlier this year, a man pleaded guilty to the charge, Cornely
said.
   A jury convicted Mosely on Tuesday.
   The lawyer for the 32-year-old Ladson man argued he did not
expose anyone to AIDS since the blood was destroyed by the Alpha
Plasma Center when it tested positive for AIDS a week after it was
collected June 22. Police arrested him Aug. 9.
   Prosecutors argued that he had run the risk of exposing medical
technicians, nurses and others to the virus.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met today
with Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres and called for closer
cooperation with Israel.
   Peres, the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to visit
Poland, told Walesa on the final day of a three-day trip that
Israel was closely following reforms in Poland and awaited a visit
from the Solidarity leader.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski on Monday told Peres
that Warsaw will restore relations with Israel, broken off 22 years
ago.
   With reporters present at the start of today's meeting, Walesa
said the nations ``should tighten our cooperation. Poland is
pursuing reforms. In these reforms your participation is
indispensable.''
   One purpose of Peres' visit was to improve economic cooperation
between the countries. Polish trade with Israel will amount to $40
million this year, compared with $22.3 million last year.
   Walesa told Peres that Poland was applying a method of indexing
wages to prices similar to a policy used in Israel. ``We can rely
on and benefit from your experience,'' he said.
   Walesa also noted that Poles and Jews shared a common history.
``Let us remember this was a country of two peoples. The war
destroyed the Jewish people and to this day we feel the shortage,''
he said.
   Poland had the largest Jewish population in Eastern Europe until
the Holocaust, in which 3 million of Poland's 3.5 million Jews were
killed. Nearly all the survivors emigrated after World War II.
   Earlier today, Peres visited the Auschwitz concentration camp in
southern Poland, where 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million
people who died there.
   There has been a steady warming in relations between Israel and
Poland in recent years, with senior officials, cultural figures and
private groups exchanging visits.
   All Warsaw Pact nations except Romania severed diplomatic
relations with Israel following the 1967 Middle East War.
   Hungary on Sept. 18 became the first Warsaw Pact country to
fully restore relations.
   Poland has had low-level ties since 1986, allowing Israel to
maintain a diplomatic office in Warsaw. The Soviet Union renewed
low-level relations last year.

   Searchers today found the bodies of two
dogs that had been on a twin-engine plane missing off Rhode Island
but saw no sign of wreckage or the eight people aboard, authorities
said.
   Authorities held out hope of finding survivors from the New
England Airlines plane that vanished Tuesday night on a 17-mile
flight from Block Island State Airport to Westerly.
   Searchers on land and in boats reported finding various debris,
including a radio headset, a shoe, a life jacket, a fire
extinguisher and a box of freight believed to have been aboard the
plane.
   ``There's always a chance. That's why we're still looking,''
said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Brear.
   The dogs were found in Block Island Sound, about two miles
northwest of the island, where two Coast Guard cutters and a dozen
smaller boats were searching in water about 100 feet deep and as
cold as 45 degrees overnight.
   The dogs belonged to passenger Judy Johnson, a New Jersey woman
who had a summer home on the island, said a friend, Barbara
Heineman, who came to the Westerly airport to await further word.
   The flight left at 6:20 p.m. and should have taken no more than
15 minutes, authorities said. The British Norman Islander aircraft
had about two hours of fuel, airline controller Dean Martin said.
   There was no radio contact with pilot John Beck Jr. after
takeoff, Martin said. The airports involved do not have control
towers, and Beck, a former Naval aviator with about 10 years of
experience on the Block Island route, would have navigated
visually, the airline said.
   ``We're all just worried sick,'' said Helen Scraug, a bartender
on Block Island. ``We're praying for everybody on that plane.''
   Peter Wood, publisher of the Block Island Times newspaper, said
his wife, Shirley, a real estate agent, was aboard on her way to a
real estate class on the mainland.
   Others aboard included two construction workers and a man who
worked at a restaurant on the island, New Shoreham police Sgt.
William McCombe said.

   Italian Cardinal Ernesto Civardi has died at
the age of 83, the Vatican said today.
   Civardi, born in Fossarmato near Pavia in 1906, died Tuesday in
Rome. The cause of death was not given.
   He was consecrated as bishop in 1967 and elevated to cardinal by
Pope John Paul II in 1979. The pope will lead funeral services for
Civardi at the Vatican on Thursday.
   Civardi's death brings the number of Roman Catholic cardinals to
149. Of those, 114 are under the age of 80 and thus eligible to
participate in a conclave for the election of a new pope.

<HEAD>Former Soviet POW Says Afghan Rebels Made Him Refuse to Come Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Soviet prisoner of war who previously
denied he wanted to come home said today he was forced to make that
statement by the Afghan guerrillas who held him captive.
   Soviet Pvt. Andrei Lopukh, 20, said at a news conference that
anti-Communist rebel authorities warned him if he didn't say he had
converted to Islam and wanted to stay with them, ``It would be all
over.''
   Lopukh and Pvt. Valery Prokapchuk were released to their mothers
Monday in an emotional ceremony in the Pakistani frontier city of
Peshawar, near the Afghan border.
   They were traded for 33 prisoners who had fought with the
rebels. Soviet and rebel officials called the exchange a goodwill
gesture.
   In their first public appearance since returning to the Soviet
Union, the soldiers told reporters they were not mistreated
physically but that they had to convert to Islam or face death.
   Lopukh said he prayed five times a day and read the Koran but
``I didn't really accept Islam.''
   Iona Andronov, spokesman for a group of POW families that helped
negotiate the release, said hat ``accepting Islam is no betrayal of
the motherland.''
   Both young men, who were held for more than a year, said they
were unarmed when they were captured _ Lopukh when he left camp to
go after a watermelon he had seen in bushes and Prokapchuk when he
wandered away to look around and got lost.
   Prokapchuk said he tried to escape and was beaten.
   Rebel fighters have intermittently released Soviet prisoners
during the 10-year war in Afghanistan.
   In December 1979, Moscow sent more than 100,000 combat troops
into Afghanistan to replace one Communist government with another
and crush a growing Moslem insurgency.
   The Soviets completed their pullout in February. Moscow says 310
men are still missing, but the rebels say they are holding no more
than 75.
   The Soviet Union continues to fund the Afghan government against
the U.S.-supported rebels.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resigned
today after five years in power, clearing the way for opposition
leaders to try to form a government.
   Gandhi, smiling and looking relaxed, said he was ready for the
role of opposition leader.
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``We will be a very good watchdog.''
   The opposition National Front's newly elected Parliament members
planned to meet Friday to pick the man they hope will replace
Gandhi as prime minister.
   The meeting had been scheduled for today, was postponed until
Thursday and then Friday amid reported disagreements over who
should be nominated.
   Gandhi and his Congress Party have been gambling that the
National Front would be hamstrung by internal squabbling that would
pave the way for Congress to return to power. The Congress Party
today decided not to stake a claim to form the government.
   Former defense and finance minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh is
the best-known leader of the National Front, the five-party
alliance that deprived Gandhi of a decisive majority in the new
Parliament in the Nov. 22-26 elections.
   But the mild-mannered Singh, 58, has said he does not want to be
prime minister and is content being the president of the Janata
Dal, or People's Party, the major component of the National Front.
   Another prominent Janata Dal member, Chandra Shekhar, said
Tuesday he was ready to take the prime minister's job but some of
his National Front colleagues were not enthusiastic about his
candidacy.
   ``There will be trouble in the party if V.P. Singh is not
elected prime minister. Efforts to persuade him to contest are
continuing,'' said Jaipal Reddy, one of the Janata Dal's general
secretaries.
   ``As of now, there is only one candidate,'' Reddy said.
``Despite persuasion V.P. Singh is not a candidate and despite
dissuasion Chandra Shekhar remains one.''
   Chandra Shekhar, 62, was a chief architect of the 1977 Janata
Party election triumph that ousted Gandhi's mother and predecessor,
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, from power for 29 months until her
comeback in 1980. Most Janata Party members switched to the Janata
Dal, which was formed in 1988.
   The 1977 election was the only time in India's 42 years of
independence that the Congress Party failed to win a majority in a
parliamentary election.
   This year, Congress got more seats than any other party but fell
far short of the majority needed for a government.
   The National Front got the second-highest number yet was able to
muster the tacit support of other opposition parties, prompting it
to boast it would be capable of forming a government.
   With 500 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided, the Congress
Party had 190 and its small-party allies 17 for a total of 207.
   The National Front had 130, and its allies had 132 for a total
of 262.
   It takes 263 seats for a majority in the Parliament, which is to
convene with 525 elected seats. Another 18 seats are to be filled
in elections that have been postponed indefinitely.
   The rest of the seats contested this month went to small parties
and independents, most of whom have not declared their support for
either the Congress Party or the National Front.
   Gandhi, whose lackluster election showing followed charges that
his government had tolerated corruption and ineptitude at high
levels, will remain prime minister until a new one is accepted by
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
   The 45-year-old former airline pilot submitted his resignation
to Venkataraman this morning. The president accepted but asked
Gandhi and his Cabinet to remain in office until a new government
is appointed, the presidential palace announced.
   Gandhi's resignation had been expected and was a formality that
cleared the way for the National Front to try to form the next
government, provided Venkataraman asks it to do so.
   The constitution says it is up to the president to decide who
should be asked to form a government. In the past, the decision was
clear-cut because one party always won a comfortable majority.
   This time the president is free to go to the party he considers
the most capable of forming a government.
   Congress Party leaders said Tuesday they were ready to enter
into the secondary role of an opposition party and bide their time
for a return to power.
   While Gandhi was closeted with the president, election officials
announced he had been elected to Parliament from his Amethi
constituency for the third consecutive time.
   He defeated his nearest rival, Raj Mohan Gandhi, grandson of
Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi by 197,000 votes,
United News of India said.

   Dunne, 59, belongs to the all-male Garden City Golf Club on Long
Island but has said he would resign if nominated as assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
   Bush earlier nominated William Lucas, a black from Detroit who
served as sheriff and county executive. Lucas' nomination was
blocked after a bruising confirmation fight on a tie-vote in the
Senate Judiciary Committee on Aug. 1.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today that
Dunne ``is the top candidate ... and we'll announce it when we
announce it.''
   He declined to talk about Dunne's qualifications for the civil
rights post, saying, ``We haven't made a selection yet.''
   The civil rights job, occupied by William Bradford Reynolds
during the Reagan administration, has been vacant all year.
Reynolds stirred controversy with his forceful opposition to
programs relying on racial preferences.
   On Tuesday, Bush signed legislation extending the life of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights through Sept. 30, 1991. The panel,
shrouded in controversy during the Reagan years, had been facing
extinction.
   Dunne is credited with helping reform the New York's prison
system after the deadly riot at Attica Prison in 1971. He went to
Attica and was critical of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's handling of
the riot.
   Thirty-nine Attica inmates and guards were killed when
Rockefeller sent in heavily armed state police to retake the
prison; a guard and three inmates were also killed during the
uprising.
   The sources, who insisted on anonymity, said Dunne was
undergoing a background clearance check before the White House
formally announces the nomination. That check could take up to two
months.
   Dunne, a graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School,
resigned from the New York Senate in September after a 24-year
career in which he rose to deputy majority leader. He returned to
practice law in Uniondale, N.Y., after losing a race for majority
leader in the Republican-controlled Senate.
   A secretary who answered the telephone at Dunne's office said:
``The senator has no comments and is referring all calls to the
people in Washington.''
   ``If the president has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a
more decent person than John Dunne,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., an old friend of Dunne's.
   Rangel said Dunne has the legal experience and training ``that
the previous candidate lacked.''
   During most of his 24 years in the Legislature _ a part-time
post _ Dunne lived at Albany's Fort Orange Club, which admitted
women to membership only last year.
   Dunne told Newsday in an interview last week that he would
resign his membership in the all-male Garden City Golf Club if
nominated to the Justice post.
   ``It would send the wrong message to stay,'' he said. ``It would
be inappropriate.''

   A United Nations group today ignored U.S. threats to
cut its funds and voted overwhelmingly to help the Palestine
Liberation Organization teach Palestinians how to grow food in
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Only the United States and Israel voted against the resolution,
which was introduced by a group of Arab countries at the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization's governing conference.
   Ninety-six countries voted in favor and 14 abstained.
   Earlier this week, the State Department threatened to cut funds
to the agency if the measure passed.
   Gerald Monroe, the U.S. representative to the organization,
demanded a roll call vote and told the conference it ``should not
allow this precedent by presenting highly political issues.''
   ``If that occurs, the FAO will cease to be effective.''
   An Israeli delegate said his country supported giving technical
assistance to the Arabs in the occupied territories ``but why does
it have to be in collaboration with the PLO, a very political
organization.''
   A PLO representative said, ``We were trying to depict reality in
the occupied territories. ... I do not wish to talk about
politics.''
   The resolution expresses opposition ``to the Israeli
confiscation of Palestinian land and expropriation of Palestinian
water resources.''
   It calls on the food organization to provide ``the Palestinian
people with the assistance necessary for their economic development
in close cooperation with the Palestine Liberation Organization.''
   The assistance could include such things as studies of soil,
water and food storage, as well as suggestions on how to improve
food-growing skills.
   The resolution also asks that the agency include
Israeli-occupied territories in future programs ``and in line with
the present cooperation and coordination between the Palestine
Liberation Organization and other U.N. agencies.''
   The resolution also calls for free access by U.N. staff members
to occupied Palestinian territory.
   The State Department said Tuesday that Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter had written to the FAO director-general, Eduoard
Saouma, a Lebanese, to say that there was considerable concern over
the issue in Congress and the administration.
   The United States said it had no objection to the FAO becoming
involved in projects in the territories, but ``it would be
ill-advised for the organization to do so in such a way as to
involve itself in the geo-political process.''
   This week, Arab nations plan to push a resolution through the
U.N. General Assembly recognizing the PLO as a nation. The State
Department has threatened to cut off all U.S. support for the
United Nations if the plan winds approval.
   The United States, as in other U.N. agencies, is assessed 25
percent of the food organization budget, set last week at $568.8
million for the next two years.

   Dry, desert winds howling through Southern
California pushed flames across acres of brush and downed power
lines, cutting electricity to thousands.
   ``It's blowing like mad,'' said Highway Patrol officer Dale
Clark in San Bernardino. ``The Santa Anas are back with us again.''
   The Santa Ana winds reached 70 mph and accompanied regular winds
of 35 mph overnight at the Rialto Airport in San Bernardino County,
the National Weather Service said.
   Nearby in the Cajon Pass, wind ranged from 40 mph to 60 mph,
forcing trucks, campers and vans to stop on the shoulder of
Interstate 15 and wait for gusts to lessen, the Highway Patrol
said. Part of the interstate was all but closed Tuesday morning as
dirt and sand kicked up by the wind reduced visibility to almost
zero.
   The weather station in Sandberg, about 60 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, reported steady winds of 30 to 35 mph Tuesday
night, with gusts to 45 mph.
   Earlier Tuesday, winds fanned a brush fire in northern San Diego
County that blackened more than 3,000 acres, destroyed several
structures and forced the evacuation of schools and homes.
   The blaze was 60 percent contained today and residents were
allowed back in their homes, authorities said.
   About 50 homes at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station were
evacuated when a fire in a manure pile near the station's horse
stables ignited and was fanned by high winds, said base spokesman
Lt. Gene Browne.
   No one was hurt and no structures burned in the early morning
blaze. Residents were allowed back into their homes within two
hours.
   Power outages caused by wind affected 40,000 customers in San
Bernardino, Orange and Ventura counties. Power was restored to all
but a few users by Tuesday afternoon. About 5,000 Los Angeles
customers also were blacked out Tuesday.
   Jerry Steiger, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said
the winds were expected to decrease today as a high pressure system
over Utah weakens.
   Santa Ana winds typically are caused when a high-pressure system
forms over the northern Rocky Mountain states while a low-pressure
system hovers over Baja California.
   Air rushing across the Western deserts from high to low pressure
heats up and dries out, and then roars through mountain passes
around the Los Angeles basin.

   Tank-led Syrian forces took up combat
positions facing troops of Gen. Michel Aoun in and around Beirut
today in apparent preparation for an attack to drive him from the
presidential palace.
   Aoun has refused to cede the palace to the country's newly
elected president, who fired Aoun on Tuesday as Christian army
commander.
   The general ordered his 20,000 soldiers on maximum alert and
fortified his defenses around the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Samir Geagea, commander of the Lebanese Forces coalition of
Christian militias, declared support for Aoun and said his 6,000
fighters would ``defend the Christian areas to the last minute of
our lives.''
   Aoun does not recognize President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite
Catholic like himself, and pledges to keep up his efforts to drive
Syrian troops from Lebanon. Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon,
supports Hrawi.
   Thirty right-wing French parliamentarians arrived in the
Christian enclave today and met with Aoun at the presidential
palace.
   Aoun's television said the lawmakers ``relayed to the general
the support of the French people for his steadfastness'' and joined
an estimated 15,000 youths in a sit-in around the palace in support
of the general.
   Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.
   In an interview with the French radio station Europe 1, Aoun
said he was willing to reach a compromise with the Syrians.
   ``I invite France to undertake negotiations toward an end that
safeguards the minimum, fundamental rights of the Lebanese
people,'' he said.
   Aoun has repeatedly offered to negotiate with Syria for the
withdrawal of all of its forces from Lebanon. The Syrians have
rejected the offers.
   France has recognized Hrawi's government and the nation's
Foreign Ministry said Paris ``will not be on the side of those who
would assume the responsibility of again taking up violence.''
   Moslem and Christian military sources said the Syrians deployed
T-55 tanks in Beirut and T-62 tanks in the mountainous fronts.
   Dozens of Soviet-designed T-55 tanks rolled into the slums of
south Beirut Tuesday night, taking up combat positions opposite
Aoun's forces, said one military source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Residents of south Beirut, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said fighters of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
withdrew from the various positions thay had manned along the front
line in that sector.
   ``Hundreds of Syrian soldiers moved in. The front in south
Beirut is now fully controlled by the Syrians,'' said one resident.
   The Syrians, according to military sources, also deployed
mortars and recoilless cannons in south Beirut in addition to
howitzers and multi-barreled rocket launchers in the mountains
overlooking the city.
   ``It's a significant buildup, the kind of measures that precede
a major battle,'' one military source said.
   The sources said the Syrian tanks were ``in combat formation. It
seems they are only waiting for the orders.''
   He said Aoun's forces have planted thousands of anti-armor and
anti-personnel mines in the valleys separating the Christian
enclave from the Syrian positions.
   Mines have been planted on all the bridges and narrow mountain
roads linking the Christian enclave with the rest of Lebanon, the
source added.
   Aoun's forces also have deployed scores of anti-aircraft
batteries around strategic locations to confront a possible landing
of airborne forces.
   Syria on Tuesday poured at least 15,000 troops into Lebanon
backed by artillery, tanks and rocket launchers.
   Hrawi on Tuesday fired Aoun and replaced him with Adm. Emile
Lahoud, also a Maronite, who called on soldiers following Aoun to
join the new command.
   Aoun called Lahoud a deserter and vowed to fight to the death.
The rebellious 54-year-old general refused to relinquish the
presidential palace.
   Aoun's mainly Christian forces battled the Syrians for six
months before the artillery duels ended Sept. 22 with an Arab
League-brokered cease-fire.
   He rejects a peace accord approved by Parliament last month that
provided for greater Moslem participation in the government because
it did not set a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian
troops in the country.
   Civil war broke out in Lebanon in 1975. The Syrian forces
entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate,
then sided with the Moslems in the war, which has claimed 150,000
lives.
   Before the peace plan was adopted, Aoun and Moslem Prime
Minister Salim Hoss had led competing Christian and Moslem
governments for 14 months.

   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering says
the dialogue between the United States and PLO will be jeopardized
if the General Assembly recognizes the Palestine Liberation
Organization as a nation.
   Debate on the Palestinian problem opens today in the General
Assembly, where Arab nations planned to introduce a resolution
Thursday that would raise the PLO's status from an observer
organization to a non-voting nation, like North and South Korea,
Monaco, the Vatican, San Marino and Switzerland.
   The State Department has threatened to cut off all U.S. funds
for the United Nations if the General Assembly approves the step.
The United States is assessed $216 million annually, one-fourth of
the U.N. budget.
   Pickering said Tuesday that the PLO move ``has serious
consequences for the peace process in the Middle East, our ongoing
dialogue with the PLO, a lot of very important issues, issues that
I would say should be much more important to the PLO than the mere
change on a nameplate here in the United Nations.''
   In Rome today, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
ignored American objections and voted overwhelmingly to help the
PLO teach Palestinians how to grow food in Israeli-occupied
territories. The United States has threatened to cut funds to the
organization if the measure passed.
   Since PLO leader Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism last year,
the United States has held talks with PLO representatives in Tunis,
Tunisia.
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said the Arab group was
determined to go ahead with the move to change the PLO's status in
the United Nations, but that negotiations would continue with other
U.N. members.
   Pickering rejected any compromise, saying, ``We are clearly not
interested in exploring all the alternatives.
   ``We are interested in finding a way to end this particular
silly idea that the Palestinians can be declared a state here in
the United Nations when they have none of the attributes of a
state.''
   European and Nordic diplomats, who often play a buffer role in
the recurring U.S.-PLO confrontations, worked on a compromise prior
to the showdown vote Friday, but said privately they had little
hope.
   Upgrading the PLO's status would take a simple majority vote of
the 159 General Assembly members. As a member of the 102-member
non-aligned movement, the PLO has more than enough votes to prevail.
   Last year, the PLO declared the existence of a state of
Palestine in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the
PLO says 117 nations have recognized it.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the United States
is obligated to pay its U.N. dues even if the PLO is recognized as
``Palestine.''
   He rejected the U.S. threat of non-payment and commented,
``Sometimes I think I have the impression that the Americans think
that they're making a loan. The Americans ought to pay what they
owe.''
   Israel, America's firmest ally in the Middle East, calls the PLO
a terrorist organization and refuses to negotiate with it.

<HEAD>Specter of Repo Man Looms in Peewee Team's Nightmare Road Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nightmarish Thanksgiving trip of two suburban
peewee football teams turned more bizarre with word that a team bus
thought to have been stolen from a Florida parking lot was actually
repossessed.
   During the five-day trip, the young players and their chaperones
faced repeated bus breakdowns, sleepless nights, a shortened trip
to Walt Disney World and two humiliating losses in football.
   The lowlight of the trip may have been the disappearance of one
of three buses used to transport the team, along with $2,200 in
donated cash, radios, cameras, jackets and other personal
possessions on board.
   The bus vanished from the parking lot of an Orlando-area high
school during the second of two Pop Warner League football games
involving the teams. Many of the 116 group members were left
stranded in Lake City, Fla. and forced to buy airline or bus
tickets back to Chicago.
   Team officials discovered Tuesday that the bus had been
repossessed and was parked at the ABC Bus Co. compound in Winter
Garden, Fla., the Chicago Tribune reported today.
   An ABC official in Winter Garden said he found $2,209 in cash on
the bus but little else.
   ``If we can get the $2,200 back, it would be a thrill,'' said
Roxanne Whited, president of the teams. ``We were left high and
dry.''
   Whited blamed the repossession on Falcon Motorcoach Co., which
provided the group with the buses, two of which broke down
repeatedly on the trip.
   But Ken Arnold, one of Falcon's owners, said his company is not
to blame because he had leased the bus from another company, B&amp;B
Tours, in south suburban Markham.
   B&amp;B officials, in turn, said they had leased the bus from yet
another firm _ Grand Tour by Linda, of Harvey, La. _ and had no
idea the company was behind on payments and that the bus might be
repossessed.
   B&amp;B repairs buses, among other things. Bernard Jackson, a
manager of B&amp;B, said that his company had repaired the bus that was
repossessed but that Grand Tour hadn't paid the bill. Grand Tour
had made arrangements for B&amp;B to use the bus as partial payment for
the work.
   Jackson said it's a common for companies that own buses to
employ repossessors to reclaim the vehicles when payments are
overdue.
   ``These guys ride around all over the United States, to the
hotspots where buses might be, and when they see the bus, they
snatch it,'' Jackson said today.
   Officials at Grand Tour by Linda could not be reached for
comment. The company's telephone was disconnected.
   Bob Yochum, an official at ABC's headquarters in Faribault,
Minn., refused to comment about the repossession. ``It's a private
business transaction,'' he said.

   Coast Guard searchers looking for five lobstermen
missing since last week moved farther out to sea this morning after
spotting a distress flare for the second night in a row.
   Three aircraft and two cutters searched a 10,000-square-mile
area about 270 miles southeast of Nantucket.
   ``The flares are coming from somewhere,'' said Lt. Paul Wolf.
   Rescuers said they hoped to find the boat's life raft, which
would have contained red and orange flares such as those spotted
Monday and Tuesday.
   The 72-foot Heidi Marie out of Stonington, Conn., was reported
missing last Wednesday by its owner.
   The vessel's last transmission was Nov. 21, the day officials
received a distress signal from a fishing area south of New York's

<HEAD>GAO: Ignored Problems Leave `Never Ending' Trail of Government Waste</HEAD>

Reagan cuts blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven years after Congress sought to improve
government management, major problems still are ignored or
corrected slowly, leaving a ``seemingly never-ending''
multibillion-dollar legacy of waste, a watchdog agency said today.
   ``Management deficiencies, program abuses and illegal activities
cost the taxpayers billions of dollars and undermine their
confidence in government,'' the General Accounting Office said.
   ``This situation is unacceptable under any circumstance but
becomes even more serious in light of overwhelming budget
deficits,'' said GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The GAO's chief, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, told a
Senate hearing today that the Office of Management and Budget had
taken recent steps to demand improved agency management but alone
could not do enough.
   And he laid much of the blame for mismanagement on the
deregulation and domestic budget cuts during the Reagan
administration. He said those steps were taken without a plan to
improve oversight of the private sector's spending of government
money.
   ``We have been penny-wise and really pound foolish,'' Bowsher
said.
   GAO said it found that myriad examples of mismanagement, fraud,
waste and abuse had been uncovered in annual assessments of
government agencies required under the 1982 Financial Integrity Act.
   But many of the problems persist years after being identified,
the report said, blaming a lack of agency leadership, shortsighted
decision-making and a failure of Congress and the White House to
aggressively oversee government management.
   ``There is a seemingly never-ending and costly trail of
mismanagement, abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs,''
the GAO said in the report to the Senate Government Affairs
Committee. ``Most of the problems are known, and in many instances
have been known for years, but they remain uncorrected.''
   Bowsher said GAO had decided to launch a government-wide review
to identify areas most ripe for abuse. He called on Congress to
expand its oversight and to demand evidence of improved financial
management as part of the budget-writing process.
   GAO also suggested a businesslike approach to government
management, recommending creation of a chief financial officer for
the government as a whole and for each major agency, and requiring
them to submit detailed annual reports to Congress and to outside
auditors.
   Bowsher warned against using budget deficits as an excuse not to
deal with the problems, many of which he blamed on ``second-rate''
and World War II-era financial management systems. But he said the
new financial systems needed to correct the problems would
ultimately pay for themselves.
   Bowsher and the report cited a litany of spending blunders by
the government, some of them previously cited in prior GAO reports,
and said many were made in attempts to improve program management.
   The report noted the Navy spent $230 million before halting
installation of an automated financial management system,
originally intended to cost $33 million, but whose cost estimate
grew to a staggering $479 million.
   Also, it cited the Internal Revenue Service's decision to
abandon, after spending $187 million, a $1.8 billion automated tax
return examination system.
   The report said government spending on information technology
and management has nearly doubled to $17 million since the
Financial Integrity Act was passed in 1982 but that there is little
coordination between government agencies when they seek to improve
their management systems.
   ``Invariably, these systems do not work as planned, have cost
overruns of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars, and
are not developed on time,'' the report said.
   As examples, the report cited:
   _Federal Housing Administration projections that its 1988 losses
were $860 million. A later private audit put the pricetag at $4.2
billion.
   _The IRS' inability to identify and collect more than $50
billion in delinquent taxes, roughly 64 percent of the $89 billion
owed the government but uncollected despite the mounting deficits.
   The GAO study found that 50 percent of the managers charged with
conducting the internal management reviews required by the 1982 law
had not been trained to properly do so.

   Thousands of Italians waving small Soviet flags
greeted Mikhail S. Gorbachev today as he prepared for a historic
meeting with the pope and became the first Soviet Communist Party
chief to make an official visit here.
   On Tuesday, the Vatican said the pope planned to ask for
establishment of permanent ties between the Holy See and the
Kremlin.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti welcomed the Soviet president shortly
after his Ilyushin-62 touched down at Leonardo da Vinci airport on
a sunny Rome morning. The two leaders inspected an honor guard and
a 21-gun salute rang out.
   Gorbachev, in a blue overcoat and gray fedora, shook hands with
a line of Italian officials before his motorcade departed for the
Soviet ambassador's residence, Villa Abamelek, where he and his
wife, Raisa, are staying.
   Thousands cheered Gorbachev as his motorcade traveled a short
while later to the Renaissance presidential palace for a meeting
with President Francesco Cossiga. Sharpshooters were posted on
buildings along the route.
   Crowds chanted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' and ``Bravo, Mikhail, bravo!''
A group of young people burst into the strains of the Socialist
Internationale, thrusting their fists into the air.
   ``Gorby, you are a beautiful man,'' one bystander yelled.
   While not as effusive as the popular welcome given the Soviet
president in other Western European countries, it was a rare public
tribute to a foreign leader in the Italian capital.
   The three-day visit comes just before the U.S.-Soviet summit off
Malta. Italian officials say they hope to get in ``the last
European word'' before Gorbachev heads into his talks with
President Bush.
   Gorbachev later joined a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier in central Rome and went on a whirlwind tour of
Rome's famous sights, including the Colosseum.
   His first contact with the Roman public was at the central
Piazza Venezia, the square where fascist dictator Benito Mussolini
once stirred crowds from his office balcony. Gorbachev smiled and
waved as thousands cheered and waved plastic Soviet flags.
   The talks in Rome were expected to focus on Eastern Europe.
Czechoslovakia's leaders have now joined East Germany, Poland,
Hungary and Bulgaria in bowing to public pressure and rejecting
hard-line communism.
   As the Gorbachev visit began, Amnesty International's Rome
office issued an appeal for the release of seven Soviet political
prisoners, including one it said was detained for religious
activities.
   Gorbachev meets Friday with the Polish-born John Paul II in the
first such encounter between a pope, leader of the world's 850
million Roman Catholics, and a Soviet Communist Party chief.
   On the eve of Gorbachev's arrival, Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said the pope would press for diplomatic relations with the
Kremlin.
   The statement was a dramatic indication of the improvement in
relations between the Vatican and the Soviet government, which once
tried to abolish religious practice.
   Gorbachev is popular among Italians for his reform programs, and
Italian-Soviet relations have been good in recent years. The
government is eager to help Gorbachev overcome the economic crisis
that his reforms have not resolved.
   About $3.3 billion worth of agreements between Italian private
and public industry and the Soviet Union are being concluded in
connection with Gorbachev's visit.
   The Fiat auto giant announced Tuesday the signing of a joint
venture agreement to produce 300,000 cars a year in the Soviet
Union.
   The visit comes as Italy's own Communist Party, the biggest in
the West, is moving toward changing its name and becoming a social
democratic grouping. The Italian Communists regularly win more than
25 percent of the vote.
   Rome prettied up for the visit, repaving roads and cleaning
building facades. ``Welcome to Italy, President Gorbachev'' read
red posters put up by the Italy-Soviet Union Association.
   The government planned to showcase Italy's famed cuisine at a
state dinner, with a menu that included small ravioli stuffed with
truffles, gilt-bream fish Sicilian-style, and fruit and eggnog
cream, along with wines and spumanti.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Nov. 24
   Los Angeles Times on the 101st Congress:
   The first session of the 101st Congress blessedly faded into the
bleak November Washington dawn ... more notable for all that it
undid or left undone than for its few achievements. ...
   The House and Senate dismantled a major program, the 1988
catastrophic health care system, which sank under an anti-tax
backlash. They then pasted together a $14.7 billion budget deficit
reduction measure with a good deal of whole cloth, in the form of
fiscal shell games, and (hush) some $6 billion in various ``revenue
enhancements'' (i.e., tax increases). ...
   Sustantial progress was made on new programs such as the Clean
Air Act and child care. And the escalating demands of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law may compel (President) Bush to
do something he failed to do this year; to lay a coherent fiscal
program before Congress in January. ...
   At the outset, the new president had lots of good will in
Congress, but he lost several big ones in his first year, including
his fight to fulfill a major campaign pledge, the capital gains
(tax) cut, and his selection for secretary of defense, John Tower
(a blessing in disguise, since he got the able Dick Cheney
instead). And he may have tripped himself up politically with his
hard-line position against public funding for abortion, even in
cases of rape and incest. ...
   The challenge for Bush is to develop a congressional agenda with
clear direction and to demonstrate a willingness to support his
kinder, gentler leanings with the necessary money.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on the Iowa blast probe:
   Since the (Navy's) own investigator made his original report, he
has changed his explanation of what triggered the blast. At first,
he said it was an electronic detonator; he now says it probably was
a chemical device.
   Yet even before the April tragedy, crewmen and their families
had been reporting accidents on board the Iowa, incidents not
mentioned in the Navy's report.
   There are conflicting stories about Seaman (Clayton) Hartwig
(who died in the blast and was blamed). Some of his shipmates
regarded him as depressed, others did not; others said he was
looking forward to his new assignment in London, and that he lacked
the technical expertise to construct the kind of device that
allegedly caused the explosion.
   And, too, there are disturbing questions about how the
investigation itself was conducted: At least one seaman said he was
threatened with severe retribution by Navy investigators if he
didn't tell the story they wanted him to.
   As a result, the armed services committees of both the Senate
and House have launched special inquiries into the explosion, as
has the General Accounting Office. Also under examination is the
Navy's handling of its own investigation.
   The inquiries are more than justified. The Navy may indeed turn
out to be correct in its conclusions. But the evidence and the
methods used by the service raise fears that rather than pursuing
the truth, Navy investigators sought to shift blame for the tragedy
from the Navy to a seaman no longer here to defend himself.

   Philadelphia Daily News on U.S.-Salvador:
   No wonder the United States has trouble finding an answer in
Central America. We can't even figure out what the question isn't.
   For instance, it is not whether the government of El Salvador is
duly constituted or elected. Maybe it is, but so is the government
of Nicaragua, which the United States has made a holy crusade of
overthrowing.
   It is not whether the $1.5 million that gets soaked up every day
by the Salvadoran government helps the people of El Salvador. It
does not. It goes for weapons to keep the people in line and to
keep the thugs in charge, in charge.
   It is not a question of maintaining ourselves as some kind of
moderating influence, moving a nation toward democracy, or at least
away from official murder. We have no influence in El Salvador. We
can't even get murderers arrested.
   It is not a question of fending off communism, the world's most
overrated threat. The very fact of our providing aid to oppressors
provides the only soil in which communism seems to thrive. ...
   The only question that matters is one the Congress of the United
States and the Bush administration refuse to consider ... : Should
the United States give aid and comfort to those who are
slaughtering their own citizens?
   The civil war in El Salvador has been going on for 10 years.
Even under the most inhumane geopolitical standard, our involvement
has done nothing but make things worse and to up the ante in lives.
We are co-conspirators with murderers. We should not _ cannot _ be.

   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on
U.S.-Salvador:
   Even in El Salvador, where the only thing more chronic than war
and violence is poverty, last week's murder ... of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and the housekeeper's daughter was
shockingly savage.
   The six massacred Jesuits were scholars and teachers and
political activists, part of what has become known as ``liberation
theology.'' They opposed the right-wing Cristiani government, which
has denounced the murders and pledged to bring the perpetrators to
justice.
   Despite that pledge, the murders have stretched U.S. support for
the Salvadoran government to its limit. The U.S. House ... came
within 21 votes of passing a bill that would have cut aid to El
Salvador, which now totals $500 million a year, by a third. ...
   But should the aid have been suspended? Not this time, not for
this incident. Foreign policy, liberal or conservative, should not
be dictated by reactions to single incidents of violence. Decisions
should be made after careful consideration of the broader
situation. And the broader situation in El Salvador is both violent
and muddy.

<HEAD>Burmese Junta Meets With Political Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government met with an
opposition political party for the first time and repeated its
pledge to hold free elections in May, a party source said today.
   Meanwhile, Thai authorities said Burmese government troops have
launched their first big attack in four months on two rebel camps
near the Thai border.
   A member of the opposition Union Nationals Democracy Party said
in Rangoon that Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the second-ranking
government official, held an hour of talks Tuesday with the party's
general secretary, Kyi Han.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted Khin
Nyunt as saying the government has ordered officials at all levels
to be strictly neutral in the election.
   The military junta came to power in a September 1988 coup in
which soldiers killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   In recent months the junta has cracked down again on the
opposition. Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, the leaders of the popular
opposition National League For Democracy, were put under house
arrest July 20.
   Of the 206 political parties registered to take part in the
elections, six have developed a national network. They include the
National League For Democracy and the Union Nationals Democracy
Party.
   It was not immediately known why Khin Nyunt met only with an
official of the Union Nationals.
   In the northern Thai town of Mae Sot, a border patrol police
officer said Burmese forces fired mortar and artillery guns at two
camps of the ethnic Karen rebels. The officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the offensive began Tuesday night just
across the border from Mae Sot.
   He said 2,000 rebels were defending the camps against about
4,000 government soldiers. The officer said he had no information
on casualties.
   The Karens withstood a fierce government offensive in late July.
   The ethnic minority is one of the strongest of a dozen guerrilla
groups fighting for greater regional autonomy.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on Czechoslovakia:
   No hyperbole has been spared in describing the momentous events
shaking Eastern Europe in recent weeks. Tongue-tied correspondents,
pundits and the people themselves _ Poles, Hungarians and East
Germans _ have fumbled for sufficiently forceful adjectives to
depict the historic developments.
   But the prize for understatement must go to Milos Jakes, the
general secretary of the Czech Communist Party who, along with the
rest of the top party leadership, resigned Friday (Nov. 24).
   In a speech to his besieged comrades just before the mass
capitulation, ... Jakes said that perhaps they had ``underestimated
completely the processes taking place in Poland, Hungary and
especially East Germany and their effect and influence on our
society.''
   For ... Jakes, the light apparently dawned ... when upward of
300,000 of his countrymen marched in Prague's 650-year-old
Wenceslas Square, the largest gathering in the history of
Czechoslovakia.
   The demonstration culminated weeklong uprisings in Prague,
Bratislava and other cities, capped by the triumphal return of
Alexander Dubcek, who championed the ill-fated 1968 democracy
movement that was crushed so ruthlessly by Soviet tanks.
   ``If there once was light,'' ... Dubcek told his cheering
countrymen, ``why should there be darkness again? Let us ... bring
back the light.''
   The old guard feels betrayed by Moscow. After the Red Army
smashed the quixotic '68 revolt, the Czech party became one of the
most servile in the communist bloc, toadying unabashedly to Moscow.
Now Mikhail Gorbachev, preoccupied with his own problems, has
abandoned these Czech sycophants, leaving them to their own devices.

   Corvallis (Ore.) Gazette-Times on extending Chinese students'
visas:
   The Chinese government is threatening diplomatic retaliation
against the United States for the congressional passage of a bill
to allow Chinese students to stay in this country. ...
   Under current law, foreigners on student visas must return home
for at least two years after completing their education before they
can apply for a different visa status. The bill passed by Congress
would eliminate the two-year requirement for the Chinese students
now legally in this country. ...
   Beijing is trying to send a message to the students ... that
they have nothing to fear by returning home.
   The message is completely unbelievable. It comes from a
government that used tanks and armed soldiers to kill peaceful
demonstrators (and) has imprisoned leaders of the protest movement.
...
   One of the great tragedies ... of history ... occurred following
World War II. This country joined other Allies in the forced
repatriation to the Soviet Union of people who had fled or been
captured in battle. After promising (that no harm would come to
these people), the Soviet government killed or imprisoned them.
   Forcing students back to China could have the same tragic
results as that sorry episode. President Bush should learn from
history and sign the visa bill into law.

   Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on drug use and student grants:
   There is a bit of resentment on college campuses these days
because Uncle Sam is insisting on an oath of no drug use@dealing in
order to get federal student grants.
   It is not unlike the requirement a few years ago that students
must comply with the requirements of the selective service law
before they could have grants.
   The main point is that those federal grants to students are not
something to which the students are entitled as a right.
   It makes sense that a government which is appropriating large
amounts of money in a war on drugs should see to it that other
federal money is not being spent at cross-purposes.
   The issue is larger than Pell Grants to students, though. The
issue is whether there should be attached qualifications for grants
in general.
   Of course there should. ...
   If the grant is for education, it would be silly if the grant
were not made with an attached string, for instance, that the money
be used for education. And it is entirely reasonable that the
government requires the recipients to maintain a clear record,
whether clear of felonies or clear of drug-related offenses.

   Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo, Miss., on gun
control:
   James Brady testified before a Senate subcommittee last week.
His subject, not surprisingly, was handgun control.
   Brady is something of a walking miracle. He was Ronald Reagan's
press secretary in 1981 when a bullet ripped through his brain
during an assassination attempt on the president.
   Brady's testimony was brave and riveting. He called the Congress
``cowardly lions'' for its failure to enact even the most
restrained controls on handgun sales. His words should pierce the
conscience of every congressman who has voted against a sensible
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   The bill is nothing more than an attempt to keep mentally
deranged people and outright criminals from legally buying
handguns. It is not designed to keep any lawabiding citizen in
(his) right mind from owning a gun.
   Now, let the National Rifle Association and other groups come
forward claiming gun-control backers are unpatriotic wimps. James
Brady puts the lie to that absurd claim.
   Brady casts the issue in a clear light that must be considered.
   Gun control is not a matter of gun ownership alone; it is a
matter of human life. Life is more important than owning a handgun.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on faith and spiritual values:
   Baby boomers who filled church and synagogue pews as children in
the 1950s are returning to the fold with their children. This is
good news, indeed, for a nation that often struggles awkwardly with
religion and the crucial role it plays in our lives.
   In a study presented to the American Academy of Religion,
sociologists Wade Clark Roof and David Roozen found that 40 percent
of those born between 1945 and 1954 said they were attending
worship services regularly last year. Only 33 percent of this same
generation reported regular attendance in the early 1970s.
   Perhaps they are discovering or rediscovering the imph and spiritual
values _ not only for themselves and their
families but for society as a whole.
   What can be more basic, more fundamental, than one's thoughts
and beliefsortance of
fait about God? That relationship _ no matter whether one is
an atheist, agnostic or devoted to God through a particular faith _
is key to how we think about ourselves and others, and how we think
about the here and the hereafter.
   And yet some people, be they believers or atheists, try to
pretend that religion is something separate. Something reserved for
a Saturday or Sunday. They lump religion with politics and sex as
subjects of conversation to avoid. ...
   It haslaw is necessary to encourage
parental involvement and protect minors' health.
   About half the states have laws requiring parental consent, but
most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges.
   Groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the
Supreme Court this term to help clarify its allegiance to Roe vs.
Wade. But the settlement of the Illinois case involving strict
regulations on abortion clinics may eliminate the greatest
immediate threat to that 1973 decision. The Illinois settlement
still must be approved by a federal judge.
   However, the court's decisions in the Ohio and Minnesota cases,
expected by July, still are sure to pack an enormous impact.
   Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers
who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million
legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _
180,000 each year _ have been for minors.
   The court touched off a political firestorm in July by voting
5-4 to give states greater power to regulate abortions. Four
justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn Roe vs.
Wade. O'Connor refused.
   But she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not
discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it.
   Neither Ohio nor Minnesota is asking the court to reverse Roe
vs. Wade, but the Bush administration has.
   Although it did not seek to participate in today's arguments,
the Bush administration urged the court to use the Minnesota case
to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion.
   ``We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should
be overruled,'' Justice Department lawyers said in a
friend-of-the-court brief.
   The disputed Ohio law was passed by the state Legislature in
1985 but never took effect, due to a successful legal challenge by
an Akron abortion clinic and one of its doctors, Max Pierre Gaujean.
   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's
parents at least 24 hours before the operation.
   A young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by
seeking a state judge's permission to have the abortion.
   A federal judge struck down the law, and that ruling was upheld
by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Minnesota law requires such young girls to notify both
biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion.
The 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations.
   After enforcement of the law was blocked, a judicial-bypass
provision took effect. It allows a girl to avoid notifying her
parents by convincing a judge she is ``mature and capable of giving
informed consent'' or that not notifying her parents would be in
her best interests.
   The notification law with the judicial-bypass option was in
effect in Minnesota for five years before it was struck down by a
federal judge.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last
year and said the law is constitutional. The appeals court,
however, blocked enforcement of the law pending Supreme Court
action.
   The cases are Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,
88-805, and Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 88-1125 and 88-1309.

   Chopping down a Christmas tree from
Monroe's town parks is a foul idea, and town officials plan to make
sure everyone agrees.
   All the evergreens in the town's three parks are being sprayed
with a foul-smelling mixture to dissuade people from robbing the
parks for Christmas trees.
   ``You can't smell it outdoors, but when you bring the tree
inside and it warms up, bang. You have a pungent, stinky odor,''
said park ranger David Solek.
   Parks director Ron Walissa said even trees too tall for use as
Christmas trees are vandalized when thieves cut off the tops.
   Solek said anyone caught stealing a tree will be fined $25 to
$30 per foot of tree.
   ``Taking one of these trees is a horrible thing,'' he said. ``It
goes against the spirit of the holiday. How can anyone be proud of
a tree they stole from a park?''

   The attorney for James M. Payton halted
his trial on battery charges by pointing out Payton couldn't be
tried as an adult because he was too young _ by three hours.
   Deputy Monroe County Prosecutor Chuck Huston was ready to argue
that Payton struck another man with a masonry hammer about 12:30
a.m. Oct. 15.
   Just before trial was to begin Monday, attorneym Pat Schrems,
noted that Payton turned 18 at 3:11 a.m. Oct. 15. Schrems said
Payton was a juvenile at the time of the offense and should be
tried as a minor.
   Huston argued that aspects of Indiana law say a person becomes a
certain age at midnight on his birthday. A person can legally drink
at midnight on his 21st birthday, he said.
   Monroe Superior Court Judge Douglas ``Randy'' Bridges agreed
with Schrems and dismissed the charges.
   Prosecutor Bob Miller said charges would be refiled in juvenile
court against Payton, who remains in police custody.

   Police recovered 81 Andy Warhol

   Seven persons were arrested, said police spokesman Kees Rameau.
The suspects were not identified in line with Dutch judicial

   The lithographs were stolen from an art gallery near Bonn in
September as part of a theft of artwork with an estimated value of
$3 million, Rameau said.
   Fourteen of the lithographs were seized when a Dutch art dealer
tried to sell them to two unidentified customers in an Amsterdam

   The remaining 67 Warhols were found when the art dealer's house
was raided. Also found were three handguns and a large amount of

   Mothers Against Drunk Driving, known as MADD,
wants a federal judge to stop a fathers' group called Mad Dads Inc.
to stop using that name.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Dallas-based
MADD sought unspecified money for alleged damage to its efforts to
promote the interests of people opposed to drunken driving.
   MADD contends Mad Dads is trading on the goodwill MADD has built
up, and the similarity of the names is likely to confuse the
public. The lawsuit alleges violation of MADD's service mark,
registered in 1983 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
according to court documents.
   MADD also said it owns the service mark ``I'm a MADD Dad,''
which was registered Nov. 7.
   Mad Dads Inc. was formed this year to discourage use of alcohol
and illegal drugs by young people and prevent gang-related crime in
the Omaha area. Spokesman John Foster said the organization does
not want to fight with MADD, but does not want to change its name.
   ``Mad Dads depicts what we are all about, parents at the
grass-roots level trying to combat the gang and drug problem in
Omaha and outside Omaha,'' Foster said.
   An attorney for Mad Dads, Thomas Johnson, said a Texas law firm
that represents MADD refused his written suggestion of a meeting of
representatives of the two groups.
   Of the claim for money, Foster said, ``Mad Dads doen't have much
money. All we have is firm commitment and determination.''

   John Klasavich speaks no Russian and
Marina Enikeeva speaks no English, but that will not stop the
American from marrying the Soviet next month.
   Klasavich of Old Orchard Beach plans to fly to Archangel, a
Soviet city near the Arctic Circle, to marry the woman he met on a
trip in June to improve U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``Everybody thinks I'm crazy except the people who were on that
trip,'' he said. ``They understand perfectly how this could
happen.''
   Klasavich and 42 other Mainers spent four days in Archangel as
part of the sister-city exchange between Greater Portland and the
Soviet port city of about 400,000 people.
   ``You would have thought we were royalty there,'' Klasavich
said. ``They were the warmest and friendliest people that I've ever
met.''
   The wedding has generated so much excitement in Archangel that
it may be broadcast on the city's television station, and the mayor
will be at the reception, said Klasavich, a telephone equipment
installer.
   It took only one day and a river cruise for Klasavich, 44, and
Enikeeva, 23, to know that something was happening between them. He
returned to Archangel four months later and won support from
Enikeeva'a mother and grandmother before he dropped to one knee in
front of the family and asked her to marry him.
   U.S. immigration officials estimate it will be at least three
months after the wedding before Soviet and U.S. red tape can be
cleared to bring Enikeeva and her 4-year-old son from a previous
marriage to Maine, where they intend to live.
   He said he sometimes wonders how they will manage without an
interpreter, whether their age difference is too great and whether
she is marrying him only to get out of the Soviet Union, as some of
his friends have suggested.
   But he says, ``I can't stand the idea of living without her.
It's that simple.''

   Gilbert said he noticed Tuesday that David R. Payne's badge had
been taken from a plaque in the station lobby. A security camera
does not focus on that area, Gilbert said.
   Payne, 26, was shot to death while on duty July 23, 1988. Joseph
Loveall, also known as Nicolo Leone, has been sentenced to 20 years
in prison for manslaughter in Payne's death, and 40 more years for
attempted murders of two officers who had gone to Payne's aid.
   Gilbert appealed for the return of the badge or information on
who may have taken it.
   ``I want that badge back,'' Gilbert said.

   Two survivors of a fiery church bus crash
testified today that they dived over a pile of fellow passengers
jamming an emergency door to escape the flames after the bus
collided head-on with a pickup truck.
   Thomas Hertz and Monica Obregon took the witness stand on the
fifth day of the trial of Larry Mahoney, the driver of the pickup.
   Mahoney, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault,
42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken driving in what
authorities say is the nation's worst alcohol-related traffic
accident.
   The truck was driving in the wrong lane at the time of the 1988
accident, which left 24 youngsters and three adults dead and 13
people injured.
   Hertz, of Hendersonville, Tenn., testified he jumped over a pile
of people to escape flames and growing heat inside the bus owned by
the First Assembly of God church in Radcliff. The bus was returning
from an outing to a Cincinnati amusement park.
   Hertz said someone held his feet and he was ``hanging upside
down outside of the bus ... face at the bumper.''
   ``I did not know how much longer it would be before it would
blow up,'' he said.
   Ms. Obregon, 17, was asked if more people could have escaped if
there had been more exits. She tearfully replied, ``Yes.''
   Mahoney remained stoic throughout the morning proceedings, his
eyes fixed on a table he shared with his attorneys. On Tuesday he
wept as a witness described seeing a fellow passenger engulfed in
flames cry, ``Oh Lord, I'm coming home.''
   Testimony from more passengers was expected today, said the
prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky Jr.
   On Tuesday, another teen-age survivor, Tammy Darnell, recounted
the panic on the church bus after the 10:55 p.m. collision on
Interstate 71 about five miles south of Carrollton.
   ``I looked up and seen nothing but flames and fire,'' said Miss
Darnell, 17, of Radcliff. She broke down in sobs, prompting Circuit
Judge Charles Satterwhite to call a brief recess.
   Afterward, Miss Darnell recalled seeing Chuck Kytta III,
engulfed in flames in the former school bus' stairwell.
   ``I saw our youth leader raise his hands and say `Oh Lord, I'm
coming home,''' Miss Darnell said. Kytta was one of 24 young people
who died. His father and two other adults also died.
   Mahoney broke down during the graphic testimony of Coroner James
B. Dunn, who described the bodies found inside the bus. Families of
the victims clasped hands tightly and dabbed tears with
handkerchiefs during Dunn's testimony.
   ``I couldn't believe what I had seen,'' Dunn said. ``I thought I
was having a nightmare.''
   Mahoney's sobbing prompted Satterwhite to order a recess.
Mahoney also broke into tears Monday as witnesses described the
screams and agony of the injured and dying.
   Russell Baldani, a defense attorney, said during a recess he
didn't know what effect Mahoney's sobbing would have on the jury.
   ``It's nothing staged. I'm sure they don't think that,'' Baldani
said.
   Mahoney's lawyers began building their case that the bus
carrying 67 people was unsafe.
   Before the crash, some passengers climbed over seats to sit with
friends and others were lying in the aisles, according to testimony
from survivors.
   ``It's no secret that's a big factor in our favor,'' Baldani
said.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last soldier from the South
African-Angolan war returned home Wednesday after having been
sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison following his
capture.
   Simeon Petrus, a member of the disbanded South-West Africa
Territorial Force, was captured in Angola in 1987 and kept in
prison in Luanda, the Angolan capital, until he was sentenced Jan.
31.
   There was no information on the circumstances of Petrus'
capture, but members of his 101 Battalion often crossed into Angola
in pursuit of South-West African people's Organization guerrillas
in the 23-year bush war in Namibia. South African forces also
crossed into Angola to aid the guerrillas fighting the Marxist
government of Angola.
   The sentencing followed a peace agreement in which South Africa
withdrew its soldiers from Angola, ended aid to the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola and agreed to grant
independence to the territory of Namibia, while Cuba began
withdrawing its 50,000 soldiers who support the Angolan government.
   The agreement also called for all sides to free their prisoners.
Petrus, 24, was handed over to the Red Cross in Luanda on Monday.

   It's not exactly 911, but the Pawnee
County Sheriff's Department has come up with a way to answer
emergency calls despite budget cuts.
   Callers in the evenings and weekends are greeted by Sheriff John
Schulze on a telephone answering machine.
   ``This is sheriff John Schulze. Due to a budget cut, a deputy or
dispatcher is not available to take your call at this time...,''
the tape-recorded message says.
   The tape includes a telephone number for the sheriff's home, and
says people may call collect in the event of an emergency, Schulze
said Monday. ``So far, we haven't had any major emergency that has
been hindered by the system.''
   Schulze said the answering machine has been in use since the
department was cut back to one deputy sheriff about six months ago.
   ``It has been years since the department staffed a 24-hour
dispatcher,'' he said. ``After that, calls were routed to deputies'
homes _ and it is still that way sometimes, depending on the
schedule.''

<TEXT>
   Americans' suspicions of the Soviet Union's
motives are fading rapidly, with a majority of people now convinced
that the Soviets do not seek to dominate the world, a national poll
has found.
   As Presidents Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev prepare for their
weekend summit off Malta, the poll found overwhelming belief that
the Soviet leader seeks real reform in his country, although
opinion was mixed on his prospects.
   Both men were highly popular in the Media General-Associated
Press poll, with Gorbachev out-polling Bush among the most-educated
Americans. A plurality said Gorbachev has done more than Bush to
ease East-West tensions.
   Their meeting comes at a moment of great change in the Communist
world. While Gorbachev pushes liberal reforms in the Soviet Union,
his Eastern European allies have taken dramatic steps toward
democracy in recent weeks.
   Forty percent of the 1,117 adults surveyed Nov. 17-25 rated Bush
as ``too cautious'' in encouraging reform in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe. Still, 46 percent said he was doing enough; the
rest were unsure.
   Respondents by a 2-1 margin favored establishing normal trade
relations with the Soviets, a step that administration officials
are exploring. A far less likely move, U.S. foreign aid to the
Soviets, was soundly opposed.
   Despite good will toward Gorbachev personally, the poll found
lingering doubt about Soviet reliability, with 53 percent saying
the Soviets cannot be trusted to live up to their arms control
agreements. The level of doubt was down, though, from 61 percent in
a poll last year.
   Reflecting the cautious view, 52 percent in the new poll said
the United States should not significantly reduce military spending
because of lessening East-West tensions. The Bush administration is
contemplating sizable cuts in its military budget.
   Respondents were divided on whether the United States should
remove all of its troops from Western Europe if the Soviets removed
theirs from Eastern Europe. Of those who had an opinion, 47 percent
favored such a deal and 42 percent were opposed, a split within the
poll's 3-point error margin.
   By a 68-25 percent margin, respondents opposed immediate cuts in
U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe as a response to reforms in
the East. But among those who opposed cuts, a majority said they
would favor troop reductions later if the reforms continue.
   On the broadest East-West issue, respondents by a 57-35 percent
margin rejected the notion that the Soviet Union is trying to
dominate the world, with the rest unsure. Just last spring, 50
percent in a CBS News-New York Times poll said they believed the
Soviets did seek world domination.
   Despite the divided opinion on Bush's caution in encouraging the
Communist changes, 74 percent approved of his handling of
U.S.-Soviet relations overall. And 70 percent had a favorable
opinion of Bush in general, the same high level of popularity he
enjoyed in a Gallup poll in May.
   Sixty-eight percent expressed a favorable view of Gorbachev,
virtually the same rating as Bush's and well up from 54 percent in
a Media General-AP poll in April 1988, before a summit between
Gorbachev and then-President Reagan.
   Moreover, Gorbachev was more popular than Bush _ an 85 percent
favorable rating, compared to Bush's 65 percent _ among respondents
with postgraduate educations. Gorbachev also outscored Reagan among
this group in 1988.
   In another measure of Gorbachev's strong position, 41 percent
said he has done more than Bush to ease East-West tensions, while
29 percent said Bush has done more. Thirty percent were unsure.
   The high regard for Gorbachev translated into a generally
optimistic view of his chances: Among the 77 percent who believed
he seeks meaningful reform in the Soviet Union, 60 percent expected
him to succeed, 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter
were unsure of the outcome.

   A new book on former House Speaker Jim Wright
recounts a private leadership meeting at which Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is said to
have made an anti-Semitic comment.
   House leadership officials were considering assigning Rep.
Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Wolpe, who is Jewish, had a background in international relations.
   But Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat, objected. ``You can't put
him there. There are already four kikes on that committee,'' he is
quoted as saying in the book, ``The Ambition and the Power.''
   A spokesman for Rostenkowski, Jim Jaffe, flatly denied that the
comment was made. But the book's author, John Barry, insists he had
several sources for the remark. ``I wouldn't have put something
like that in the book unless I were certain of it,'' he said.

   Vietnamese Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh
suffered a stroke and is hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City, it was
reported Wednesday.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified sources, said
Premier Do Muoi has temporarily taken over as party general
secretary.
   Linh, 72, was hospitalized first in Hanoi, the capital, then in
Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, after his return on Oct. 24 from
a visit to East Germany, Kyodo said, quoting sources in Hanoi.
   Kyodo quoted a Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
Linh had been in ill health, but was recuperating under doctors'
care.
   Linh, who became party leader in 1986, said in September that
capitalist-style economic reforms would continue in Vietnam, but he
rejected any multiparty system or speeding of democratic reforms.
   He accused the United States and other ``imperialists'' of
trying to undermine the socialist camp and launching ``frenzied
attacks against socialism.''

   A helicopter hauling equipment from a
mountain flipped over and crashed when a dangling cable snagged a
trailer, authorities said. A ski resort executive was killed and
five other people were injured.
   The pilot was critically injured and two passengers were
seriously hurt Tuesday, hospital officials said.
   The copter was clearing equipment and transporting people
following last week's World Cup races at the Park City Ski resort,
officials said.
   The helicopter had unloaded equipment and was taking off for
another run. Witnesses told police the copter's steel cable snagged
on a trailer, snapped and flew upward into the rotor, Police Chief
Frank Bell said.
   ``It came down upside down ... there was no fire and nobody on
the ground was injured,'' said Bell.
   Craig Badami, 37, of Park City, was killed. Badami was vice
president of marketing for Park City Ski Resort and director of the
World Cup competition.
   The helicopter came down near a ski lift, hurling metal
fragments 1,000 feet, Bell said. The ski run was not open for
public skiing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating.

<HEAD>Stonemason Invents Tombstones to Stand up Against Quakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stonemason has patented a tombstone designed to
keep standing through severe earthquakes, saving high replacement
costs in a country where elaborate, expensive markers reflect deep
respect for ancestors.
   ``My earthquake-proof tombstones can resist even a temblor as
strong as the Great Kanto Earthquake,'' said Toshihiko Nagoya, 41.
   The 1923 earthquake, estimated at 7.9 on the Richter scale,
destroyed much of Tokyo, then a city of 2 million people, and
killed 140,000. Tokyo's population is now 12 million.
   The new tombstone uses stainless steel poles implanted in the
center, and its parts are pressed together with Nagoya's special
glue. He tested it with the help of Tokyo University's seismology
department.
   Japan, sitting along a major geological fault, is hit by
hundreds of quakes annually, although most are too weak to be felt.
   The idea for the new tombstone came after Nagoya inspected the
wreckage of statues and tombstones _ some costing nearly $70,000 _
after a strong earthquake two years ago in Chiba, just outside
Tokyo.
   ``Almost everything was destroyed at many temples and graveyards
I visited,'' he said.
   More stunning was the death of a woman hit by a falling stone
lantern in the quake, measured at 6.6 on the Richter scale.
   The new quake-resistant tombstone would not cost much more than
the normal price of up to $35,000, he said. Existing tombstones can
be made quake-resistant for about $1,045, he added.

   Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas ``briefly
overran'' the home of a U.S. Embassy officer in the capital of El
Salvador today and attacked the residences of other embassy workers
as well, the Bush administration said today.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters the
guerrillas had been ``shooting their way into and invading certain
private homes'' in San Salvador, the capital.
   ``They briefly overran the home of a U.S. embassy officer but
were driven out by the Salvadoran armed forces,'' he told
reporters, also saying:
   ``It is our belief that all United States personnel and their
families are safe but several are in their homes in this area of
heavy fighting.''
   The guerillas burned a mansion blocks away from the official
residence of U.S. Ambassador William Walker.
   The early morning attacks were in the affluent Escalon
neighborhood, where the rebels last week took over a Sheraton
Hotel, entrapping six U.S. Green Berets during a 27-hour standoff
with government forces.
   It was not immediately clear if today's fighting signaled the
resumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that began
Nov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew Nov. 22.
   Residents of the affluent Escalon neighborhood said they heard
several loud explosions near the fortified complex between 2 a.m.
and 3 a.m.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater first announced the
attacks, saying he had little information, as he was being
questioned about reported harsh tactics in a crackdown by the
rightist government of U.S.-backed President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Asked about the raids by Cristiani's government on church and
labor offices, the arrests of civilians and other tactics of the
counteroffensive crackdown, Fitzwater said, ``Our response is that
we deplore violence and killing on both sides.''
   Pressed as to whether the administration had communicated any
concerns to the Cristiani government, he said, ``We have made our
views known to both sides publicly and privately that we are
opposed to the killing and the violence there.''
   President Bush has repeatedly voiced strong support for
Cristiani in the war against the Marxist rebels.
   For his part, Baker told reporters that, with regard to reports
of right-wing death squad activity, ``I think its important that
they do everything they can to get control of that kind of
activity.''
   Fitzwater appeared to take a softer approach today to the arrest
of Connecticut church worker, Jennifer J. Casolo, by the Salvadoran
police than on Monday when he had said ``there are indications''
that she was involved with a cache of weapons found buried in the
backyard of her residence in San Salvador.
   He said she would be charged with illegal explosives and weapons.
   When the police arrived at her house on Sunday, she telephoned
the U.S. consul general, Fitzwater said. A consular officer went
immediately to her home and stayed with her during her arrest and
through that night.
   Fitzwater said that during her four years in El Salvador, Miss
Casolo had become ``known to embassy ofifcials thorugh her work
with Christian education sminars and coordinating non ofifcial
delgations to El Salvador.
   ``We have been monitoring her case closely to assure she is well
treated. ... The embassy will continue to assure that she is given
every benefit due her under Salvadoran law.''

<HEAD>FCC Says Local Telephone Companies May Have to Refund $75 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local telephone companies may have to refund
as much as $75 million to long-distance companies and large
private-line business customers, the Federal Communications
Commission says.
   The local phone companies accumulated overcharges between 1985
and 1988 under FCC guidelines that allowed prices of these
high-capacity private-line services to exceed the phone companies'
costs of providing the services.
   The FCC ordered a refund Tuesday as it considered challenges to
the special pricing scheme, which the local phone companies provide
for long-distance companies or large business customers.
   The commission voted 4-0 that the scheme was legal during the
1985-88 period, when the high prices were designed to keep too many
customers from switching from the regular public telephone network
to private lines, but that market conditions today no longer
justified continuation of the special pricing.
   The commission said it expected the local phone companies to
refrain from requesting such special prices in the future.
   While it was examining the challenges to the special pricing
scheme, the commission said it found that local phone companies in
some cases had charged more than allowed under the commission's
guidelines. Therefore, the companies must refund those charges,
which could amount to as much as $75 million, the commission said.
   The FCC said the amount of the refunds will not be known until
the local phone companies file detailed reports with the
commission. The companies have 40 days to make their filings.
   The companies found not to be in compliance with the
commission's pricing guidelines from Oct. 1, 1985, to Dec. 31,
1986, were:
   Diamond State; South Central Bell in Alabama; Southwestern Bell
in Missouri and Oklahoma; Northwestern Bell in Iowa, Minnesota,
Nebraksa and North Dakota; and Pacific Northwest Bell in Idaho.
   Companies found not complying from Jan. 1, 1987, to Dec. 31,
1988, were:
   Ohio Bell; Wisconsin Bell; Southern Bell in North Carolina and
South Carolina; South Central Bell in Mississippi and Tennessee;
Pacific Bell; Nevada Bell; Southwestern Bell; Mountain Bell;
Northwestern Bell; and Cincinnati Bell.

   Fighting broke out in the
affluent western sectors of San Salvador again today, and U.S.
officials said leftist guerrillas briefly overran the home of an
American Embassy officer.
   The rebels also burned a mansion just blocks away from the
American ambassador's official residence, but no injuries were
reported to U.S. employees, according to the American officials.
   It was not immediately clear if the fighting signaled the
resumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that began
Nov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew on Nov.
22.
   The rebels said on their clandestine radio today they had
attacked the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with
mortars. But officers on the scene said none had fallen in the
compound, which also houses the Defense Ministry. Reporters saw at
least six dead soldiers in one neighborhood and one dead guerrilla
in another.
   Residents of the zone, in the capital's western sector, said
they heard several loud explosions near the fortified complex
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.
   Rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles at the
Public Security Academy in the western suburb of Merliot. Col.
Rigoberto Soto, director of the academy, said the attack was
repelled. He said his troops suffered no casualties but that a few
guerrillas appeared to have been wounded.
   Fighting continued to be heavy after daylight on the edge of the
affluent Escalon neighborhood, which reaches to the slopes of the
San Salvador volcano, a guerrilla stronghold.
   Wilfredo Hernandez, soundman of a crew of the Spanish language
network Univision, was wounded in the back in the fighting in upper
Escalon.
   Fighting was heavy at times before dawn along the tree-lined
streets of San Benito, a wealthy residential district where U.S.
Ambassador William Walker has his official residence. Guerrillas
burned a mansion just blocks from Walker's house. It was not
immediately known whether Walker was home at the time.
   Some of the homes attacked belonged to U.S. Embassy employees,
but all the Americans were reported safe, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in Washington.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III later told reporters in
Washington that the rebels were ``shooting their way into and
invading certain private homes. They briefly overran the home of a
U.S. Embassy officer but were driven out by the Salvadoran armed
forces.''
   Walker lives in the same neighborhood, Baker said.
   Baker also cited unconfirmed reports that the rebels also
invaded the Japanese embassy in San Salvador. He offered no further
details. ``It is our belief that all United States personnel and
their families are safe but several are in their homes in this area
of heavy fighting,'' he said.
   Guerrillas and soldiers of the U.S.-supported, rightist
government also exchanged fire in Guadalupe, south of the Chiefs of
Staff, where three light tanks were positioned across the street
from a movie theater.
   Helicopters and O-2 spotter aircraft fired machine guns and
rockets at suspected guerrilla positions west and south of the
capital for several hours before dawn. Reporters saw at least six
dead soldiers and a burned light tank on the edge of Escalon, and
one dead guerrilla near Guadalupe.
   Rebels last week assaulted Escalon and briefly took over the
blocks surrounding the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel.
   That attack marked the conclusion of what may have only been the
first phase of a massive rebel offensive launched Nov. 11, the
largest in the 10-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated
71,000 people.

   Nadia Comaneci, the Romanian gymnast
whose unprecedented perfect scores at the 1976 Olympics made sports
history, has fled to Hungary and asked for temporary settlement,
the state-run media said today.
   The report, by the MTI news agency, said Comaneci, who retired
from gymnastics in 1984, applied for a temporary settlement permit,
valid for three days at the police station in Szeged, 15 miles from
the Romanian border.
   An earlier MTI report, which quoted Hungarian radio, had said
Comaneci applied for asylum after crossing into Hungary by car
before dawn Tuesday together with six other Romanians, who were not
identified.
   She reportedly told Hungarian border guards that her escape had
been organized ``in advance under the guidance of a Romanian man,''
the news agency said without elaboration.
   The earlier report quoted her as saying she had left behind a
``neatly furnished flat, a car and financial security for the sake
of freedom.''
   Comaneci was quoted as saying she had been denied permission to
work abroad as a coach or even travel, in spite of numerous offers
and invitations. She has been planning a coaching and refereeing
career.
   An employee of the local radio station in the southern Hungary
town of Szeged said Comaneci checked into the Royal Hotel there,
spent the night and left this morning. The radio station employee
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An estimated 25,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians
complaining of discrimination, have fled to Hungary in the past two
years seeking refuge from chronic hardships under the regime of
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Comaneci, 27, an ethnic Romanian, astounded the world as a
petite, solemn 14-year-old, turning in a series of perfect 10
scores and winning three gold medals at the Montreal games.
   Her former coach, ethnic Hungarian Bela Karoly, defected with
his wife in March 1981 while on a tour of 15 American cities with
the Romanian gymnastics team. He became a U.S. citizen last spring
and coaches American gymnasts.
   ``I'm happy finally she made the step which would lead to a free
life, what she fully deserves,'' Karoly told The Associated Press
today in a telephone interview from Clarens, Switzerland.
   Comaneci ``is still a big personality in Romania, (and) she has
nothing against the Romanian population, but just like me she was
chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' Karoly
said.
   Karoly said he would ``warmly and honestly'' urge her to go to
the United States. ``It is still the country with the greatest
respect for Nadia and at the same time a country still with the
greatest opportunity,'' he said.
   Comaneci is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the
first gymnast to receive a perfect score in a major international
tourney. During her carreer, she collected 21 gold medals, 12 of
them for Olympic and world titles.

<HEAD>Israelis: No Intervention Even if Syrians Attack Aoun</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lebanon, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Despite a long history of supporting Lebanese
Christians, Israeli officials say they won't intervene this time to
defend Christian Gen. Michel Aoun from Syrian attack.
   The bitter experience of Israel's occupation of Lebanon from
1982-85 is largely responsible for the change in policy.
   However, the Israelis have issued new warnings to Syria about
making moves they say would endanger Israel's security and its
northern border.
   For example, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, the Israeli air force
chief, said on armed forces radio Wednesday that surprise flights
by Syrian warplanes over Lebanese territory where Israelis
routinely patrol could lead to clashes.
   Referring to reports that a Syrian MiG-23 had buzzed Aoun's
presidential palace in Baabda, Bin-Nun said: ``There is no doubt
that entrances like this to Lebanon can result in a clash, even
unwanted.''
   He hinted at diplomatic contacts to prevent greater tensions and
said, ``We are trying to make sure that the Lebanese do not get us
involved in a war that we don't intend, and we hope we will succeed
in that.''
   Israel has insisted it needs a clear view from Lebanon's
airspace to protect its border from attacks by Palestinian and
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas. It also has used the skies
to launch 15 air raids on guerrilla targets this year.
   Officials have said Israel would not tolerate Syrian troops
moving south of Sidon and the Awali river, about 25 miles north of
Israel's border, or into areas Israel evacuated in June 1985 at the
end of the three-year occupation. Those areas include the Bekaa
Valley.
   The occupation produced a consensus that is strongly against
renewed Israeli involvement. The war cost the lives of 650 Israeli
soldiers, damaged Israel's image abroad and caused deep political
splits at home.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982 following clashes in which
Israeli troops went to the defense of Christian militiamen being
attacked by Syrian forces.
   Israel threw its military backing and political support to
Bashir Gemayel, a Christian militia chief. But Gemayel was
assassinated in 1982, reportedly with Syrian involvement, and
Israel's hopes for a friendly Lebanese government were undone.
   The Christian militia's refusal to play a major role in driving
out Palestinian guerrillas also caused deep resentment in Israel's
army.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said last week that
Israel had no plans to intervene in the current standoff between
Aoun and Syrian troops unless its own security was threatened.
   ``As a matter of principle and policy, we do not involve
ourselves in Lebanon, as long as there is no Syrian threat or other
threat along our northern border,'' he said.
   One senior Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Israel would not support Aoun just because he was a Christian
leader.
   ``We are tired of backing losers in Lebanon,'' the official said.
   However, there was lingering support among some Israelis for
Aoun's anti-Syria campaign, especially in the right-wing led by
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Rafael Eytan, a former chief of staff and now a member of
parliament, said Wednesday that Israel should support Aoun.
   He said Syrian gains in Lebanon ``will bring increased pressure
on us in southern Lebanon,'' where Israel still supports a
2,500-member Christian-led militia known as the South Lebanon Army.

   Bomb squad officers at the airport today blew
up a Colombia-bound suitcase thought to contain explosives, only to
discover the bag contained nothing more dangerous than a video
game, police said.
   ``It wasn't an explosive device. It was a Nintendo game,'' said
Lt. Helen Kidder.
   X-rays at Los Angeles International Airport had detected what
appeared to be sticks of dynamite, wiring and a clock inside the
suitcase, which was to have been loaded onto an Avianca Airlines
jet bound for Colombia, police said.
   ``Our bomb squad acted on that information and we exploded it in
the canister,'' said Officer Bill Frio.
   There were no reports of threats against the flight, police said.
   On Monday, an Avianca jet exploded near Bogota, Colombia,
killing all 107 people aboard. Drug traffickers in Colombia have
waged a campaign of bombings there, but investigators have raised
doubts about whether terrorists caused the blast.
   ``This got more publicity because of the Avianca jet
explosion,'' Frio said of today's incident.

<HEAD>Shell Agrees to $19.75 Million Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil has agreed to pay $19.75
million in penalties and compensation for a 1988 spill of more than
400,000 gallons of crude oil that fouled a scenic waterway near San
Francisco, the mayor says.
   Mayor Mike Menesini said Tuesday the agreement is the largest
oil spill settlement in California history.
   ``It provides a clear warning that harm to our environment will
not be tolerated,'' he said.
   The spill fouled a 15-mile stretch of the Carquinez Strait
shoreline and a marsh next to Shell's refinery. It killed at least
300 birds and animals.
   Menesini said Shell will pay $11 million to restore damaged
wetlands and an additional $4.7 million in civil penalties for
violating federal rules in allowing the oil to bypass a collection
dike and pour into the waterway 40 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   The settlement also will pay for such things as environmental
studies of the affected areas and restoration of the fishing
industry.
   The oil company admitted that it illegally allowed storm water
to drain from the top of a 12.5 million gallon oil storage tank,
and that oil leaked through a flexible pipe in the middle of the
tank and made its way into the waterway.
   Shell had ignored a federal requirement to monitor the drainage
system before making discharges, allong discharges to go directly
into state waters.
   Additional settlement details were to be released at a news
conference in San Francisco this afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Regulations that ban panhandling in the subway
system violate the constitutional rights of homeless people who may
need to beg to survive, according to a lawsuit filed by advocates
for the homeless.
   The class-action lawsuit brought Tuesday in U.S. District Court
challenges ``Operation Enforcement,'' a recent drive by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to enforce existing rules,
including the prohibition on panhandling.
   The lawsuit charged that the ban on begging singles out the
homeless because it allows other people to solicit contributions
for charitable, religious and political causes.
   ``The intended purpose is simply to roust the homeless and needy
from the subways,'' the lawsuit said.
   The regulation violates the First and 14th Amendment rights of
the homeless, it charged.
   ``To deny them this exercise of free speech is to deny them the
means to survive, for they spend the money they ask for on the very
necessities of life, that is, on food, shelter, clothing,
transportation and medicine,'' the lawsuit said.
   The plaintiffs are two homeless men who panhandle in the subway
system. The lawsuit, brought by the Legal Action Center for the
Homeless, was filed on behalf of all homeless people in the state.
   The defendants are the MTA and two of its agencies, the Transit
Authority and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
   ``We don't believe it's a constitutional right to panhandle, but
it's an obvious issue for the courts to decide,'' said MTA
spokesman Tito Davila.
   The lawsuit seeks a court order barring the MTA from enforcing
the ban on panhandling. A hearing is scheduled Friday before Judge
Leonard Sand.

<HEAD>World Has Changed Since Last US-Soviet Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the year since Mikhail S. Gorbachev last
met with a U.S. president, the Soviet leader's world has turned
topsy-turvy, with a legislature challenging him at home and
demonstrators chasing Communist regimes from power in Eastern
Europe.
   On the U.S. side, the change is less striking: Simply the man at
the top.
   As George Bush prepares for his first meeting as president with
Gorbachev, the world overseas appears to be changing at a faster
pace than at any time since World War II, when President Franklin
D. Roosevelt began the practice of sitting down for a summit with
the Soviet leader, at that time Josef Stalin.
   Since the most recent superpower summit on Dec. 7, 1988, when
Gorbachev met with President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in
New York, Poland has formed the first non-Communist government in
the Soviet bloc, Hungary has scrapped its Communist Party, East
Germany has opened the Berlin Wall, Bulgaria has dumped its
longtime Communist boss, and the Czechoslovakian Communist Party
has surrendered its monopoly on power.
   Only Romania, long a maverick in the Warsaw Pact, has remained
cold to the thaw started by Gorbachev after he rose to power in
March 1985.
   For years the Soviets complained about what they perceived as
the tumult of the U.S. electoral process, with presidential
balloting every four years and congressional races every two
clouding the rare air of geopolitics.
   Now the United States seems tranquil compared to the
free-for-all in the Communist world.
   Bush, under pressure to respond to changes in the Soviet bloc,
scheduled the meeting with Gorbachev off the Mediterranean isle of
Malta this weekend. He has also begun planning for a military
cutback.
   He would be hard put to keep pace with the revolution in Eastern
Europe.
   In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was embarrassed in
elections last March, the most democratic legislature in 72 years
of Soviet history is learning to stand up to the government and the
party, and ethnic unrest has shaken the country from the Baltic Sea
to Central Asia.
   On the international front, Bush administration officials, like
their predecessors, are complaining that Soviet surrogates
Nicaragua and Cuba are exporting revolution to El Salvador.
   Closer to Moscow, Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan last
February, but the Kremlin-backed government there remains in power.
The president of the U.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government in
exile, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, on Monday said he wants Bush to
pressure Gorbachev to end support for the ``puppet government'' and
reach a political accord with the resistance.
   In arms control, many hurdles have been cleared, but the
superpowers have not finalized deals to cut nuclear, conventional
and chemical weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of
State James A. Baker III last September in Wyoming that the Kremlin
was removing two major obstacles to a proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START) to reduce long-range superpower nuclear
weapons by up to 50 percent.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviets were withdrawing the precondition
that America abandon its Star Wars strategic defense initiative. He
also said the Soviets were seeking a separate agreement to limit
submarine-launched cruise missiles, rather than include them in
START.
   But the Soviets have been pressing for talks to curb the might
of the U.S. Navy, and want to ban the submarine cruise missiles
within that framework.
   Although changes have been more slow and orderly in the United
States, they have occurred. Bush has replaced Reagan as president
and after months of skepticism appears to have embraced Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Bush's apparent uncertainty prompted Democrats, led by Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, to label the Republican
president as ``timid'' in responding to Gorbachev.
   Bush's backers claim he has been playing a cool hand,
alternating his public hesitation with careful preparation and
brilliant masterstrokes.
   He was heavily criticized for not replying in kind to
Gorbachev's surprise announcement, before his last summit with
Reagan, that he was unilaterally withdrawing 50,000 troops from
Eastern Europe and cutting the Red Army by 500,000.
   Then Bush proposed last May that the two alliances agree within
a year to make sharp cuts that would eliminate the Warsaw Pact
numerical advantage.
   Now the alliances appear near an agreement under which the
United States would reduce its forces in Central Europe by 30,000,
and the Soviets by ten times that many.
   Before the Oct. 31 announcement that he would meet with
Gorbachev in Malta, Bush was criticized for not seeking a summit.
Bush says, and the Soviets have not disagreed, that he first
requested the meeting after he traveled to Poland and Hungary last
July and met with reform leaders who urged him to consult
face-to-face with the Soviet leader.

   Army experts safely defused a
bomb a police inspector found under his car Wednesday, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary said.
   The bomb contained one pound of a plastic explosive, a police
spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   The inspector, who was not identified, found the bomb during a
routine search of his car that all police officers are supposed to
make before driving.
   No group claimed responsibility for planting the bomb.
   In nearby Lisburn, 37 families were evacuated from their homes
Wednesday while army experts defused a bomb found in a hijacked
taxi, police said.
   A spokesman said police received a telephone call from someone
claiming to be a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed
Protestant group, alerting them to the bomb.
   The bomb contained a small quantity of explosives, he said.

<HEAD>Goldwater Says He's Feeling Fine Following Hip Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater was released
Wednesday from a hospital where he underwent hip replacement
surgery earlier this month. He said he feels fine.
   ``If I don't run out of parts, I'll probably be here the rest of
my life,'' said Goldwater, 80, referring to St. Luke's Medical
Center, where he has had several major reconstructive surgeries.
   Goldwater has suffered from degenerative arthritis of his hips
and knees since his early 60s.
   The Nov. 14 surgery replaced an artificial right hip he received
in 1975. Goldwater had had similar surgery on his left hip in June,
and had previously had his left knee replaced.
   Goldwater's ``high level of activity'' wore on the original
artifical hip, said his orthopedic surgeon, Anthony K. Hedley.
   Hedley said Goldwater would receive therapy at his suburban
Paradise Valley home and probably would be able to walk aided only
by a cane by early next year. Goldwater's daughter would stay with
him for a few weeks, Hedley said.
   ``I want him to get back to doing exactly what he wants to do,''
Hedley said.
   Hedley said Goldwater's hips wouldn't need further replacement.
   Goldwater, who retired from the Senate in 1987 following five
terms, appeared relaxed in his wheelchair as he was questioned
about world affairs and whether he thought his style of ``shooting
from the hip'' was responsible for his medical troubles.
   ``When I shot from the hip, I fanned. I didn't get any recoil,''
Goldwater joked.

   A watch factory that produces a popular timepiece
called the ``Slava'' _ coincidentally the name of the Soviet

commemorative watch.
   A small number of the watches were being sent to Malta to be
handed out as souvenirs to participants in the summit meeting
aboard Soviet and U.S. ships off the Mediterranean island of Malta,
the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   Moscow's Watch Factory No. 2 also is manufacturing a larger
number of various Slava watches to be sold in allied countries,
Italy, the United States, France, Singapore and other countries.
   The center of the watch, shown in a picture in the newspaper,
displayes the blue and white flag of the Soviet navy.
   Soviet watches, including those made by the Moscow factory, have
become a popular fashion item in many Western countries, including
Italy.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began a visit to Italy on
Wednesday that precedes the two-day summit meeting off Malta with
President Bush. Gorbachev will have one day of meetings with Bush
on the Soviet warship Slava.

   Coast Guard rescuers searching for five lobstermen
moved farther out to sea Wednesday following a trail of distress
flares that appeared two nights in a row.
   Three aircraft and two cutters were searching a
10,000-square-mile area about 270 miles southeast of Nantucket,
Coast Guard spokesman Steven Aitkins said.
   The rescuers shifted their search after spotting a flare Tuesday
night about 60 miles east of where a flare was seen the night
before, Aitkins said.
   Coast Guard officials were not discounting the possibility that
the flares came from different sources, Aitkins said, adding, ``We
didn't find an origin for either one.''
   The last transmission of the 72-foot Heidi Marie, out of
Stonington, Conn., was Nov. 21.
   Since then, the Coast Guard has found the boat's emergency
signal device and other debris, but no other sign of the crew.

<TEXT>
   A decision to enforce an 11-year-old health
ordinance on a charitable group's functions has members scrambling
to provide a Christmas meal for thousands of hungry Houston
residents.
   Last week, the Health Department started requiring the Citywide
Club of Clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to
the public to be prepared at a city-approved kitchen, just in time
to cause problems for the group's annual Thanksgiving feast for the
needy.
   The private, non-profit community service organization has
relied heavily in the past on donations of home-prepared food _
turkey, hams, dressing, vegetables, desserts, relishes _ to pull
off its annual Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, club Director
Leroy Woodward said Tuesday.
   Last week, because of the new enforcement, volunteers faced with
a record 60,000 people for Thanksgiving ran out of food three or
four times, and only the hasty barbecuing of 500 chickens saved the
day, he said.
   ``Now you can't get through our main telephone lines because of
all the needy people calling up to make reservations for our annual
Christmas feast on Dec. 23,'' said Woodward. ``And we're scared.
We're afraid we're not going to be able to feed all these folks.''
   Joe Zuchlewski, a health department official, was unable to
explain why the group wasn't required to meet the ordinance until
this year.
   ``We appreciate all the work that the Citywide Club is doing in
feeding all these people but, by the same token, we want to make
sure the food is safe,'' said Zuchlewski. ``We're just trying to
protect the public.''
   Health department officials will gladly work with club members
to make sure they know how to conduct their feast according to
regulations, Zuchlewski said.
   ``There are all kinds of items that can be donated that will
satisfy people on the street and satisfy the health code,''
Zuchlewski said. The department cited such things as canned
vegetables or frozen turkeys.
   Woodward is worried, but he hesitates to slam the health
department.
   ``They gave us their reason and we understand. If people even
put harmful things in trick or treat candy, we understand the
potential problem of letting people bring prepared food,'' he said.
   ``But even though we understand, we're still left with the
problem of feeding all those hungry people.''
   In addition to feeding the hungry and needy, the club last year
distributed 12,000 donated toys to children and registered more
than 7,000 people for jobs and housing.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today the United States and Soviet Union should seek ``mutual
advantage'' from the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, and hinted
that President Bush would back improved Soviet trade opportunities
at this weekend's superpower summit.
   At the same time, Baker said the two days of talks between Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev are ``not an arms control
summit.''
   At a White House news conference on the day before Bush's
departure for a shipboard summit off Malta, Baker also said the
continued flow of Soviet-made arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador
and the Afghanistan government amounted to a ``Cold War relic.''
   He stressed in a prepared statement and in reply to questions
that U.S.-Soviet relations were on the upswing, and that U.S.
support for Gorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, program to
reform the Soviet economy was firm.
   Baker said it would be a mistake not to support the reform
movement sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe even if there
is a chance the pace may bring some temporary instability.
   ``The real question is not whether perestroika will succeed or
fail,'' he said. ``The real question is this: Do you engage the
Soviet Union in a search for mutual advantage in this time of
uncertainty. And our answer to that question is a resounding
`yes.'''
   Hardline Communist governments have been removed from power in
recent weeks in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, in
addition to the changes that moved through Poland and Hungary
earlier in the year.
   Gorbachev has expressed fears that the changes within the Soviet
bloc would be exploited by the West. But in a nationally televised
speech last Wednesday night, Bush offered ``our assurance that
America welcomes reform, not as an adversary seeking advantage but
as a people offering support.''
   Baker broadly hinted that Bush would offer to support Soviet
participation in the international group known as GATT _ the
General Agrement on Tariffs and Trade _ that would make it easier
for the Soviets to trade with other countries.
   Baker said the issue definitely was on the president's summit
agenda, but he did not want to pre-empt Bush's discussion with
Gorbachev. And he said the success or failure of the summit
depended on no single issue.
   Baker spoke as Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said the
Bush administration needs ``a more meaningful response'' to the new
political climate in the Soviet Union and urged the president to
press for movement on trade and arms control at the summit.
   ``While I welcome the administration's offer to provide
technical advice to the Soviet Union, I believe a more meaningful
response is necessary,'' the Maine Democrat told a news conference.
He again called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions aimed at
the Soviets under the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment.
   Baker used his pre-summit appearance before reporters to take a
hard line on Central America, and to rule out a deal in which the
United States would cut off its assistance to rebels in Afghanistan.
   Baker's remarks about El Salvador, where rebels recently renewed
their offense against the government, and Soviet support for
Afghanistan and Cambodia contrasted with an otherwise warm stance
toward Moscow.
   Baker said Soviet behavior in regional conflicts contrasts
sharply with the pattern of its conduct in Eastern Europe.
   ``The continuing pattern of Soviet arms shipments to Moscow's
Third World clients is especially disturbing ... This pattern is a
Cold War relic,'' he said.
   Baker said that if Gorbachev can promote perestroika and foster
new thinking in Eastern Europe, he can also stop ``throwing fuel on
the fire'' in El Salvador.
   Baker spoke as sources said the U.S. budget squeeze may force
Bush to confront a proposed armed forces cutback even as he
reassures the allies he will not cut a military deal with Gorbachev
behind their backs at the summit.
   On Bush's desk before his takeoff Thursday evening for the
Mediterranean could be a recommendation from Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to trim the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps by
275,000, or 12.9 percent from current levels, defense sources told
The Associated Press on Tuesday night.
   The Army would be reduced by 135,000, the Air Force by 100,000
and the Navy and Marine Corps by 40,000 under a proposal from the
U.S. armed services chiefs, said the sources, who declined to be
identified.
   Cheney will find the recommendation on his own desk when he
flies home from Europe early Thursday. The cuts would be carried
out by 1994, and would involve the elimination of three army combat
divisions, five and a fraction Air Force fighter wings and about 60
naval vessels, the sources said.
   The fleet includes 562 vessels, and the idea would be to reduce
to about 500 by 1994.
   If Cheney accepts the recommendation, he would take it to the
president before his departure for the summit. Richard Darman, the
director of the Office of Management and Budget, is pushing for
even deeper cutbacks in the U.S. military, the sources said.
   It was not clear whether the president would make a decision
before his takeoff, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
declined comment today on the matter.
   He said the president planned to spend most of the day in
preparation for the summit, and would also discuss the summit at
some length at a private dinner at the White House tonight for
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   The spokesman also said that Bush had discussed the summit today
by phone with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They also
discussed Kohl's new proposal for the reunification of Germany, the
spokesman said.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell on
Wednesday said the Bush administration needs ``a more meaningful
response'' to the new political climate in the Soviet Union and
urged the president to press for movement on trade and arms control
at the summit.
   ``While I welcome the administration's offer to provide
technical advice to the Soviet Union, I believe a more meaningful
response is necessary,'' Mitchell told a news conference. He again
called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions.
   Mitchell said the ``American people are united in support of
President Bush as he travels to this important meeting.'' And he
added that Bush was right in his approach concerning possible
discussion of arms control and military forces with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the summit off Malta.
   He expressed hope that Bush would reaffirm his commitment to a
START treaty.
   Mitchell said the administration should say clearly it will
abide by the 1972 ABM treaty and ``abandon the view that it can
reserve the right to unilaterally change the terms of a treaty
limiting strategic defenses while seeking to conclude a binding
agreement limiting strategic offenses.''
   He said that ``concluding the current conventional negotiations
under way in Vienna has assumed even greater importance in light of
the changes taking place in Eastern Europe.''
   On trade, Mitchell said the Bush administration should forget
its offer to provide technical assistance to the Soviets. ``They've
not requested that,'' Mitchell said.
   ``But we should demonstrate our willingness to move toward a
trade relationship based on market principles rather than political
proscriptions,'' Mitchell said.
   He reiterated his suggestion of last May that the administration
should grant a trial waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which
restricts trade with the Soviets to bring pressure on Moscow for
freer emigration policies.
   He said Moscow's loosening of emigration curbs over the last few
years justifies such a move.
   Mitchell also urged Bush to propose talks aimed at reaching a
commercial trade agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said in response to a question that such an agreement would
not result in any quick upturn in imports from the Soviet Union.
``The reason is very simple. There's very little produced in the
Soviet Union that Americans would be interested in buying. They do
not have a competitive economy and I think they realize this.''
   Meanwhile, 15 senators urged Bush to raise the issue of
political rights of Baltic peoples at the summit.
   ``This is of vital importance to the safety and security of both
of our nations, as well as to our allies in Europe,'' said a
statement issued by the office of Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis.
   The lawmakers called on Bush to tell Gorbachev that economic
assistance and trade with the United States must be linked with
progress toward democracy in the Baltic states.

<HEAD>Interior Reportedly Ready to OK California Water Leases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan tentatively
has decided to renew long-term water leases for irrigation in
central California, but the Bush administration remains divided on
how to ease environmental concerns over the leases, administration
sources said Wednesday.
   Objections from the White House prompted Lujan to delay
announcement of the lease renewal plan on Tuesday, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for the
secretary disputed suggestions that the White House had blocked the
decision, but acknowledged that the lease announcement was
postponed.
   ``We wanted a unified administration position on this issue. If
delaying the process a few days will help us reach that, it's that
much the better,'' said Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein. He
added, ``The decision is the secretary's to make.''
   The renewal of the California water contracts, one of the
thorniest water issues in the West, has developed into a major
environmental test for the Bush administration, with critics of the
40-year leases arguing that they should not be renewed at current
water supply levels and for such a lengthy duration.
   According to administration sources, Lujan earlier this week
decided to renew the leases without first requiring completion of a
formal environmental review. Lujan's plan called for initiating an
environmental assessment as part of the lease renewal plan, the
sources said.
   But the proposal ran into trouble at the White House after
Michael Deland, chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, objected to the ``fine print'' of the
proposed environmental review, according to the administration
sources.
   Deland reportedly maintained that the environmental review
suggested by Lujan was meaningless because it would have had no
effect on key provisions of the renewed water contracts, such as
length of the lease or volume of water being supplied.
   Deland raised the objections with White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu, the sources said.
   Goldstein, the Interior spokesman, denied that Lujan's proposal
had been blocked by the White House. He said that while there were
some concerns from the Council on Environmental Quality, the delay
resulted from legal questions and technical wording raised by the
Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget.
   Environmentalists have filed a lawsuit against the Interior
Department, arguing federal environmental laws require a formal
assessment of the environmental impact of such long-term leases
before they are renewed. The Environmental Protection Agency also
has argued no leases should be renewed until such an assessment is
made and the Council on Environmental Quality earlier this year
sided with the EPA.
   The leases, which are expected to expire over the next year,
provide more than 1.5 million acre-feet of federal water annually
to irrigation districts across a broad expanse of central
California.
   Lujan decided in April to proceed with renewing one of the
leases providing water to the Orange Cove Irrigation District in
eastern San Joaquin Valley for 40 years without an environmental
study.
   That brought sharp criticism from environmentalists.
   Legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would
block any further lease renewals unless an environmental impact
study is performed. A federal judge in California warned that any
lease renewals will be subject to his eventual decision on the
lawsuit brought by the environmentalists.
   The long-term irrigation leases are expiring at a time when
California is struggling to develop new water distribution and
water quality protection plans. Disputes over water has pitted
Northern Californians against those in the southern part of the
state, and urban users against farmers.
   There has been concern about how the diversions will affect
water quality, soil conditions and fish and wildlife habitat if
such long-term diversions are allowed to continue. Critics also
argue that the large water diversions have kept farmers from
conserving water when growing urban centers are worried about
future water shortages.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Parks Legislation for Colorado, Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday
clearing the way for expansion of the Rocky Mountain National Park
in Colorado and helping create an interpretive center for three
national historic trails in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
   Part of the 515 acres being added to the park are a migratory
route to winter ranges for deer and elk. Some of the land had been
eyed for a housing development. Other portions now lie within the
Roosevelt National Forest, which will cede the land to the Rocky
Mountain National Park.
   The government expects the 515 acres to be donated for the
265,000-acre park 65 miles north of Denver, which draws 3 million
visitors annually.
   A separate measure signed by Bush authorizes federal help of up
to $8.4 million to develop the interpretive center in Council
Bluffs near the Lewis and Clark, Oregon and Mormon Pioneer trails.
   The legislation requires that every $2 in federal funds be
matched with $1 in non-federal funds. The Bush administration had
opposed federal participation in building the center, which will
not be located on a historic site. No funds have yet been
appropriated to carry out the plans.
   Bush signed both bills without comment.

   Peter MacDonald, suspended chairman of the Navajo
tribe, pleaded innocent to corruption charges today in tribal court.
   The 60-year-old leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe was
charged Oct. 11 by special prosecutors hired by the tribe with 107
offenses, including conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and
election-law violations.
   MacDonald, who was suspended by the Navajo Tribal Council three
months ago, also is the target of a federal grand jury
investigation and a defendant in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
filed by the 225,000-member tribe.
   The lawsuit and the bulk of the criminal charges focus on the
tribe's purchase of an Arizona ranch for $7.2 million more than the
sellers had paid for it hours earlier.
   The tribe's prosecutors also filed charges against the suspended
vice chairman, Johnnie R. Thompson, and MacDonald's son, Peter
MacDonald Jr. Thompson has pleaded innocent to 15 election-law
violations; the younger MacDonald was to be arraigned later today.
   MacDonald, who three years ago was inaugurated for a fourth term
in a lavish ceremony attended by dignitaries in rented limousines,
is pleading poverty and has asked for a court-appointed defense
attorney.
   On Monday, Tribal Judge Robert Yazzie rejected the request,
saying MacDonald is ``far better off financially than all but a
handful of Navajos,'' but gave MacDonald until today to provide
more evidence that he's indigent.
   McDonald appeared at his arraignment today without an attorney
and did not press his request. ``I'm still in the process of trying
to retain counsel. ... I can find one,'' he told Yazzie as the
arraignment began.
   Prosecutors said MacDonald has a net worth of more than $400,000
in addition to the $55,000 annual salary he still draws while on
paid administrative leave.
   Allegations emerged in testimony before a special U.S. Senate
committee in January that MacDonald personally profited from the
tribe's 1987 purchase of the 491,000-acre Big Boquillas Ranch.
   The tribe paid Byron T. Brown and K. Tom Tracey, two longtime
friends of MacDonald, $33.4 million for the ranch soon after they
had purchased it for $26.2 million.
   Brown told the Senate panel that MacDonald received $50,000 plus
vacation trips and lease of a BMW automobile.
   In August, the tribe filed a $24 million lawsuit in state court
against MacDonald and others over the ranch purchase. Meanwhile, a
federal grand jury investigation has been under way for at least a
year.
   MacDonald has strongly denied the allegations.
   At a news conference the day after the complaint was filed,
MacDonald promised to ``stand up and fight.'' He reiterated his
contention that the federal government wanted to oust him and other
strong Indian leaders so it could have easier access to minerals
and other natural resources on reservations.
   Attempts to reach MacDonald on Tuesday were unsuccessful. His
Flagstaff residence has an unlisted telephone.
   MacDonald was acquitted of federal fraud and income tax evasion
charges in 1977, six years after he began his first term as
chairman. He lost a re-election bid to Peterson Zah in 1982 but
regained the office with a 750-vote victory over Zah four years
later.
   His latest problems began after the U.S. Senate Select Committee
on Indian Affairs' hearings on his financial dealings.
   Several witnesses, including his son, testified that bribes and
kickbacks were an accepted way of doing business on the Navajo
Reservation.
   A month later, he was placed on administrative leave by the
88-member Tribal Council.
   Sporadic violence followed, culminating in a July clash between
police and about 300 club-wielding MacDonald supporters in Window
Rock. Tribal police shot and killed two of MacDonald's supporters,
and nine other people were injured.
   Leonard Haskie, the interim tribal chairman, blamed MacDonald
for the violence, saying he could have prevented it had he wanted.
MacDonald, however, blamed the police, saying they overreacted to a
peaceful demonstration by his supporters.

   Hundreds of students packed their
belongings and left campus Wednesday after authorities closed
Copperbelt University to end violent protests, the second school to
close in Zambia this month.
   Students were ordered to leave the university in Kitwe, 225
miles north of Lusaka, by nightfall, campus officials said.
   Students were expected to return after the Christmas vacation, a
campus spokesman said.
   The decision to shut down the campus ahead of the vacation came
after several days of unrest in which students stoned cars and
buildings and assaulted teaching staff to protest low food
allowances, said the spokesman.
   On Monday, rampaging students dragged vice chancellor Mubanga
Kashoki from his office and forced him to stand on the roof of his
car and address protesters gathered in a parking lot.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   The students demanded that their food allowances of about $166 a
term be more than doubled to match allowances received by privately
sponsored students.
   Zambia's main university campus in Lusaka was closed Nov. 23
after 3,000 state-sponsored students looted food stores and
boycotted class.

   The army Wednesday recaptured the
strategic border town of Kurmuk from southern rebels, military
officials said.
   The armed forces General Command said Kurmuk was retaken in ``a
swift and fierce battle with the rebels, who have suffered heavy
material and human losses.''
   Heavy fighting continued late into the afternoon and government
soldiers were chasing rebels around the town, on the border with
Ethiopia.
   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army and government
officials are to begin peace talks in Nairobi, Kenya, on Dec. 1.
   ``Despite this important military victory, the Sudanese people
and the army are still committed to peace,'' they said.
   The armed forces view the negotiations ``with seriousness ...
and hope that the current peace efforts will succeed,'' the rebels
said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Brig. Osman Ahmed Osman told about 1,000
student demonstrators loyal to the government that the army would
retake Karmuk by the end of the day.
   Rebels seized the garrison town Oct. 28 in the first major
breach of a cease-fire in effect since April.
   The students marched from Khartoum University to the nearby
General Command and cheered the government.
   A student representative said in a speech that they were ready
to join the civilian militia the government recently formed to help
the military.
   ``The students want peace based on the strength of the rifle ...
not peace at the expense of dignity and identity of the Sudan,''
the unidentified student said.
   He praised the military, which overthrew the elected government
of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi June 30.
   Military leader Lt. Col. Omar Hassan el-Bashir blamed el-Mahdi's
government for the 6{-year-old civil war and the East African
nation's deteriorating economy. A 15-member ruling military junta
disbanded Sudan's political parties and imprisoned many political
leaders.
   The rebel movement, which is predominantly Christian or animist,
took up arms in 1983, demanding greater autonomy in the South.
   Moslem fundamentalists have dominated Sudan's government and
universities.

<HEAD>Study Finds Scarcity of Programs to Fully Use Older Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American employers value the dependability and
loyalty of older workers but most do little to recruit or retain
these employees or to help them adapt to new technologies,
according to a private report released Wednesday.
   The study found ``a real gap between the positive attitudes
being expressed ... and the actual mechanisms and practices that
are now in place to utilize older workers,'' said David Meer of the
Daniel Yankelovich Group, a research company.
   The report, commissioned by the American Association of Retired
Persons, was based on telephone interviews with executives at 400
businesses and on ``focus group'' discussions among employees age
50 and older.
   Seventy-nine percent of the surveyed executives reported their
companies were ``finding ways to leverage the experience of older
workers,'' but other research data ``did not support this success
in tapping older workers' skills,'' the study said.
   Many older workers, meanwhile, see themselves as an untapped
resource and feel frustrated about the scarcity of programs to help
them contribute more on the job, the report said.
   ``When discussing their work situation, ... older employees seem
fearful,'' it said. ``They believe they are vulnerable, even
disposable.''
   Skills-training programs for older workers had been adopted by
just three in 10 companies surveyed, the same proportion as in a
similar 1985 study, and one-fourth of businesses had a formal
commitment to fully use older workers, down from one-third in 1985,
it found.
   ``One of the most disturbing findings of this study is the
reported decline in senior management's formal commitment to
utilizing older workers,'' the report said.
   Unless more is done to help older workers adapt,
``non-technologically oriented older workers could find themselves
shut out of rewarding, well-paying positions,'' the report said.
   Meer predicted that growing labor shortages in the 1990s will
force businesses to adopt new ways to integrate older workers into
the workforce.
   ``This will require new approaches to the way work is organized,
the types of jobs that are available, the ability to have part-time
work that is knowledge-based and not just service-oriented,'' he
said.
   AARP Executive Director Horace Deets said the report indicates
businesses are shedding stereotypes of older people as being afraid
of change, unreliable and unable to learn new tasks, but many
companies ``have not translated that into action by hiring and
retraining older workers.''
   Deets said the message for older workers was:
   ``You have to take the initiative to seek training and maintain
needed skills. An older worker can't wait for an employer to make
the first move.''
   The study found that businesses give older workers high ratings
on characteristics such as attendance, punctuality, reliability,
commitment to quality and loyalty. For example, 89 percent of
employers rated their older workers as excellent or very good in
commitment to quality.
   Older employees got their lowest marks on feeling comfortable
with new technologies, such as computers, with just 22 percent of
the businesses rating their older workers as excellent or very good
in that category.
   Executives at the largest companies were prone to give older
workers less credit for their work habits and to be more critical
of their ability to adapt to technology, the report said.
   The report said that in addition to questions about older
workers' adaptability to new technology, businesses also show
growing concern about the cost to employ older workers,
particularly to provide them with health insurance. It also found
increasing use of early retirement programs to reduce costs.

   Randy Kraft was sentenced to the gas
chamber today for strangling 16 young men during a 12-year spree of
sexual torture and mutilation.
   ``Burn in hell, Kraft!'' one of the victims' relatives shouted
as Kraft was led from court. ``Turn around and look!'' the relative
shouted.
   The 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant was convicted of
murder in May after a 10{-month trial. In August the jury
recommended the death penalty, and Superior Court Judge Donald A.
McCartin today agreed.
   The judge recounted one of Kraft's slayings, which included
cigarette lighter torture, castration and mutilation, and said, `If
anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming.''
   Kraft was convicted of murders that occurred between 1972 and
1983. Prosecutors said he picked up hitchhikers, gave them drugs
and alcohol, sexually tortured or mutilated them and then strangled
them.
   The bodies were dumped along roads, frequently from a moving car.
   Highway Patrol officers arrested Kraft in 1983 after pulling him
over for erratic driving and discovering a strangled Marine in his
car.
   The courtroom was full of victims' relatives, who cried and
hugged when it became apparent the death penalty would be imposed.
Kraft remained calm throughout the proceeding, playing with a pen
cap, yawning, laughing and chatting with his attorney.
   Kraft after sentencing addressed the judge, saying only, ``I
have not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review of the
record will show that.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised
the possibility Wednesday that NATO and the Warsaw Pact might enter
into a second set of negotiations to slash conventional arms and
troops further in Europe.
   Cheney said at the end of a two-day meeting at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization that no decision had been made to go
beyond the current bargaining in Vienna to reduce non-nuclear
forces in Europe.
   ``But,'' he said, ``I certainly would not rule out the
possibility'' that after an agreement was reached in Vienna, the
alliance ``would then decide upon further steps to accelerate and
expand upon'' the pact.
   He said he hoped that ``we will be able to persuade the Soviets
to ultimately withdraw all of their forces from Eastern Europe.''
   The current bargaining between the 16 NATO nations and the seven
of the Warsaw Pact is designed to reduce the East's enormous
superiority in tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers in
Europe. Both sides would be brought down to equal levels under
proposals on the table.
   As part of those talks, President Bush has suggested the United
States and the Soviet Union pare their forces in Europe to 275,000
on each side. The plan would require the Soviets to pull out
300,000 troops and the United States 30,000.
   An agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe is expected
in the second half of next year.
   During meetings with other defense ministers, Cheney sought to
dispel fears the United States would unilaterally pull its troops
out of Europe because of budget pressures and reduced East-West
tensions.
   Reports of American plans to clip military spending in coming
years has prompted concern about the United States' ties to its
European allies.
   Cheney said that over time, the United States could possibly
``contemplate ... additional reductions'' in deployments in Europe.
   But, he said, such cuts would take place ``only in the context
of the alliance, only based upon consultation with our allies and
only based upon similar kinds of developments with respect to the
East.''
   ``There has been no slackening in the U.S. commitment to NATO,''
he insisted. ``There will be no slackening in the U.S. commitment
to NATO. There will be no unilateral reductions in U.S. deployments
with respect to NATO.''
   He said the United States' share of total defense spending by
NATO nations amounted to 64 percent. ``I do not expect that to
change in significant ways,'' he said.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said defense ministers at
the meeting found Cheney's remarks ``realistic and reassuring.''
   He said said Cheney made clear that ``no significant changes''
in U.S. forces in Europe were under consideration before an accord
at Vienna.
   Any major reductions beyond that, he said, would be done in
consultation with the allies.
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the United
States sees future troop cuts to mean that Europeans ``must take on
more responsibility'' for the West's common defense.
   In a final statement, the defense ministers welcomed the rapid
pace of political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe but urged caution.
   ``A time of rapid political change presents the West with new
opportunities, although the resulting uncertainty also carries
potential risks,'' the statement said.
   ``Our defense requirements must continue to be assessed against
the realities of Warsaw Pact military capabilities,'' it said.
   They noted the Soviet Union had taken initial steps to fulfill
last year's promises of unilateral arms reductions, but said Warsaw
Pact forces were still larger and better-equipped than in the West.
   ``There has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the
threat which confronts us,'' said Woerner, ``but not yet a
significant change in the military capability of the Soviet Union
and the Warsaw Pact.''
   The ministers said they would follow a step-by-step approach to
changes in the East and promised not to make any unilateral arms
cuts that could hurt chances for an accord on conventional forces
in Europe.
   The leaders of the NATO nations will gather Monday in Brussels
to hear about Bush's weekend summit with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The alliance's defense ministers meet twice year in their role
as the Defense Planning Committee. France, which is outside NATO's
joint military structure, does not attend. Iceland, which has no
armed forces, has observer status.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resigned
Wednesday, and for only the second time since independence in 1947
his Congress Party did not claim the right to form the next
government.
   Opposition parties began trying to assemble a coalition.
   Gandhi submitted his resignation to President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman and said he was ready for the role of opposition
leader.
   ``The people have given their verdict,'' he said in a televised
speech Wednesday night. ``In all humility, we respect the verdict.''
   ``A new government will be formed. We extend to them our good
wishes and offer them our constructive cooperation,'' said the
45-year-old former airline pilot, who won his own Parliament seat
overwhelmingly for a third time.
   Congress won more Parliament seats in last week's elections than
any other party, but was far short of a majority.
   Venkataraman asked Gandhi to remain in office as caretaker prime
minister. The resignation cleared the way for the National Front
alliance to form the next government for the world's most populous
democracy.
   The Congress Party has been out of office only once before since
independence from Britain, for 29 months after losing the 1977
elections.
   National Front leaders predicted Wednesday they would choose the
next prime minister, but differences arose among the five parties.
   A meeting was delayed until Thursday, then Friday, while
legislators from the alliance tried to persuade its main leader,
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, to take the job. Singh has repeatedly said
he doesk not want it.
   ``There will be trouble in the party if V.P. Singh is not
elected prime minister,'' said Jaipal Reddy of Janata Dal, or
People's Party, largest of the five parties in the National Front.
   Singh is a former Gandhi minister and ally who has become his
most prominent political foe.
   The National Front and its allies picked up enough pledges of
support from smaller parties Wednesday form a majority in the
543-seat Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament where the power
lies.
   Gandhi's party is gambling that the coalition will be hamstrung
by internal squabbling, paving the way for Congress to regain power.
   Congress legislators met Wednesday night and unanimously
re-elected Gandhi as parliamentary leader, putting him in the
position of becoming prime minister again if the opposition should
fail and President Venkataraman asked Congress to form a government.
   Asked whether he was prepared to lead the opposition, Gandhi
said with a smile: ``Absolutely. We will be a very good watchdog.''
   Later, the party's parliamentary board decided not to claim the
right to form the next government, state TV reported.
   Throughout the campaign, Gandhi portrayed the election as a
choice between the stability his government and potential chaos
under the opposition.
   Many feuds have been reported within the National Front since it
was formed in August 1988.
   Leaders of the various parties set aside their differences after
elections were called in mid-October, but squabbling resumed while
the votes were counted.
   Singh, a 58-year-old former defense and finance minister, is the
best-known of its leaders, but has said he just wants to be
president of the Janata Dal.
   Another prominent Janata Dal member, Chandra Shekhar, said he
was ready to be prime minister, but some colleagues don't support
him.
   The taciturn 62-year-old former socialist engineered the
opposition victory in 1977.
   ``As of now, there is only one candidate,'' Reddy said.
``Despite persuasion, V.P. Singh is not a candidate and despite
disuassion Chandra Shekhar remains one.''
   With 512 seats decided, the Congress Party had 190 and its
smaller allies 17 for a total of 207. The National Front had 139
and its allies 137, a total of 276.
   It takes 263 seats for a majority in the Lok Sabha, which will
convene with 525 seats. Elections for the remaining 18 seats were
postponed because of the deaths of candidates and other reasons.
   Gandhi entered Parliament in 1981 and became prime minister in
1984 after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi. continuing the political dynasty started by his
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru.
   As one of his last acts, Gandhi began the process of dropping
criminal charges against Simranjit Singh Mann, a fomer police
officer charged with conspiracy in the murder, who was elected to
Parliament from Punjab state.
   He did not say why the charges were being dropped.

   A sanitation worker accused of goofing
off on the job says he will work for free until March to prove he
is productive.
   Robert Baronowski is one of two employees followed by reporters
during a three-month investigation by the Bridgeport Post-Telegram.
   The newspaper said Baronowski and housing code inspector Gil
SaNogueira spent more time in restaurants and on personal business
than on the job. Both have been suspended without pay.
   ``As an employee with the town for the past 23 years, I feel
terrible about what has taken place,'' Baronowski said in a letter
to Town Manager Ronald Owens. ``Recently I have been under extreme
stress due to family illnesses. While this is no excuse for what
has taken place, it is a reason why I have not been myself as an
employee.''
   Owens said Baronowski will return to work Monday and work for
free until March 2.
   SaNogueira, who was suspended Tuesday and faces a recommendation
that he be fired, refused comment. The Public Works Union is
contesting the recommendation.

<HEAD>OSHA Cites Air Force Base Over B-52 Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has cited the Air Force
for unsafe work conditions surrounding a fatal B-52 fire, alleging
workers weren't given proper tools and cigarette butts were found
near where the plane was being fueled.
   One worker was killed and 11 were injured in the July blaze at
Kelly Air Force Base.
   The notice Tuesday from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration includes 16 ``willful'' violations and two
``serious'' ones. No fines were imposed because the Air Force is a
federal agency.
   OSHA did not pinpoint the the fire's cause but found several
hazards were present. Among the violations cited were cigarette
butts found within a 50-foot safety zone. However, OSHA did not
allege that workers were smoking.
   OSHA also said an ``integral tank tool kit'' was not available
for testing one of the plane's fuel tanks. L. Nicholas, the
agency's area director, refused to elaborate today on how the lack
of proper tools related to the accident.
   The Air Force has until Dec. 11 to correct some violations but
must correct others as soon as Monday.
   Maj. Gen. Richard Smith, commander of the Air Logistics Center,
said in a statement today that the OSHA citations parallel the Air
Force's own findings and that ``corrective actions are already in
progress.''
   The Air Force blamed the accident on an improperly constructed,
unapproved fuel tank vent plug mistakenly left on a fuel tank after
the tank was tested for leaks. That caused the tank to burst when
filled, according to the military.
   OSHA also charged that the fire guard had left the refueling
area and was not present to detect leaking fuel and give a warning,
and that supervisors didn't brief the refueling crew, discuss
escape routes or designate one person to direct refueling.

   Star magazine has sued Don Johnson claiming
the former ``Miami Vice'' star encouraged a bodyguard to fire
shotgun blasts at a helicopter trying to cover his June remarriage
to actress Melanie Griffith.
   Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said Tuesday that the
supermarket tabloid's allegations are ``a complete fabrication,
just a pathetic attempt to sell some magazines.''
   The Star claimed a photographer and reporter aboard the
helicopter were injured. The lawsuit, filed Friday in Pitkin County
Court, also named Greg Isaacs, described as a Johnson bodyguard who
``lay in wait for the helicopter and ... ambushed the aircraft.''
   An investigation by the Pitkin County Sheriff's Department and
the Colorado Bureau of Investigation concluded that shots probably
were fired from Isaacs' gun and hit the helicopter. Isaacs told
investigators he was skeet shooting. No charges were filed.
   The tabloid, reporter Barry Levine, Thunderbird Helicopters of
Montrose and pilot Burt Metcalf are seeking unspecified damages
from Johnson and Isaacs.
   Mintz said Johnson and his attorney haven't seen the lawsuit and
could not comment on it.

Hahn at a Canadian nude-dancing club, and all she did was talk.
   Many of the 75 people who attended the show at the Million
Dollar Saloon in this city across the Detroit River from Detroit
said they felt tricked.
   ``It's true that you're seeing me, but I'm not taking my clothes
off,'' said Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual
encounter with television evangelist Jim Bakker spurred his
downfall.
   ``The difference between what I'm doing and what Jim Bakker did
is that he passes around a collection plate,'' she told her
audience Monday night.
   Club manager John Trecapelli Jr. said he delivered exactly what
his advertisements promised: that Hahn would appear in person

   ``I can't be responsible for what people think,'' he said.
   About a dozen people paid Hahn for her autograph, Polaroid

   University of Nebraska officials plan to name
a new theater for Johnny Carson, and not just because the talk show
host studied radio and speech at the school.
   Carson made a ``very, very generous'' contribution to
construction of the $20 million Lied Center for Performing Arts at
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus, project director Sheila
Griffin said Tuesday.
   Ms. Griffin said she wrote Carson asking whether a multiuse
space at the center that seats about 2,300 people could be named
The Johnny Carson Theater. He agreed as long as the amount of his
donation was not revealed, she said.
   Ms. Griffin said Carson had asked that his contribution be
anonymous when he made it during a fund-raising campaign that ended
in 1986. Since the Lied Center has been completed, names of
benefactors who gave $50,000 or more are being placed on various
parts of the building and pieces of the equipment in it, she said.
   The designation of the secondary theater and rehearsal hall in
Carson's name is subject to approval by a campus administration
committee, she said.

   Luke and Matt Goss of the Bros pop band settled a
libel lawsuit Wednesday with a newspaper they claimed had suggested
they took heroin.
   The People, a tabloid weekly, agreed to pay the 21-year-old
twins a six-figure sum and publish an apology in next Sunday's
paper, prosecutor Richard Hartley said. Hartley said the exact
amount would not be disclosed, but six figures in British pound is
the equivalent of at least $160,000.
   The brothers, avid campaigners against drugs, testified at a
libel hearing that articles in the newspaper in September 1988
spoiled their ``squeaky clean'' image in the eyes of their mainly
teen-age fans.
   The newspaper had alleged that Luke Goss shared a house with a
heroin dealer in a front-page article headlined ``Exposed! Heroin
Dealer in Bros House.''
   The newspaper denied the articles were defamatory and said it
never intended to suggest the brothers took heroin or approved of
its use.

   Hundreds of prisoners have begun a hunger
strike, demanding the abolition of capital punishment and improved
prison conditions, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Lawmakers and judicial officials met with representatives of the
632 prisoners, who began their hunger strike Nov. 20, and assured
them some of their demands would be discussed at Parliament's next
session on Dec. 14, according to the newspaper Trud.
   The strikers said they would end their protest if their
grievances were published in the national press, but it was not
known if they had given up their hunger strike.
   According to Trud, the hunger strikers sent an open letter to
new Communist Party chief and President Petar Mladenov, Parliament,
the official Committee For Human Rights and the state prosecutor's
office.
   They demanded a shortening of prison terms; exemption from
prosecution of persons under 16, women over 55 and men over 60; a
government decision on a partial amnesty; abolition of the death
penalty; and a shorter duration of investigative custody.
   The hunger strikers also commissions established to investigate

   Young hounds with some hope of retraining will be offered for
sale at about $540 at the inflated official exchange rate.
   Healthy middle-aged dogs with too much experience tracking

   Older dogs and those with illnesses wll be put to sleep, the

   Billie Sol Estes, a confidant of Lyndon
Johnson convicted in a multimillion-dollar fertilizer swindle in
the 1960s, has been indicted with five other people on charges of
stealing trade secrets.
   Estes, 64, was freed on $10,000 bail Tuesday with three other
defendants.
   The six were charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday with
engaging in organized criminal activity. They were accused of
plotting to steal and duplicate trade secrets owned by Loadcraft, a
manufacturer of container cargo trailers.
   ``They were going to go into business against Loadcraft,'' said
District Attorney Ronald Sutton. ``They were basically ready to go
when we stopped it in March 1988.''
   It took more than a year to indict them because ``it takes a
mountain of records to put these things together,'' Sutton said. If
convicted, the six each face two to 20 years in prison and a fine
of up to $10,000, he said.
   Sutton said one of those indicted, David Jay Guzan, 41, of
Corpus Christi, had been plant manager at Loadcraft and stole trade
secrets and manufacturing plans before he left there.
   The group had set up manufacturing operations under the name
Loadstar International Inc. in Corpus Christi with financial
backing from the Corpus Christi Economic Development Board when
investigators stepped in.
   Estes, a contribitor to Johnson's political campaigns, was known
as an agricultural financial wizard in the 1950s and 1960s until
his empire collapsed after it was disclosed that its assets were
mostly paper.
   He was convicted in 1963 of mail fraud and conspiracy in a
swindle involving nonexistent fertilizer tanks backed by federal
agriculture loans. He began a 15-year prison term in 1965 and was
paroled in 1971.
   In 1979, his parole was revoked and he was sent back to prison
for mail fraud and conspiracy to conceal assets. He was released in
1983. His parole expired this year.
   After his 1983 release, he said, ``I'm just one drink away from
being a drunk and just one deal away from being back in prison.''
   In the November issue of Texas Monthly, Estes was quoted as
saying, ``I've always been able to make money. If I put my mind to
it, I could make a million in the next 30 days.''
   Also indicted were Guzan's wife, Molly Guzan, 41; John Andrew
Smith, 33, of Brady; Boyd Harrold Pool, 49, of Clarendon; Cheryl
Ann Vick, 27, of Yucaipa, Calif., and Loadstar, which is defunct.
   Sutton said Mrs. Guzan and Ms. Vick were to surrender today.

<HEAD>Analysts See Weakening in Economy's Moderate Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew moderately from July
through September, the government said Wednesday, but analysts said
it has since weakened sharply, threatening to derail an
unprecedented peacetime expansion.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 2.7
percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent
rate originally reported last month.
   Earlier this year, economists had widely forecast only sluggish
growth in the quarter, but the revision means the third quarter
topped the 2.5 percent second quarter rate.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We always like to see increase in growth. And this report
is relatively good news in that sense.''
   However, private analysts predicted with near unanimity a
sharply weaker performance in the final three months of 1989 and
the first quarter of next year. A few expect the nation to topple
into a recession, ending the expansion, which enters its eighth
year in December.
   ``We should enjoy these (third quarter) numbers because the
chances are we're not going to see their like anytime soon,'' said
economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co.
   Most economists attribute the current sluggishness to a
year-long anti-inflation campaign by the Federal Reserve Board,
which pushed interest rates up through this spring.
   Since then, the Fed has nudged rates lower, but the economy
won't reflect the full benefit of rate cuts _ and any further
declines in the next few months _ until later next year.
   ``The reason the economy will skirt a recession, but not fall
into one, is interest rates are coming down substantially,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch. He predicted a further
decline in rates next month.
   In other economic news, an administration source who spoke on
the condition of anonymity said that President Bush planned to name
Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins Jr. to a vacancy on
the Federal Reserve board. Economists said the appointment was
likely to give the administration, which has sought a looser
monetary policy, a greater voice in the Fed's decisions.
   Although the GNP revision Wednesday was in line with economists'
expectations, it still caused a negative ripple in financial
markets because traders interpreted it as a sign the Fed will feel
less pressure to lower rates immediately.
   Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipated
trade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit a
five-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made.
   Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third
quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, while
imports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump in
the initial report.
   Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising at
a brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the first
quarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8
percent.
   Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,
improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annual
rate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-June
quarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate.
   Analysts generally expect that the third-quarter surge in
consumer spending will not be repeated, attributing much of the
rise to auto purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing

   They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that the
strength in the dollar will stall further improvement in the

   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said after-tax
corporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in the third
quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which was the
worst performance in three years. It was the third consecutive
quarter that profits have dropped. The department attributed much
of the decline to losses from Hurricane Hugo.

   A judge declared a mistrial today
after a jury deadlocked on racketeering charges against three
avowed revolutionaries already cleared of plotting to overthrow the
U.S. government.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Young came on the
jury's 21st day of deliberations in the year-long trial.
   The jury for three days had said it did not think it would be
able to reach agreement on the racketeering and conspiracy charges,
which involved 15 successful or attempted bombings of courthouses,
banks, corporate offices and military recruiting and reserve
centers. One of the bombings, at a courthouse in Boston in 1976,
cost one man his lower leg. Some other bombs failed to explode.
   It was not immediately clear if a second trial would be held on
the racketeering charges.
   The jury delivered a partial verdict Monday acquitting the three
of sedition, or trying to overthrow the government, a charge rarely
used since the Civil War. The acquittal means the defendants cannot
be tried again on that charge.
   On trial were Raymond Levasseur, his wife, Patricia Gros
Levasseur, and Richard Williams.
   They were tried as part of a group operating under the names
United Freedom Front and Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit, which
they said took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank
robberies along the East Coast from 1976 to 1984.
   Jurors were deciding racketeering charges against Levasseur and
Williams as well as a charge of racketeering conspiracy against all
three. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $20,000
in fines.
   Originally, eight people were indicted but only three were left
in the trial.
   Some of the defendants have been convicted at separate trials
for some of the bombings, but the Springfield prosecution pulled
the case together through racketeering laws that allow several
people to be tried for incidents occurring in several states.
   Levasseur and Williams already are serving long prison terms for
some of the bombings. Mrs. Levasseur is free on bail after serving
3{ years of a five-year term for harboring a fugitive, her husband.

   States should be allowed to ban abortions for
most unmarried girls unless their parents are notified before such
operations are performed, the Supreme Court was told today.
   But challengers to parental notification laws in Ohio and
Minnesota countered that the measures unfairly impinged on a girl's
right to abortion, as guaranteed by the Supreme Court in its 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Groups on both sides of the abortion issue looked to the court
this term to clarify where it stood on Roe vs. Wade. But an
Illinois case that promised to be the major barometer of the
court's intent was settled out of court last week.
   The cases argued before the court today dealt, not with the
broad issue of whether abortion should be legal, but whether
parents of minors should be notified if their daughters seek one.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, considered a key vote in both
notification cases, expressed skepticism about the Minnesota law's
requirement that both biological parents of a girl be notified
before an abortion is performed.
   ``The statute just doesn't provide for any exceptions, even when
it's not in the child's best interest,'' she told Minnesota Chief
Deputy Attorney General John Tunheim. ``How do you defend the
state's best interest?''
   Tunheim said biological parents are presumed to have ``rights
and responsibilities'' in the upbringing of their children that the
state should defend.
   But Janet Benshoof, representing challengers to the Minnesota
law, said the state gave minor girls inadequate protection against
unfit parents.
   She said the law requires notification of a parent who may be
``a mental patient, a fugitive, who beats the family regularly.''
   In some cases, there are fathers who have been been absent from
the family for years and the daughter seeking an abortion would
have to notify him even if he were ``a complete stranger,'' Ms.
Benshoof said.
   The Ohio law requires notification of one parent.
   ``States are entitled to enact laws to aid parents,'' Ohio
Assistant Attorney General Rita Eppler argued.
   Ms. Eppler urged the justices to reinstate a law she said
preserves a minor's right to abortion while aiding parental
involvement.
   But Linda Sogg, a Cleveland lawyer representing those who
successfully challenged the Ohio law in lower courts, contended,
``Ohio really has singled out ... abortion ... for the notification
requirement.''
   She said young girls seeking medical help for drug abuse or a
contagious disease face no such parental-notification requirement.
   At issue in both cases are state laws requiring doctors to
notify parents before performin abortions sought by unmarried girls
under 18 who are still supported by a parent.
   The lawyers in both cases were asked numerous questions by the
justices during a two-hour-long presentation.
   As an alternative to parental notification, the Ohio law allows
a young girl to try to persuade a judge that she is mature enough
to make the decision on her own, or that telling her parents is not
in her best interests.
   The Ohio law says a young girl must prove her maturity by
``clear and convincing evidence.''
   O'Connor asked whether that standard makes it too difficult for
young girls seeking a judge's approval to get an abortion without
parental notification.
   ``What about the risk of erroneous deprivation'' of a minor's
right to abortion, O'Connor asked Ms. Eppler.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that both Ohio and
Minnesota contend that no so-called judicial bypass alternative to
parental notificiation is required.
   The Ohio law ``represents no undue burden,'' Ms. Eppler said,
adding that the state has a pressing interest in assuring the
involvement of parents ``when their daughter faces perhaps the most
serious dilemma of her young life.''
   But Ms. Sogg argued, ``not all parents are loving,'' and
referred to ``too many statistics about how unloving parents can
be.''
   She told the court many young girls who desire abortions have a
``fear of parental retaliation or abuse.''
   About half the states have laws requiring parental consent, but
most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges.
   Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers
who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million
legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _
180,000 each year _ have been for minors.
   The court touched off a political firestorm in July by voting
5-4 to give states greater power to regulate abortions. Four
justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn Roe vs.
Wade. O'Connor refused.
   But she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not
discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it.
   Neither Ohio nor Minnesota is asking the court to reverse Roe
vs. Wade, but the Bush administration has.
   Although it did not seek to participate in today's arguments,
the Bush administration urged the court to use the Minnesota case
to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion.
   ``We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should
be overruled,'' Justice Department lawyers said in a
friend-of-the-court brief.
   The disputed Ohio law was passed by the state legislature in
1985 but never took effect, due to a successful legal challenge by
an Akron abortion clinic and one of its doctors, Max Pierre Gaujean.
   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's
parents at least 24 hours before the operation.
   A young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by
seeking a state judge's permission to have the abortion.
   A federal judge struck down the law, and that ruling was upheld
by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Minnesota law requires such young girls to notify both
biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion.
The 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations.
   After enforcement of the law was blocked, a judicial-bypass
provision took effect. It allows a girl to avoid notifying her
parents by convincing a judge she is ``mature and capable of giving
informed consent'' or that not notifying her parents would be in
her best interests.
   The notification law with the judicial-bypass option was in
effect in Minnesota for five years before it was struck down by a
federal judge.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last
year and said the law is constitutional. The appeals court,
however, blocked enforcement of the law pending Supreme Court
action.
   The cases are Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,
88-805, and Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 88-1125 and 88-1309.

<HEAD>GAO Says Commission Overestimated Savings from Base Closings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal commission overestimated the annual
savings from closing or realigning 15 military bases, but the
eventual amount still will be considerable, a congressional agency
said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office said that based on revised and
updated data it found that the annual savings from shutting down or
scaling back the 15 bases amounted to $453.4 million _ about $170
million less the $622.9 million the commission estimated.
   ``But still a substantial annual savings,'' the GAO said.
   The congressionally established Commission on Base Realignment
and Closure recommended in January closing a total of 86 military
bases and scaling back five more, a proposal accepted by
then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Despite overwhelming support in Congress for the plan, a number
of lawmakers questioned the commission's methodology and complained
that its findings were based on faulty data.
   Members asked this past summer that the GAO, the investigative
arm of Congress, review the commission's work on 15 bases slated
for closure or realignment, including the Presidio in California,
Fort Dix in New Jersey and Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois.
   The GAO, in its report, said the commission overestimated the
savings at the 15 bases because of ``data errors, inaccurate
estimates and the exclusion of certain relevant costs.''
   Specifically, at the Jefferson Proving Ground in Indiana, the
commission did not calculate the cost of cleaning up munitions at
the facility. The panel estimated annual savings of $6.6 million at
the base and six years to recover the closure costs.
   But the GAO said that it could take anywhere from 38 to more
than 200 years to recover the expense of closing Jefferson Proving
Ground. The GAO also estimated savings at $6.3 million annually.
   The GAO recommended that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney closely
monitor the closing and realignment of the bases, which are to be
completed by Sept. 30, 1995.
   The GAO said the Department of Defense provided oral comments on
a draft of the report which generally agreed with the agency's
findings, although it estimated that the annual savings from the 15
bases will be about $522 million.

   Police used tear gas and water cannon to
force back hundreds of young demonstrators Wednesday who attacked
the towering monument to Vladimir I. Lenin at Nowa Huta in southern
Poland, state media reported.
   The demonstration, called by the radical Movement for an
Alternative Society, targeted the statue that dominates a square in
Nowa Huta, an industrial city of 220,000 people built outside
Krakow in the 1950s to be a model workers' community.
   According to state TV and the official PAP news agency, the
demonstrators used metal bars and hacksaws to begin dismantling
barriers surrounding the monument to the founder of the Soviet
state before police intervened.
   Demonstrators shouted chants calling for dismantling the
monument and the removal of the estimated 40,000 Soviet troops in
Poland.
   The protesters finally dispersed after pleas for moderation from
Solidarity parliament Deputy Edward Nowak, who promised to propose
dismantling of the monument to parliament Thursday, state TV said.
   The 33-foot-tall statue long has been a hated symbol of Soviet
domination in the city, a Solidarity stronghold which until 1977
was denied the right to have its own Roman Catholic Church.
   Last week, demonstrators splashed paint on the statue and tried
to set it ablaze.
   In 1979, worker activists dynamited the statue, blowing off one
of its legs. It was quickly repaired by communist officials and
several people were imprisoned in the attack.
   The attempt to dismantle Lenin's statue follows the officially
sanctioned dismantling of another hated symbol, a monument in
Warsaw to Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret
police, on Nov. 17.
   City officials agreed to the dismantling of the statue and the
renaming of Dzerzhinski Square where it stood, saying the statue's
removal was needed in connection with subway construction work.
   The Solidarity-led government has sought to maintain friendly
relations with the Soviet Union, including a trip to Moscow last
week by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. He has condemned
outbreaks of anti-Soviet vandalism.
   But his government has stressed that Poland is a sovereign
country and must no longer be dominated by its larger neighbor.

   The Solar Maximum satellite, responding
increasingly to Earth's pull, dropped 7.5 miles in 24 hours and is
expected to crash through the atmosphere about 1:49 a.m. EST on
Saturday, NASA said Wednesday.
   The U.S. Space Command in Colorado, which tracks objects in
space, said it did not know where on the globe the 10-year-old
satellite might fall because a few minutes one way or another can
mean hundreds of miles. The impact point will be estimated more
closely as the time of the satellite's demise comes nearer.
   Solar Max has been studying the sun since it was launched in
February 1980. It ran out of fuel recently and began tumbling out
of control. NASA jettisoned its solar panels last week, depriving
the satellite of power.
   The 5,000-pound spacecraft will be mostly destroyed by fire, but
some larger pieces may survive and fall in chunks to Earth.

hologram.
   The self-adhesive 25-cent stamps, showing an eagle and selling
for slightly more than face value, are being tested in 15 cities
across the country. Early sales have been reported good.
   The new plastic stamp, also self-adhesive, was unveiled this
week at World Stamp Expo in Washington and will be test-marketed in
Seattle.
   This stamp was designed to be sold in bank automatic cash
machines, and it is made of plastic to make it easier for the
machines to dispense.
   A 25-cent stamp, the plastic model features a stylized American
flag, with a dozen stamps sold together on a backing sheet the size
of a dollar bill. Testing will begin early in 1990.
   The hologram, a specialized design in which the image changes
color when viewed from different angles, goes on sale Sunday.
   It is on a stamped envelopes and features a picture of the
planned space station. The stamped envelope will cost 30 cents,
including the 25-cents postage.

   A judge refused to grant a mistrial
Wednesday in a state anti-pollution lawsuit against Amtrak after
the defense said all of its witnesses would invoke the Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
   Circuit Judge Robert Perry gave Amtrak attorney Edward Booth
until Thursday morning to find substitute witnesses. The lawyer
said he plans to rest his case if no one else can be found.
   Amtrak faces four counts of commercial littering for human waste
allegedly flushed from trains into the St. Johns River and Rice
Creek. A couple fishing under a trestle also testified they were
sprayed.
   Booth said his potential witnesses feared their testimony would
be used by the state attorney's office to support charges against
them.
   ``I'm trying to avoid charges ever being brought against these
people,'' Booth told the judge. ``It would form a link in a chain
of evidence that the state could use. It would overwhelmingly
incriminate them.''
   The judge said Booth should have anticipated the problem.
   Amtrak contends federal law exempts the national rail passenger
line from state pollution control laws. Amtrak says it would be too
expensive to add holding tanks to the toilets aboard all its trains.

<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST. Note language in 12th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two memories of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, one from
historian Stephen Ambrose, one from columnist William F. Buckley,
are recounted in the December issue of American Heritage magazine:
   Buckley was having lunch with the Wisconsin Republican on Labor
Day 1952 when McCarthy got a phone call from the chairman of the
Republican Party in Massachusetts.
   McCarthy returned to the table looking troubled. The caller, he
said, wanted him to go to Boston and speak on behalf of Sen. Henry
Cabot Lodge, who was being challenged by John F. Kennedy, the
Democratic nominee.
   ``That's hard to do,'' McCarthy complained. ``Joe Kennedy (JFK's
father) has always been on my side, and he contributed $5,000 to my
own re-election campaign. If I go to Boston, Jack Kennedy will lose
to Cabot Lodge, no doubt about it.''
   Lunch resumed, but 15 minutes later McCarthy got up and went to
the phone. When he returned, he was smiling.
   ``Well, I took care of that one all right!'' he said. ``I told
his manager, `Sure, I'll give a speech for Cabot. But he'll have to
ask me to do it.''' He laughed. ``Cabot Lodge would never ask me
publicly. He'd lose the Harvard vote.''
   Lodge lost. Kennedy won.
   Now, Ambrose's story:
   In 1954, McCarthy and aide Roy Cohn came to the University of
Wisconsin, where the senator was to give a speech. He was met at
the airport by Ambrose, his student host.
   ``He and Cohn were drunk,'' Ambrose recalls. ``They continued
drinking from a whiskey bottle as we drove to campus. On arrival, I
told the senator he had an hour before his talk; I asked if there
was anything he would like to see.''
   The card catalog in the library, McCarthy replied. At the
library McCarthy flipped straight to the ``M'' section and pulled
out several drawers of cards on books by and about Karl Marx, and
threw them down on the director's desk.
   ``This is a goddamned outrage!'' McCarthy roared. ``The good
children of Wisconsin shouldn't be exposed to this crap. I want all
these books burned.''
   Instead of arguing the merits of Marx or pleading for academic
freedom, the director explained why the books could not be
summarily torched _ they were state property.
   Taken aback by this invocation of so basic a conservative value,
McCarthy relented, but insisted that the volumes be locked up with
the library's collection of pornography.
   Ambrose says he checked back a few weeks later. The Marx books
were still in circulation.

<TEXT>
   A school district must supply a
sign-language interpreter for deaf parents at school-sponsored
conferences involving the education of their children, a federal
judge ruled Wednesday.
   ``School-sponsored activities that are designed for parental
involvement and are focused on the student's academic or
disciplinary progress ... must be made available to the
hearing-impaired,'' U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel wrote.
   The case is the first of its kind in the country, said Marc
Charmatz, attorney for the National Association for the Deaf Legal
Defense Fund, which brought the case. He said most school districts
willingly supply sign language interpreters.
   The parents, Kenneth and Karen Rothschild, have two children who
can hear normally in the Ramapo Central School District, Charmatz
said. One is a fourth-grader and one a high school senior. The
district is in Rockland County, north and across the Hudson River
from New York City.
   Since the early 1980s, the parents have sought an interpreter so
they could participate in parent-teacher evenings and other
activities involving their children.
   The Rothschilds have retained sign-language interpreters at
their own expense, paying an estimated $2,000 through the 1988-89
school year, according to the decision.
   The couple maintained that they are denied equal opportunity to
participate in school programs and to consult with school district
personnel concerning their children.
   They sought relief under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973,
which says any organization receiving federal aid cannot
discriminate against the handicapped.
   The school district claimed that the parents do not qualify
under the act because they are not students.
   Goettel said that the regulations of the act define reasonable
access for a deaf person as including a sign-language interpreter.
   ``Without the provision of a sign-language interpreter, the
plaintiffs are de facto barred from the participation in the school
district's programs for parents,'' Goettel wrote. ``This is not a
case where the relief sought by the plaintiffs would be cumulative
or duplicative of services they are already receiving.''
   Goettel added, however, that the district's obligation ``is
limited to school-initiated conferences incident to the academic
and-or disciplinary aspects of their child's education. To the
extent that the plaintiffs wish to voluntarily participate in any
of the plethora of extracurricular activities that their children
may be involved in, we think they, like other parents, must do so
at their own expense.''
   Attorneys for the school district did not immediately return
phone calls.
   In Camden, N.J., a deaf Rutgers University law student won a
court order Monday forcing the school to provide her with classroom
notes.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Brotman ordered the university's
law school not to hold two classes attended by Karen Prince unless
she receives notes within 24 hours of each class.
   Ms. Prince sued under the same law as the Rothschilds.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to open
records of the state's defunct segregation spy agency to allow a
prosecutor to examine reports about the 1963 assassination of NAACP
leader Medgar Evers.
   Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters is trying to decide if
Byron de La Beckwith, whose first two trials on charges of killing
Evers ended in mistrials, should be tried again.
   In an order made public Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William H.
Barbour Jr. ruled it would be premature to grant prosecutors access
to the closed records of the state Sovereignty Commission.
   Peters sought access to the records to determine if there was
jury tampering in the two 1964 trials of Beckwith, a former
Greenwood fertilizer salesman accused of killing Evers. Beckwith
now lives in Tennessee.
   Mistrials were declared in both trials when all-white Hinds
County juries failed to reach verdicts.
   A Hinds County grand jury that meets Dec. 11 is expected to
explore whether to bring new charges.
   ``The decision of the district attorney as to whether to try
Beckwith again should be based on whether he thinks the evidence
available to him at this time is sufficient to obtain a
conviction,'' Barbour wrote in the new ruling. Barbour also wrote
that evidence of jury tampering would not be admissible in any new
murder trial.
   The Sovereignty Commission, created by the 1956 Legislature,
infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups. It went out of
existence in 1973 when its funding was cut off.
   The 1977 Legislature sealed the agency's records until 2027.
Barbour ruled July 27 the records should be open to the public, but
allowed them to remain sealed pending appeals to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Published reports have been that the commission screened
potential jurors before Beckwith's second trial in April 1964.
   Evers was shot to death outside his Jackson home June 12, 1963.
Beckwith's rifle was found nearby and one of his fingerprints was
on the rifle sight, but Beckwith testified the gun had been stolen
from him.
   Barbour said he might later reconsider Peters' request for the
records.
   ``The district attorney argues that if he attempts to retry
Beckwith, that Beckwith will argue that such retrial would be
barred by his constitutional right to a speedy trial,'' Barbour
wrote.
   While prosecutors plan to respond that proof of jury tampering
would make it possible to retry the case, the judge wrote, ``this
argument is premature and may be renewed if the district attorney
decides to retry Beckwith and if Beckwith raises the speedy trial
issue.''

years ago by a man who insists he repossessed the animals for
non-payment and animal abuse.
   FBI spokesman Norm Middleton said Tuesday the agents seized the
elephants Monday at a farm where circus animals are trained and
boarded.
   Civil action involving the elephants is pending in federal court
here, Middleton said.
   Arlan Seidon, 60, was arrested in October by Marion County
deputies and is fighting extradition to New Jersey. He is free on
$20,000 bond.
   FBI agent Mike Santimauro in Dallas said the elephants weren't
seized until this week because authorities didn't know where they
were.
   Seidon says he repossessed the elephants in 1984 after a dispute
with two men who bought them from him in 1981. Seidon claimed the
buyers mistreated the animals and fell behind on their payments.
   Seidon was arrested after he was tracked down by one of the men,
Richard Drake, who has said he has spent thousands of dollars
searching for Seidon and the elephants around the country.
   Seidon sold the elephants, Tory and Duchess, to Drake and his
son, Edward, who owned a now-closed exotic-animal ranch in
Tehachapi, Calif., in 1981 for $80,000.
   A judge in Monmouth County, N.J., in 1984 ordered Seidon to
return the 7-foot-tall elephants. Instead, Seidon fled with them in
a truck and hid them.
   The Drakes denied abusing the animals.
   Seidon has said he raised the animals, now in their late 20s,
from infancy. He told a newspaper in 1988 that he left his
Fordland, Mo., farm and his career preparing animals for circus and
television appearances to care for the elephants. He also said he
hadn't seen his four children or met his grandson since he took off
with the animals.
   Middleton declined to say where the elephants were taken after
the roundup, but said they are somewhere in eastern Texas.
   Seidon faces charges of theft in New Jersey. If convicted he
would face up to five years in prison and a $100,000 fine.

<HEAD>Christian Militias Pledge to Join Aoun Against Syrians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christian militias that have opposed Gen.
Michel Aoun said Wednesday they would join him in fighting the
troops, tanks and artillery Syria is massing around Lebanon's
Christian enclave.
   Elias Hrawi, the new Christian president backed by Syria,
dismissed Aoun as army commander Tuesday and ordered him to leave
his command post in a bunker beneath the presidential palace in
Baabda, east of Beirut.
   Aoun claims Hrawi's election by Parliament last week was
unconstitutional, says he won't accept a new peace plan until the
Syrian ``occupation army'' leaves the country, and has refused to
turn over the shell-battered palace.
   Lebanon's largest Christian militia, the Lebanese forces, said
it would fight beside the 20,000 Christian troops who followed Aoun
through a six-month artillery war with the Syrians earlier this
year.
   The Phalange Party, the main right-wing Christian political
force and also a foe of Aoun, pledged to confront any attempt to
storm the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of
Beirut.
   Thirty-three members of the French parliament met with Aoun. In
a show of support that contradicted the official French government
stand, the legislators joined thousands of young men who have
formed a human shield around the palace.
   One of the lawmakers, Bernard Bosson, said he was ``amazed at
the flood of masses'' at the palace and declared: ``This is like
the people's movement in Eastern Europe asking for democracy.''
   France supports Hrawi, who is trying to strengthen his central
government and reunite the fractured military as part of an effort
to end the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, in which more than
150,000 people have been killed.
   Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciary
since Lebanon became independent of France in 1943.
   Residents of Chtoura, an east Lebanon market town on the
Damascus-Beirut road, said Wednesday afternoon that scores of 122mm
and 133mm Syrian artillery pieces were moving toward Beirut and the
central mountains above Baabda, followed by dozens of trucks filled
with ammunition.
   They said hundreds of empty trucks were heading back toward
Syria, apparently after unloading soldiers and equipment.
   Earlier, the residents reported seeing at least 15,000 soldiers
in 800 trucks roll into Lebanon through the Bekaa Valley between
Monday night and midday Tuesday, along with 90 tanks, 120 field
guns, mine-clearing tanks, armored personnel carriers and
ammunition trucks.
   Both Christian and Moslem military sources said Syria had
Soviet-designed T-55 tanks arrayed on the line that separates
Moslem west Beirut from the capital's Christian sector.
   Larger T-62 tanks formed an ``arch of fire'' pointed at Aoun's
troops in Souk el-Gharb, a mountaintop town that commands the main
routes to Baabda.
   A Christian source said: ``They are in combat formation. It
seems they are only waiting for the orders. It's a significant
buildup, the kind of measures that precede a major battle.''
   Samir Geagea, commander of the Lebanese Forces militia, said:
``I ordered our forces last night to be ready to link up with their
comrades of the Lebanese army in defense of the liberated areas,''
a reference to the 30 percent of Lebanon free of Syrian troops.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers regularly stationed in Lebanon under a
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League issued in 1976, the year
after the civil war began. The Arab League arranged a cease-fire
Sept. 22 in the battle between Aoun and the Syrians, in which
nearly 1,000 civilians were killed.
   Aoun's soldiers drove the 6,000 Lebanese Forces militiamen from
east Beirut in a power struggle that culminated in a 4-day
confrontation in February that killed 82 people and wounded 200.
   A statement from the Phalange Party said: ``This is the hour for
mobilizing all potential without exception to face any attempt to
storm the Christian area. We shall be in the forward defense
lines.''
   The Phalange and Aoun parted company on the the peace plan
worked out by Lebanese legislators worked out in October at Taif,
Saudi Arabia. The Phalange supports the plan, but Aoun rejected it
because it did not include a fixed timetable for Syrian withdrawal
from Lebanon.
   Information Minister Edmond Rizk, a Phalangist, said in an
appeal to Aoun on Tuesday: ``We all ask you to prove that you
really love Lebanon. ... Allow peace to prevail. You must rest and
let the nation rest.''
   A Christian military source said Aoun's forces had planted
thousands of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in valleys that
separate the Christian enclave from Syrian positions.

<HEAD>With AM-Summit, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday talked by
telephone with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl about Kohl's
plans for German reunification as Secretary of State James A. Baker
III outlined a four-point U.S. stand on the divided country.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaer told reporters that Bush
and Kohl had discussed the chancellor's plan and that they also had
talked about Bush's upcoming summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The spokesman said he had no details of the conversation.
   ``We note that Chancellor Kohl is responding to the deepest
aspirations of his people,'' said Fitzwater. ``This is a goal that
we and the Federal Republic of Germany have long held in terms of
German unity.''
   Baker told reporters at a pre-summit news conference that the
U.S. position on German reunification ``should essentially embrace
four principles.''
   They are:
   _The people of East and West Germany should decide for
themselves whether they want unity and what form it should take.
   _A reunified Germany should be a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the European Economic Community.
   _Any steps toward reunification should be ``peaceful, gradual
and part of a step-by-step process'' to preserve European stability.
   _Any change of borders in Europe should be made according to the
1975 Helsinki accords, which specify that frontiers can be changed
only peacefully.
   ``We really shouldn't endorse or exclude any particular vision
of unity,'' Baker said. ``Unity can mean a lot of things. It can
mean a single federal state. It can mean a confederation. Or it
could mean something else.''
   There have been suggestions that a reunited Germany might be
neutral, with West Germany withdrawing from NATO and East Germany
from the Warsaw Pact.
   But Baker said the United States opposes such a West German
withdrawal from the Western community.
   ``There should be no trade of neutralism for unity and there
should be no dilution of the Federal Republic of Germany's liberal
democratic character,'' he said.
   Baker noted that Kohl had not mentioned changing borders. Some
right-wing political forces in West Germany have called for
reclaiming traditional German areas that have been in the Soviet
Union and in Poland since World War II.
   ``I think we should reiterate our support for the principles of
the Helsinki Final Act, recognizing the inviolability of frontiers
in Europe and allowing for the possibility of change in those
borders only through peaceful means,'' he said.
   Baker was asked whether he thought a Europe-wide conference
should be held to consider the German question.
   He said he thought the 35 nations _ involving Eastern and
Western Europe, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada _
that signed the Helsinki accords ``all have a very firm and
definite interest in what happens with respect to the question of
unification.''
   But he said the focus should be first on what is meant by
unification because the word ``means different things to different
people.''

<HEAD>Two Masked Palestinians Shot to Death by Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two masked
Palestinians who were throwing stones at Israeli cars Wednesday,
the army said.
   The men reportedly were stoning the cars on the main highway
between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. They
started to run after soldiers arrived and ordered them to halt, the
army said.
   ``The soldiers then opened fire according to standing
regulations, and as a result two were killed,'' said an army
spokesman, who cannot be identified under military regulations.
   Their deaths raised to 619 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians during the nearly 2-year-old uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. At least 151
others have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.
Forty-two Israelis have also been killed.
   In the Gaza Strip, 16 Arabs were wounded from army gunfire as
Palestinians in the occupied territories observed a general strike
to mark the anniversary of the U.N. vote to partition Palestine,
Arab reports said.
   The Palestinians, ranging in age from 8 to 28, were shot with
live and plastic bullets during stone-throwing clashes with Israeli
soldiers, Arab reports said. Most of the wounded were shot in the
legs.
   The army said it had no reports of any Arabs wounded but that
two Israeli soldiers were slightly injured by stones thrown at them.
   The army also said it sealed two houses in the Gaza Strip
belonging to families of men accused of helping kill Palestinians
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   In the West Bank, soldiers found two metal pipes with explosives
and detonators near the city of Tulkarm. One bomb was blown up by
soldiers and the other fell apart, according to Israeli reports.
   The strike, called by leaders of the Palestinian uprising,
marked the 42nd anniversary of the U.N. General Assembly's vote to
partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, which led
to Israel's creation less than a year later.
   Workers in the occupied territories stayed home, merchants
closed their shops and public transportation ground to a halt, Arab
reports said.
   General strikes have been a frequent protest tactic in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East War.
   Twenty-five people lived in the nine-room house that was sealed
in Gaza City. In nearby Beach Camp, 17 people lived in the
five-room house sealed by Israeli soldiers. Each had a family
member suspected of helping kill an accused collaborator with
Israel.
   Israeli military authorities have destroyed 244 Palestinian
homes and sealed 116 others since the start of the uprising, army
figures show.
   International human rights groups have condemned the moves as
harsh and drastic measures that have failed as a deterrent.

   Iva Mae Long's hobby has a nice ring to it
_ 20,000 rings that is.
   She collects bells, and her home in West Deer Township, 20 miles
north of Pittsburgh, is brimming with them.
   ``I do have a lot of bells,'' said Mrs. Long.
   That's an understatement.
   By her own estimate, about 20,000 bells fill every nook and
cranny in her home, which she calls Bell Haven. A 2,200-pound bell
is displayed in the front yard, and other bells adorn her front and
back porches, gazebo and driveway.
   ``It's the largest collection in the world,'' said Louise
Collins of Natrona Heights, another collector and former editor of
Bell Tower, the publication that connects 2,600 members of American
Bell Association International, Inc.
   Mrs. Long said bell collecting is contagious, and her children
and grandchildren have caught the bug.
   ``Touch one or two and first thing you know, you're a
bell-a-holic,'' she said.
   Mrs. Long caught the bug from her father and inherited his
collection, although she had started her own many years before he
died.
   She finds bells at auctions, in shops and trades with other
collectors.
   Among her most unusual pieces are a set shaped like a man and a
woman. The man nods no, and the woman nods yes. She has three
bells, dating between 1828 and 1862, from the locks of the old
Pennsylvania canal.
   An 1869 ``Wedding of the Rails'' bell commemorates the opening
of the transcontinental railroad. Other bells resemble figures of
famous people including Edgar Allen Poe and Friar Tuck.
   She can't resist collecting. ``After all, a bell is the only
thing in the house that thanks you for dusting it _ it rings,'' she
said.

   A city computer error sent the check to Blue Knight Publishing

Ann, when it was supposed to go to Blue Cross to cover insurance
payments.
   The city once purchased a book from the Wisconsin couple, so
their company was in the computer's list of vendors.
   ``Once the checks come off the printer they're folded and mailed
automatically,'' said investment officer Arthur Barnes. ``The error

   Hundreds of museums, galleries and other
institutions plan to observe ``A Day Without Art'' on Friday to
mourn artists who have died of AIDS and for the art that might have
been.
   Plans include darkening galleries and removing or covering
artwork. Some organizations will mount special exhibitions or hold
seminars or memorial services. Others will close for the day.
   ``Our aims are to honor and recognize friends and colleagues who
have died or are dying, and to seek greater support and
understanding from an ill-informed and sometimes hostile public,''
said Thomas W. Sokolowski, director of the Grey Art Gallery and a
member of Visual AIDS, a group of art professionals who organized
the event to coincide with the World Health Organization's second
``AIDS Awareness Day.''
   The group also hopes to use the prestige of arts organizations
to add weight to calls for more AIDS services and research, said
another Visual AIDS member, Philip Yenawine, who also is director
of education at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
   ``The real tragedy is not that we have lost people who everybody
knows,'' Yenawine said. ``For every Rock Hudson, there's been 500
or 5,000 maybe that have died young enough in their lives that
their careers have not come to public attention.''
   More than 600 art institutions take part in the observance,
including about 150 in New York.
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Pablo Picasso's portrait of
Gertrude Stein will be taken down for five days. A sign in its
place will explain the painting has been removed ``to symbolize the
losses the art community is currently experiencing because of
AIDS.''
   The Guggenheim Museum will hang a black banner on its Fifth
Avenue facade. The Museum of Modern Art and the Jewish Museum plan
memorial services.
   Sections of the Names Project Quilt, which memorializes people
who have died of AIDS, will be on display at The New-York
Historical Society, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the American Craft
Museum and the Museum of American Folk Art.
   Elsewhere:
   _About 50 art museums and galleries in New England will observe
the day. In the courtyard of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum,
empty chairs will be set to represent Boston-area artists affected
by AIDS. Panels of the Names Project Quilt will be hung at Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts.
   _A coffin will be placed in the center of the gallery at the
University of Florida at Gainesville.
   _The Dallas Museum of Art will install a digital counter
enumerating the worldwide AIDS toll and erect black walls with the
names of artists who have died of AIDS at the entrances.
   _The Louisiana State Museum will place mourning wreaths on the
historic houses it administers around New Orleans.
   _The J. Paul Getty museum in Malibu, Calif., will dim the lights
in its photography galleries.
   _The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the city's Museum of
Contemporary Art will waive their admission fees and suggest the
money be donated to the AIDS Project-Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Despite Changes, East Germans Unprepared for Currency Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An East German economic recovery like the one
that transformed war-ravaged West Germany into one of the world's
richest nations, hangs on the fate of a crudely minted,
featherweight coin.
   East Germany's aluminum Ostmark is non-convertible abroad and
quickly losing its value at home due to a dearth of goods and a
free fall on illegal exchange markets.
   West German financial experts consider currency reform to be a
crucial first step toward a convertible Ostmark and economic
recovery.
   But even the most committed reformers in the communist state
have so far resisted the idea of forcing a nation nurtured on
socialist promises of security to endure the draconian transition
to a currency of real value.
   East Germans have $84 billion stashed in savings banks _ the
equivalent of more than $5,000 for every man, woman and child in
the nation.
   That poses a massive threat of inflation, as well testifying to
a chronic lack of anything desireable to buy in East Germany.
   Price controls have to be removed or drastically reduced to
bring the cost of goods in line with the cost of their production,
economists on both sides agree. But prices would skyrocket if state
controls were lifted while so much cash is at the ready.
   Western economists therefore recommend a currency reform, or
replacement of the long-disdained Ostmarks with a new currency that
people will respect.
   ``Whatever else needs to be done hinges on a currency reform,''
said Liane Launhardt, a senior economist with West Germany's
Commerzbank. ``We feel it is pivotal for introducing market
economic elements and getting important projects off the ground.''
   She described the move as ``bitter potion that no one in East
Germany wants to swallow,'' but like other Western economists said
widespread unrest will be unleashed if runaway inflation results
from attempted half-measures.
   ``How soon a currency reform could be implemented depends on how
long it takes to accept economic reform as the way out of the
current crisis,'' said Norbert Walter, spokesman for Deutsche Bank,
West Germany's largest financial institution.
   Deutsche Bank President Alfred Herrhausen predicts East Germans
could enjoy the same living standards as West Germany in five to 10
years if they quickly come to grips with the nationwide sacrifices
needed in the interim.
   West Germany's post-war recovery was achieved in large part
because of the 1948 currency reform that replaced the inflated
Reichmarks with Deutschmarks at a rate of 10-1.
   The measure immediately infused confidence in the currency and
put an end to the ``cigarette economy,'' where food and other
necessities were valued in American tobacco.
   But it devastated the personal wealth of most Germans in the
occupied Western sectors and inflicted harsh sacrifice on those
without property and other tangible assets.
   The East German government is not prepared to wipe out private
cash reserves deliberately, said Finance Ministry spokesman Franz
Koeckerbauer.
   ``We don't consider it necessary,'' he said. ``We are trying to
encourage citizens to have confidence in the financial system, and
such measures would run counter to that aim.''
   East Germany's new finance minister, Uta Nickel, has likewise
brushed off Western suggestions that subsidies be drastically
reduced in the transition to market-related pricing.
   ``Changes to the practice of subsidies must be considered with
all caution,'' Ms. Nickel told the labor newspaper Tribuene.
``Everyone is now criticizing the subsidies, as if they hadn't been
enjoying them for years.''
   The views being expressed by East German and West German
economists on the need for currency reform reflect the sensitive
political situation complicating recovery.
   Communists have held power since the East German state was
founded in the Soviet-occupied sector of defeated Germany in 1949,
and to suddenly advocate measures undertaken by West Germany four
decades ago would be tantamount to an admission of political errors.
   The Communists face challenges to their continued rule both from
unrecognized opposition movements and from the smaller political
parties they have been aligned with for 40 years.
   East Germany needs a new and more-secure political system in
place before it can seriously tackle economic measures of the
magnitude of a currency reform and convertibility, according to
Manfred Milzer of the West Berlin-based German Institute for
Economic Research.
   But time is running against restraint, especially since East
Germans have been allowed to travel freely to the West.
   Untold thousands have smuggled out their excess currency and
traded it as low as 20 Ostmarks to one West German mark, flooding
the illegal market to the point that free traders will no longer
buy the East German currency at any price.
   Jochen Zimmermann, head of Berliner Bank's foreign exchange
division, said estimates run as high as $1.6 billion on the amount
of East German currency traded illegally in the West by tourists
wanting funds for weekend shopping sprees.
   Ms. Nickel, the finance minister, has proposed a value of 4.4
Ostmarks per West German mark as an internal conversion rate to
provide tourists with travel money.
   But no realistic rate has been mentioned in East Berlin as a
target for eventual convertibility to hard currencies.
   Internal reforms, like replacement of the Ostmark, are viewed as
necessary to even start aiming for conversion, said Berliner Bank's
Zimmermann.
   Noting that initial West German offers of assistance have been
rebuffed as interference, Zimmermann said a convertible currency is
``clearly a long way off.''

<HEAD>ANC's Mbeki Gets Honorary Degree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Govan Mbeki received an honorary
doctorate degree from the University of the Western Cape on
Wednesday, the first leader of the outlawed African National
Congress to be so honored in South Africa.
   ``We live in exciting and disturbing times when much of the
world seems to be in the process of renewal,'' Mbeki said after
receiving the philosophy doctorate from the university's
chancellor, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   ``We are fortunate that this happens on the eve of our own
liberation,'' Mbeki said. South Africa should ``draw on the
experiences of other countries and tap the African experience so
that what we build does not repeat the mistakes that the sister
peoples on our continent have made,'' he added.
   Although he argued that capitalism was the foundation for
apartheid, Mbeki challenged the view ``expressed in some circles
that genuine democracy would result in the masses descending on the
economy like a swarm of rapacious locusts, eating up everything in
their path without regard to the vital question of persuing an
economic policy that would guarantee growth and development.''
   Mbeki's imprisoned colleague, Nelson Mandela, sent a message of
congratulations that was read by his wife, Winnie.
   ``This is the first time a South African University will honor a
red-hot freedom fighter who has spent years in prison and has
emerged from that harsh experience with his convictions
unscathed,'' the message said.
   Mrs. Mandela received a standing ovation from the audience of
about 1,000 as she took the stage to read her husband's words.
Earlier this year, black anti-apartheid leaders had distanced
themselves from Mrs. Mandela, accusing her of complicity in the
death of a teen-age activist and her bodyguards of conducting a
``reign of terror'' in the Johannesburg township of Soweto.
   Since the men imprisoned for life with her husband in 1964 were
freed last month, she had made several appearances with them.
Mandela is the only one of the group still imprisoned for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mbeki, 79, was freed in 1987 after 24 years in jail. After
holding two news conferences, at which he declared he believed in
the actions for which he was sentenced and remained a member of the
outlawed ANC and the South African Communist Party, he was
prohibited from making public appearances or statements until his
restrictions were lifted last month.
   Mbeki, the son of a Xhosa tribal chief, earned university
degrees in education and economics before he helped found the ANC's
military wing. He worked as a teacher, journalist, store owner and
union organizer. While in prison, he earned an advanced degree in
economics by correspondence course and was awarded an honorary
doctorate in social science by the University of Amsterdam for his
book, ``The Peasant Revolt.''

<HEAD>Rare Birds Fly Straight Into Windmill Blades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State officials want to know why majestic
birds of prey capable of spotting a mouse from aircraft altitudes
fly straight into the whirling blades of windmills at the Altamont
Pass energy farm.
   Since 1986, a total of 99 eagles, falcons, hawks and owls have
been killed at the farm's thousands of 40-foot windmills,
considered one of the most environmentally safe ways to generate
electricity.
   The California Energy Commission is spending $120,000 to find
out why.
   ``These birds may have the sharpest eyes, but they don't
necessarily have the biggest brains,'' said Susan Orloff, a senior
wildlife biologist with Biosystems Analysis Inc., the Tiburon
company hired to do the study.
   ``At this point we really don't know why they're doing this,''
Orloff said.
   Altamont Pass, with 6,700 windmills sprouting like steel daisies
over 80 square miles along Interstate 580 near Livermore, is the
world's largest and most productive wind farm.
   California produces more than 90 percent of the world's
wind-generated electricity, and Altamont is the largest of the
state's six wind farms. Together, they produce enough power for a
city the size of San Jose.
   The pass is also a traditional migratory path where birds of
prey hunt for food during their flight down the state's Central
Valley to winter in Mexico.
   The state Energy Commission study, administered by Contra Costa,
Alameda and Solano counties, is being conducted during the spring,
fall and winter seasons at Altamont Pass. Five Biosystems Analysis
biologists are counting birds and studying their behavior every day
at the farm.
   They speculate the birds, despite their sharp vision, may be
mistaking the windmills for trees. They may also be concentrating
so intently on their prey that they don't see the whirling blades,
Orloff said.
   Researchers are experimenting with ways to deter the birds,
possibly using noise or painting the windmills a bright color.
Local ordinances, however, aimed at preventing eyesores prevent
windmill operators from painting the windmills.
   Mike DeAngelis, manager of the state energy commission's
research and development office, said he doubts that any of those
ideas will work. ``If this is a problem, it's going to remain a
problem,'' he said.
   U.S. Wind Power, which operates nearly half the windmills at
Altamont Pass, also has hired a biologist to study ways of stopping
the deaths, said Lori Adams, a business development associate for
the company.
   ``It's really a shame that this happens, and we'd like to do
what we can to make sure it doesn't happen at all,'' said Adams.
   The company has built roosts on power line poles to keep the
birds from electrocuting themselves by sitting on lines and has
developed a manual to help field workers handle accidents.
   It also contributes money to a shelter in Stockton for injured
birds of prey.

<HEAD>ACLU Asks Probe of Thornburgh Decision in CIA Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: INSERTS 9th graf: ``CIA Director,'' with Webster comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union asked
Congress Wednesday to investigate Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's decision leading to dismissal of the Iran-Contra case
against a former CIA station chief.
   There is a ``strong possibility'' Thornburgh's action regarding
Joseph Fernandez stemmed in part from the CIA's desire ``to cover
up its involvement in the Iran-Contra affair,'' Morton Halperin,
director of the ACLU's Washington office, said in a statement.
   A week ago, Thornburgh filed an affidavit blocking disclosure of
classified information relating to the location of three CIA
facilities in Central America and details of three agency programs
in Costa Rica. Thornburgh was acting on behalf of U.S. intelligence
agencies.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton threw out the criminal
charges aganst Fernandez on Friday, saying the CIA's ex-station
chief in Costa Rica needed to use the classified information in
order to get a fair trial. The office of independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh is appealing.
   In a session with reporters Wednesday, Thornburgh said he
expected the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond will
allow the trial to go forward by overturning Hilton's refusal to
allow substitutions for the classified information.
   Thornburgh refused to discuss the information when asked if it
revealed CIA involvement in covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels, as
claimed by Fernandez.
   ``These are troublesome areas,'' Thornburgh said, noting that
when he headed the criminal division of the Justice Department in
the Ford administration he revoked an order giving the CIA power to
determine ``who could be prosecuted within their organization.''
   ``I found that to be unthinkable. That's a decision that has to
be made by prosecutors in the Department of Justice.''
   CIA Director William Webster, answering questions after a
luncheon speech Wednesday at the National Press Club, was asked if
the CIA were trying to protect Fernandez. He replied, ``That's
absolutely without merit.''
   Halperin, in a letter to Congress, said, ``Congress should ...
investigate whether the attorney general acted properly in refusing
to release information required to allow the trial to go forward.''
   It went to the leadership of the Senate and House intelligence
committees and judiciary committees.
   ``This case gives the appearance of a conflict of interest,''
the letter stated.
   ``Neither the Bush administration, represented by the attorney
general, nor the intelligence community had an interest in seeing
this case go to trial,'' said the letter.
   ``The intelligence community may have been much more interested
in protecting Fernandez and its relationship with him than in
protecting vital national security secrets,'' the letter added.
   The case against Fernandez was being handled by Walsh's office
and ``the attorney general had no stake in the prosecution,'' said
Halperin.
   The attorney general ``appears simply to have followed the
dictates of the intelligence agencies in refusing to disclose the
information,'' the letter stated.
   In filing the unprecedented affidavit, Thornburgh invoked a
provision of the Classified Information Procedures Act. The law
requires the attorney general to report to Congress in all cases
where the prosecution cannot proceed because the government bars
disclosure of classified information.
   It was sent to Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and William Cohen,
R-Maine, of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Boren is chairman
and Cohen is vice chairman. The letter also was sent to Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., ranking minority member of the Judiciary
Committee.
   The letter also was sent to Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and U.S. Reps. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas, and Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y. Brooks is chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee and Fish is a Judiciary Committee
member.

<HEAD>Possible Serial Killings Spread Fear Among Prostitutes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of prostitutes on the city's
streets has dropped dramatically in the past few weeks as the
number of unsolved killings of young women has grown to 13, police
say.
   Seven bodies of young women have been found in the Rochester
area in the past two months. The most recent victim was Elizabeth
A. Gibson, 29, whose body was found Monday by a hunter. On
Thanksgiving Day, the body of June Stotts, also 29, was discovered
in Rochester's Genesee River gorge.
   Of the 13 unsolved slayings in the Rochester area in the past
two years, police have identified all but three of the victims as
prostitutes. Another prostitute has been missing since early
November.
   Rochester police say that solving the killings is their top
priority, but no arrests have been made and they have refused to
comment on whether they have any suspects.
   ``I think the murders will continue'' until the killer or
killers are found, Deputy Chief Terrence Rickard said this week. He
said there may be at least three killers responsible for the deaths.
   Many of the city's prostitutes fear they are being stalked by a
serial killer.
   ``I'm scared to death,'' said Debra, a 24-year-old prostitute,
as she paced nervously on a corner north of downtown recently. ``If
it wasn't for my drug habit I wouldn't be here anyway.''
   Rickard said the number of prostitutes working the city's
streets has declined dramatically since mid-November. Debra said
she tries to stay off the street as much as possible but sometimes
``you can't help it.''
   Sister Eileen Conheady, a nun who has worked for years with
prostitutes, said she has been to the funerals of some of the
victims and talked with their friends.
   ``The next day, I've seen them back on the street,'' she said.
   Sister Conheady said public attention to the string of deaths
was slow in coming because prostitutes are considered ``the most
disposable of people.''
   ``Why has it taken so many deaths to arouse our attention?'' she
said. ``People think they can take out violence on them because
they're not worth anything.''
   On weekend nights, nearly as many police cars as prostitutes
cruise Lyell Avenue, a strip of liquor stores, pizza joints and
neon-lit bars just a few blocks from the Genesee River Gorge. Eight
of the victims have been found along the gorge within a few miles
of one another.
   Debra said the officers are all over the neighborhood, telling
the prostitutes to stay off the streets.
   Yvette, 20, who did not want her last name used, said police
follow prostitutes on their tricks. It makes her feel safer, she
said.
   She said she has started carrying a knife. ``If someone tries to
do something to me, I'll hurt them.''
   At least four of the victims were strangled or choked, one was
shot, two were beaten to death and one was hit by a car while
fleeing an attacker. Police have not determined the cause of death
of the five other victims.
   Rickard said solving crimes involving prostitutes is complicated
because many of them are transitory. They come to Rochester and
work for a while, then leave with few clues after they are arrested
or get into trouble, he said.

<TEXT>
   In the latest disclosure of alleged
corruption in the top Communist ranks, newspapers Wednesday said
that the former premier of East Germany turned a park into a
private estate.
   The Communist leadership that took over last month has launched
a campaign to expose abuses by former party officials, who could
face prosecution. The aim is to improve the embattled party's image
and restore its credibility.
   The official Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland
reported that Willi Stoph, the former premier, lived ``surrounded
by Western luxury'' on an estate containing several houses, fruit
plantations and an indoor pool. He employed servants, including
three gardeners, the newspaper said.
   Stoph, who was fired from the Politburo, resigned as premier on
Nov. 7.
   The trade union newspaper Tribuene said the estate was located
within a protected wildlife area on which Stoph built roads to
carry his family and guests in Volvo sedans ``when he didn't use a
helicopter.''
   The report said the estate contained more than 10 large
refrigerators filled with food imported from the West, along with
hundreds of bottles of the ``finest imported wine.''
   Stoph left the estate after he lost his posts, Neues Deutschland
said, ``taking his most beloved furniture and other things with a
truck.''
   Tribuene said the house looked ``like it had been left in
panic.''
   Neither newspaper gave Stoph's whereabouts.
   The party commission investigating corruption allegations said
Wednesday it will turn over its findings to judicial officials.
   The official news agency ADN said the commission recommended
that the party's Central Committee expel former non-voting
Politburo member Gerhard Mueller. The report did not elaborate.
   The agency also said three officials expelled from the party in
the 1950s had been rehabilitated, and that the expulsions of other
former leaders were being reviewed.
   Also on Wednesday, the Communist-dominated trade union
federation expelled former chief Harry Tisch. He was removed from
the ruling Politburo this month for allegedly abusing his powers.
   The lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major
source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to
wait 10 years or more for a car.
   Since taking over from ousted hard-line leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18, Egon Krenz has begun a program of sweeping reforms that
includes promises of free elections and abolition of the
Communists' 40-year monopoly of power.
   Krenz himself has moved from the exclusive residential compound
of Wandlitz, just north of East Berlin, to a modest house in the
city.
   The wooded, walled-in compound has been home to high-ranking
Communist Party members. Tribuene said several former Politburo
members and two current ones still live in Wandlitz, but that it
would be turned into a rehabilitation center. Honecker is among
those still living in the compound.
   Neues Deutschland said the Communist Party had ordered that a
special shop in Wandlitz be emptied of rare Western-made consumer
goods, such as video recorders.
   The Communist party has blamed Honecker and former economy chief
Guenter Mittag for East Germany's economic crisis and has begun a
disciplinary investigation of them. Mittag already has been kicked
out of the party.

<HEAD>Peres Praises Poland for Offer to Help Move Convent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres praised
the Polish government on Wednesday for offering to help move a
Roman Catholic convent located on the edge of the Auschwitz
concentration camp.
   Peres said the government had offered land and financial support
to build a new convent for the Carmelite nuns living in an
abandoned theater used by the Nazis as a storehouse during World
War II.
   ``I appreciate the position taken by the Polish government,''
Peres said. ``I was told the Polish government offered land and
financial support and they expect the Catholic church to do the
rest.''
   The presence of the convent at the camp where up to 2.5 million
Jews were murdered by the Nazis is considered deeply offensive to
Jews and severely strained Jewish-Catholic relations.
   Tension mounted earlier this year when the Roman Catholic church
failed to honor a 1987 agreement to move the convent. Under
pressure from the Vatican, Primate Jozef Glemp in September pledged
to move the convent.
   ``I do not see why this Carmelite monastery should hang like a
cloud on our relations,'' Peres said.
   Peres visited the former concentration camp Wednesday on the
final day of a three-day visit to Poland during which Poland said
it would restore full diplomatic relations with Israel early next
year.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski on Monday informed Peres
of Warsaw's decision to restore relations with Israel broken off 22
years ago.
   Peres also met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and said he
had invited the union leader to Israel.
   Walesa told Peres, ``We should tighten our cooperation. Poland
is pursuing reforms. In these reforms your participation is
indispensable.''
   A major aim of Peres' visit was to improve economic cooperation.
Polish trade with Israel will amount to $40 million this year,
compared with $22.3 million last year.
   Walesa also evoked the common history of the two peoples who
existed together for centuries in Poland.
   ``Let us remember this was a country of two peoples. The war
destroyed the Jewish people and to this day we feel the shortage,''
Walesa said.
   Poland had the largest Jewish population in Eastern Europe until
the Holocaust claimed 3 million of Poland's 3.5 million Jews, with
nearly all the rest emigrating after World War II.
   There has been a steady warming in relations between the two
countries in recent years with senior Israeli and Polish officials,
cultural figures and private groups exchanging visits.
   Except for Romania, all Warsaw Pact nations severed diplomatic
relations with Israel following the 1967 Middle East War.

   Customs agents detected what they thought was
a bomb in a suitcase headed for a Colombian airliner Wednesday and
a bomb squad blew it up, but analysis of the debris revealed the
luggage contained a video game.
   ``It wasn't an explosive device. It was a Nintendo game,''
police Lt. Helen Kidder said after experts examined the smashed
remains.
   Customs officials will reimburse the owners of the destroyed
suitcase, police said.
   Drug traffickers have waged a campaign of bombings and
assassinations in Colombia in retaliation for stepped up efforts to
curtail their business and concern was heightened with Monday's
crash of an Avianca Airlines plane.
   All 107 people aboard the plane were killed when it exploded
this week near Bogota and initial reports, later dismissed by
investigators, blamed the crash on terrorists.
   ``This got more publicity because of the Avianca jet
explosion,'' police Officer Bill Frio said after Wednesday's scare.
   Customs agents X-raying luggage checked in early Wednesday at
Los Angeles International Airport spotted what appeared to be
sticks of dynamite, wiring and a clock inside a large, heavy
suitcase destined for an Avianca flight to Bogota. The plane had
not yet arrived.
   A police bomb squad put the suitcase and an explosive charge
inside a protective canister and set off the charge to blow up the
luggage and detonate any explosive it might contain.
   ``What they saw was what they believed to be an explosive
device. Our bomb squad acted on that information and we exploded it
in the canister,'' said Frio.
   A New York spokeswoman for Avianca, Colombia's national airline,
said security had been tightened since Monday's crash.
   ``There is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that
jet,'' spokeswoman Cecelia Battista said. ``Security has always
been tight but it is even tighter now.''

<TEXT>
   The Communist-controlled
Parliament on Wednesday swiftly ended the party's 40-year monopoly
on power in a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the growing
pro-democracy movement.
   A member of the ruling Communist Politburo said the first free
elections in four decades could be held within a year.
   Voting with the somber, mechanical gestures born of decades of
rubberstamp approval of Communist measures, the 309 deputies
unanimously scrapped Article 4 of the constitution, which mandated
the leading role of the Communist Party. They also deleted a clause
that bases all education on Marxism-Leninism.
   ``The revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected,''
said Jiri Dienstbier, spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition,
minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television.
   The changes were among historic concessions the opposition won
from the Communist government on Tuesday when Premier Ladislav
Adamec also promised to form a new government, including
non-Communists, by Sunday.
   They followed 11 straight days of huge anti-government
demonstrations, which culminated in a two-hour strike on Monday in
which millions of workers participated.
   Adamec went on national TV and said he had asked Civic Forum for
its suggestions on who to include in the new government. He also
said he would negotiate a reassessment of the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion that crushed reforms.
   Civic Forum proposed that the new Defense Minister be a civilian
Communist, and the Interior Minister, who controls the police, be a
civilian non-Communist, Dienstbier said.
   Parliament also eliminated the Communists' leading position in
the National Front, an umbrella organization embracing all
political parties and social groups allowed in Czechoslovakia. Four
deputies opposed the measure and 16 abstained.
   Shortly after the historic votes, state TV showed Slovak actor
Milan Knazko announcing word of the changes to a packed National
Theater in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia. The entire audience,
which included prominent dissident Vaclav Havel, rose to its feet
in thunderous, minute-long applause.
   Parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional
court and a commission to investigate allegations of police
brutality in a crackdown on protesters Nov. 17.
   The removal of the requirement that Marxism-Leninism be the
guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who
staged the Nov. 17 protest and have led the pro-democracy movement
since.
   In parliamentary debate, broadcast live on TV for the first
time, deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the
Communists must work hard to win the people's confidence.
   ``We have betrayed the trust of the electorate, and whatever
laws we pass today will not change this,'' said Blanka Hykova of
the Socialist Party, until recently a docile ally of the Communists.
   Anton Blazej, dean of a Communist Party training academy, said:
``We have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its
position. We must regain this trust.''
   Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik, a member of Parliament, sounded
a cautionary note: ``I am aware that neither the army nor the party
have the best position now. We should be aware that retreats and
compromises are necessary, but there are limits.''
   Alois Indra, who said Tuesday he was quitting as Parliament
president, delivered a formal speech of resignation to the
350-member chamber.
   He described the resignation as ``a logical step in the context
of the present developments.''
   Indra was said to be among party leaders who requested the
Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' of reform instituted by Alexander Dubcek, then Communist
Party chief.
   Bretislav Nedbalek, secretary of a preparatory committee, said
Czechoslovakia's Social Democratic Party had been re-established
after an absence of 41 years.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II prayed that Czechoslovakia
would use its Christian traditions in building its ``new future.''
   About 5,000 people attended a Communist-sponsored rally
Wednesday at Ostrava, an industrial city near the Polish border,
including supporters of the opposition group Civic Forum.
   Senek Milota, a local party leader, told the rally, ``We don't
want to eat soup from a charity kitchen,'' an apparent reference to
the party giving up power. Civic Forum backers jeered loudly, but
no trouble was reported.
   Vasil Mohorita of the party's ruling Politburo said Wednesday
that free elections could be held within a year, now that the
Communist Party has agreed to relinquish its monopoly on power.
   Mohorita, the first member of the new leadership to face the
international press, was asked a news conference when Czechoslovaks
would have a chance to vote freely, and replied:
   ``First, it is necessary to change the laws. Most probably it
will take place within a year. We don't want the monopoly of one
party to continue.''
   Party chief Karel Urbanek said Tuesday the Communists were ready
to give up their exclusive control.
   Despite repeated questions, Mohorita did not say specifically
the party would hand over control if it lost free elections, but he
stressed several times: ``We're a different party now, and you all
should get used to it.''
   He conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is under
pressure from its own 1.7 million members as well as the
opposition, and said a special party congress tentatively set for
Jan. 26 might have to be held sooner.
   At a closed meeting of 3,500 party activists Tuesday night,
Urbanek said ``the future of the party requires giving up the
monopoly of power'' amd many opposition demands are acceptable, the
official news agency CTK reported.
   Differences exist, he added, but ``we shall have to get used to
making politics not only with those who agree with you.''
   Urbanek said Civic Forum's demands that the the party disband
the People's Militia, its private army, and get out of the
workplace were ``totally unacceptable,'' however.
   Civic Forum has also demanded the resignation of President
Gustav Husak by Dec. 10. Husak, who is closely associated with
Dubcek's ouster, was quoted on the state news agency CTK as saying
he was unwilling to step down before his current five-year term,
his third as President, ends in May.

   A deadlocked jury prompted a judge to
declare a mistrial Wednesday in the racketeering case of three
1970s radicals, two days after they were cleared of charges of
plotting to overthrow the government.
   U.S. District Judge William Young granted a defense motion for a
mistrial after the jury announced for the third straight day it was
unable to decide whether the group's alleged bombing exploits
constituted racketeering.
   Prosecutors claim Raymond Levasseur, his wife, Patricia, and
Richard Williams were part of a group operating under the names
United Freedom Front and Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit that
took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank robberies
along the East Coast from 1976 to 1984.
   One of the bombings, at a courthouse in Boston in 1976, cost one
man his lower leg. Some other bombs failed to explode.
   Raymond Levasseur and Williams already are serving lengthy terms
for convictions in connection with some of the bombings.
Levasseur's wife is free on bail after serving 3{ years of a
five-year term for harboring a fugitive, her husband.
   Young set a hearing Jan. 5 in Boston, at which time the
government will decide whether to retry the racketeering conspiracy
charges.
   Defense attorney Elizabeth Fink called for an end to the
proceedings.
   ``What we ask is that everybody call (U.S. Attorney) Wayne Budd,
that everybody call the Department of Justice and ask that this
farce, this fiasco be stopped,'' Fink said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks declined to comment after
the mistrial was declared.
   On Monday, after 19 days of deliberations in the yearlong trial,
jurors delivered a partial verdict acquitting the trio of seditious
conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government. At the time jurors
said they seriously doubted they could reach agreement on the
racketeering charges.
   The defendants had no visible reaction as the mistrial was
announced, but immediately handed out a prepared statement claiming
the government had suffered a ``significant loss.''
   ``We commend the courage of the jury in the face of a very
vindictive and politically motivated prosecution,'' the statement
said.
   Jurors had already cleared Mrs. Levasseur of racketeering and
were deciding the same charge against the two men as well as a
charge of racketeering conspiracy against all three. Each count
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $20,000 in fines.
   The racketeering charges include 15 successful or attempted
bombings of courthouses, banks, corporate offices and military
recruiting and reserve centers.
   Originally, eight people were indicted. Some charges were later
dropped and other defendants have been convicted in separate trials
on some of the bombings. The Springfield prosecution pulled the
case together through racketeering laws that allow several people
to be tried for incidents occurring in several states.

<HEAD>Nuclear Industry Applauds New Approach to Opening Waste Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nuclear industry on Wednesday applauded
the Energy Department's decision to sue Nevada over its refusal to
allow construction of a high-level nuclear waste dump. Nevada's
governor said, ``We're not going to be influenced by threats.''
   The department announced Tuesday night it would give Nevada 30
days to grant the environmental permits needed to study the
proposed dump site at Yucca Mountain. After that the Justice
Department will take the state to court, Deputy Secretary Henson
Moore told a nuclear industry meeting in San Francisco.
   Gov. Bob Miller said Wednesday the state would not back down
from its opposition to the dump, which would entomb tons of
radioactive wastes for 10,000 years.
   ``We're not going to be influenced by threats when we have
already taken conclusive and decisive action in expressing our
opposition to the dump,'' Miller said in a telephone interview.
   ``They want us to take this like a dose of castor oil,'' he
said. ``But this isn't castor oil they want us to swallow. This is
poison.''
   Nevada has fought the project since Congress declared in 1987
that Yucca Mountain, situated about 100 miles northwest of Las
Vegas, would be the only site considered for a dump. Earlier this
year the Nevada Legislature passed a bill prohibiting the federal
government from placing any high-level nuclear waste in the state.
   Moore said the department had given up trying to persuade Miller
to drop his state's opposition to the project.
   ``Court is not our preferred course of action, but enough is
enough,'' Moore said.
   Moore also announced that Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had
decided after lengthy review of the Yucca Mountain project that all
sub-surface testing of the site would be put off for two years.
That, in combination with other changes in the project, means the
dump will not open before 2010, Moore said.
   The department originally planned to the open the dump by 1998.
Last year it pushed the target date back to 2003, but failure to
complete surface-based testing and Nevada's refusal to grant
environmental permits has forced a further delay.
   Nuclear industry groups cheered Moore's announcement, despite
the fact that it pushes back by seven years the date when utilities
can get rid of the tons of high-level waste they have been
``temporarily'' storing at reactor sites for three decades.
   ``The announced delay in the completion of the waste repository
is regrettable,'' said the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the
nuclear industry's main lobby group. ``But the important thing is
that DOE has ... a plan that puts us on a path toward resolving the
administrative and political problems. ...''
   The Edison Electric Institute, the trade group of investor-owned
electric utilities, said it was pleased that Watkins had developed
a plan to revitalize the project.
   ``We have long recognized that the repository would be delayed;
we just hope that the new schedule is realistic,'' said David
Swanson, the group's senior vice president.
   Moore's announcement also brings to the fore a related dispute
between the state and federal governments over whether to build an
interim dump for nuclear waste.
   The interim facility originally was proposed for Tennessee, but
the state fought the project and Congress ordered a special
commission to recommend how to proceed. The commission earlier this
month told Congress that some form of interim storage was needed
because of uncertainty about opening the Nevada dump, but it made
no recommendation on where the interim facility should be built.
   Moore said the department would press Congress for legislation
to build an interim facility.
   Moore also announced that Watkins had sent to the White House a
suggested nominee to be director of the civilian nuclear waste
management office, which has been without a permanent director for
two years. Department officials on Wednesday declined to identify
the proposed nominee, but congressional and other sources have said
it is John Bartlett, a former nuclear engineeering executive.
   Jacqueline Johnson, a department spokesman, said Bartlett has
been hired as a consultant to Watkins on ``waste management
issues.'' She declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Changes in Eastern Europe Creating Instability, Webster Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapid change in Eastern Europe has created a
new and uncertain era where hope for the demise of communist
systems is accompanied by dangerous instability, CIA Director
William Webster said Wednesday.
   ``As the hard edges of the world recede, the threats we face
have become more numerous, more diffuse and more difficult to
define,'' Webster said in a speech to the National Press Club.
   He said intelligence that concentrates on counting Soviet
military forces and tracing Moscow's influence around the world is
giving way to the need to spy on drug traffickers, assess Third
World conflicts and verify arms-control treaties.
   Moves in Eastern Europe will open new economic opportunities for
the West, he said. But those moves also represent ``the most
immediate threat to internal political stability. The reformers
face stiff odds'' because of the need for economic austerity
measures that will bring popular unrest, he said.
   As the Soviet grip on its satellites loosens, the Central
Intelligence Agency and spy services of U.S. allies agree that
Moscow's own intelligence activities around the world are growing,
Webster said.
   ``Around the world, our stations are reporting more aggressive
action, a more robst intelligence-collection effort, more efforts
to recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seen
in a long time,'' he said.
   Many of the moves appear aimed at stealing U.S. or allied
technology, he said. ``As less money is dedicated to that
particular effort inside the Soviet Union, more and more effort
needs to be applied to obtain that kind of technology through
clandestine means. And that's what we're experiencing.''
   Much of his speech appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts
for the CIA and other intelligence agencies in the government as
the Pentagon _ in whose budget most intelligence operations are
hidden _ prepares for substantial cuts in the next few years.
   While the precise figures are secret, U.S. intelligence
reportedly spends $25 billion to $30 billion a year, just under 10
percent of the defense budget. He conceded that intelligence, after
receiving substantial budget increases in recent years, may be in
for ``a period of flat budget growth.''
   ``The lowering of the military threat only advances other
responsibilities of ours,'' Webster said, particularly in the areas
of arms-control verification. The agency now is watching
implementation of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty at
120 sites inside the Soviet Union. If a strategic arms treaty is
concluded, monitoring will involve 2,500 sites, he noted.
   The agency is in the middle of an expensive five-year bolstering
of its satellite spying capability.
   On other topics, Webster said:
   _The Salvadoran FMLN rebels continue to ``make a symbolic and
important statement about their ability to keep causing trouble''
through urban attacks, but pose no threat to the rightist
government of Alfredo Cristiani. It is clear the rebels are
receiving Soviet bloc weaponry and ``we have a right to assume a
Soviet involvement.''
   _It is time for the debate over a longstanding U.S. ban on
participation in assassinations of foreign leaders, revived after a
failed coup in Panama, to fade from public attention. Ambiguities
about the policy with congressional overseers have been eliminated
and it is now clear that the risk of violence in a coup ``is not to
be equated with participation in assassination.''
   _He will not predict whether President Bush will sign a bill
authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year that would
create for the first time an independent inspector general at the
CIA. The inspector general would answer to Congress as well as the
agency director, which ``will have adverse effects on our liaisons
with other intelligence agencies'' because they will be less
inclined to trust what they say will be kept secret, he said. ``If
it becomes law, we will do our best to make it work.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Abortion Parental-Notice Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was asked Wednesday to rule
that most young girls have no right to abortions without first
telling their parents.
   The justices, who have allowed limits on the availability of
abortions for minors in the past, questioned lawyers defending and
attacking parental-notification laws in Minnesota and Ohio.
   In two hours of relatively narrow arguments, they gave no sign
they are considering the broader possibility of scrapping the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion _ an
idea much discussed outside the court whenever they take up any
abortion case.
   ``The court showed no interest in overturning a woman's
constitutional right to abortion,'' Cleveland lawyer Linda Sogg
said after the argument session in which she attacked the Ohio law.
   Minnesota Chief Deputy Attorney General John Tunheim agreed. ``I
don't think Roe should be on the table in this case,'' he told
reporters after defending his state law before the court.
   Last July, the court voted 5-4 to give states more authority to
regulate abortions for all women. Four justices appeared ready to
go even further and overturn Roe vs. Wade, but Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor refused.
   Groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the
court this term to help clarify its allegiance to the 1973 decision.
   But settlement of an Illinois dispute over regulating abortion
clinics _ a case that was to be argued before the justices next
month _ may have eliminated the greatest immediate threat to Roe
vs. Wade. The Illinois settlement still must be approved by a
federal judge.
   O'Connor is expected to play the pivotal role again in the
Minnesota and Ohio cases, to be decided by July. At issue in both
are laws requiring parents to be notified before abortions are
performed on unmarried girls under 18 who are still supported by
parents.
   About half the states have laws requiring parental notification
_ or even parental consent _ in such cases, but most of the laws
have been invalidated after court challenges.
   Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers
who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million
legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _
180,000 a year _ have been for girls 17 and younger.
   The Ohio law requires that one of a minor's parents be notified
by a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed. The
girl can avoid telling her parent if she persuades a judge she is
mature enough to make the decision on her own, or that telling her
parents is not in her best interest.
   The Minnesota law requires that the minor's two biological
parents be notified at least 48 hours before she has an abortion. A
judicial bypass alternative also is provided.
   Both Tunheim, Minnesota's lawyer, and Ohio Assistant Attorney
General Rita Eppler argued that states do not have to provide a
judicial alternative in such cases. But because both states do
provide them, the court might not have to say.
   O'Connor, vigorously questioning Tunheim, seemed deeply troubled
by Minnesota's two-parent requirement.
   ``The statute just doesn't provide for any exceptions, even when
it's not in the child's best interest,'' O'Connor said. ``How do
you defend the state's interest'' in requiring both parents be
notified, she asked Tunheim.
   O'Connor also quizzed Ms. Eppler about that portion of the Ohio
law requiring a girl to prove her maturity by ``clear and
convincing evidence.'' O'Connor asked whether the standard might be
too stringent, resulting in a ``greater risk of erroneous
deprivation'' of a minor's abortion right.
   O'Connor never has said whether she believes such a right to
abortion _ for any woman _ exists.
   The court in 1981 allowed states to require parental
notification before minors' abortions, but the focus in that Utah
case was limited to how the state law was applied to ``immature''
minors.
   Ms. Eppler said the Ohio law ``represents no undue burden,'' and
properly balances a minor's rights with the need for parental
involvement ``when their daughter faces perhaps the most serious
dilemma of her young life.''
   But Ms. Sogg warned the court that ``not all parents are
loving.'' She said many girls seeking abortions need to be
protected from parental retaliation and abuse.
   The Minnesota law was in effect for five years before being
ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. A federal appeals court
later ruled that the law is valid, but blocked its enforcement
pending Supreme Court action.
   The Ohio law, enacted in 1985, never took effect due to a
successful legal challenge by an Akron abortion clinic and one of
its doctors.

<HEAD>Thwarted Romance Involving Exchange Student Prompts Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 students walked out of class
in freezing weather to protest what they considered an attempt to
break up a relationship between an exchange student and a high
school senior.
   Kelly LaPointe, 17, and her boyfriend, Iiro Lehtinen, 18, of
Kiviniemi, Finland, were infuriated when exchange program officials
transferred Lehtinen to a school in Maine, saying the relationship
was hurting his grades.
   Lehtinen said he was given two hours' notice on Nov. 11 that he
was being moved from Farmington to live with a new host family in
South Portland, Maine, about 90 minutes away by car.
   ``I have been treated unfairly,'' Lehtinen told Foster's Daily
Democrat. ``I would be happier in Farmington.''
   Susan Jackson, program coordinator for the Education Foundation
for Foreign Study in New Hampshire and Maine, said Lehtinen was
moved because his grades began to drop and he was not spending
enough time with his host family.
   The host family has repeatedly refused to comment on the issue.
   Lehtinen said he had been given two weeks to break up with
LaPointe and was told he might be sent home if he continued to see
her.
   Jackson said the two were not told to break up, but that
Lehtinen had been told he was seeing too much of LaPointe and not
enough of his host family.
   As a show of support for the couple, about one-third of the
student body walked out of Farmington High School Monday when the 8
a.m. bell summoned the start of classes. They stood outside in
freezing weather for about a half-hour.
   No disciplinary measures were taken against the students,
LaPointe said.
   Principal Ken Beaupre said he would welcome Lehtinen back to the
school if the program moved the teen-ager back to town.
   Lehtinen said he appreciated the students' show of support. He
said his father in Finland has contacted the foundation, demanding
that he be returned to Farmington.
   South Portland High School, where he now is enrolled, has 1,200
students, compared to Farmington's 300. ``There is a different
climate here in terms of friendships,'' he said.

<UNK>Armenians, Azerbaijanis Reject Karabakh Solution</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's latest bid to break a bitter
territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan was met
Wednesday with demonstrations, strikes and angry criticism from
both sides.
   On the final day of its fall session Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet
parliament overwhelmingly approved a directive disbanding a special
commission that had imposed direct rule from Moscow on the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh territory. The territory is located inside
Azerbaijan but the the majority of its population is Armenian.
   The decision appeared to give ultimate control over
Nagorno-Karabakh back to Azerbaijan. It ordered Azerbaijan
officials to work with reinstated local officials from
Nagorno-Karabakh to ensure law and order, economic and cultural
development in the region.
   It established a parliamentary oversight commission and said
that soldiers would remain in the region to ensure stability during
the transition.
   Officials of that commission have acknowledged that despite the
presence of Interior Ministry soldiers a virtual civil war has
raged there.
   The region's Armenian population, supported by the neighboring
Armenian republic, has demanding that it be annexed to Armenia
because of what it calls years of willful neglect by Azerbaijani
authorities.
   ``The whole resolution doesn't suit us,'' said Ektibar Mamedov,
a spokesman for the Azerbaijani People's Front Movement.
   Bobkin Arargetsyan, an Armenian activist, said the decision by
the Supreme Soviet parliament proved legislators ``can't make a
political decision based on the internationally recognized right of
self-determination.''
   Oleg Bakhshyan, a spokesman for the disbanded commission in
Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, said by telephone that
few people were happy with the decision.
   Activists from both sides said a general strike was under way in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Thousands of people gathered in the Armenian capital Yerevan on
Tuesday to protest the decision, said Arargetsyan, a member of
Armenia's Karabakh Committee. A joint meeting of the Armenian
Supreme Soviet legislature and Nagorno-Karabakh legislators was
scheduled Thursday, he said.
   In a continuation of the violence that has killed scores of
people since February 1988, Arargetsyan said a policeman was killed
in a border region between the two republics on Wednesday. He had
few details and the report could not be confirmed independently.
   Deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia walked out of the
Supreme Soviet session on Tuesday to protest the resolution, and
Arargetsyan said Armenian Communist Party official Golust Goloyan
appeared on local television Wednesday night to criticize the
Supreme Soviet's move.
   But Mamedov, the Azerbaijani activist, claimed that there was a
secret point to the agreement that prevents Azerbaijan from
interfering in the affairs of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   He predicted more violence in the mountainous region.

   The government Wednesday announced the
arrest of a man reputed to be one of Bolivia's two major cocaine
traffickers.
   Juan Carlos Lisboa Melgar, 35, was arrested Tuesday during a
raid on a home in Santa Cruz, a drug-trafficking center 335 miles
southeast of La Paz, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gonzalo Torrico
said.
   He said police found some high-powered weapons at Lisboa's
hideout, but that Lisboa did not resist arrest. Torrico did not
give details on the weapons.
   He said Lisboa owns the biggest cocaine-processing laboratory
ever uncovered in Bolivia. He said it can produce up to 8,800
pounds a week.
   Bolivia is a major source of coca, the leaf processed into
cocaine.
   According to Torrico, Lisboa had established links with
Colombian and Peruvian traffickers to smuggle the drug to the
United States and other markets.
   There was no immediate word on charges. Police had been hunting
Lisboa for a year, and the Supreme Court had begun a trial in
abstentia.
   The country's most-wanted drug-trafficking suspect, Jorge Roca
Suarez, is still at large.

<HEAD>De Klerk Says Media Restrictions to Be Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk said
Wednesday the government is considering changing the 3-year-old
emergency restrictions on the press in a way that will address the
difficulties of journalists and editors as well as security
concerns.
   In a speech to the Johannesburg Press Club, de Klerk said the
government doesn't want to place any unneccessary obstacles in the
way of the press, because, he said, it has an important task to
perform in the debate on changing South Africa.
   He said the whole question of the national emergency was under
constant review and it would be lifted as soon as circumstances
permit.
   De Klerk had been expected to make a more substantive statement
on the emergency media regulations, which prohibit journalists from
covering or reporting on unrest events or security force action,
boycotts, strikes, statements the government considers subversive,
and detentions without trial. The restrictions are not uniformly
obeyed, and scores of journalists have been repeatedly arrested at
the scene of news events.
   Several newspapers have been closed without recourse to the
courts, and one, the New Nation, is under threat of a second
closure.
   One newspaper editor faces a prison sentence for violating the
emergency regulations by quoting a prohibited person.
   On Friday, the government-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
had given the strongest indication yet that some of the emergency
restrictions were about to be lifted.
   ``The lifting of media restrictions that are no longer relevant
in today's relaxed political climate will promote a more open
public debate on crucial national issues and bring the country
closer to more comprehensive and fruitful negotiations on a new
political and constitutional dispensation,'' it said in a
commentary.
   Former President P.W. Botha declared the national emergency on
June 12, 1986, and renewed the emergency restrictions in 1977,
1988, and 1989, saying they were necessary to control a situation
of political unrest in black townships. Botha was ousted in August,
and de Klerk became acting president before leading the National
Party government to a parliamentary victory in September.
   De Klerk already has modified the emergency regulations, by
allowing outdoor political rallies and marches, which had
previously routinely been broken up by police. The prohibition
remains on the books and can be invoked at any time, along with
bans on many forms of political expression, including wearing
T-shirts, displaying of banners and making certain speeches. The
punishment for violation of an emergency regulation is a maximum of
six months in prison or a $4,500 fine.

<TEXT>
   A broadcasting board has suspended the license
of an Islamic radio station after its owner was convicted of
defaming Jews.
   The decision by the Swedish Local Radio Board occurred Tuesday
after Radio Islam's owner and leading broadcaster, Ahmed Rami, was
sentenced to six months in prison.
   A district court found him guilty of broadcasting ``disparaging
and deeply offending'' remarks about Jews and the Jewish religion
on his local station.
   Sweden's 15,000-member Jewish community has viewed it as a
landmark case. It is only the second time that a court has
overridden the right of free speech to enforce an anti-racism law
barring the defamation of a people, race or ethnic group.
   The court reached its verdict two weeks ago after an eight-week
trial. The prosecution called in distinguished clergymen to argue
that Rami's programs were anti-Semitic.
   Rami was convicted of 18 counts of broadcasting anti-Semitic
remarks, including quotes from Nazi writings such as Adolf Hitler's
``Mein Kampf.'' He has spoken on the air of a Jewish conspiracy to
achieve worldwide power.
   Rami, a Moroccan immigrant, has said he will appeal the court
sentence. His license would be returned if the Appeals Court
overturns the verdict.
   Rami had called the verdict ``a judicial murder, a scandal.'' He
said he had been judged in a political trial and accused the
prosecutor of ``Zionist sympathies.''
   ``I want to crush the state of Israel. ... If I am allowed on
the air again, I will say the same things again,'' he said.
``Zionism, Judaism and the state of Israel are fakes.''
    Radio Islam and about 2,500 independent companies or
individuals rent air time from the Local Radio Board. Radio Islam
had been broadcasting an hour a week.

   A House committee on Wednesday called for
stronger action against doctors and hospitals that provide
substandard care for Medicare patients.
   The House Government Operations Committee said that while
tougher laws are needed the Department of Health and Human Services
also must begin to use the broader authority Congress granted in
1985 to punish doctors and hospitals.
   A report by the panel criticized the department for the delay in
putting out regulations to enforce the law, which allows HHS to
deny payment hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard
care is provided.
   The department is working on the regulations, said Dennis
Siebert, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration,
which handles Medicare, the government health-care program for 33
million elderly, blind and disabled Americans.
   ``They're fairly controversial and complex regulations,'' he
said. ``We've spent a lot of time consulting with medical care
industry.''
   Currently, physicians can be terminated from participating in
Medicare or be fined up to the amount of the care provided, but
only in cases where there has been a clear pattern of incompentence
by physicians who were ``unwilling or unable'' to improve their
treatment.
   The report said the standard that has to met is too stringent
because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to
taken an educational course to indicate their willingness to
improve. It also said the monetary penalty is too low.
   HHS Inspector General Richard Kusserow recommended that Congress
strengthen the standard and raise the fine to $10,000 per case.
   The report also estimated that more than 800,000 errors are made
each year by doctors and hospitals caring for Medicare patients,
mostly by releasing them too early.
   ``The large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of
inadequate hospital-discharge planning is of special concern to the
committee due to fears that the PPS system (Medicare's system for
paying hospitals) ... is resulting in patients being discharged
faster and less stable,'' the report said.
   Eight Republicans on the 39-member committee, in an accompanying
document, cautioned that the error estimate was derived by
extrapolating from random reviews, called generic screens, which
were designed to detect potential problems. An error can result
from merely failing to sign a form in the proper place, they said.
   ``If an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen
failures, we are convinced the number of quality problems would be
far below the committee report's projections,'' they said.
   The report said the prospective payment system, created in 1983
as a Medicare cost-saving measure, ``provides the greatest profits
to hospitals that give the shortest in-hospital care and the least
services.''
   Under the system, hospitals are paid a flat fee for each
treatment they provide. The fee assumes a certain length of
hospital stay and medical services.

<HEAD>Study from Calif., Ark., Miss., La., Texas: Farmers Dodging Subsidy
Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attempts by Congress to keep farmers from
dodging a $50,000 limit on federal crop subsidies probably will
have little effect because farmers are creating new loopholes, the
Agriculture Department's watchdog agency said Wednesday.
   The department's Office of Inspector General said in a new audit
report that 1987 legislative changes are scheduled to take effect
this year and in 1990 for wheat, feed grains, rice, cotton, honey
and other price-supported commodities.
   But the 1987 legislation failed to effectively limit the use of
``multiple legal entities'' and other ways to avoid the payment
limitations, the report said.
   Federal crop ``deficiency'' payments used to make up part of the
difference between a low market price and some higher price target
are supposed to be limited to $50,000 per person. As an example,
last month's average corn price at the farm was $2.20 per bushel.
The target price for 1989 corn is $2.84. Farmers should get 64
cents per bushel from the government.
   ``However, our review determined that producers have found new,
innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989
payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative
changes,'' the report said.
   The audit report, which was provided upon request by The
Associated Press, followed one sent to Congress describing the
inspector general's activities for the six-month period that ended
on Sept. 30.
   In that review, the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a
number of abuses checked by investigators and auditors. The audit
report released on Wednesday dealt specifically with operations of
crop programs handled by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   The auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14
county offices. In the counties, 822 of 7,424 farm operating plans
were selected for preliminary review. Finally, 52 farms were chosen
for in-depth analysis.
   The review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that
reorganized so that all entities _ which can be individuals,
corporations, associations, trusts or other legal entities _ could
continue receiving payments as ``persons'' under the program.
   ``For example, one operation we reviewed in Tunica, Miss.,
created 51 irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments
reduced,'' the report said. ``The operation involved three joint
ventures (A, B and C) controlled by two intermingled families and
was determined (to include) 43 persons in 1988.''
   The 43 ``persons'' consisted of six individuals and 37
corporations, the report said. Owners of the 37 corporations
consisted of 11 individuals and one corporation.
   ``Seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of
the two families (a father and two daughters, and a father, two
sons, and a daughter) that controlled the operation,'' the report
said.
   If the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988, it
would have collected no more than $700,000 in payments in 1989. But
with reorganization, the operation is expected to collect as much
as $1,431,576 in subsidies this year.
   ``One of the family members of this organization told us that
the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum
program benefits,'' the report said. ``He said it became a
challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the
operation's full-time employees. He called it a profit-sharing
plan.''
   Although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations,
auditors said the trusts themselves are believed to be
``flow-through entities'' to avoid new regulations last year
limiting a person's membership in more than three entities.
   ``We conclude this because about $1.3 billion per year will be
routed back to the seven immediate family members through
management fees, equipment and land leases, and loans,'' the report
said.
   No individual names were released. Here are the counties or
parishes checked:
   _Arkansas, Jefferson, Crittenden and Phillips.
   _California, Butte and Kern.
   _Louisiana, Morehouse, Natchitoches and Tensas.
   _Mississippi, De Soto, Noxubee and Tunica.
   _Texas, Jackson, Jefferson and Lubbock.

<HEAD>NATO Troop Reductions Will Have Small Effect On U.S. Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A possible agreement next year between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact nations to cut conventional arms and troops
will have a minimal direct effect on U.S. military spending,
defense analysts said Wednesday.
   But a reduction in the Warsaw Pact's superiority in armed
forces, tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers could have an
indirect impact that would result in long-term savings for the
United States.
   In negotiations between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact, President
Bush has proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union
reduce their forces in Europe to 275,000 on each side. The Soviets
would have to withdraw 300,000 troops while the United States
reduce its forces by 30,000.
   The American cut of 30,000 amounts to less than 1.5 percent of
the 2.1 million U.S. troops worldwide, and the Congressional Budget
Office has estimated savings from that reduction of about $2.1
billion annually.
   The current Pentagon budget is about $300 billion.
   Analysts for the Defense Budget Project, an independent
non-profit research group, told a news conference that conventional
arms reductions would have to produce larger savings to have a
significant impact on U.S. military spending.
   Long-term savings could occur if after an agreement is reached
creating a numerical parity between the 16 NATO countries and the
seven Warsaw Pact nations, NATO decides it needs less war stocks,
can rely more on reserve forces and less expensive, lighter
infantry forces and limits modernization of its military hardware.
   At the news conference on the issue of U.S. policy after a
conventional arms agreement, Stephen Flanagan, a member of the
State Department's policy planning staff, said such a treaty will
be a ``watershed event'' but a number of outstanding issues means
the pact is not a done deal.
   Political developments in Eastern Europe make it difficult to
predict what the Soviet force structure will be and what levels the
United States will maintain in Europe, Flanagan said.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill To Rebuild Mouse-Breeding Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday
authorizing up to $25 million in federal funds to build a
laboratory to breed mice for medical research.
   The contract is expected to go to help rebuild the Jackson
Laboratory of Bar Harbor, Maine, destroyed by a fire last May that
killed more than 400,000 research mice.
   The 60-year-old nonprofit Jackson Laboratory was the nation's
largest supplier of laboratory mice, and federal health officials
have warned its loss could interfere with reearch into cancer and
other diseases.
   Drugs and vaccines are commonly tested first in mice, and the
Jackson Lab had special breeds of mice for longterm study of
specific ailments.
   The 1990 appropriations bill for the Department of Health and
Human Services _ the parent agency of the National Institutes of
Health _ contains $15 million for the mice breeding facility.
   The legislation that Bush signed requires that every $3 in
federal funds for the facility be matched with $1 in non-federal
funds.

<HEAD>Serbia Cuts Ties With Slovenia; Possible Breakup of Yugoslavia Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's largest republic,
Serbia, urged all its organizations to sever ties with rival
Slovenia on Wednesday in what analysts said may be the first step
toward the breakup of Communist Yugoslavia.
   The move came after the northern republic of Slovenia introduced
emergency measures to prevent a mass rally planned for Friday by
Serb nationalists seeking to topple Slovenia's liberal leadership.
   Organizers had predicted at least 40,000 people from Serbia
would travel to the rally in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital.
   The Serbian Socialist Alliance issued a proclamation calling on
all Serbian ``institutions and enterprises to break all contacts
with Slovenia.''
   The alliance, a communist-led mass organization, serves as a
mouthpiece for the republic's ambitious president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
   It said Serbs will no longer allow themselves ``to be
humiliated'' by Slovenia and that ``all freedoms and human rights
have been suspended'' there.
   The state Tanjug news agency carried a statement from the
rally's organizing committee, calling off the rally because ``we
don't want to be greeted by clubs and rifles.''
   Slovenian TV called Serbia's decision ``senseless'' and said the
Serbian leadership ``has reached the lowest possible moral and
political level.''
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, consider
Serbia's move as a first step toward disintegration of Yugoslavia.
   The country is a loose confederation of six republics and two
provinces, containing many different nationalities and religious
groups. Economic problems and sinking living standards have
heightened ethnic tensions.
   A commentary broadcast nationwide on an evening newscast said
Serbia's decision ``complicated the political situation in the
country to an extreme.''
   Slovenian police said earlier Wednesday they would block all
vehicles carrying Serbian demonstrators to the rally in Ljubljana.
They announced other emergency measures including banning all
public rallies and gatherings of more than 30 people without
explicit approval by authorities.
   Slovenian authorities hinted they would use force against
demonstrators, who planned to travel the 550 miles to Ljubljana by
bus, train and automobile. The rally was to protest alleged
harassment of the Serbian minority in Kosovo province by ethnic
Albanians.
   The protesters reportedly demanded toppling of the liberal
Slovenian leadership that they claimed supports the ethnic
Albanians. They accused the Albanians of intimidating the Serb
minority and forcing Serbs to leave the economically backward
province.
   Hard-liners in the Serbian leadership supported the Ljubljana
protest. They strongly oppose the Western-style democratization
processes in Slovenia, including next year's planned introduction
of a multiparty system.
   Serbia advocates the Communist Party's continued monopoly on
power and strong central control. It is deadlocked with Slovenia
over Yugoslavia's political future. Serbian leaders have been
accusing Slovenia of wanting to secede from the federation, and the
statement by the Socialist Alliance said Serbs ``will no longer beg
Slovenes not to break away from Yugoslavia.''
   Yugoslavia's population of nearly 24 million includes 9 million
Serbs and 2 million Slovenes. Slovenia is economically the most
developed region.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked the
execution of Dalton Prejean, who was due to die early Thursday in
Louisiana for killing a state trooper when Prejean was 17 years old.
   The court granted Prejean's emergency plea to save him from the
electric chair, barring his execution until the justices decide
whether they will hear his formal appeal to set aside his death
penalty.
   No date has been set for the court's action on the formal appeal.
   Prejean had been scheduled to be executed shortly after midnight.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana denied clemency to Prejean on
Tuesday, rejecting a 3-2 recommendation of the state's pardon board
to commute the sentence to life in prison.
   Prejean, 30, has been on death row in Louisiana for 12 years _
longer than anyone else in the state's history. He was convicted of
fatally shooting Donald Cleveland in 1977 after a traffic stop by
the trooper.
   His lawyer has argued that he should be spared because he was
retarded, with an I.Q. of 76, and because of his age at the time of
the crime.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected the appeal
Tuesday, said he is not retarded under standards of the American
Association on Mental Retardation, which sets a threshold at 70.

   As much as $150 billion _ or more _ in
taxpayers' money is likely to be wasted by the federal government
in the near future because of antiquated accounting systems,
lackadaisical management and hollow commitments to doing better,
Congress was told Wednesday.
   Its investigative agency, the General Accounting Office, said
problems exist in every major federal department and agency. The
GAO said the shoddy government oversight of how its money is spent
is years' old in some cases and blamed Reagan administration
deregulation and staff cutbacks for much of the problem.
   The GAO also said that an ongoing audit of the Air Force had
found its financial statements ``dead wrong ... in practically
every area'' and cautioned that conditions likely were worse in the
Army and Navy because the Air Force is believed to have superior
records.
   ``There is a seemingly never-ending and costly trail of
mismanagement, abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs,''
the GAO said in the report to the Senate Government Affairs
Committee. ``Most of the problems are known, and in many instances
have been known for years, but they remain uncorrected.''
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who heads the GAO, said the
government has wasted hundreds of millions of millions of dollars
on systems designed to improve accounting that proved virtually
useless.
   What's more, he said, many identified problems remain
uncorrected because government managers charged in a 1982 law with
identifying flaws treat them ``just as a paperwork exercise.''
   He said the government needed to make a major investment in
state-of-the-art accounting and financial-management systems but
said he did not know how much that would cost.
   He recommended the appointment of a government-wide ``chief
financial officer'' to oversee government spending, with deputies
at each major agency who would be required to file detailed monthly
and annual financial reports.
   The chairman of the committee, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said he
would press for passage of legislation creating those posts when
Congress returns next year. ``This (government) being one of the
biggest businesses in the world, we've just got to do it,'' Glenn
said.
   Bowsher said the multibillion dollar scandals involving the
savings and loan industry, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the Energy Department's troubled nuclear plants
were likely to be followed by billions more in fraud, waste and
abuse for a common reason: lousy management.
   ``We have every major agency in the federal government
acknowledging that they have weak financial management sytstems,''
Bowsher said, adding that the government was ``bound to end up with
scandals and fraud and mismanagement.''
   Bowsher said the Office of Managment and Budget, a White House
agency, recently had improved its efforts to identify problems
areas. He said the GAO too was launching a government-wide review
to identify the potential for costly waste and abuse.
   He said the Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service;
NASA; the Medicare system; the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the
government insurer of private pension systems, and student loan
programs already had been placed on GAO's priority watch list.
   Likely to be added, he said, were a host of government
insurance, credit and financing programs, including the Export
Import Bank, the Farmers Home Administration, foreign military
sales accounts and the new agency set up to bail out failing S&amp;Ls.
   He said $150 billion ``was not unrealistic'' as an estimate of
waste and fraud likely to occur in the near future, a figure that
did not include the two-year Air Force audit, which Bowsher said
had not reached the point at which he could put a price tag on the
problem.
   That report is due in January and the GAO plans a follow-up
audit before moving on to the Army and Navy, Bowsher said.
   Bowsher said Reagan-era deregulation and staff reductions were
made at a time the government ``had no plan to achieve the cutbacks
and not lessen our oversight and control. ... We have been penny
wise and really pound foolish.''
   Complicating poor oversight and accounting has been the rapid
turnover among senior agency political appointees and the
reluctance of Cabinet members to tackle complicated management
problems, he said.
   ``The great turnover of the presidential appointees is a great
problem for our government,'' he said.
   Congress also has contributed to the problem by placing certain
programs _ including the savings and loan bailout _ ``off budget''
to keep their costs from affecting the federal deficit.
   ``We see a trend here of going `off budget' but not for a moment
reducing the risk to the American taxpayer,'' he said. ``The hollow
government is really happening and I'm afraid it's going to get
more hollow because of the budget deficit.''
   Bowsher delivered to the Senate a GAO report on compliance with
the 1982 Financial Integrity Act, which required agency managers to
report annually on potential weaknesses in government management.
Half of those managers have not been trained to prepare the
required reports, the GAO found.

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has given up his New
York state residency, ending any chance he'll run for governor next
year, a spokesman said.
   Kemp notified the Erie Board of Elections on Monday that he was
withdrawing his voting registration there, said Robert Nipp, a
Housing and Urban Development spokesman in Washington.
   ``He intends to register in Montgomery County, Maryland,'' said
Nipp.
   Nipp said Kemp was making the change because ``he's no longer a
congressman from Buffalo'' and ``he has his home in Bethesda.''
   Steven LaFever, a spokesman for the New York state Republican
Committee and a former official at the state Board of Elections,
said that to run for governor a person must be a resident of the
state for five consecutive years.
   State GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett had hoped that Kemp, who
unsuccessfully sought the 1988 Republican presidential nomination,
might be willing to challenge Democrat Mario Cuomo's expected
re-election bid next year.
   A recent GOP poll had found that, among those New Yorkers
surveyed, Kemp tested well against the popular Cuomo. The governor
won that theoretical matchup, 48 percent to 42 percent.
   Cuomo, should he do well in a re-election bid next year or skip
it entirely, is considered a potential 1992 presidential contender.
Because of that, supporters of President Bush would like to see
Cuomo given a tough race next year.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk
declared Wednesday that no one can kill with impunity, and said he
will reveal next week what the government plans to do about alleged
murders by police death squads.
   In a speech to the Johannesburg Press Club, de Klerk said his
Cabinet had received an official report and was giving it urgent
attention. He said criminal action in government service would not
be tolerated.
   The report, completed Tuesday by a provincial attorney general
and a police commander, covers a five-week investigation of claims
by three former policemen that they were in death squads that
killed opponents of the government.
   De Klerk did not say whether he had seen the report, which was
presented Wednesday to Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and Adriaan
Vlok, the law and order minister.
   ``We believe that nobody has the right to take the law in his
own hands,'' de Klerk said. ``The misuse of rights, to exercise
violence against the life and property of people, must be opposed
and punished wherever it occurred.''
   New allegations about death squad activity were made in the
Netherlands on Tuesday by a 27-year-old South African who
identified himself as Mervyn Malan and said he was a cousin of
South Africa's defense minister, Gen. Magnus Malan.
   On Wednesday, the general said he had no knowledge of a relative
named Mervyn. The Defense Ministry said it was not ready to comment
on the man's allegations that his former army unit had carried out
attacks on civilians.
   The state South African Broadcasting Corp., which reflects
government thinking, said ``the very idea of a police assassination
squad operating in South Africa is so monstrous as to be almost
unbelievable.''
   ``It is absolutely essential that the facts are established .. .
in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been
done,'' it said in an editorial.
   ``Unless justice is not only done, but seen to be done, those
allegations will be believed, and exploited for propaganda, in
quarters hostile to South Africa.''
   In a speech at a police parade Tuesday, de Klerk said strong
action would be taken against any officers implicated in death
squad activity. He added that most policemen behaved ``in an
impeccable manner'' and did not deserve to be ``dragged through the
mud.''
   He also announced steps to reduce military and police influence
on national security policy. They include abolishing the National
Security Management System, set up by former President P.W. Botha
to coordinate a strategy that included suppression of activists and
improvement of black communities.
   Several newspapers suggested Wednesday abolishing the Security
System was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the state of
emergency Botha declared on June 12, 1986.
   The system is dominated by officers of the security forces and
reports to the State Security Council of generals, police
commanders and certain Cabinet ministers.
   Critics said it usurped the powers of Parliament and municipal
governments and set policy on the international, national and local
level.

   A former Nazi SS sergeant
suspected of the 1944 death camp execution of German Communist
leader Ernst Thaelmann has died. Wolfgang Otto, who served as a
guard at the Buchenwald concentration camp, died Sunday at his home
in the town of Geldern, the Rheinische Post newspaper reported
Wednesday. He was 78.
   Otto was said to be in frail health. He had lived in Geldern
near West Germany's border with the Netherlands for more than 10
years.
   In May 1986, Otto was found guilty of complicity in the shooting
death of Thaelmann at Buchenwald. Thaelmann was imprisoned when the
Nazis took power in 1933.
   Otto was sentenced to four years in prison by a court in Krefeld
but remained free pending an appeal.
   Prosecutors had argued Nazi leader Adolf Hitler personally
ordered Thaelmann's execution and that Otto carried out the orders.
Otto denied the charges.
   The case was appealed to West Germany's Supreme Court, which
overturned the verdict because of a legal error.
   Two years later, Otto was retried and acquitted of the murder
charges by a Duesseldorf state court. The court said there was
insufficient evidence.
   Otto served five years of a separate 20-year war crimes sentence
imposed by a U.S. military court in 1947. His later prosecution was
delayed by bureaucratic wrangling complicated by the failing
memories and deaths of witnesses.

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who
spun and vaulted her way into sports history with scores of perfect
10s at the 1976 Olympics, has fled her homeland, Hungary's news
agency reported Wednesday.
   Comaneci, 28, told border guards she left her rigid Communist
country ``for the sake of freedom,'' the MTI news agency said.
   Her whereabouts were not known. The agency initially reported
she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been
granted a temporary residence permit, valid for three days.
   At the age of 14, the solemn, 4-foot-11 Comaneci astounded the
world with the first-ever perfect scores in gymnastics, winning
three Olympic gold medals on the uneven bars, balance beam and
overall competition at the Montreal games.
   During a career that lasted until 1984, Comaneci won 21 gold
medals in Olympic and other international competition. After ending
her competitive career, she turned coach and referee and served as
a role model for Romanian youth.
   Because of her achievements, Comaneci was made a Hero of
Socialist Labor by President Nicolae Ceausescu, the hard-line
Communist leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform
sweeping the East bloc.
   At one time, she was linked romantically with Nicu Ceausescu,
the president's son.
   She reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country
notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods, as well as
for the Ceausescu brand of neo-Stalinism. About 25,000 Romanians
have fled to Hungary the past two years.
   Despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her
government, Comaneci often expressed dissatisfaction with the
demands of her career. She repeatedly complained of exhaustion,
overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous
training and competition schedule.
   MTI said Comaneci complained to Hungarian border officials that
her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad.
She received the temporary residence permit in Szeged, a town about
15 miles from the Romanian border.
   Hungarian radio reported that Comaneci made a pre-dawn crossing
Tuesday into Hungary by car at the nearby border town of Kiszombor
with six other Romanians, who were not identified.
   Citing unconfirmed reports, MTI said Comaneci and her companions
Wednesday left the Szeged hotel where they had been lodged by
police in a car bearing non-Hungarian plates, and had not been seen
since.
   Istvan Fretyan, an editor at the Szeged radio station told The
Associated Press that Comaneci was believed to have left for
Budapest, about 110 miles away, to stay with friends. The residency
permit allows unrestricted travel throughout Hungary.
   The Interior Ministry refused to disclose Comaneci's whereabouts
and told The AP that the former Olympic star did not wish to give
any interviews.
   Comaneci's former coach, Bela Karolyi, defected in 1981 while on
an American tour with the Romanian gymnastics team.
   ``I'm ready to help her in any manner if she needs it,'' said
Karolyi, who became a U.S. citizen last spring.
   Her defection ``is what I was really wishing would happen one of
these days,'' he said in an interview from Clarens, Switzerland,
where he was coaching the U.S. women's team at an international
meet.
   Comaneci ``is still a big personality in Romania. She has
nothing against the Romanian population, but just like me she was
chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' Karolyi
said.
   The coach said he would recommend that Comaneci go to the United
States because of the opportunities there.
   Officials in Washington said there was no immediate indication
she would try to gain admission to the United States.
   ``I am not aware of anything right now,'' said Verne Jervis,
spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Comaneci has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs
in the West but she did not say where.
   Patty Auer, a spokesperson for the U.S. Gymnastics Federation in
Indianapolis, said: ``We have no official word on any offers, but
that wouldn't surprise me. There have been no overtures from the
federation.''

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, convicted of
having sex with a 16-year-old girl, has left for Taiwan while a
state court hears arguments in his appeal but is ``upbeat'' about
his prospects, an aide said Wednesday.
   The 58-year-old Republican from Middletown was convicted May 26
of contributing to the unruliness of a minor and was sentenced to
30 days in jail and a $500 fine. He is appealing to the 10th Ohio
District Court of Appeals while free on bond.
   Oral arguments were scheduled for Thursday morning.
   Lukens left Wednesday for Taiwan with four other congressmen to
oversee elections there on Friday, said William Jarrell, Lukens'
chief of staff.
   Jarrell said Lukens refused a request for an interview on the
advice of his attorney.
   ``I can tell you that he's very upbeat about it, but he will be
nowhere near Columbus, Ohio, tomorrow,'' Jarrell said in a
telephone interview from his Washington office.
   Lukens was convicted after a five-day trial in Franklin County
Domestic Relations Court. The girl, Rosie Coffman, and her mother,
Anna, had charged that Lukens knew she was underage when he paid
her to have sex at his Columbus apartment in November 1988. The
girl is now 17.
   Lukens, who did not testify at the trial, had denied the
allegations.
   Anna Coffman's complaint to a Columbus television station last
year led to the congressman's indictment in February.
   She testified at the trial that during a meeting with Lukens in
November 1988, Lukens offered to find her a government job after
she accused him of having sex with her daughter. Television station
WSYX videotaped the meeting.
   Court records show that the focus of the appeal will be a ruling
by Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove that kept Lukens'
attorney, Thomas Tyack, from using Rosie Coffman's juvenile court
file and school records as evidence. Tyack had said the records
were crucial to the defense.
   Tyack did not return telephone messages seeking comment
Wednesday.
   Thomas Tornabene, a spokesman for Franklin County Prosecutor
Michael Miller's office, said the state will argue that the girl's
past had nothing to do with the encounter in Lukens' apartment.
   Lukens' conviction sparked calls for his resignation from
Republican leaders in Ohio, including in his home district. In
Congress, the House ethics committee is investigating Lukens.
   Lukens has said he will await the outcome of his appeal before
deciding whether to seek re-election.

<HEAD>Judge Sues Airline Over Luggage Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state supreme court justice who is
suing Trans World Airlines over a delay in getting his luggage has
filed more papers in the case, this time likening himself to Don
Quixote as he seeks $38,000 in damages.
   Justice Richard Neely filed a lawsuit in July seeking the
damages from the airline as well as a $3,000 speaking fee for
telling passengers what he thought was the delay in receiving their
luggage.
   The July incident was ``vexatious,'' Neely said in papers filed
Tuesday in Kanawha County Circuit Court to try to force the airline
to supply information.
   ``After standing around in a confined space at about 88 degrees
Fahrenheit at Kennedy Airport for over half an hour, plaintiff and
about 150 other passengers concluded that their baggage was in
imminent peril of taking an unscheduled trip to their plane's next
stop, Frankfurt, Germany,'' Neely said in the documents.
   Neely, who had flown from Seattle to New York, said he was told
by a TWA employee that the plane's cargo door was jammed and he
stood on a luggage conveyor belt to relay that information to other
passengers.
   ``Plaintiff was mistaken for a TWA employee and subjected to
obloquy, ridicule, contempt and abuse _ Don Quixote doing a good
deed for the galley slaves,'' the justice said.
   Robert King, an attorney for TWA, said Wednesday the airline
denies that Neely's luggage was delayed and said his suit is
intended to harass the airline.
   ``We have previously said we believe the lawsuit to be
frivolous, and we intend to defend it vigorously, and we intend to
be successful in that defense,'' King said.
   The documents filed were Neely's second attempt to get the court
to force TWA to provide all statements issued or published by TWA
Chairman Carl Icahn about employee compensation through July 1989.
   Neely claims that TWA, under Icahn, instituted policies it knew
would ``lower employee morale, create an atmosphere of passive
resistance amoung defendant's lower echelon employees and
inevitably result in the abusive treatment of passengers.''
   ``At trial plaintiff will try to prove that Mr. Icahn's
leveraged buyout of TWA has diverted money from passenger amenities
_ particularly sufficienty personnel competently to handle lost and
delayed baggage claims _ to junk bond speculators.''
   King called Neely's request for documents ``way beyond the
bounds of proper discovery.''
   A circuit court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 14.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Wednesday that news leaks prompted him to order a complete review
of Justice Department press guidelines to tighten the release of
information.
   ``I expect it to result in two things: one that we will have
some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal
investigations and, secondly ... that we speak with one voice on
policy matters,'' Thornburgh said.
   The review of the ``entire spectrum'' of public information
policies was occasioned by a series of news leaks about criminal
investigations, including an FBI probe of Felix Bloch, the U.S.
diplomat suspected of espionage, the attorney general said.
   Thornburgh has attributed the FBI's inability so far to solve
the case on news accounts that disclosed the investigation last
summer.
   ``It was `let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' the
attorney general said in an often-stormy session with reporters.
   ``Peoples rights were being compromised, our investigations were
being compromised by unauthorized disclosures of information
regarding criminal investigations,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh launched a number of investigations of leaks, notably
to try to identify the source of information about an FBI
investigation into financial practices in the office of Rep.
William Gray III, D-Pa.
   The leak occurred while Gray was seeking election in the House
as majority whip, prompting accusations from Democratic lawmakers
that Thornburgh's aides were the source of a political leak.
   The political firestorm also forced the Justice Department to
state several days later that Gray was not a target of the
investigation and was cooperating with the probe.
   Asked if he was satisfied that leak did not come from his
office, Thornburgh said: ``I haven't had an oportunity to review
the results of the investigation.''
   Thornburgh disclosed the department-wide review, which began
earlier this fall, when questioned about proposed Bureau of Prisons
regulations that would restrict reporters interviews of federal
inmates.
   Later in the day, Thornburgh issued a statement saying he had
ordered the Bureau of Prisons to withdraw the proposed regulations,
saying ``this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my
personal review. It will be subject to further review before
resubmission.''
   The regulations published this week would allow prison wardens
to bar reporters who do not ``verify any allegations'' about
prisons or inmates with corrections officials.
   During his session with reporters, Thornburgh said the proposed
regulations are intended to guarantee ``an accurate flow of
information ... and observe what is necessary to properly manage
prison facilities.''
   The attorney general did not cite specific examples of
inaccurate news stories, referring all questions to the Bureau of
Prisons, where a spokesman did not immediately return a reporter's
telephone call.
   The department-wide review has also resulted in a new policy at
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Gene McNary, the new immigration commissioner, recently ordered
INS officials nationwide to obtain permission from the agency's
Washington public affairs office before commenting publicly on a
wide range of issues.
   ``It is necessary for us to speak with uniformity in discussing
INS policies, operations, procedures, and other issues,'' McNary
said in a Nov. 27 memo.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said district and regional officials
will have discretion to answer reporters' questions about arrests
of illegal aliens or breaking news.
   ``It's not a gagging, its not a silencing,'' Jervis said. ``It's
a means, I will use the word of controlling, of knowing what is
being said in the field before you read it in the newspaper or see
it on television,'' Jervis said.
   Thornburgh's session with reporters was punctuated by complaints
that the attorney general had made it difficult for reporters to
get even the most basic information about department operations.
   ``Our subject is ordinary information, not sensitive
information, not criminal information,'' said one reporter.
   ``We try to give it as best we can,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``But we're not getting it,'' the reporter replied.
   The attorney general acknowledged that ``my reputation with you
folks has deteriorated because you don't like the fact that I don't
condone leaks or encourage leaks.''
   ``We're not talking about leaks,'' the reporter repeated.
   ``I am,'' Thornburgh replied. ``I am talking about what has
impelled me to try to tighten up the process of discussion of
matters'' in the department.

   Soviet officials rejected West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's German reunificiation plan Wednesday, the first day
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Italy. They said a united
Germany could upset European stability.
   As the Soviet president was hailed in the streets of Rome by
throngs shouting, ``Bravo, Mikhail, bravo!,'' a Soviet spokesman
dismissed the 10-point plan for phased reunification of the two
Germanys outlined Tuesday by Kohl.
   The rejection showed mounting Soviet concern that the Kremlin's
tolerance of democratic reforms in the East bloc could be used to
disrupt Gorbachev's vision of a ``common European home'' erasing
the lines between East and West.
   While Gorbachev met privately for more than 1{ hours with
Premier Giulio Andreotti, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
expressed Moscow's concerns to Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis
and other Italian officials, a spokesman said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a
news briefing, ``Not one country in Europe is anxious to see a
united Germany because it could upset the present stability in
Europe.''
   Gerasimov said Shevardnadze told the Italians the Soviet Union
would not reconsider its opposition to the Kohl plan unless West
Germany first renounces any claim to the pre-World War II borders
of Germany, which included many areas now belonging to Poland, the
Soviet Union and other border states.
   A West German constitutional court ruled in 1972 that, in the
absence of a treaty defining new borders, the legal boundaries of
Germany are those that existed in 1937, before Adolf Hitler
launched the war that led to his death and the carving up of the
German nation.
   In Moscow, Gerasimov deputy Yuri Gremitskikh rejected the Kohl
plan in even harsher language, calling it ``an attempt to shift the
movement that started in East Germany to nationalistic lines.''
Gremitskikh said Kohl presented the plan ``without considering the
opinions of other countries.''
   On the first day of his three-day state visit, Gorbachev waded
into cheering crowds who shouted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as he and his
wife took a whirlwind tour of Rome between official talks that
focused on the tumultuous changes taking place in Eastern Europe.
   On Friday, he will have a historic meeting with Pope John Paul
II at the Vatican.
   The first Soviet Communist Party chief to visit Italy, Gorbachev
was greeted like a conquering hero by flag-waving Romans, who
rarely display any particular enthusiasm for visiting foreign
dignataries.
   During a 10-minute stop at the Colosseum, Gorbachev and his
wife, Raisa, started into a crowd and were instantly engulfed by
shouting well-wishers.
   Some young people began singing the ``Internationale,'' the
socialist anthem, and others waved the red and yellow flag of the
big Italian Communist Party, now in the midst of a soul-searching
comparable to that going on among Communists in much of Eastern
Europe.
   Surrounded by KGB bodyguards and Italian security agents, the
Gorbachevs emerged beaming after shaking dozens of hands.
   Gorbachev met Andreotti in a tete-a-tete that stretched from the
half-hour scheduled to more than three times that, leaving official
delegations to carry on without them.
   In remarks prepared for a state dinner in his honor at the
presidential palace, Gorbachev expressed gratitude for Italy's
willingness to help the Soviet Union recover economically, but said
that in the end only the Soviets can implement perestroika _
restructuring of the economy and politics.
   ``It is not rare that in the West we are asked how we can be
helped,'' he said. ``The biggest help consists in understanding our
processes and problems. We are open to cooperation, we are
favorable to its new forms. But perestroika has to be realized by
ourselves.
   ``All the riches of the West cannot substitute what we have to
do ourselves ... We have enormous natural riches, a powerful
production system, an inestimable intellectual potential. It is
through perestroika that we have to put all of this to its best
use.''
   President Francesco Cossiga toasted Gorbachev with warm praise
for his efforts to move from confrontation to cooperation between
East and West and said Italy intends to play a part in forming a
united Europe.
   He wished Gorbachev well in his shipboard summit off Malta this
weekend with President Bush.

<TEXT>
   Tests on a sample of air duct contaminated
with plutonium dust at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant have
revealed only a fraction of the plutonium inspectors had feared was
present, officials said.
   Laboratory tests found only 1{ percent as much of the highly
radioactive element as inspectors estimated in August, a Department
of Energy official at the plant said Tuesday.
   Rocky Flats is the only government plant at which plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons are made. The plant, 16 miles
northwest of Denver, is operated by Rockwell Corp. for DOE.
   In August, DOE inspectors said they found 11 pounds of plutonium
in air ducts at the plant, one of the most serious recent
allegations about dangerous practices at the plant.
   Rocky Flats' safety and hazardous waste disposal practices have
come under intense scrutiny in recent months. FBI agents and
Environmental Protection Agency inspectors raided the plant on June
6 looking for evidence of illegal waste disposal, and a special
federal grand jury convened Aug. 1 to examine the allegations.
   The inspectors said enough plutonium dust could be clumped
together in the air ducts to cause an uncontrolled nuclear chain
reaction, although no evidence has been found that such a reaction
occurred.
   Inspectors had said they found one section of duct that
contained 1,600 grams or 56 ounces of plutonium per linear foot,
said David Simonson, the DOE's Rocky Flats manager. But a detailed
lab analysis showed the section contained just 24 grams or 0.84 of
an ounce per linear foot, he said.
   However, Simonson said an analysis of one section of the duct is
not enough ``to say `Eureka, the problem is solved,''' and more
studies are being done.
   In all, about 11 pounds of plutonium was estimated to be in the
air ducts in buildings where plutonium is processed and fabricated.
But officials now think the ducts contain only 2{ ounces of
plutonium.
   DOE has ordered improvements in filters and filter seals, said
Simonson. Also, an additional nine engineers are being assigned to
safety, and ducts containing more than 70 grams or 2.45 ounces of
plutonium per linear foot are being removed and replaced.

<HEAD>Bush Signs $305 Billion Defense Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday signed, with
reservations, a bill authorizing $305 billion for defense programs
for the current fiscal year, including a slash in his request for
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The measure cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's $4.9 billion request
for spending on the SDI program, or Star Wars, in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   Bush, in a statement, said the measure would provide sufficient
funds to ``provide a national defense sufficient to meet
foreseeable threats to the national security'' in the coming year.
   In signing the bill, Bush voiced reservations over several
provisions, including one calling on him to persuade NATO partners
to increase their active-duty forces in Europe.
   He also criticized a section urging him to seek a Japanese
agreement to offset U.S. costs of deploying forces to defend Japan.
   He said both provisions ``derogate from the president's
authority'' under the Constitution.
   Bush also took issue with a section requiring him to report to
Congress on any negotiations with U.S. allies on the Strategic
Defense Initiative, claiming it could compromise his authority to
control sensitive national defense information.
   He suggested he might ignore this section, as well as some
others he claimed infringed on his constitutional powers.
   The legislation represents the first cut in the SDI program in
six years.
   The bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic
programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2
stealth bomber.
   Congress adopted a series of provisions intended to press U.S.
allies into accepting a greater share of the defense burden.
   One amendment calls on Japan to boost defense and foreign aid
spending and requires the president to negotiate an agreement
providing for Japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining
U.S. forces to defend Japanese territory.
   A third directs the president to prepare a five-year plan for
the U.S. military presence in South Korea, including a discussion
of the feasibility of a reduction in U.S. military personnel
stationed in the Asian nation.
   The legislation also reduces the ceiling on the number of U.S.
troops overseas by about 15,000. Those troops were associated with
intermediate-range nuclear weapons, which were banned by a
U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1988.
   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, officials said they now estimate
that the effect of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law covering
fiscal 1990 means a $1.7 billion cut for the agency's spending.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Jim Turner, said it wasn't immediately
clear what the effect of the cuts would be or how they would affect
manpower decisions.
   Turner said the number was a ``preliminary estimate'' pending
formal notification from the Office of Management and Budget.
   ``We're still trying to figure out how its all going to fall,''
Turner said.

   AIDS victim Ryan White, who faced pickets
and lawsuits to attend school, was scheduled for tests to see if he
is strong enough for surgery.
   His mother, Jeanne White, says Ryan is scheduled for surgery to
correct a hernia on Dec. 4, at Riley Hospital for Children.
   ``He needs it very much. He's swollen really bad,'' Mrs. White
said. The pre-testing was scheduled Thursday.
   Ryan, 17, contracted AIDS through a blood-clotting agent used to
treat his hemophilia. He was diagnosed with Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome in December 1984.
   Ryan was barred in July 1985 from attending Western Middle
School near Kokomo because of fear that he could spread AIDS to
other students.
   A judge ruled the following spring that Ryan should be allowed
to attend school, because AIDS cannot be spread through casual
contact. The lawsuit and controversy split the community of Kokomo.
Ryan's family eventually moved 20 miles away to Cicero, a town of
about 3,200 people.
   In Cicero, the school system welcomed Ryan, but because of his
hernia, and staph infections in his eyes and legs, he has not
attended school much this year.
   ``This year's been really rough,'' his mother said.
   The tests Thursday are to see if Ryan's blood count is high
enough for surgery. Hemophiliacs are subject to prolonged bleeding
because they are missing a normal blood-clotting factor.

   Most Americans think the nation can meet its
future electricity needs without building more generating plants,
and a large majority oppose expanding use of nuclear energy,
according to poll results released Wednesday.
   The national survey, focusing mainly on energy and environmental
issues, also found that most people believe the federal government
should put more research focus on renewable energy sources such as
solar power and less on fossil fuels such as oil.
   The poll said a slim majority of Americans believe the quality
of their local environment has neither deteriorated in recent years
nor will in the near future.
   Smog, global warming and other threats to the atmosphere are the
most troublesome of the environmental problems facing the nation
now, according to the poll results.
   The survey was conducted by Vince Breglio, chief pollster for
President Bush's 1988 campaign, and sponsored by the Union of
Concerned Scientists, a public interest group.
   In the polling sample of 1,200 registered voters interviewed in
late October and early November, 76 percent said the best way to
meet future needs for electricity is to improve energy efficiency,
rather than building new power plants.
   When asked, ``Would you favor or oppose a proposal to build more
nuclear power plants in the United States,'' 45 percent said they
would strongly oppose it.
   Seventeen percent described themselves as somewhat opposed to
more nuclear power, 17 percent were somewhat in favor and 16
percent were strongly in favor. Four percent didn't know or didn't
answer.
   Anti-nuclear groups said the poll showed the nuclear industry,
in trying to persuade the public of a need for expanded use of
atomic energy, is out of step with most Americans.
   ``The results reinforce a long-term trend over the past 14
years, showing increasing opposition to more nuclear power
development in the United States,'' said Scott Denman, director of
the Safe Energy Communications Council.
   The industry says its polls have shown a recent increase in
public acceptance of nuclear energy.
   At a nuclear industry conference in San Francisco on Wednesday,
utility executives predicted that growing power demands will
require greater use of nuclear energy.
   James J. O'Connor, chairman of Chicago's Commonwealth Edison
Co., the nation's largest nuclear utility, called new nuclear and
coal plants the ``ideal way'' to meet growing power demands.
   The Breglio poll also said that 63 percent of respondents
believe their local environment has improved or stayed the same
over the past three years. Thirty-six percent said it was not as
good.
   When asked about the coming three years, 51 percent said they
expected their environment to either improve or stay the same,
while 45 percent said it would worsen.
   The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

   Convicted serial killer Randy Kraft was
sentenced to death Wednesday for a 12-year spree of sexual violence
in which he murdered 16 young men and grotesquely mutilated their
bodies.
   ``Burn in hell, Kraft!'' the father of 22-year-old murder victim
Mark Howard Hall shouted as Kraft was led from court.
   Kraft, 44, insisted he was innocent after Orange County Superior
Court Judge Donald A. McCartin ordered him put to death in the gas
chamber. Relatives of victims cried and hugged each other.
   ``If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it
coming,'' the judge said, recounting the grisly savagery of one
slaying which included torture by cigarette lighter, castration and
mutilation.
   ``I don't know of any person who could do that to another human
being,'' said McCartin.
   ``Mr. Kraft took innocent and unsuspecting victims who he
drugged, tortured and mutilated. .... He demonstrated an
unbelievable, aggressive, violent tendency toward humanity. I just
can't imagine this violence to satisfy his sexual desires,'' the
judge said.
   Kraft was convicted of murders that occurred between 1972 and
1983. Prosecutors said he picked up male hitchhikers in their late
teens or early 20s, gave them drugs and alcohol, sexually tortured
or mutilated them and then strangled them. Their bodies were dumped
along roadsides.
   California Highway Patrol officers arrested Kraft on May 14,
1983, when they pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered
a strangled Marine from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in his car.
   ``I sat here for a year, and I didn't see any remorse, feelings
or regret,'' McCartin said. ``It seemed he was in another world
during this trial.''
   Kraft, who played with his pen cap, yawned, laughed and chatted
with his lawyer during the proceeding, briefly addressed the court
after sentencing.
   ``I have not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review
of the record will show that,'' said Kraft, a Long Beach computer
consultant.
   McCartin imposed the death sentence for 11 murders and
consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders. The judge
said he did that to keep Kraft in custody in case all the death
sentences were somehow overturned.
   A death sentence is automatically appealed to the state Supreme
Court.
   Kraft also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts
of sodomy, four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily
injury.
   A jury of 10 women and two men convicted Kraft on May 12 after a
10{-month trial and recommended the death penalty in August.
   Deputy District Attorney Bryan Brown mentioned again a list
found in Kraft's car which prosecutors believe contains the names
of 65 murder victims. Kraft was sometimes called the ``scorecard
killer'' because of that list.
   McCartin told Kraft he had received letters from parents in
Corona del Mar, Calif., and ``somewhere in Iowa'' whose children
were missing and wanted to know if there was some way the list
could divulge their fate. He did not give the families' names.
   McCartin, noting he was addressing Kraft as an individual and
not as a judge, said if the death sentence appeals fail ``you might
give some thought in your waning moments to help those people out.''
   Outside court relatives of victims clasped hands, hugged and
cried.
   ``My vindication will come the day I know he's gone to the gas
chamber. Then I can truly say it's over,'' said Shirley De Vaul,
mother of murder victim Roger James De Vaul Jr., who was killed at
age 20.
   She and her husband, Roger Sr., are sponsoring an initiative
drive to hasten the judicial process in death penalty cases.
Kraft's case from arrest to sentencing took six years.
   ``People say the death penalty is not a deterrent. Sure it's not
a deterrent because it's never imposed,'' De Vaul said.

   Legislators debated on Wednesday
whether to deny immunity to a fellow member, who also is the
opposition candidate for vice president, so he can be prosecuted on
charges of misusing donations.
   A decision is expected this week in the single-house National
Assembly, which is dominated by the ruling Sandinistas, on whether
Virgilio Godoy should be stripped of the immunity to which
membership entitles him.
   Godoy is the running mate of publisher Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, presidential candidate of the 14-party United National
Opposition in the Feb. 25 elections.
   The dispute is over Godoy's handling of a West German donation
worth $60,000. If the assembly allows him to be tried, and he is
convicted, Godoy could be expelled from the legislature.
   The accusations originated in his own Independent Liberal Party,
but he claims the Sandinistas manipulated party members. He said it
is part of a ``Moscow-style'' witch hunt with which the Sandinistas
hope to discredit him and the opposition alliance.
   ``What they want to is exhibit me, to keep me in the store
window for several months,'' Godoy said. ``This won't end until
Feb. 25.''
   About the possibility of losing his immunity, he said: ``Let
them do it. Those who have lent themselves to this dirty
maneuvering need to be taught a lesson.''
   Because of infighting among alliance factions, Mrs. Chamorro has
been surrounding herself with a ``shadow cabinet'' to counter those
who conspre against her close advisers.
   While she was out of the country earlier this month, the
alliance's political committee voted to expel Alfredo Cesar from
the campaign directorate. Opposition sources said it was done
without Mrs. Chamorro's knowledge or consent, and while Cesar also
was abroad.
   When she returned to Nicaragua, Mrs. Chamorro appointed Cesar as
the first of what she said would be 10 personal advisers, and
selected two more soon afterward.
   The Godoy problem involves money and goods given by the
Friedrich-Naumann Foundation of West Germany to a research center
started by the Independent Liberal Party, of which he is president.
   Some party members said Godoy had not given a clear accounting
of the donation and asked the National Assembly to strip him of
immunity so he could be formally charged and tried.
   In a letter, the foundation dismissed the allegations of
mismanagement and demanded a retraction from what it called ``the
pro-Sandinista media.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has told both Nicaragua and Cuba
to stop supplying arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador, a French
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua gave the instructions at a
secret meeting Tuesday in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital,
according to the authoritative daily Le Monde.
   The newspaper said the meeting was apparently called by the
Soviets and included high-ranking Cuban and Nicaraguan officials.
   The report came in advance of a weekend summit between Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Bush off the Mediterranean
island of Malta.
   The newspaper said the Soviets hoped to gain points with
Washington by ordering Managua and Havana to cut their support for
the leftist Salvadoran rebels, the newspaper said. The United
States backs the rightist Salvadoran government.
   The newspaper said the Soviets were embarrassed by the crash
last weekend over El Salvador of a plane loaded with arms that
apparently originated in Cuba, Moscow's client state.
   The order to stop supporting the rebels of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, was better received in Managua
than Havana, the newspaper said.
   ``The El Salvador business can only worsen our isolation, even
though we had nothing to do with these last events,'' the newspaper
quoted an unidentified Nicaraguan leader as saying. ``This
offensive and this arms shipment were organized by the FMLN and
Cuba.''
   The newspaper said the leftist Sandinista rulers in Nicaragua
were privately furious with Cuban leader Fidel Castro for
jeopardizing their position with other Central American nations.
   Nicaragua signed a 1987 regional peace plan, promising not to
interfere in other countries' affairs.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday
abruptly rescinded a Bureau of Prisons proposal restricting the
circumstances under which reporters could interview federal
prisoners.
   Thornburgh issued a brief statement announcing his decision just
hours after he had defended the day-old proposal at stormy session
with reporters who cover the Justice Department.
   Reporters sharply questioned the attorney general about the
regulations, accusing the Bureau of Prisons of seeking to control
the way news organizations cover conditions in federal prisons.
   The regulations, published in Tuesday's Federal Register, would
have empowered wardens to refuse to allow reporters to conduct
further interviews if they failed to seek comment from correction
authorities about allegations about prison conditions.
   Under the proposal, inmates would have been allowed to be
interviewed by journalists once a month. No more than one interview
between a prisoner and a reporter could be held each day in any
facility.
   In his statement, Thornburgh said he ordered the Bureau of
Prisons to withdraw the proposed regulations. ``This proposal was
submitted prematurely and without my personal review. It will be
subject to further review before resubmission,'' the attorney
general said.
   Thornburgh's spokesman David Runkel said the attorney general
had learned of the regulations Tuesday night and decided to rescind
them Wednesday afternoon.
   Bureau of Prisons spokesman James Jones said he did not know
what, if any, provisions Thornburgh found objectionable. He said
the attorney general did not outline specific objections to the
Bureau of Prisons when he announced his order.
   During the morning session with reporters, Thornburgh had
defended the proposal, stressing that he had not personally
reviewed it. ``I think there is a problem that they are trying to
address of reconciling their management responsiblity with the flow
of information in and out of prisons,'' Thornburgh had said.
   ``Let's start from the reductio ad absurdum that any prisoner
who wants to talk to any reporter at any time can do so,'' the
attorney general said. ``I find that unacceptable in terms of
managing a prison population.''
   The regulations ``are designed to ensure two things: one that an
accurate flow of information and observe what is necessary to
properly manage prison facilities.''
   Before it was rescinded, the proposal was branded as a form of
censorship by Ed Koren, an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union's national prison project.
   ``It is certainly an attempt to cut of any kind of criticism and
to protect the Bureau of Prisons from any embarrassments,'' Koren
said.
   ``What is particularly obnoxious is that provison ... that
requires reporters to come up with a balanced approach on the pain
of not being able to get further interviews,'' Koren said.
   The proposed regulations said that reporters ``have a
professional responsibility to make a reasonable attempt to verify
any allegations regarding an inmate, staff member, or institution.''
   ``To ensure an opportunity to gather complete information
regarding both sides of any issue in the institution, a
representative of the news media, as a condition of any
face-to-face interview granted by the bureau, shall provide
authorized staff of the Bureau of Prisons an opportunity to respond
to any allegations that might be published or broadcast,'' the
regulations said.
   Jones said the policy or requiring reporters to obtain comment
from corrections officials has been existence for a decade.
   ``All we are asking for is if there are allegations made, we get
a chance to respond.''
   Jones said ``there is not a whole lot that's new'' in the
proposed regulations, which were published for public comment.
   New elements of the regulations were the proposals to limit the
number of interviews per institution to one a day and the number of
meetings an inmate could have with a reporter to one a month, Jones
said.
   Jones said that the new regulations would not have functioned as
a limit because ``we determined that the average number of
interviews per institution a month was five.''

   Dick Clark, the boyish Pied Piper of rock
'n' roll known to generations as America's oldest teen-ager, turns
60 Thursday secluded on another continent far away from the
enamored masses.
   The squeaky-clean packager of pop will blow out the candles on a
birthday cake with his wife, Kari, and another couple somewhere in
Brazil, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
   No fanfare. No party. No fuss.
   Whether because of modesty or vanity, Clark turned down an
interview request. In the past, the multimillion-dollar
entertainer-producer said he would prefer to ``age gracefully''
without media attention.
   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but it's hard
to believe he's 60.
   For decades, his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets
to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go.
It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.
   Clark arrived in the nation's living rooms through his
``American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to
Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Madonna, as well as the Bunny Hop,
Twist and Jerk dance crazes.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the airwaves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But Clark became its symbol when he took it over in 1956, and
generations of teen-agers came to identify with the clean-cut,
carefully suited and coiffed host. He was a friendly, hip father
figure.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC-TV
network, quickly becoming a national success. Jerry Lee Lewis'
``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' was the first record spun on that
show.
   In March, Clark hung up his saddle shoes after 33 years as host
of ``American Bandstand.'' The show reigns as television's
longest-lived variety program.
   Clark lives on the beach near Paradise Cove, behind an imposing
iron gate across a driveway that winds down from Pacific Coast
Highway.
   He was born at the onset of the Great Depression, when the Big
Band era started to flourish.
   Clark joins other celebrity sexagenarians this year _ Jacqueline
Onassis, Bob Newhart, Audrey Hepburn, June Carter Cash, Buck Owens,
Ed Asner, Berry Gordy, Adam West, Jules Feiffer, Jean Simmons and
Arnold Palmer.
   Clark was unique, however, in transcending the generations with
a hip music show and, in recent years, as host of the ``$25,000
Pyramid'' and ``$100,000 Pyramid'' game shows.
   He also produces the annual American Music Awards, the Academy
of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' TV bash and
``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''

<TEXT>
   Convicted killer Dalton Prejean won a stay of
his midnight execution Wednesday from the U.S. Supreme Court after
spending the day with his family in the state prison's death house.
   Prejean, 10 days shy of his 30th birthday, had been scheduled to
die in the electric chair for a murder he committed as a teen-ager.
   But the Supreme Court granted Prejean's emergency plea, barring
his execution until the justices decide whether they will hear his
formal appeal to set aside his death penalty. No date has been set
for the court's action on the formal appeal.
   The Supreme Court had previously turned down three of his
appeals.
   He was 17 when he shot Donald Cleveland in the face in 1977
after being stopped for driving with a broken tail light. Prejean
had been freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center
where he served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14.
Cleveland was the only Louisiana state policeman ever murdered
while on duty.
   Prejean would have been the first person executed under the U.S.
Supreme Court's June ruling that authorizes executions of people
who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17.
   Prison officials said his mother, wife, son, brother and
sister-in-law were among those authorized to visit him.
   Prejean, on death row in Louisiana longer than anyone else,
would have been the 19th person executed in Louisiana since the
Supreme Court upheld the death penalty in 1976. Nationwide, 119
people have been put to death.
   On Tuesday, Gov. Buddy Roemer rejected a 3-2 Pardon Board
recommendation that Prejean's life be spared, and the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals denied a ninth stay of execution.
   The 5th Circuit said that while Prejean had low intelligence,
his intelligence quotient was not low enough to call him retarded.
   Death penalty opponents made Prejean's case a national cause
celebre, saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded
(an IQ of 76) and because he was so young when he killed the
trooper.
   The 5th Circuit, which rejected Prejean's appeal, said he is not
retarded under standards of the American Association on Mental
Retardation, which sets the threshhold at an IQ of 70.
   In the appeals court's 39-page opinion, Chief Judge Charles
Clark wrote:
   ``To date, 11 different lawyers have represented Prejean in the
processing of 20 legal proceedings in 6 different courts before 35
different judges. The matter is being considered by this panel for
the third time ... It is time to let justice be done.''
   The Pardon Board on Monday recommended commuting the death
sentence to life in prison after hearing testimony from Prejean and
others about the killer's childhood abuse at the hands of his aunt,
his limited mental ability and his remorse over his killings.
   Roemer, however, cited the brutal nature of Cleveland's death,
noted that the victim was a uniformed trooper on duty and said
Prejean's sentence met all judicial standards for the death penalty.

<HEAD>PLO Says U.S. Threat to Cut Funds Is `Financial Terrorism'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization said
Wednesday the United States it is guilty of ``financial terrorism''
by threatening to cut off funds to the United Nations if the
General Assembly calls the PLO a nation.
   Arab diplomats plan to introduce a resolution changing the PLO's
status from an observer to a non-voting nation like North and South
Korea, Switzerland, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican.
   The State Department says it will halt U.S. payments if the
General Assembly approves the resolution. The United States is
assessed $216 million annually, one-fourth of the U.N. budget.
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, the PLO representative, told a luncheon
meeting: ``This is another example of financial terrorism.''
   In Rome, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization ignored U.S.
threats and voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to help the PLO teach
Palestinians how to grow food in Israeli-occupied territories.
   The United States said such a policy involved the FAO in
politics and said it would stop funds to the agency if it was
approved. It also has threatened to withdraw from the FAO.
   ``We have made it absolutely clear to the FAO leadership over
the last few days that passing the resolution would have serious
consequences for the organization,'' the State Department announced.
   A U.S. official said the State Department would consult with
American delegates to FAO on their return from Rome before
announcing their next step.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli government condemned the FAO action.
   In the General Assembly, a vote on the PLO resolution has been
postponed from Friday until next Wednesday.
   Diplomats said privately negotiations were under way on a
compromise acceptable to both the PLO and United States.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said: ``We are
clearly not interested in exploring all the alternatives. We are
interested in finding a way to end this particular silly idea that
the Palestinians can be declared a state here in the United Nations
when they have none of the attributes of a state.''.
   Upgrading the PLO's status would need only a majority vote of
the 159 General Assembly members. As a member of the 102-member
non-aligned movement, the PLO theoretically has more than enough
votes to prevail.
   Last year, the PLO declared an independent state of Palestine,
without defining its borders but presumably in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and says 117 nations have recognized it.

   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz joined
leading dissidents Wednesday in calling for East Germany to remain
independent, as West Germany began a worldwide diplomatic push to
win support for reunification.
   Krenz insisted that East Germany will remain a staunchly
socialist state, sovereign and independent.
   The United States already has given its support to uniting the
Germanys, whose common border is considered the dividing line of
East and West and was established after the Nazi defeat in World
War II.
   Soviet officials on Wednesday rejected a reunificiation plan
advanced by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and said a united
Germany could upset European stability.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher informed
British officials about the proposal in London Wednesday and
planned a similar stop in Paris Thursday. He will brief the Soviets
on it Tuesday in Moscow.
   About 10,000 people marched late Wednesday in a Communist
Party-organized rally in Leipzig, considered a hotbed of
pro-democracy opposition.
   ``There is no collective guilt of the Communist Party,'' said
city party leader Thomas Bonesky, referring to widespread
corruption being uncovered during the leadership of ousted
hard-line party chief Erich Honecker.
   Speakers clearly rejected reunification, the official East
German news agency ADN said.
   Krenz and other East German Communist leaders have rejected any
talk of reunification, despite sweeping changes and upheavals in
this troubled nation. He and Communist Premier Hans Modrow signed
an appeal circulated by leading dissidents demanding an East German
state that offers ``a socialist alternative to West Germany.'' It
was initiated by writer Stefan Heym and other East German
intellectuals concerned about the nation's future.
   Krenz told the organizers in a letter: ``We have the historic
duty to preserve this country with its anti-fascist ideals and
traditions as a socialist alternative within German development.''
   Echoing the petition's sentiments, he called for ``peace and
social justice, individual freedom, freedom of travel for all and
the preservation of the environment.''
   His government, bowing to reform demands, already has promised
free elections by early 1991 and a constitutional amendment
stripping it of its 40-year monopoly on power.
   Kohl says East Germany must hold free elections if it wants West
German aid and closer ties.
   Kohl on Tuesday outlined his 10-point reunification plan, which
received the approval of West Germany's opposition Social Democrats.
   Kohl discussed his proposal Wednesday with President Bush in a
``very intensive and complete telephone conversation,'' government
spokesman Hans Klein said in Bonn.
   West Germany sent the plan to its embassies worldwide, and
ambassadors were told ``to deliver it to the host governments'' and
explain it, Klein said.
   In Rome, where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began a
state visit on Wednesday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
I. Gerasimov told reporters, ``Not one country in Europe is anxious
to see a united Germany because it could upset the present
stability in Europe.''
   He said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Italian
officials that before Moscow would reconsider, West Germany must
renounce any claim to Germany's pre-World War II borders, which
included many areas now belonging to Poland, the Soviet Union and
other border states.
   Gerasimov deputy Yuri A. Gremitskykh said in Moscow that Kohl
presented his proposal ``without considering the opinions of other
countries. ... We can clearly see an attempt to shift the movement
that started in East Germany to nationalistic lines.''
   Many Europeans fear a reunified Germany, with a population of 80
million people, would dominate the continent politically and
economically.
   Kohl sought to ease such worries Tuesday by saying a united
Germany would never again threaten Europe.
   He did not offer a timetable for reunification, but said it
could take years.
   Reunification talk began after East Germany opened its borders
and the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 as part of a policy allowing citizens
to travel freely.
   The moves came after thousands fled their homeland and hundreds
of thousands took to the streets demanding social and political
reforms.
   The party ousted Honecker Oct. 18 and the new leadership has
begun exposing corruption and abuses by party members.
   East German newspapers on Wednesday described how former Premier
Willi Stoph turned a natural park into a private estate.
   Stoph was sacked from the ruling Politburo and resigned as
premier Nov. 7.
   The official Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland said he
had lived ``surrounded by Western luxury'' on an estate containing
houses, fruit plantations and an indoor swimming pool.
   East German opposition groups, church leaders and the Communists
are to meet Dec. 7 for the first round of talks on reform.

   Authorities Wednesday ordered the
arrests of four ex-ministers, a former chief of the central bank
and five other officials in connection with a $7 billion fraud case.
   It was a sensational development in the scandal, which centers
on the disbanded Recadi government agency. The case is part too of
a wave of corruption charges against the administration of former
President Jaime Lusinchi, who completed his five-year term in
February.
   The country's Upper Court on Wednesday ordered the arrests of
former Cabinet ministers Hector Hurtado, who oversaw development
and finance; Hector Meneses, from the development department;
Manuel Azpurua of finance; and Modesto Freites of planning.
   A warrant was also issued for Mauricio Garcia Araujo, former
president of the Venezuelan Central Bank.
   The court also ordered the arrests of former Recadi director
Egdalia Bastardo, former Finance Vice Minister Jorge Garcia, and
three other officials.
   The court had been expected to rule after state and municipal
elections scheduled for Sunday.
   ``The warrants were issued this afternoon and have already been
handed to the police, who will be in charge of executing them,''
said Judge Silvestre Ortiz Bucaram.
   He gave no details of what the suspects were being charged with.
   Lusinchi's successor, Carlos Andres Perez, is an old personal
and political rival.
   Meneses is reported to be in the United States seeking medical
treatment for serious injuries he suffered in April, when he shot
himself in the temple shortly after the Recadi investigation began.
   In a letter found at his side, addressed to his wife, Meneses
accused Hurtado and Azpurua of trying to make him the scapegoat.
   Recadi was the government agency charged with distributing
dollars for imports at prices much lower than those of the general
market. It was set up in 1983 to soften the impact of the
devaluation of the national currency, the bolivar.
   Perez eliminated Recadi and the preferential dollar system
shortly after his inauguration.
   Dozens of companies are now under investigation, charged with
fraudulently obtaining cheap Recadi dollars through overbilling or
non-existent imports. According to official figures, close to $7
billion ended up in private and company accounts in the United
States and Europe.
   A few months ago, a lower court investigating the case ordered
the arrest of Argentine Finance Minister Nestor Rapanelli.
   From 1984-85, Rapanelli headed Gramoven, a Venezuelan flour
mill. He was charged with wheat contraband and exchange fraud.
   In October, Lusinchi himself narrowly avoided a formal
congressional investigation when two consecutive votes ended in a
tie with the entire opposition voting against the governing
Democratic Action party.
   In another case, Jose Angel Ciliberto, Lusinchi's last interior
minister, is being investigated by the prosecutor general for
possible misuse of public funds.

   The Air Line Pilots Association expects
Eastern Airlines to begin rehiring its members who ended their
strike last week at the rate of about 100 a month, the union
president said Wednesday.
   ``The airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional
employees to work, because it's sure not working now,'' said Henry
A. Duffy, ALPA president.
   Duffy, speaking at a Washington Journalism Center seminar, said
Eastern officials have taken a ``soft approach'' in initial
discussions with pilots and flight attendants who ended their
support for a Machinists strike after eight months off the job.
   Duffy said he expects Eastern to hire back 700 union pilots.
   The airline, which has about 1,800 pilots, said it has no
openings for the returning strikers but might accept some of the
ALPA pilots when openings occur.
   About 3,500 pilots initially joined the sympathy walkout, along
with 6,000 flight attendants. Some 8,500 members of the Machinists
union remain on strike over company demands that they take wage
cuts and grant other concessions.
   Duffy said recent ALPA defeats, including a rejection of union
representation by Federal Express employees and the failure of an
employee effort to take over United Airlines, have not weakened the
union.
   He blamed a New York bankruptcy court and President Bush for
failure to resolve the Eastern strike. The court has rejected
union-backed efforts to end the strike since Eastern filed for
reorganization. Bush refused to intervene in the strike and vetoed
a bill that would have set up a congressional advisory commission
to help settle it.
   Duffy said the union is still working with the flight
attendants' union and United Airlines management to make a new
offer that would prevent the airline from being taken over in a
leveraged buyout.
   He said the Machinists union, which opposed the previous
management-employee takeover, might be more willing to join a new
proposal because the share price will be lower. United's stock fell
after the deal collapsed, helping to trigger the Oct. 13 stock
market plunge.
   Duffy said that although British Airways has said it foresees no
further involvement in the deal _ it had planned to acquire a 15
percent interest _ talks are continuing with several foreign
carriers who might join the next bid.

   The former chief of the government's $91.2
million-a-year malaria research program was indicted Wednesday on
charges of conspiring with a consultant to convert more than
$140,000 for his personal use.
   James Erickson, who has been suspended as chief of the Agency
for International Development's malaria research program, was
charged in a 12-count indictment, AID said in a statement.
   Erickson was indicted in Alexandria, Va., along with George
Diaz, a former malaria project consultant who was charged with
conspiracy.
   The two are accused of conspiring to transfer more than $140,000
in federal research grant funds for their personal use.
   Erickson was also charged with making false statements, conflict
of interest, accepting gratuities, making a false claim against the
government and filing false income tax returns.
   If convicted of the charges, Erickson could be sentenced up to
41 years in prison and fined more than $500,000, according to the
agency's statement.
   Diaz, a close friend of Erickson, faces a possible five-year
prison sentence if convicted of conspiracy.
   The indictment resulted from an investigation by the agency's
inspector general. The General Accounting Office recently
criticized the management and financial practices in the program
that Erickson administered.
   The indictment supersedes an earlier one filed against Erickson,
charging him with one count of making a false statement about a
government malaria grant.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist-run Parliament
swiftly ended the party's 40-year monopoly on power on Wednesday
and a Politburo member said Czechoslovakia's first free elections
since 1948 could be held within a year.
   The move was a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the
growing pro-democracy movement here.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said he intended to negotiate a
reassessment of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed reform
in Czechoslovakia and would be prepared to negotiate the withdrawal
of Soviet troops.
   It was the first such statement by a top-echelon official.
   Vasil Mohorita, a member of the ruling Politburo, told a news
conference that now that the Communist Party has agreed to
relinquish complete control, free elections could be held within 12
months.
   Voting with the somber, mechanical gestures born of decades of
rubberstamp approval of Communist measures, the 309 deputies
unanimously scrapped Article 4 of the constitution, which mandated
the leading role of the Communist Party. They also deleted a clause
that bases all education on Marxism-Leninism.
   ``The revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected,''
said Jiri Dienstbier, spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition,
minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television.
   The emergency parliamentary session ended late Wednesday, the
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The changes were among historic concessions the opposition won
from the Communist government on Tuesday when Adamec also promised
to form a new government, including non-Communists, by Sunday.
   They followed 11 straight days of huge anti-government
demonstrations, which culminated in a two-hour strike on Monday in
which millions of workers participated.
   Adamec went on national TV and said he had asked Civic Forum for
its suggestions on whom to include in the new government.
   Civic Forum proposed the new defense minister be a civilian
Communist and the interior minister, who controls the police, be a
civilian non-Communist, Dienstbier said.
   Parliament also eliminated the Communists' leading position in
the National Front, an umbrella organization embracing all
political parties and social groups allowed in Czechoslovakia.
   State TV later showed Slovak actor Milan Knazko announcing word
of the changes to a packed National Theater in Bratislava, capital
of Slovakia. The entire audience, which included prominent
dissident Vaclav Havel, rose to its feet in thunderous, minutelong
applause.
   Parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional
court and a commission to investigate allegations of police
brutality in a crackdown on protesters Nov. 17.
   The removal of the requirement that Marxism-Leninism be the
guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who
staged the Nov. 17 protest and have led the pro-democracy movement
since.
   In parliamentary debate, broadcast live on TV for the first
time, deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the
Communists must work hard to win the people's confidence.
   ``We have betrayed the trust of the electorate, and whatever
laws we pass today will not change this,'' said Blanka Hykova of
the Socialist Party, until recently a docile ally of the Communists.
   Anton Blazej, dean of a Communist Party training academy, said:
``We have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its
position. We must regain this trust.''
   Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik, a member of Parliament, sounded
a cautionary note: ``I am aware that neither the army nor the party
have the best position now. We should be aware that retreats and
compromises are necessary, but there are limits.''
   Alois Indra, who said Tuesday he was quitting as Parliament
president, delivered a formal speech of resignation to the
350-member chamber.
   He described the resignation as ``a logical step in the context
of the present developments.''
   Indra was said to be among party leaders who requested the
Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' of reform instituted by Alexander Dubcek, then Communist
Party chief.
   Bretislav Nedbalek, secretary of a preparatory committee, said
Czechoslovakia's Social Democratic Party had been re-established
after an absence of 41 years.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II prayed that Czechoslovakia
would use its Christian traditions in building its ``new future.''
   About 5,000 people attended a Communist-sponsored rally
Wednesday at Ostrava, an industrial city near the Polish border,
including supporters of the opposition group Civic Forum.
   Senek Milota, a local party leader, told the rally, ``We don't
want to eat soup from a charity kitchen,'' an apparent reference to
the party giving up power. Civic Forum backers jeered loudly, but
no trouble was reported.
   The Politburo's Mohorita replied when asked by reporters when
Czechoslovaks would have a chance to vote freely:
   ``First, it is necessary to change the laws. Most probably it
will take place within a year. We don't want the monopoly of one
party to continue.''
   Party chief Karel Urbanek said Tuesday the Communists were ready
to give up their exclusive control.
   Despite repeated questions, Mohorita did not say specifically
the party would hand over control if it lost free elections, but he
stressed several times: ``We're a different party now, and you all
should get used to it.''
   He conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is under
pressure from its own 1.7 million members as well as the
opposition, and said a special party congress tentatively set for
Jan. 26 might have to be held sooner.
   At a closed meeting of 3,500 party activists Tuesday night,
Urbanek said ``the future of the party requires giving up the
monopoly of power'' and many opposition demands are acceptable, the
official news agency CTK reported.
   Differences exist, he added, but ``we shall have to get used to
making politics not only with those who agree with you.''
   Urbanek said Civic Forum's demands that the party disband the
People's Militia, its private army, and get out of the workplace
were ``totally unacceptable,'' however.
   Civic Forum has also demanded the resignation of President
Gustav Husak by Dec. 10. Husak, who is closely associated with
Dubcek's ouster, was quoted on CTK as saying he was unwilling to
step down before his current five-year term, his third as
President, ends in May.

   The Air Force announced Wednesday that 50 MX
nuclear missiles will be removed from underground silos in Wyoming
and placed on trains there and in six other states _ Louisiana,
Texas, Washington, North Dakota, Arkansas and Michigan.
   The announcement represents the Bush administration's commitment
to push ahead with plans to modernize the nation's strategic
nuclear missile force, even amid projections of Pentagon
belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-control agreements
and sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.
   The 50 missiles _ dubbed the ``Peacekeeper'' by former President
Reagan _ will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles
aboard. The trains will be kept on seven Air Force bases and moved
onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis.
   The Air Force did not indicate how many of the missiles would be
at any particular site, but did say that Warren Air Force Base in
Wyoming will continue to be the main MX operating base.
   In a statement, the Air Force said that once the trains are sent
out, they will have access to ``more than 120,000 miles of
commercial track.
   ``This dispersal will offer enhanced (missile) survivability in
the event of an enemy attack, providing the potential for prompt
retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war,'' the Air
Force said.
   The Bush administration has struggled, as had the Reagan
administration, to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear
missile to America's arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult
for the Soviet Union to target U.S. forces and thus deter the
Soviets from even considering a first-strike attack.
   Earlier this year, President Bush opted to move forward with two
mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the
10-warhead MX on trains while also building the smaller,
truck-based Midgetman.
   Bush's decision has run into considerable opposition in Congress
_ both among those who contend the two-prong program is too
expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other.
   The cost of taking the nation's 50 MX missiles out of their
underground silos at the Wyoming base and building the new
``garrisons,'' or shelters, is expected to be at least $5.6
billion, said a Pentagon source who requested anonymity.
   ``Hopefully, it will be completed by 1994, but that clearly
depends on the budget,'' the source said.
   The Pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at these Air
Force bases: Warren and Barksdale in Louisiana, Dyess in Texas,
Fairchild in Washington, Grand Forks in North Dakota, Little Rock
in Arkansas and Wurtsmith in Michigan.
   Ten bases had been under consideration. The four rejected were
Eaker in Arkansas, Malmstrom in Montana, Minot in North Dakota and
Whiteman in Missouri.
   A spokesman at the Wyoming base, Maj. Kathleen McCollum, said
that four of the trains initially would be based at Warren, with
the first to be operational by 1992. The base also will serve as
the training center for the six rail-garrison crews, she said.
   In Spokane, Wash., Al Mangan of the National Committee to Block
the MX, said local activists would try to block the use of
Fairchild.
   Bush signed a military spending bill last week that establishes
a $1.1 billion fund for both the MX and the Midgetman, with the
exact spending split left to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The bill also imposes a 50-missile cap on the MX.
   Although Cheney at one point said he favored the MX over the
Midgetman, the administration has since argued that both systems
are necessary as the United States engages the Soviet Union in
arms-control talks on strategic weapons, the most lethal in the
superpowers' arsenals.
   Earlier this year, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that moving ahead on both the MX and Midgetman missiles would give
the United States more leverage at the Geneva arms-reduction talks.
   Fitzwater said: ``We think a mobile capability is essential.
Then you negotiate reductions as best you can.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, touted the decision as a job-enhancer
for his state and a chance to save the Dyess base from closure as
the Pentagon trims its budget.
   ``Rail-garrison MX will be the mainstay of our stragetic defense
well into the 21st century. So this is very good news'' for Texas,
Gramm said.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs a Senate Armed Services
subcommittee, was quoted last week as casting a doubtful eye on
money for both the MX and Midgetman programs during a time of
reduced Pentagon budgets.
   ``I don't see how we can say with a straight face that we're
going ahead'' with both of them, he said.

   A man accused of arranging his pregnant
wife's murder watched as two teen-agers stabbed her, according to
court documents unsealed Wednesday.
   Anthony Pfaaf, 19, told police that Kenneth Johnson offered him
$10,000 to kill Johnson's wife, Sharon, according to an account of
a police interview on Monday filed with Merrimack District Court by
State Police Sgt. Roland Lamy.
   Pfaaf said he recruited Jason Carroll, 19, to help kill her the
night of July 28, 1988.
   Johnson, 37, currently of Warwick, R.I., Pfaaf of Wallace, N.C.,
and formerly of Manchester, and Carroll of New Boston were all
charged with capital murder Tuesday in the woman's death.
   Sharon Johnson, 36, was seven months pregnant and had been
married to Johnson for three years when she was killed.
   Pfaaf said he asked Carroll to pretend to be someone named
``Bob'' who was to give her some money. They met Sharon Johnson at
the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester, forced her into her car
and to drive to a Bedford sand pit, Pfaaf told Lamy. He said
Kenneth Johnson gave them directions to the sand pit earlier in the
day.
   When they arrived at the pit, Carroll told Lamy they got out and
a man, whom he assumed was Johnson, approached from nearby woods.
   ``What are you doing here?'' Sharon Johnson asked the man,
according to Carroll's account.
   Kenneth Johnson responded by cursing her and accusing her of
cheating on him, said Carroll, who had never met Johnson before.
   Pfaaf, who also placed Johnson at the scene of the killing, said
his wife began to struggle and Carroll stabbed her, then gave him
the knife and he stabbed and choked her. Pfaaf said Johnson
supplied them with the knife used in the killing.
   Pfaaf said he and Carroll later went to Johnson's home in Bow
where he paid them $10,000.
   Based on information supplied by Kenneth Johnson, police
circulated a sketch of ``Bob'' and tried to locate him during the
months after the murder. At one point last year, Johnson told
police that Bob was ``someone who put in bets for me and he owes me
money.''
   An investigation, however, later showed there was no ``Bob,''
and suspicions focused on Johnson.
   The three, who face the death penalty if convicted, were ordered
held without bail at the Hillsborough County Jail in Manchester.

   The company operating a construction crane
that collapsed and fell 16 stories, killing five people,``has one
of the poorest safety records in the industry'' in its home state,
an official said.
   Erection Co. of Kirkland, Wash., has been fined for safety
violations at least eight times, including four since 1987,
according to Washington state Department of Labor and Industries
records.
   In August 1988, it was cited for a ``serious, willful
violation'' of state safety laws after a worker fell 123 feet to
his death, said John Akins, department spokesman. Erection is
appealing a $24,500 fine, he said.
   Telephone calls to company offices were not returned Wednesday.
   Construction officials said they have no idea why the 240-ton
crane snapped and fell Tuesday morning while it was being moved to
allow work at the top of a 20-story high-rise being built for the
Federal Home Loan Bank in the city's Financial District.
   The crane plunged 200 feet to the street, whipping into two
other buildings and smashing vehicles below. Five people were
killed and 21 injured.
   Four of those killed were jacking the crane from the 16th floor
to the 20th floor of the high-rise. The other victim was the driver
of a bus that was taking disabled children to school.
   ``This was not considered a dangerous procedure at all,'' said
Larry Duggan, a vice president for the project's general
contractor, Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co. of San Francisco.
   Swinerton &amp; Walberg itself has faced criminal negligence charges
twice before, once stemming from another fatal crane collapse,
according to Los Angeles Deputy City Attorney Michael Guarino.
   Hamilton Fairburn, deputy chief of the California Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, said the investigation of the
accident is continuing and no possible causes have been eliminated.
   Fairburn said investigators have ``given a low priority to wind
as a factor'' and referred to the raising of the crane operation,
which was underway when the accident occurred, as ``historically a
very safe operation.''
   The coroner's office on Wednesday identified the dead workers as
Paul Cline, 49, of Renton, Wash.; Lonnie Boggess, 45, of Tacoma,
Wash.; Steve Tilton, 25, of Spanaway, Wash.; and David Graden, 34,
of Kirkland, Wash. Boggess was at the controls of the crane when it
collapsed. The bus driver was Kathleen Holden, 39, of Berkeley.
   Five people remained hospitalized Wednesday; one was in serious
condition, three were fair and one was listed as good, said Gloria
Rodriquez, a spokeswoman for San Francisco General Hospital.
   As workers cleaned up the debris Wednesday, authorities shut off
the gas supply for 28 businesses in a seven-block area because of a
worsening gas leak caused by the crane collapse.
   Workers clearing away debris found part of the crane's
counterweight embedded in pavement directly over a main gas line.
   The Fire Department told Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. to close the
area's gas supply so the counterweight could be lifted, allowing
officials to survey damage to the 16-inch main gas line, said PG&amp;E
spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   Nearly half the customers should get their gas restored by
Thursday after an auxiliary gas line is installed, he said.
   The huge job of removing debris will probably take at least two
weeks, according to an official in charge of the operation.
   ``It will take that just to pull stuff off the roof,'' said
Barney Bloat, superintendent of Sheedy Drayage Co.
   Guarino, the Los Angeles deputy city attorney, said charges were
filed against the construction company after a crane collapsed in
Los Angeles in 1981, killing two people. The case was dropped
because prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence, but
state labor code requires proof of wanton and willful disregard for
human safety, Guarino said.
   In 1986, Swinerton was a co-defendant with another construction
company in a case involving an overloaded steel superstructure on a
21-story building in Los Angeles. Three ironworkers were killed
when girders crashed through a floor, Guarino said.
   That case resulted in Swinerton agreeing to sponsor a safety
seminar for downtown Los Angeles contractors and to make a donation
to a labor safety board, he said.
   Swinerton did not repond to telephone calls Wednesday requesting
comment on the charges.
   Akins, the Washington state labor official, said the crane
subcontractor, Erection Co., ``has one of the poorest safety
records in the industry'' in Washington.
   In November 1988, the company was fined $41,000 for numerous
worker-safety violations at an office tower under construction,
said department spokesman Dick Kunkle.
   The San Francisco project began in January and has received no
safety citations, Swinerton officials said.

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who
spun and vaulted her way into sports history with scores of perfect
10s at the 1976 Olympics, has fled her homeland, Hungary's news
agency reported Wednesday.
   Comaneci, 28, told border guards she left her rigid Communist
country ``for the sake of freedom,'' the MTI news agency said.
   Her whereabouts were not known. The agency initially reported
she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been
granted a temporary residence permit, valid for three days.
   At the age of 14, the solemn, 4-foot-11 Comaneci astounded the
world with the first-ever perfect scores in gymnastics, winning
three Olympic gold medals on the uneven bars, balance beam and
overall competition at the Montreal games.
   During a career that lasted until 1984, Comaneci won 21 gold
medals in Olympic and other international competition. After ending
her competitive career, she turned coach and referee and served as
a role model for Romanian youth.
   Because of her achievements, Comaneci was made a Hero of
Socialist Labor by President Nicolae Ceausescu, the hard-line
Communist leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform
sweeping the East bloc.
   At one time, she was linked romantically with Nicu Ceausescu,
the president's son.
   She reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country
notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods, as well as
for the Ceausescu brand of neo-Stalinism. About 25,000 Romanians
have fled to Hungary the past two years.
   Despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her
government, Comaneci often expressed dissatisfaction with the
demands of her career. She repeatedly complained of exhaustion,
overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous
training and competition schedule.
   MTI said Comaneci complained to Hungarian border officials that
her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad.
She received the temporary residence permit in Szeged, a town about
15 miles from the Romanian border.
   Hungarian radio reported that Comaneci made a pre-dawn crossing
Tuesday into Hungary by car at the nearby border town of Kiszombor
with six other Romanians, who were not identified.
   Citing unconfirmed reports, MTI said Comaneci and her companions
Wednesday left the Szeged hotel where they had been lodged by
police in a car bearing non-Hungarian plates, and had not been seen
since.
   Istvan Fretyan, an editor at the Szeged radio station told The
Associated Press that Comaneci was believed to have left for
Budapest, about 110 miles away, to stay with friends. The residency
permit allows unrestricted travel throughout Hungary.
   The Interior Ministry refused to disclose Comaneci's whereabouts
and told The AP that the former Olympic star did not wish to give
any interviews.
   Comaneci's former coach, Bela Karolyi, defected in 1981 while on
an American tour with the Romanian gymnastics team.
   ``I'm ready to help her in any manner if she needs it,'' said
Karolyi, who became a U.S. citizen last spring.
   Her defection ``is what I was really wishing would happen one of
these days,'' he said in an interview from Clarens, Switzerland,
where he was coaching the U.S. women's team at an international
meet.
   Comaneci ``is still a big personality in Romania. She has
nothing against the Romanian population, but just like me she was
chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' Karolyi
said.
   The coach said he would recommend that Comaneci go to the United
States because of the opportunities there.
   Officials in Washington said there was no immediate indication
she would try to gain admission to the United States.
   ``I am not aware of anything right now,'' said Verne Jervis,
spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Comaneci has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs
in the West but she did not say where.
   Patty Auer, a spokesperson for the U.S. Gymnastics Federation in
Indianapolis, said: ``We have no official word on any offers, but
that wouldn't surprise me. There have been no overtures from the
federation.''

   Salvadoran diplomats closed their
embassy in Managua and returned home Wednesday after their country
suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   But charge d'affaires Roberto Lopez Geissman insisted there was
no break in relations between the two countries. He told reporters
at the airport before leaving for San Salvador that he was just
being recalled indefinitely for consultations.
   ``Unfortunately, there's been speculation that there's a
breaking of relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua, which is
not true,'' Lopez said.
   ``It's not even a suspension .... It's a re-calling for
consultations. Of course, it's much graver because it's the whole
diplomatic and consular delegation'' that is leaving Managua, he
added.
   Lopez left together with the Salvadoran Consul, an executive
secretary and their families. The Salvadoran diplomatic mission was
shut down Wednesday.
   The Colombian Embassy in Managua might look after Salvadoran
affairs, but this has not been finalized, Lopez said. Meanwhile, he
said Costa Rican Ambassador Farid Ayales had agreed to act as
caretaker.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani announced Sunday he had
suspended diplomatic and commercial relations with the Sandinista
government, accusing it of smuggling weapons to leftist guerrillas
in El Salvador.
   Cristiani announced the break a day after authorities in the
neighboring country found two small planes were ferrying
surface-to-air missiles and other military hardware to the rebels.
   In one plane, three crew members died as a result of the crash
and a fourth survived but committed suicide afterwards, Salvadoran
military authorities said.
   They said the other plane landed and unloaded but could not take
off for reasons still being investigated and the crew set the
aircraft afire and fled the scene.
   Lopez said ``because of the fellowship that has united the
Central American countries'' the closure won't last long, and
``diplomatic relations can be fully re-established.''
   El Salvador re-called its ambassador after the 1978-79
Sandinista revolution, when the embassy was fired on. Since then,
the mission has been headed by several charge d'affaires.
   In New York, diplomats at the United Nations said the Security
Council will hold a debate Thursday on El Salvador's complaint that
Nicaragua is sending weapons to the rebels.
   El Salvador has requested the debate, and the council members
decided to go ahead during private consultations Wednesday, the
diplomats said on condition of anonymity.

   The investment banker who was raped, beaten and
left for dead by a group of young men while jogging in Central Park
seven months ago has returned to her job in the financial district,
a source said Wednesday.
   The 29-year-old woman, who has undergone physical and emotional
rehabilitation since her April ordeal, returned to the department
she had worked in with similar duties at the Salomon Brothers
investment banking concern, said a court source who spoke only on
the condition of anonymity.
   The woman's name has not been published because of the nature of
the crime. She was assigned to a position advising large
corporations on investments.
   ``I'm sure they're not going to overload her,'' the source said.
``The doctors were very concerned about the effect of stress on
her.''
   The woman returned to work as her alleged assailants were in
court for a pretrial hearing to determine whether statements they
gave to police can be used as evidence at their trial. Defense
lawyers believe they were acquired illegally.
   She resumed working full-time Monday, the source said.
   Jennifer Clements, a spokeswoman at Salomon, said the firm would
have no comment.
   An aunt of the jogger told WABC-TV Wednesday night that her
niece's ``attitude is unbelievably lovely. She has no animosity.
She has the determination that `I'm going to make it,' and she's
thankful.''
   The aunt, a school teacher who appeared in silhouette on the
broadcast, said the jogger has no memory of the attack, ``and
hopefully it will never come back.''
   The aunt added, ``She's as sharp as she ever was, I think ...
and in conversation, in her grasp of what's going on in the world,
she is very cognizant of world events.''
   Before the attack, according to friends and colleagues, the
woman would often begin her work day at 7:30 a.m. and spent up to
12 hours in the office.
   The woman, who had been at a Connecticut rehabilitation
hospital, moved out of her Manhattan apartment and relocated to
another in the borough, the source said.
   According to the source, the woman has also resumed jogging with
family and friends. She has told prosecutors that she is eager to
testify at the trial of the six youths accused of attacking her
during her nightly jog on April 19.
   The woman's remarkable recovery since being discovered near
death in a wooded area in the park has been chronicled closely in
the media and cheered by New Yorkers.
   According to authorities, she was jogging through the park when
she was attacked by a gang ``wilding'' youths, dragged into the
woods, beaten and raped.
   The woman had lost most of her blood and was suffering from
hypothermia when she was discovered hours after the attack. Doctors
initially gave her little chance of making a complete recovery.

   CBS has bought rights to the summer blockbuster
hit, ``Batman,'' and Ted Turner's cable company has bought rights
to 1,000 films from Columbia Pictures Television, CBS and Turner
officials said Wedneday.
   The officials wouldn't disclose the purchase prices, but Susan
Tick, a spokesman for CBS in Los Angeles, characterized as ``just
silly'' one report that said CBS paid up to $20 million for
``Batman.''
   She said she didn't know when CBS will air the film. One
executive who asked not to be identified said the network probably
won't broadcast the film until 1992.
   The cable rights purchase by Turner's year-old Turner Network
Television cable channel and his TBS SuperStation is for films
dating from 1935 to 1983.
   They range from ``Tootsie'' to ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
The majority of the films will air on TNT.
   Rights to show the films begin in January and extend through
May, 1999 1999.
   Turner's film library already includes the pre-1986 MGM films,
pre-1950 Warner Brothers films and a number of RKO titles.
   In a statement, Turner Broadcasting System, which owns TNT and
TBS, said the Columbia purchases represents ``the largest movie
package ever licensed from a single Hollywood studio in the history
of basic cable.''

<TEXT>
   A CIA plane en route from Zaire to Angola
carrying military and other equipment for U.S.-backed rebels in
Angola crashed this week, killing an undetermined number of
Americans and insurgents, government officials said Wednesday.
   The L-100 flight left a military base at Kamina in Zaire Monday
night and went down not far from the southeastern Angolan town of
Jamba, where the UNITA rebels have their headquarters, the sources
said, attributing the crash to pilot error.
   They said all the Americans on board were killed along with
several UNITA rebels. Several others survived, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The State Department said Wednesday night that four Americans
were on board but it did not say how many were killed. The
department declined further comment, except to confirm that there
was a crash on Monday in a remote section of southeastern Angola
and that the cause was unknown.
   Asked for comment, CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said, ``As a
matter of policy, we never confirm or deny such reports.''
   The sources were unable to identify the dead Americans but a
Defense Department official on Tuesday reportedly notified the
family of James Spessard, 31, of Hagerstown, Md., that he had died
in a plane crash ``near Zaire.''
   A family member told the Hagerstown Morning Herald that the
Pentagon official offered very little information about the crash.
   Spessard is survived by his wife, Deborah, and two small boys.
Efforts to reach the family Wednesday evening were not successful.
   Since 1986, the United States has been providing military aid to
UNITA in its 14-year struggle against the Soviet-backed government
in Angola.
   U.S. resupply planes secretly have been using Zaire as a staging
area for sending materiel to the rebel forces but Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko ordered a halt to this activity last June when he
launched a peace mediation effort.
   During a visit to Washington in early October, U.S. officials
convinced Mobutu to allow the resupply flights to resume, the
officials said. The Monday flight was the first since June.
   The L-100 is a civilian version of the workhorse Lockheed C-130
transport, powered by four turboprop engines.
   Randall Robinson, who heads TransAfrica, a private group seeking
to influence U.S. policy in Africa, said the incident in Angola
reinforces his view that U.S. aid to UNITA should stop.
   ``We have turned this African country into a graveyard,''
Robinson said. ``American participation in this devastation is
morally and strategically indefensible.''
   A cease-fire was agreed to in June between UNITA and Angola's
MPLA government but it was broken in August and there has been
intermittent fighting since then.
   The MPLA has been backed by large-scale Soviet military aid over
the years and by Cuban troops. Last December, however, Cuba agreed
to remove its troops over a 27-month period that will end in early
1991.
   The Angola war is one of several regional conflicts in which the
United States and the Soviet Union have been supporting rival
factions. It is expected to be the subject of discussion this
weekend at the summit meeting in the Mediterranean between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Ironically, the CIA flight went down just two days after a
similar type of incident involving a guerrilla resupply flight
occurred in El Salvador. There, a twin-engine Cessna originating in
Nicaragua crashed while carrying Soviet bloc anti-aircraft missiles
and other equipment reportedly earmarked for leftist rebels in El
Salvador.

   Parliament voted unanimously to scrap the provisions in the
constitution that mandated a leading role for the Communist Party.
   A member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo said free
elections _ the first in four decades _ could be held within a year.
   Parliament also ended a requirement that all education be based
on Marxist-Leninist principles. Dropping that requirement was a
primary demand of student demonstrators.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said would be prepared to negotiate the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia. He also said he
had asked the opposition group Civic Forum for suggestions on whom
to include in the new government.

   West Germany has begun a diplomatic campaign to win
international support of its plan for reunification of the two
Germanies. But Soviet officials rejected the West German plan and
said a united Germany could upset European stability.

The move came after Slovenia introduced emergency measures to

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Wednesday that the Salvadoran government's domestic crackdown was
an ``absolutely appropriate'' response to rebel attacks on U.S. and
other targets.
   Earlier, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said when
asked about the government's crackdown, ``Our response is that we
deplore violence and killing on both sides.''
   The leftist guerillas ``briefly overran'' the home of at least
one U.S. Embassy officer in the early morning outbreak of fighting,
Baker told reporters, also saying, ``We are taking steps to assure
the safety of embassy personnel.''
   Administration officials said all the Americans escaped injury.
   The State Department, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour task force to
monitor the events in El Salvador.
   The task force said in a statement that the family whose home
was briefly seized had been ``safely evacuated by Salvadoran
government forces'' and that the Americans were ``not actually in
the hands of the guerrillas at any time.''
   The rebels ``appeared to seize this residence at random,'' said
task force spokesman David Denny.
   After the pre-dawn attack, embassy personnel were told not to
report to work Wednesday and the embassy was closed for the day,
said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   However, said Denny, ``several families are unable to leave
their homes because of fighting'' in the neighborhoods of San
Benito, Escalon and San Francisco.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said in San Salvador that a
charter flight might depart Thursday with embassy dependents who
want to leave. Embassy personnel who planned to go home for
Christmas would leave early, he said.
   Baker said President Bush will press Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Central America during their shipboard summit this
weekend in the Mediterranean. The secretary said Bush wants the
Soviet Union to make sure its Nicaraguan ally adheres to Soviet
assurances to the administration that East Bloc weapons will not go
through Managua to the Salvadoran rebels.
   In Paris, the newspaper Le Monde said Wednesday that the Soviet
Union has told both Nicaragua and Cuba to stop supplying arms to
the Salvadoran rebels. The newspaper said those instructions were
given to high Cubana and Nicaraguan officials at a secret meeting
in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, called by the Soviet ambassador.
   ``It's in their power to assure themselves that they will not be
lied to in the future. We'd like to see them exercise that,'' Baker
said, referring to the Soviets.
   He decried ``the continuing pattern of Soviet arms shipments to
Moscow's Third World clients,'' saying that in the case of Central
America it was a ``disturbing approach of throwing fuel on the
fire.''
   Baker spoke a few hours before it was learned in Washington that
a CIA plane carrying equipment to a U.S. Third-World client, the
UNITA rebel movement in Angola, had crashed near Jamba, Angola.
   The all-out offensive the Salvadoran rebels launched on Nov. 11,
Baker said, ``was made possible by Soviet arms.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani ``is cracking down in El Salvador in
an attempt to rid the streets of these terrorist guerrillas. I
don't think that that's anything but absolutely appropriate,'' the
secretary said.
   Separately, CIA Director William Webster told reporters that the
rebels were continuing to ``make a symbolic and important statement
about their ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacks
but that they posed no threat to Cristiani's government.
   Since the rebel offensive began, Cristiani's security forces
have raided more than a dozen churches and refugee centers and have
detained labor officials.
   Last week, six Jesuit priests were brutally murdered; witnesses
have said uniformed sldiers were seen near the killing site.
   In a separate incident, seven civilians were lined up and
executed on Nov. 18 in a poor San Salvador suburb. Witnesses saw
government soldiers a block away minutes before the killings.
   Baker said Cristiani and his government ``understand very well
that there must be complete respect for human rights in El Salvador
if they expect to contiue to receive United States support.''
   As to the resurgence of right-wing death squad activity, which
in the past has been linked to Cristiani's conservative Arena
party, Baker said, ``I think its important that they do everything
they can to get control of that kind of activity.''
   Baker was asked by reporters if President Bush was contemplating
any military intervention in light of the latest violence. He said
the president ``has never ruled out any option that might be
necessary to protect American lives.''
   Under current congressional restraints, the United States can
provide 55 military advisers as part of its aid to the Salvadoran
government.
   The presence of an additional six Green Berets came to light
last week when the rebels took over the Sheraton Hotel in San
Salvador, where the elite troops were staying. Fitzwater said those
Green Berets were not part of the 55-member contingent butwere on
special temporary assignment in El Salvador.
   Wednesday's outbreak of fighting occurred in the same affluent
neighborhood.
   Regarding the case of Connecticut church worker Jennifer Casolo,
who was arrested by the Salvadoran government on Sunday on charges
of harboring weapons, Fitzwater said U.S. officials ``have been
monitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated.''
   Fitzwater said that during her four years in El Salvador, Miss
Casolo had become ``known to embassy officials through her work
with Christian education seminars and coordinating non-official
delegations to El Salvador. ... The embassy will continue to assure
that she is given every benefit due her under Salvadoran law.''
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who spoke with Miss Casolo in the
police barracks where she is held, said in Seattle she ``maintained
her innocence.''
   A group of Americans headed by former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark planned to fly from Miami to San Salvador on Thursday to see
her and help slect a Salvadoran attorney, a spokesman for the group
said in Seattle.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on his first visit
to Britain predicted Wednesday that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
alliance will eventually be dismantled.
   On his arrival from Poland, Walesa told a news conference at
Heathrow Airport that he expected Eastern bloc defense budgets to
decline gradually as democratic reforms are enacted.
   The global arms race will slow, and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact
``will be dissolved eventually ... as the process of common sense
prevails,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The Warsaw Pact was created in 1955 as a mutual defense alliance
among the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites.
   ``It's ridiculous to destroy the earth eight times over, and
they are still thinking of a ninth,'' Walesa added. ``As Europe
becomes integrated economically, it becomes even more ridiculous.''
   Western European nations have agreed to form an economic union
by the end of 1992.
   In Washington on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit should leave the
superpowers ``better prepared to make substantial progress'' on a
treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons.
   However, he emphasized anew that no such agreement would be
reached during the two-day meeting. He also said he expected no
pact on conventional forces to emerge from the meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Saturday
and Sunday off the Mediterranean island of Malta.
   In his comments, Walesa said he would like to see the 12-nation
European Economic Community expanded to embrace all of Europe.
   ``Together we can find solutions we are proud of,'' he said.
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning labor leader said his recent trip
to the United States proved to Americans that they should invest in
Poland and now he was bringing his appeal to Britain.
   The U.S. House of Representatives has approved a three-year,
$864.5 million aid program for Poland.
   After his tour of the United States, Canada and Venezuela,
Walesa returned to Poland on Thursday before flying out again on a
four-day trip to Britain. Solidarity took control of the Polish
government in August, creating the first non-Communist government
in the East bloc since the Communists consolidated power after
World War II.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced Wednesday that Britain
will double its aid package to Poland to $77 million over a
five-year period and give $64 million more to an International
Monetary Fund to rebuild the Polish economy.
   Walesa, a guest of the Trade Unions Congress federation, later
Wednesday attended a private dinner to mark the 40th anniversary of
the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
   The 46-year-old former shipyard electrician is to meet Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at her official residence on Saturday.

<NOTE>John Palmer Leaving NBC News After 26 Years</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Palmer, the former ``Today'' newscaster
shifted to an earlier show when Deborah Norville took his place on
``Today,'' is leaving NBC News after 26 years to work on a
syndicated program, it was reported Wednesday.
   Palmer declined to comment on CNBC's ``Media Beat'' report that
he is leaving to go work with Av Westin, a former ABC News
executive, on a proposed new series, ``Only Yesterday,'' for King
World. Programs the company currently syndicates includes the hit
``Wheel of Fortune'' game show.
   An NBC spokeswoman also declined to comment on the Palmer report
on CNBC, which is NBC's new cable channel.
   However, an NBC executive who asked not to be named said that
Palmer is leaving NBC News, which he joined in 1963 from WSB-TV in
Atlanta.
   Palmer, a former White House correspondent, was shifted to ``NBC
News at Sunrise'' in September after Norville, then that program's
anchor, was moved to the news anchor job he had held at ``Today''
since September, 1982.
   The shift was part of a series of changes at NBC's top-rated

   A Richmond man accused of using a
computer bulletin board to ask about acquiring young boys for a
pornographic ``snuff'' film pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy
to kidnap and soliciting to produce child pornography.
   The defendant, Dean A. Lambey, faces a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment plus 10 years and $500,000 in fines for both charges.
   Lambey, 34, and Daniel T. Depew, 28, of Alexandria, were charged
in U.S. District Court in August following a six-month undercover
police operation that began, according to court documents, when
Lambey contacted an undercover police officer in San Jose, Calif.,
through a computer bulletin board system and asked about young boys
for a pornographic ``snuff'' film.
   A ``snuff'' film is one in which someone is actually killed.
   In March, Lambey suggested that he and the undercover officers
produce their own child pornography film, buying a child for
$12,000 from an out-of-state source, according to an account of the
case given The Associated Press in August by an official who
insisted on anonymity.
   More than 100 FBI agents and San Jose, Calif., police were
involved in the investigation, U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson said
in August, with agents keeping the suspects under surveillance 24
hours a day.

<HEAD>Supercomputer Foresees End of Amazon Rain Forest in 50-100 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study by the Brazilian Space
Research Institute shows the entire Amazon rain forest could be
wiped out in 50 to 100 years if deforestation continues at the
present rate.
   Carlos Nobre, an engineer and meteorologist with the institute,
said Wednesday the findings were the result of a year-long study at
the University of Maryland using a supercomputer belonging to NASA.
   Nobre said he used mathematical formulas to project the effects
of deforestation, which he estimates destroys 14,000 square miles
of rain forest a year.
   The computer predicted the huge wilderness could dry up and turn
into a vast, scrub-covered savanna, he said.
   ``The advance of pasture land would profoundly change the
landscape and the way of life in the region,'' the scientist said
at the institute in Sao Jose dos Campos, 200 miles southwest of Rio.
   Nobre said the destruction of trees to clear land for planting
and grazing reduces the forest's capacity to retain water.
   As a result, temperatures will rise, rainfall will diminish and
the soil will become poorer, he said. Even the water level in
rivers will fall, reducing the hydroelectric potential.
   When that happens, Nobre said, the rain forest would succumb to
a long dry season and turn into a savanna, covered with scrub trees
and grass.
   The 2 million-square-mile Brazilian Amazon is the world's
largest wilderness. Independent studies show 12 percent of it has
been destroyed, mostly by small farmers and cattle ranchers using
slash-and-burn techniques. The government claims the correct figure
is 5 percent.
   Scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the
greenhouse effect, which traps the sun's rays and causes global
warming.
   The Brazilian government, under fire from environmentalists,
recently announced that burnings in the Amazon were far less than
in previous years.

<TEXT>
   Dorothy Stebbins Bowles, who won an
international reputation as a friendly and independent-minded
diplomat during her late husband's tours as U.S. ambassador to
India, has died after a brief illness.
   Her husband, Chester Bowles, was a principal foreign policy
advisor to President Kennedy and served as Ambassador to India
twice, first from 1951 to 1958, then from 1963 to 1969.
   Mrs. Bowles, who died Tuesday, was widely known in India. She
delighted in Indian culture and raised eyebrows among other
Americans when she began to wear a sari, the traditional,
wrap-around Indian dress.
   She often wore a sari in Connecticut, and wore one to her
husband's funeral.
   Bowles, who died in 1986, also served one term as Connecticut
governor and represented the state in Congress. He once said his
1934 marriage to Dorothy Stebbins, then a psychiatric social
worker, was ``the most important event in shaping my later lfe.''
   In Essex, where she lived for 50 years, Mrs. Bowles was active
in local politics and brought many famous guests to the Connecticut
River town.
   ``It was a household where you could find Adlai Stevenson or
Eleanor Roosevelt or some prizefighter or some neighbor who just
happened to drop in, and usually a large number of children,'' said
Doug Bennet, president of National Public Radio and a former member
of the Bowles' embassy staff.
   ``It was one of the most exciting places I've ever been in my
life,'' he said.
   Gov. William A. O'Neill, in a statement Wednesday, said, ``I
consider myself extremely fortunate to have been Steb's friend and
I will miss her greatly.''

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury convened Wednesday
to study an engineer's allegations that equipment for the space
shuttles did not get proper inspections after the explosion that
killed the seven Challenger astronauts.
   U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson said he expects the grand jury to
complete its work by Friday and that he is prohibited from
commenting on anything the panel is examining.
   However, a spokesman for the Thiokol Corp., formerly
Morton-Thiokol, at Ogden, Utah, Steve Lawson, said the company had
been asked to provide information about instrumentation in
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket motors used starting with the
Discovery flight Sept. 30, 1988.
   Lawson, whose company makes solid fuel boosters for the
shuttles, said he could not provide details on what type of
information had been requested. He said the instruments fulfilled
NASA requirements.
   A Thiokol engineer, Dan Joos, has said there was improper
testing of booster parts. He and employees of at least one Thiokol
subcontractor reportedly were subpoenaed to appear before the grand
jury.
   Joos had said that instruments that measure stresses on the
184-foot-long boosters were not properly inspected and could be
giving engineers false information. He said that could lead to
failures of the booster rockets.
   NASA suspended shuttle flights and overhauled engines and
spacecraft after the failure of a booster rocket seal caused the
Challenger explosion.
   Royce Mitchell, manager of the solid rocket motor office at
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, said his office was
cooperating in the investigation of Joos' charges.
   Jack Lee, Marshall's director, said NASA engineers at Huntsville
investigated Joos' allegations and concluded there were ``no safety
issues involved'' that would require suspending shuttle flights.
   The Rogers Commission that investigated the Challenger tragedy
found that Marshall engineers had pushed for the Challenger launch
while ignoring booster problems.
   J.R. Thompson, NASA's deputy administrator and Marshall director
during the booster redesign work, said he was unaware of Joos'
concerns or the grand jury probe.
   ``I don't know what they're talking about because all flights we
have made since Challenger have gone exceptionally well,'' he said
in Washington.
   Porter Bridwell, manager of Marshall's shuttle projects office,
said his engineers and NASA's inspector general began looking into
Joos' concerns about a month ago. He said they felt sure they
``weren't related to safety issues.''

<HEAD>Challenger Formally Nominated to Run Against Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Anthony Meyer, a rank-and-file member of the
governing Conservatives, was nominated for party leader Wednesday
in the first challenge to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher since
she took over the party's top post 14 years ago.
   The challenge comes at a time of sagging popularity for Mrs.
Thatcher's leadership. Opinion polls published Sunday showed the
Conservatives trailing opposition Labor by as much as 14 points.
   However, Meyer, who handed in his nomination papers Wednesday
evening, said he had ``no idea'' how much support he would get.
   ``All I want to do is to give people the opportunity to vote,''
he told reporters. ``It is for them to make up their own minds.''
   Mrs. Thatcher ousted former Prime Minister Edward Heath as party
leader 14 years ago.
   The 64-year-old prime minister has led the Conservatives to
three successive election victories since 1979. She is the
longest-serving British prime minister this century.
   Nominations for the party leadership close at noon Thursday. The
results of voting by the 375 Conservatives in the 650-member House
of Commons are due to be announced Tuesday.
   Conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader, but Mrs.
Thatcher has been endorsed unopposed since defeating Heath in 1975.
   Mrs. Thatcher complained Monday that the challenge to her
leadership was causing ``damaging'' uncertainty.
   Labor moved ahead of the Conservatives in the polls in the
spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and
intended changes in the National Health Service.
   
   When Meyer, a 69-year-old former diplomat, announced his
candidacy last week, he said he would withdraw if a more senior
party member would run against Mrs. Thatcher. But none has come
forward.
   Under party rules, the identities of Meyer's nominator and
seconder are not disclosed.
   Under a complicated voting formula, Mrs. Thatcher needs 57
percent of the votes cast to win outright. If she fails, other
candidates are expected to enter the race for a second ballot.
   Meyer opposes the sale of state-owned water utilities. He wants
better pensions for war widows and believes Mrs. Thatcher should be
more enthusiastic about European economic integration.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos Turned To Nancy Reagan For Legal Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon after Ferdinand Marcos was deposed as
Philippine leader in 1986, his wife appealed to Nancy Reagan for
White House intervention in their legal affairs, according to
government documents made public Wednesday.
   In a ``Dearest Nancy'' letter dated Sept. 11, 1986, Imelda
Marcos asked Mrs. Reagan to help her avoid iving a deposition in a
civil racketeering lawsuit brought in a California court by the
Philippine government against the Marcoses.
   ``I understand that a `suggestion' from the `White House' or the
`State Depart.' could prevent these indignities to an ally and
friend,'' Mrs. Marcos wrote.
   Whether Mrs. Reagan responded is not known, but Mrs. Marcos
later did give the deposition, invoking her Fifth Amendment rights.
The Philippine case, which is still pending, seeks to recover money
allegedly stolen from the Philippine government by the Marcoses for
personal use.
   Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the Reagans in Los Angeles, said
Wednesday that it was the Reagans' ``long-standing practice not to
comment on pending legal matters.''
   The letter was contained in the government's response papers to
numerous pretrial motions brought by Mrs. Marcos' lawyers in her
pending criminal indictment.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to charges that she and her
late husband siphoned nearly $200 million from the Philippine
treasury and funneled it into this country for the purchase of New
York real estate and art. She is scheduled to go on trial in
Manhattan's federal court March 14.
   The government papers also revealed that prosecutors
investigated charges that Marcos embezzled $15 million in U.S.
government funds that had been designated for use by the Philippine
government. The money, from the U.S. Agency for International
Development, allegedly was deposited into a Swiss bank account
controlled by Marcos.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said Wednesday that the
embezzlement allegations were not contained in the racketeering
indictment brought against the Marcoses in October 1988.
   Mrs. Marcos' letter was included to undercut her contention that
she and her husband were ``kidnapped'' from the Philippines by the
U.S. government in February 1986 after Marcos was ousted as leader.
   In the letter, Mrs. Marcos thanks the Reagans for their
hospitality.
   LaBella said Mrs. Marcos's abduction allegation was ``an absurd
claim ... She transforms history into fairy tale.''
   ``Marcos does not acknowledge that the United States government
evacuated her amidst crowds of anti-Marcos demonstrators, but
contends, instead that the United States government ousted her from
power through force and deception,'' LaBella said in his papers.
   Mrs. Marcos is seeking to have the charges against her dropped
because of the abduction claim.
   The government papers also revealed that the Marcoses declined
to provide any tax information to the United States government in
1986 and 1987 because they claimed they were brought to the country
against their will.
   In addition to Mrs. Marcos' letter, the prosecutor included a
letter from Ferdinand Marcos to President Reagan, which had
previously been made public.
   In that letter, dated June 9, 1988, Marcos, who died in
September at the couple's home in exile in Honolulu, asks the
president to block the criminal indictment against the Marcoses and
then thanked the president for his hospitality over the last two
years.
   Marcos's letter, which was typewritten and addressed to ``Mr.
President,'' was much more formal than Mrs. Marcos's appeal to Mrs.
Reagan, in which she describes the pain and humiliation of the
couple's legal problems.
   ``I don't think I have enough strength left to bear up with all
these,'' she wrote. ``Therefore I ask your invaluable help to
prevent a `deposition' on me and with a clear conscience, I am
optimistic of justice and your understanding.''
   The letter was signed, ``Much, much love, Imelda.''

   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., was refused
permission to visit the so-called Birmingham Six, six prisoners
serving life sentences for IRA bombings in 1974, the Home Office
said Wednesday.
   Kennedy, eldest son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, said he was
``very distressed'' his request, made through the British Embassy
in Washington, was denied.
   A world campaign is under way for release of the six prisoners,
who claim they were beaten into confessing and convicted on faulty
forensic evidence.
   The bombings killed 22 people in Birmingham, England. The Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of
British rule, claimed responsibility.
   The Home Office said Kennedy's request was denied because he was
not on the prisoners' approved list of visitors. It said logistics
also presented a problem because the six are in three separate
prisons.
   Kennedy met with relatives of the six and campaigners for their
release at Shannon Airport in the Irish Republic.
   He said the Human Rights Caucus in Congress would hold a full
hearing on the case early next year.

<HEAD>Son of B-Movie Actress Gets Suspended Sentence in Her Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of B-movie actress Susan Cabot was
given a three-year suspended sentence and placed on probation
Wednesday for the beating death of his mother.
   Timothy Scott Roman originally was charged with murder in the
1986 bludgeoning death of Miss Cabot, 59, who appeared in such
1950s films as ``Machine Gun Kelly'' with Charles Bronson and
``Tomahawk'' with Rock Hudson.
   The sentencing of Roman ended an unusual pair of trials marked
by testimony that Roman, born a dwarf, suffered brain damage from
growth drugs and allegations Roman was the illegitimate son of
Jordan's King Hussein.
   Roman, 25, of Encino was convicted last month of involuntary
manslaughter in a second trial, conducted without a jury before
Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp. The first trial ended in a
mistrial when Roman's attorney became ill.
   ``The case is a real tragic one. It's hard to walk out and say
you're happy with the result,'' said Roman's second attorney,
Michael White. ``He loved his mother and ... is relieved in the
knowledge he doesn't have to go to jail and can get on and live his
life.''
   Miss Cabot's body was found Dec. 10, 1986, after Roman called
police to the dilapidated Encino home they had shared. She had been
beaten with a barbell.
   Roman initially told officers that he had been beaten
unconscious by a man dressed as a Ninja warrior and awoke to find
his mother dead. But in court he admitted he had fabricated the
story and pleaded innocent by reason of insanity.
   In the second trial, Roman testified his mother's mental state
had badly deteriorated and that she had initiated the violence by
swinging the barbell at him. He said he didn't remember what had
happened next.
   The involuntary manslaughter charge carried a maximum four-year
prison term, but Schempp handed down the three-year prison term,
which she then suspended.
   Roman's defense attorney in the first trial, Chester Smith,
argued part of the insanity defense was based on side effects Roman
suffered from experiments with drugs undertaken to boost his growth.
   Smith, in arguing his client was at risk in jail, said Roman
might be the illegitimate son of King Hussein and could have been a
terrorist target.
   Susan Cabot briefly dated King Hussein in the 1950s.

<TEXT>
   The ex-wife of convicted cocaine
kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas was sentenced Wednesday to four years
in prison for conspiracy to distribute cocaine in the so-called
``Son of Lehder'' case.
   Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York City was one of nine people who
pleaded guilty in September before U.S. District Judge John H.
Moore II. Five were sentenced Wednesday.
   ``I'm truly sorry for whatever involvement I had in the cocaine
business,'' she told the judge. ``My marriage to Carlos Lehder was
not as it may seem. I was trying to be a good wife and it mainly
exposed me to most of what has happened.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller, the lead prosecutor, said
Ms. Nacel, who faced up to 15 years imprisonment, had cooperated
fully. He recommended a prison term of five years or less.
   ``I have no doubt that her original involvement with Carlos
Lehder was due to romance and not other reasons, in fact I think
she still has some love for the man,'' Mueller said.
   The case is called ``Son of Lehder'' because it grew out of a
7{-month trial that resulted in Lehder, 39, receiving a life
sentence with no chance of parole. He is being held in isolation at
the maximum-security prison in Marion, Ill.
   In the agreement, Ms. Nacel pleaded guilty to a charge of
conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. The
government charged that Lehder continued to arrange cocaine
transactions from his cell through his ex-wife while awaiting his
Jacksonville trial in 1987.
   Ms. Nacel married Lehder in 1977 in Toronto. The couple divorced
about three years later in Haiti.
   Co-defendant John Lee Moller, 45, of Jupiter was sentenced to 10
years in prison and fined $50,000 for possession with intent to
distribute at least one kilogram of cocaine and one tax evasion
charge from California.
   Moller, who could have received 20 years, will remain
incarcerated until he receives a prison assignment. He agreed to
forfeit more than $1 million in real estate and money to the
government.
   Richard James Barile, a defendant accused of being instrumental
in distributing large amounts of cocaine for Lehder in California
in the 1970s, was sentenced to 2{ years and fined $20,000 on his
conspiracy plea.
   San Diego attorney and businessman Pat Passenheim, 42, was
sentenced to six months in jail and a $20,000 fine, and urban
planner Stanley E. ``Ned'' Jaros, 44, of Honolulu got a sentence of
two years.
   The five must report Jan. 3 to start serving their sentences,
except for Moller, who is in custody.
   Sixteen others remain fugitives in the case, including the
leaders of Colombia's Medellin cartel, who are listed on a
most-wanted list of drug kingpins sought by the Justice Department.
   They include Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez
Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez.
   Also indicted in the case was fugitive U.S. financier Robert
Vesco, who is living in Cuba, and Everette William Bannister, a
close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.

   A search for eight people missing
aboard a twin-engine commuter plane that disappeared off Block
Island the day before was called off Wednesday night, a Coast Guard
spokesman said.
   ``The results of the search indicated there were probably no
survivors from the crash,'' said Petty Officer David Jersey,
speaking from Coast Guard headquarters in Boston.
   All searchers found was debris and the bodies of two dogs aboard
the aircraft. Jersey said the search was officially suspended at
9:38 p.m. and the eight aircraft and cutters were told to cease
their efforts.
   Jersey said the search would not be resumed Thursday.
   While earlier in the day Coast Guard officials expressed hope of
finding survivors, veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6 feet
and water temperatures of about 45 degrees made survival unlikely.
The Coast Guard said the debris was found mainly in an area where
the water averages 100 feet deep.
   Debris that was plucked from the water or washed ashore included
a shoe, a fire extinguisher, a headset, life jackets, seat cushions
and a box with a New England Airlines label, officials said.
   The two dogs were identified as belonging to passenger Judy
Johnson. Friends said Johnson, a resident of Essex Fells, N.J., ran
a sporting goods store with her husband on the island and had taken
a later flight than her husband after closing the store for the
season.
   Thomas Grady, New England Airlines' attorney, said officials
from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board, would investigate.
   He said the British Norman Islander airplane, built in 1969,
left the Block Island Airport about 6 p.m. Tuesday for the
15-minute flight to Westerly State Airport on the mainland.
   ``It had the most thorough inspection it gets in the preceding
30 days,'' Grady said.
   The pilot made contact with Block Island after takeoff, but was
not heard from again, the airline said.

American letters which have had an extraordinary and permanent
impact on American literature.
   Casey was born in Worcester, Mass., in 1949 and educated at
Harvard College and Law School and the University of Iowa. He is a
professor at the University of Virginia, teaching English
literature and creative writing, and also wrote ``Testimony and
Demeanor'' and ``An American Romance.''
   ``Spartina'' is a study of the ties that bind Dick Pierce _ a
fisherman, father and lover _ to his wife, his mistress, his sons,
his community and his boat.
   ``Thank goodness these five judges were in the mood, because
that's what it is, they were in the mood for my book,'' Casey said
at a news conference after the awards presentation.
   ``It's like a date when you read a book. Some of them go well,
some of them don't go well, so I just lucked out,'' he said.
   ``From Beirut to Jerusalem'' is an account by Friedman, a New
York Times reporter, of the Middle East conflict as seen from the
two eponymous cities.
   Friedman was born in Minneapolis in 1953 and educated at
Brandeis and Oxford universities. Twice winner of the Pulitzer
Prize for his reporting from the Middle East for the Times, he is
now the newspaper's chief diplomatic correspondent.
   ``I discovered I was quite at home in Jerusalem ... I was
definitely more Middle East than Minnesota,'' Friedman said.
   Asked if he'd ever go back to Beirut, he said, ``I certainly
won't be going back until Terry Anderson is freed.'' Anderson, an
Associated Press correspondent, was kidnapped in Beirut in 1985.
   The National Book Awards were established in 1950 to recognize
American literary works of exceptional merit. Previous recipients
include William Faulkner, John Cheever, Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow,
Tom Wolfe and Alice Walker. Last year's winners were Pete Dexter
and Neil Sheehan.
   The finalists and winners for fiction and non-fiction are
selected by independent judging panels. Each winner receives a
$10,000 prize and a commemorative medal.
   A record 325 books, all published between Nov. 1, 1988, and Nov.
1, 1989, were submitted by publishers for consideration by the two
juries.
   The awards were presented at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan.
   The other 1989 finalists for fiction were:
   _ Katherine Dunn, for ``Geek Love,'' in which an albino dwarf
narrates the story of herself and her three genetically altered
siblings, bred by their parents to perform in a freak show;
   _ E.L. Doctorow, for ``Billy Bathgate,'' the story of a
15-year-old boy's apprenticeship to the notorious mobster Dutch
Schultz;
   _ Oscar Hijuelos, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' a
portrait of a pair of brothers from Havana who find a measure of
fame in the nightclubs of New York;
   _ First-time novelist Amy Tan, ``The Joy Luck Club,'' the story
of four Chinese friends in San Francisco who meet weekly to play
mah jong and talk about themselves, their ancestors and their
American-born daughters.
   For non-fiction, the other finalists were Taylor Branch, for
``Parting the Waters,'' the first volume of his history of the
American Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and '60s; McGeorge
Bundy, for ``Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the
First Fifty Years,'' a political history of the nuclear bomb;
William Pfaff, for `Barbarian Sentiments: How the American Century
Ends,'' an analysis of American foreign policy since World War II;

<HEAD>No Beatles Reunion as Long as John Lennon is Dead, George Harrison
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul McCartney's suggestion that the
surviving Beatles reunite isn't for George Harrison, who says he
doesn't believe in yesterday.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, there won't be a Beatles reunion as
long as John Lennon remains dead,'' Harrison said in a terse
statement that seems to put the kibosh on reunion speculation.
   Ringo Starr, the third surviving Beatle, couldn't be reached
through his manager's office.
   During the publicity blitz surrounding the start of his world
tour, McCartney said in an interview this week that he's receptive
to getting together again with Harrison and Starr.
   ``We might get to play together after all this time,'' McCartney
was quoted in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times.
   Harrison said such a gathering would be a hollow exercise
without Lennon, the former member of the ``Fab Four'' who was
assassinated by a deranged publicity seeker.
   ``What good are three Beatles without John?'' Harrison asked The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It's too far in the past.''
   Harrison, 46, said the future is more interesting than the past.
   ``Let sleeping dogs lie,'' said Harrison, who has become
involved in the British film industry and has a comedy movie,
``Nuns on the Run,'' scheduled for U.S. release early next year.
   McCartney said during a news conference Monday that a
documentary film on the Beatles called ``The Long and Winding
Road'' may be on the way.

MTI news agency reported today.
   The terse report said Comaneci, who retired from gymnastics in
1984, applied for political asylum after fleeing across the
Romanian-Hungarian border on Tuesday before dawn.
   The report quoted her as saying she had left behind a ``neatly

   Comaneci was quoted as saying she had been denied permission to
work abroad as a coach or to travel, in spite of numerous offers

   Helmut Kohl dazzled his countrymen
with his vision of a united Germany within a united Europe. But
East Germany's leaders apparently see Kohl's ideas as something of
a Trojan Horse laden with suspicious cargo.
   Kohl on Tuesday outlined a 10-point plan to gradually unite the
two German states, saying he wants reunification but acknowledging
it could take time.
   The chancellor wrapped his ideas into a far-reaching concept of
overcoming the overall divisions of Europe, stepping up disarmament
and forging closer links between the European Economic Community
and Eastern Europe.
   Kohl's proposals are specific in some areas but appear general
enough to save him from criticism at home that he is being too
meddlesome in East German domestic affairs.

   In one case, the department's Office of Inspector General said
Tuesday, a single farm operation collected about $2.8 million in
subsidies, 56 times the $50,000 limit set by law.
   The report did not identify the recipient of the huge payment,
and inspector general officials refused to provide further details.
   However, the report's appendix showed a ``maximum payment

   The cost of new weapons and decreasing defense
budgets are forcing more countries, including some NATO members, to
upgrade their armored vehicles rather than buy new ones, a new
Jane's yearbook said today.
   NATO countries are concentrating their upgrading on improving
fire control systems and providing an enhanced night vision
capability, said the authors of the 1989-1990 edition of ``Jane's
Armored Fighting Vehicle Systems.''
   ``Few countries are at present installing new armament which is
required to penetrate the latest Soviet MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) or
to install more armor to increase their battlefield
survivability,'' wrote Christopher Foss and Tony Cullen in the
authoritative yearbook.
   They said the installation of a larger caliber gun and
additional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles'
suspension and reduce the power-to-weight ratio.

<HEAD>Martin Landau Is Gangster Money Man in `The Neon Empire'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Landau stars as the money man behind
the turbulent development of a small Nevada desert town into a
gambling oasis in the Showtime miniseries ``The Neon Empire.''
   The two-part drama traces efforts by New York gangster Junior
Moloff to turn Las Vegas into a sophisticated mecca for gambling
and prostitution in the 1940s. The first two-hour segment appears
Sunday and the second part on Monday.
   Landau plays New York mobster Max Brower, a character based on
Meyer Lansky, and Ray Sharkey is the volatile Moloff, based on
Bugsy Siegel.
   ``Lansky was a brilliant man who was consulted not only by
gangsters but by businessmen as well,'' said Landau. ``He was able
to see into the future. Lucky Luciano often wouldn't make a move
without consulting Lansky.
   ``Lansky saw it as a business. Drug traffic was something he
wanted no part of. He was also against prostitution. He wanted to
stop at gambling and booze. He was a man who could be trusted if
you played by the rules. He could be very dangerous if you stepped
outside the rules.''
   ``The Neon Empire,'' written by journalist-novelist Pete Hamill,
also stars Gary Busey, Linda Fiorentino, Dylan McDermott, Julie
Carmen, Harry Guardino and Richard Brooks. Larry Peerce directed on
location in Los Angeles and Arizona.
   ``I play Max Brower rabbinically,'' said Landau. ``Like a rabbi,
but a deadly one. He's a man you can talk to, do business with.
Like Lansky, he's the man who ties the Jewish mobs and the Italian
Mafia together.
   ``Bugsy Siegel was a man who was emotionally wild. Lansky had to
keep him under control. Siegel was later killed in Los Angeles.''
   Landau worked on ``The Neon Empire'' in June and July, after
completing work on Woody Allen's ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Next,
he worked in ``By the Dawn's Early Light'' for Home Box Office. He
also stars in ``Max and Helen'' for TNT.
   He's probably best remembered as Rollin Hand, the master of
disguise, in the TV series ``Mission: Impossible.'' His former
wife, Barbara Bain, was Cinnamon Carter. They later starred in the
syndicated series ``Space: 1999.''
   Many people believe that Landau's role as Dr. Judah Rosenthal in
``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' will bring him his second nomination
for an Academy Award. He was nominated as best supporting actor
last year for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dreams.''
   ``My role is the biggest male protagonist Woody's ever written
outside of his own roles,'' he said. ``He usually writes his own
role and a role for a female protagonist. I don't want to say too
much about my role. But what happens after people see it is
fascinating. It resonates for days afterward. I've never been in a
movie that affects people that powerfully.''
   Landau, a native of Brooklyn, studied art at the Pratt Institute
and at the age of 18 became assistant to cartoonist Gus Edson in
drawing ``The Gumps.'' He also illustrated Billy Rose's ``Pitching
Horseshoes'' column.
   ```The Gumps' was the most popular comic strip in the country at
one time,'' Landau said. ``I drew the lettering and the backgrounds
for the daily strip. The Sunday strip had a separate story and I
did the story and all the drawing, from conception to finish. You
could create your own little world in cartooning. I could create
little one-act plays.''
   Nevertheless, Landau quit after winning an audition to the
Actors Studio. The only other actor accepted at that time was Steve
McQueen.
   The role in ``Mission: Impossible'' was created for Landau by
Bruce Geller, a writer who had studied acting in a class taught by
Landau. The character was originally called Martin Land. Landau
thought that was too obvious and Geller changed it to Martin Hand,
the name used in the pilot.
   ``Space: 1999'' came after the ``Star Trek'' series but before
the ``Star Wars'' movies. Landau was one of the astronauts on Moon
Base Alpha who were pushed into outer space when atomic waste
stored on the moon went critical and acted as a propellant. As they
passed through various solar systems the astronauts kept checking
for a liveable planet, and were checked out in turn by curious
otherworldly creatures.
   The show was created for ABC, but instead became a pioneer in
first-run syndication. It inspired Norman Lear to put ``Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman'' into syndication.
   After that, Landau did not have a major film role until
``Tucker.''
   ``I was working but I was doing mindless pictures,'' he said.
``I always believed a good role would come along. It did when
Francis Ford Coppola cast me in `Tucker.'''
   Next, he will produce and play a role in the film adaptation of
Kurt Vonnegut's ``Breakfast of Champions.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Pledge Fight Over Diamond Mining</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>

   Tourists dream of instant wealth at
North America's only diamond-mining park. But companies with the
same hopes for the Crater of Diamonds State Park have
environmentalists worried.
   ``This land belongs to the public and should be preserved, not
used to line somebody's pockets,'' said Jim Stanley, a Little Rock
attorney representing the Sierra Club, part of a coalition of
environmental groups threatening legal action to stop the potential
exhaustion of a unique natural resource.
   Retiree James Archer is a regular among the 700 visitors a day
who sweat and swear on diamond digs for just a $3 admission ticket.
Archer, 64, shovels clumps of dirt into a wire-screened pan then
dunks it vigorously in a large tub of water, allowing heavy
material _ diamonds, he hopes _ to settle. Most of his pans turn up
nothing and others produce diamonds the size of a pinhead. But for
the discoverer even small stones carry the satisfaction of
Tiffany's finest.
   ``I don't care if I find a big diamond,'' Archer said. ``I just
want to keep a-digging.''
   The largest diamond found at the park was a 40-carat, 33-point,
light-pink stone unearthed in 1925 by miners and dubbed ``Uncle
Sam.'' The largest found by a tourist was a 16-carat, 37-point,
white stone dug up in 1975.
   The state has moved cautiously in its authorization of
commercial core drilling on the 35-acre field in southwestern
Arkansas. Gov. Bill Clinton in 1986 appointed a Diamond Mining
Advisory Task Force to study the idea of mining at the park, and
the state Parks and Tourism Commission distributed paperwork to
more than 50 companies or individuals who might be interested.
   ``It has forced us to ask a lot of questions about what we
really want out of the only resource of its kind in the U.S.,''
said Richard Davies, the acting director of the Parks and Tourism
Department.
   ``It also made us realize that we made some strategic mistakes
at the park, because the crater is not very user-friendly.'' A
35-acre plowed field where people can look for diamonds is
inaccessible to the handicapped and doesn't have water fountains,
restrooms or other amenities.
   The commission voted last month to work with four companies who
will share the estimated $350,000 cost of initial studies plus the
cost of any litigation. Test drilling could begin by April if the
process is not delayed by a lawsuit by the Sierra Club and the
Friends of the Crater of Diamonds.
   ``This is something completely new in mineral exploration,''
said John Morgan, a consulting engineer who served as a state
adviser. ``You have four companies cooperating with the state to
conduct tests in the most effective manner. Normally, they would be
slitting each other's throats.''
   Should the state decide to allow mining, only the companies
paying for the initial studies will be allowed to seek digging
rights, Davies said. ``I think a lot of these companies are used to
spending money on a gamble.''
   Environmentalists who attended an earlier commission meeting at
which preliminary core drilling was approved say even those tests
could mean diamonds aren't forever at the park. ``We see this as a
foot-in-the-door type thing. If they get the test drilling in
there, it defeats the principle of inviolacy of park lands,'' said
Stanley, the Sierra Club attorney.
   ``It's a lose-lose situation. If the results come back and they
say there are lots of diamonds there may be incredible pressure to
open it to commercial mining. If they come back and say it's a dry
hole, then much of the mystique of the park may disappear.
   ``We prefer to leave a little bit of the aura of mystery out
there.''
   To allow tests, the Interior Department had to grant a
``temporary non-recreational use'' of the diamond field. ``This is
a political decision,'' said Dean Banks, coordinator of Friends of
Crater of Diamonds State Park.
   Past drilling has shown that the diamond-bearing ore goes down
at least 205 feet. Six to 10 feet of earth have been scraped away
in 50 years, so the park could last centuries, said Superintendent
Jim Cannon. No projections have a commercial site in production
past about 50 years, he said.
   Cannon, 39, doesn't like to talk politics, but he does like to
brag about the crater, where he has been in charge since 1973.
``Personally, I'm cautious about any major changes in the park that
would have a major impact, and this certainly would have a major
impact,'' he said of testing.
   Attempts for more than a century to commercially mine diamonds
at the site have flopped, he said, because of a lack of experience
or capital. The mine was idle when the state acquired it for
$750,000 in 1972.
   Bad luck and bad feelings also figured in past failures, Cannon
said. One father-son team found itself facing 36 lawsuits after a
year in operation and their mining plant was gone after three
mysterious fires in one night.
   The four companies that will take part in the studies are
Continental Diamonds, 51 percent owned by Galactic Resources Ltd.,
of Vancouver, Canada; Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Sunshine Mining Co. and Exdiam Inc., both of Dallas, and Rhombus
Inc. of Little Rock; Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia;
and Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City.
   Such companies may offer improved technology and big backing,
according to Cannon. Even so, they're gambling _ just like the
hopeful tourists who slog through the often muddy field bearing
shovels and pans.
   ``It's a combination of curiosity and quick riches. Gambling _
an idea of buying a $3 ticket and perhaps finding something of
untold worth.''

   After more than 20 years of pressure and persuasion, and some
recent improvement in the trade balance, Washington is zeroing in
on what many experts say has been the issue all along: Real
progress depends on changing the way the Japanese do business.
   ``Japan's systems for buying and distributing goods are the
biggest obstacle facing U.S. manufacturers who export or do
business in Japan,'' R.K. Morris, director of international trade
policy for the National Association of Manufacturers, recently told
a U.S. Senate committee in Washington.
   With Japan accounting for 40 percent of the U.S. trade deficit
last year, the imbalance hasn't fallen as far as it should have
given the weakening of the dollar against the yen, U.S. officials
say.
   Behind the arcane trade rules once used to keep imports out lies
an even more formidable challenge _ ``keiretsu,'' or networks of
financial and personal ties that bind Japanese subcontractor to
manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, in almost impenetrable
alliances.
   U.S. officials expressed disappointment after talks in
Washington in November at which Japanese officials said they would
``advise'' firms to end practices keeping foreign companies out of
their market, but warned that quick change was unlikely.
   ``There was very little flexibility in the Japanese government
position ... in reaching common ground on the nature of the
problems, even problems which appear to be widely recognized in
Japan,'' U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara said
after the talks.
   Japan's insular, exclusive business culture and the lifestyle
and tastes of its discriminating consumers lie outside government
jurisdiction.
   In most cases, but certainly not all, a foreigner hoping to sell
to Japan no longer faces obvious legal barriers, U.S. officials
say. Quotas and excessive duties on alcohol, beef, citrus and many
other products have been negotiated out of existence.
   Vociferous complaints and lengthy trade talks also have helped
to end the strange restrictions like those that once judged
foreign-made skis ``unsuitable'' for Japanese snow.
   Instead, foreign and Japanese businessmen trying to sell new
products here face alliances of Japan's most powerful firms _ led
by Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo (Fuji), Sanwa and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo _ each with its own banks, retailers and real estate,
insurance and manufacturing companies.
   These are the ``keiretsu,'' and there are some 30 smaller ones
as well. Through interlocking holdings, they own more than 70
percent of shares on Japan's stock markets.
   Cartels by any other name, the keiretsu enable competing
manufacturers to fix prices and divide markets among themselves _
activities that would be illegal under antitrust laws in the United
States or Europe but provoke only mild government warnings here.
   According to a study by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Japan, almost 48 percent of home electronics in Japan are sold
through exclusively affiliated stores and 99 percent of cars are
distributed through exclusive dealerships.
   The keiretsu are looser versions of the industrial combines, or
``zaibatsu,'' of wartime Japan.
   Japan's commercial armies are the nation's economic defense.
Only Japanese products carry the guarantee of being returned to the
wholesaler if they don't sell. Imports don't. Through such
arrangements, Japanese manufacturers keep 1.6 million retailers in
business. The United States, with 25 times the area and twice the
population, has only 1.4 million.
   The Japanese retailer survives this inefficiency by charging the
world's highest prices.
   A recent survey by the Japanese and U.S. governments found 84 of
122 items priced in both countries were excessively expensive in
Japan, including food, wine, cosmetics, bed linens, golf clubs and
spark plugs.
   Americans, in contrast, paid more for ketchup, perfume, table
china, household batteries and Japanese-made electronics goods.
Some people think Sonys and Panasonics are cheaper in the United
States, but the surveyors did find bargains at discount stores in
Japan.
   Surprisingly, pressure for change has come not from Japan's
long-suffering consumers but from foreigners and other
``outsiders'' _ new Japanese entrants into established markets.
   Large-scale retailers are fighting the regulations that limit
their expansion to protect small stores. Industrialists are calling
for opening Japan's farm markets. Even some rice farmers in Japan's
most productive areas, confident of their ability to compete, have
begun to rail against government restrictions.
   Supporters of change have found a willing but quiet ally in
Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission, which
has long done little but issue warnings to violators of antitrust
laws.
   In recent months, the Fair Trade Commission has fined
contractors involved in a price cartel, investigated price gaps
between Japan and other countries, and issued warnings to computer
manufacturers that bid one yen _ less than a penny _ to win
contracts from local governments.
   The commission last year recommended steps to encourage more
supermarkets and department stores, which tend to import more than
mom and pop shops. It said they should be allowed to have more
floor space and stay open past 7 p.m., the normal closing time.
   The panel recommended deregulating sales of alcohol and lifting
other government controls that limit competition and drive up
prices in the airline, banking, insurance and transport industries.
   U.S. officials say a myriad of restrictions, most not apparent
until they are violated by foreign exporters, exist at all levels
of the Japanese economy.
   Japan faces possible retaliation under the U.S. Super 301 trade
bill for tariffs and housing standards that limit imports of wood
products and for government procurement policies that limit
purchases of U.S.-made supercomputers and satellites.
   Recent trade figures indicate foreign firms are making inroads
here, despite the odds. Japan's prices mean high profits for those
importers who manage to crack the barriers, and more are acquiring
the expertise to do so.
   The U.S. deficit with Japan remains high: it is expected to be
about $50 billion this year, compared to $55 billion in 1988 and
almost $60 billion in the peak year of 1987, according to U.S.
Commerce Department figures.
   But U.S. exporters are trying harder. American exports to Japan
so far this year are up almost 19 percent.
   Japan is importing more finished, higher-value products that can
make a bigger dent in the surplus than cheap raw materials. In
1980, only 22 percent of Japan's imports were finished products. In
1988, almost half were, according to Finance Ministry figures.
   Despite high costs, language and cultural barriers and
difficulties in recruiting top employees, many foreign companies
have done very well in the Japanese market.
   Schick razors, Nestle instant coffee, Kellogg's corn flakes, Lux
soap, Contac cold medicine, Pampers disposable diapers, Snickers
candy, Kleenex and other foreign brands, through trial and error,
have won hard-earned places on Japanese store shelves.

   Breaking into the lucrative Japanese market isn't
impossible, but it isn't easy, either. Consider Snickers.
   For Mars Co., putting Snickers, Mars bars and M&amp;M's within reach
of Japanese consumers required ``a mind-boggling expenditure of
time and money,'' said Kiyoshi Ide, senior managing director of
Mars' Japanese subsidiary, Master Foods KK.
   The breakthrough also required an alliance with one of Japan's
giant trading companies. Mars leaped over Japan's formidable
barriers by using Mitsubishi Corp.'s extensive contacts to place
its candy bars at subway kiosks and in grocery stores.
   Mars began selling candy in Japan in 1987. While the company
won't divulge sales figures, it said surveys show Snickers' share
of the chocolate bar market is growing, from its small base, faster
than that of any other brand.
   Foreign companies attempting to sell in Japan have to hurdle
government barriers _ including murky rules and regulations, import
duties, fair trade price laws that limit sales promotion
activities, and complex import procedures.
   But the maze-like distribution system _ rigidly controlled by
wholesalers _ is a particular hindrance to importers because it
typically increases prices up to four times after Japanese
distributors add on their markups.
   For ``status'' products, the climb is even steeper. The
wholesale price of a bottle of Hennessy's VSOP cognac is $7, but by
the time it hits store shelves it is $77.50.
   Consider the imported necktie: $28 to the import agent, who
sells it to a wholesaler for $56, who sells it to a department
store for $70, which displays it beautifully and gets $112 from the
customer.
   The distribution system is under scrutiny by Japanese and U.S.
trade negotiators in talks on the two nations' structural barriers
to trade.
   Simply finding someone to distribute new products in Japan often
is impossible because of exclusive, longstanding relationships
between wholesalers and retailers. Sole import agents, although
easier to find, limit a product's sales.
   Amway Corp., the American direct-sales company, is doing a
booming business here. Its secret? It imported its own distribution
system.
   The company offers household items, toiletries and cookware
through its network of 500,000 Japanese distributors who sell
through personal contacts from their homes. A phone call to one of
Amway's three modern distribution centers will produce an item
within 72 hours, says Peter Scacco of Amway.
   Amway is the fastest-growing foreign company in Japan, according
to a study by the Nomura Research Institute, with sales of more
than half a billion dollars last year.
   Tiffany and Co. boosted its Japanese sales 38 percent last year,
working through the equally upscale Mitsukoshi Ltd. as its sole
distributor.
   Blue Diamond Growers, sellers of California almonds, broke into
the market after 15 years by piggybacking onto Coca-Cola Japan's
independent distributors, which deal with 1.2 million outlets.
   BMW got around the astronomical price of land for car lots by
seeking out people who owned land where dealerships could be set
up, then training the landowners to be dealers. Riding a
consumption binge, the West German automaker is approaching its
target of 1 percent of the car market.
   U.S. executives in Japan concluded in a recent study that new
companies, whether foreign or domestic, are the targets of a kind
of in-bred discrimination.
   ``Even a Japanese company with a new product has trouble
penetrating the Japanese distribution system,'' said William Best
of the management consulting firm A.T. Kearney International, who
headed the study by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.
   Because the Japanese put so much stock in powerful companies
with famous names, wholesalers and retailers are uncomfortable with
fledgling enterprises.
   ``Without name recognition, it is very difficult to get
wholesalers to accept your products into the distribution system
and to get retailers to put them on the shelves,'' Best said.
``Just because you're unknown, you won't get the kind of
opportunity you would get in the United States market.''
   Best said the U.S. government and Japanese leaders face an
uphill battle in trying to change the way people think about
business relationships.
   ``These attitudes can't be legislated away,'' Best says.
   But some changes loom. Recent trends include retailers importing
directly from U.S. suppliers, and ``development imports.''
   Development imports _ custom products for which materials,
quality levels, design and processing methods are specified by
Japanese companies that then import the finished products into
Japan _ are among supermarket chain Jusco Co. Ltd.'s most common
type of import, says Chikashi Honma, general manager of the
international merchandising division at Jusco.
   Issetan, an elegant department store, is also creating
private-label products this way. Analysts say this trend will
continue because the goods can be sold cheaper than domestic
products.
   ``There are a number of new channels and smart U.S. businessmen
will do the market research to find the right distribution
network,'' says one analyst.

   The U.S. trade deficit, after improving for
six months, deteriorated slightly to $27.75 billion in the third
quarter, fed by the nation's appetite for imported goods and by
flat exports, the government said.
   Analysts do not see much improvement in the near future. Imports
may drop somewhat because of a slowing U.S. economy, they said
Tuesday, but exports also are likely to fall because of a strong
dollar and moderating economies overseas.
   The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and exports
edged up 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter from the second
quarter's $27.55 billion.

56 times the $50,000 limit set by law.

   Analysts said Tuesday that the pact, reached on the fourth day

   It also should help trim production from the present nearly 23.5

   A shrinking labor pool will be the biggest
problem confronting U.S. businesses in the coming year, according
to a report by the Conference Board.
   The business-research group said Tuesday its Human Resources
Outlook Panel, comprising 10 corporate executives and labor
analysts, predicted that many companies, faced with a continuing
labor shortage, will be forced to hire workers they would not have
hired in the past, such as unskilled workers.
   ``The old days of creaming the country's labor pool for the very
best candidates are over,'' said Audrey Freedman, management
counsellor at the Conference Board. ``Companies will be
increasingly seeking ways to bring people in rather than screening
them out of jobs in the coming decade.''
   The job pool has become smaller as more people are employed and
fewer are looking for work. Women and immigrants are expected to be
the largest group of new job candidates in the 1990s, the
Conference Board said.
   Many large firms have begun seeking employees from foreign
countries and are devoting more time and money toward recruiting,
training and retraining workers, the business-supported research
organization said.
   The Conference Board panel, which meets annual to issue its
labor and economic forecast, said the economy would again escape a
recession in 1990. It projected that the unemployment rate would
average 5.3 percent next year, little changed from its recent
levels.
   Wages would rise an average 5 percent in 1990 and that inflation
will average 4.5 percent, also near its current levels, the panel
said.

<HEAD>Ceiling on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Home Loans Declines Slightly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ceiling on the size of single-family home
loans purchased by the nation's secondary mortgage-market agencies
is declining by $150 to $187,450 next year, the first drop in at
least a decade, the government said.
   Lenders usually charge interest rates a quarter- to a
half-percentage point lower on mortgages they sell on the secondary
market, compared with loans that exceed the limit.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) announced
the drop Tuesday in its limit based on October data collected by
the Federal Housing Finance Board, which said the average home
purchase price was $136,800 in the month, down from $136,900 a year
earlier.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) followed with
a later announcement saying it too was dropping its ceiling for
single-family homes to $187,450, effective with mortgage contracts
signed after Jan. 1.
   Together, the two congressionally chartered but publicly owned
agencies help finance nearly one in four of the nation's
residential mortgages. They purchase mortgages from lenders and
repackage them into bond-like securities for investors.
   Robert M. O'Toole, senior vice president at the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, a trade group, said the agencies should
have used their discretion and left the ceiling unchanged. The
slight drop will affect few homebuyers but he complained it sets a
bad precedent and will prove somewhat disruptive for lenders.
   According to Fannie Mae, mortgages purchased in the first nine
months of this year averaged $83,000. Only 5 percent exceeded
$168,700, the previous year's limit.
   In the past few years, rapid increases in the ceiling have
helped buyers in high-priced markets obtain a lower interest rate.
This year, home prices have cooled in expensive New York and New
England markets, but they continue to climb at double-digit rates
in California.
   The ceiling was $115,000 in 1985, $133,250 in 1986, $153,100 in
1987, $168,700 in 1988 and $187,600 in 1989.
   The 1990 decline in the index ``certainly indicates that home
prices have flattened out a little bit. It probably is a reasonably
accurate reflection of what's happened in the real estate market,''
O'Toole said.
   It is the first decline since the index was established in 1980.

<HEAD>Group Recommends Replacing Stock Certificates With Electronic Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock certificates should be replaced by
electronic records of stock ownership to speed up the process of
trading securities, according to experts on financial markets.
   Greater use of computerized record keeping for securities
transactions is part of a plan to shorten the period for settling
U.S. corporate securities trades to three business days from the
current five.
   The plan stems from recommendations to reduce settlement periods
worldwide made earlier this year by the Group of Thirty, a private
international research organization.
   The London-based group's recommendations were ``aimed at
improving and harmonizing clearance and settlement systems in the
world's securities markets to reduce risks and transaction costs as
well as increase liquidity and efficiency.''
   The Group of Thirty's recommendations were evaluated by a U.S.
study committee, which prepared a report. A summary of the report
was released Tuesday. Copies are being distributed to executives at
U.S. investment firms and banks.
   The U.S. study committee urged an ``extensive educational
effort'' by industry trade groups and securities firms to accustom
investors to do without certificates and accept an electronic book
entry system. The committee expects the conversion could be
accomplished by 1992.
   Under the plan, once the new system is in place existing
certificates would be withdrawn from circulation when stocks are
sold and reissued as book entries.
   U.S. Treasury securities and mutual funds already are sold to
retail investors in book-entry form. About a third of all newly
issued municipal bonds are sold as book entries and some corporate
bonds are also.
   The study committee said the switch to a book-entry system could
entail sweeping changes in securities firms' back-office operations
and might require legislation to be put into effect.
   But the committee concluded that ``the cost savings would far
outweigh the expense of implementation.''
   Cost cuts would be welcome during the current slump in
securities trading activity and industry profitability, the
committee said in its report.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Down 6 Percent in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction fell 6 percent
in October as contracts for highway and bridge building declined
sharply, according to a survey.
   New contracts fell 6 percent in October to an annual rate of
$262.6 billion, said the survey released Tuesday by the F.W. Dodge
Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co. Its seasonally
adjusted Dodge Index dipped to 167 in October from 178 in September.
   The October decline set back construction contracting to the
level that has prevailed for most of the past two years, the Dodge
Group said.
   ``October's return to the 1988-89 `plateau' of contracting shows
that the basics haven't changed much,'' said George A. Christie,
vice president and chief economist for the consulting group.
   ``Commercial overbuilding and public austerity are conditions
that the construction industry must endure while waiting for lower
interest rates to revive the housing market,'' he said.
   While contracting for highway and bridge construction fell
sharply in October and nonresidential building also declined,
homebuilding activity was stable, the report said.
   Residential building held steady at $121.5 billion as hotel and
motel contracting gained, multi-family projects declined and
single-family homebuilding was steady.

   Thrift regulator M. Danny Wall does not plan
to heed the latest call for his resignation, his spokesman said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called for
Wall's departure Monday but said he might not be to blame for the
problems of the savings and loan industry.
   Wall declined to respond to Mitchell's statement but his
spokesman, William Fulwider, said Tuesday the senator's complaint
``is hardly grounds for asking for his resignation.''
   ``He has no plans to resign,'' Fulwider said.
   Meanwhile, the leaders of three advocacy groups said they will
demand today that Wall quit. They are Jim Davidson, chairman of the
National Taxpayers Union; Joan B. Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a group founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader, and Alan
L. Keyes, president of Citizens Against Government Waste.
   They will be joined by Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., analyst
frequently at odds with Wall over estimates of the S&amp;L industry's
losses.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, has written to President Bush suggesting that Wall step
aside. The president's response has been less than warm support.
   ``If part of the savings and loan problem proves to be
management or regulation people that aren't aggressive enough, the
answer will be yes,'' Bush said when asked about Gonzalez' letter.
   Gonzalez' committee has been investigating the collapse of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., expected to
become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a cost to taxpayers of
$2 billion.
   The panel charges that Wall ignored a recommendation to seize
Lincoln and stem its losses two years before the thrift was taken
over.
   Wall maintains that there was insufficient evidence to legally
take that action. Nevertheless, pressure has been building for him
to quit.
   The Wall Street Journal called for his resignation in an
editorial this week. And, according to industry sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity, White House advisers led by counsel C.
Boyden Gray are pushing for Wall's ouster.
   However, an administration source, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Wall enjoys some support within the Treasury
Department, which counts on his vote on the five-member board
governing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent
agency which insures bank and S&amp;L deposits.
   Under S&amp;L legislation passed in August, Wall's term extends
until July 1, 1991. He previously served as chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, but under the new law's regulatory
reorganization, he now serves as director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, an arm of the Treasury Department.

<HEAD>British Airways Chairman Calls For Open Skies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of British Airways says he has no
plans for further attempts to buy an interest in United Airlines
but said his company still wants to become the first ``truly global
airline.''
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said Tuesday the United
States and the European Community should merge into one trading
bloc, beginning with open skies for airlines on both sides of the
Atlantic.
   King criticized two bills in Congress that would give
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner increased power to stop
foreign control of U.S. carriers. Skinner also opposes the
legislation, saying he already has enough power to limit foreign
involvement in U.S. aviation.
   King, speaking on the eve of British-U.S. talks over the
possible revision of bilateral air service agreements, said that
despite his call for open skies, he won't advocate any further
opening of routes or investments to U.S. carriers in Europe without
reciprocal benefits.
   ``I am not advocating and will not practice unilateral
commercial disarmament,'' King told a group of U.S. and British
business executives.
   Asked after the speech if he still had an interest in buying
into UAL Corp., parent company of United Airlines, after a deal for
an employee-management buyout of the airline fell through, King
said: ``Not in the foreseeable future.''
   British Airways would have gained a 15 percent interest in the
new UAL.
   King said, however, that British Airways would continue to
``widen and deepen'' its marketing agreements with United and
possibly make similar agreements with other U.S. carriers.
   ``We shall continue to pursue our ambition to be the first
truely global airline,'' he said.
   King said the United deal, which failed to get the needed
financing, was skewed ``by the need to restrict the level of
(foreign) participation to what would be acceptable to the U.S.
government.''
   U.S. law allows no more than 25 percent foreign interest in the
voting stock of an American carrier.
   King said that even though 27 percent of British Airways is
owned by Americans, it likely would not have been allowed to
acquire more than 15 percent of a U.S. airline.
   He noted that Skinner forced a reduction of KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines interest in the takeover of Northwest Airlines' parent
company, NWA Inc.
   King said he would continue to encourage his government to
resist U.S. carriers' efforts to gain additional services to
Manchester and other British cities unless British Airways is
allowed to serve more U.S. cities.
   ``Disparity in market strength has enabled the U.S. to trade
limited access to the American market for larger access to the
European,'' he said.
   But after 1992, when 12 European markets unite, conditions will
change, he said.
   ``Do not expect the nations of Europe to continue to accept such
an unequal state of affairs,'' King said.
   He said European states are expected to open all of their routes
to all airlines within the European community, and the United
States could be part of the community.
   But he added, ``If Europe is to be open to U.S. airlines, the
United States must be opened to European airlines.''

   The value of U.S. agricultural exports is
expected to decline in 1990 after reaching an eight-year peak in
1989, the Agriculture Department said.
   Shipment value rose to $39.7 billion in the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30, the most since the record of $43.8 billion in 1981.
For 1990, the department said Tuesday, exports may drop to $38
billion.
   The actual quantity of shipments also is down, totaling 147.8
million metric tons (162.9 million short tons) in the last fiscal
year. In 1990, those may drop to 145.5 million metric tons (160.4
million short tons).
   ``Lower prices for most grains and oilseeds largely account for
what is expected to be the first decrease in export value since
fiscal 1986,'' the report said.
   Export volume will be down mostly because of a substantial
decline in wheat exports, which will be partly offset by larger
shipments of corn, soybeans, cotton and high-value products.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new magazine on science and health topics
geared toward people over age 50 is planned for next spring from
Family Media Inc., the publisher of such magazines as Discover and
Health.
   Family Media says the digest-sized magazine will be called
Breakthroughs in Health and Science. It plans to publish the
magazine every other month with a circulation projected at 400,000.
   Meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Health, Dianne Partie Lange,
said Tuesday she has resigned as a result of a series of recent
changes affecting her magazine.
   Among the changes are a planned 27 percent reduction in Health's
circulation rate base, cutting the frequency of publication to 10
times a year from 12 and the appointment of two editorial directors
to oversee Family Media's 11 magazines.
   Ms. Lange said she had not been consulted in advance about the
moves.
   ``The magazine I was recruited to produce is not the magazine
the company wants to continue with,'' Ms. Lange said. She had been
editor since April 1988.
   Breakthroughs is being designed to appeal to older consumers
interested in ``noteworthy advances in health, medicine, psychology
and other sciences,'' the company said.
   Gregory Dunn, group president of Family Media Publications, said
Tuesday that advertisers are starting to realize the potential of
the growing group of older consumers although few have begun
spending much to reach them.
   He said the launch of Breakthroughs should put Family Media in a
position to benefit over the next few years as appreciation for the
market builds.
   A number of publishers have shown an interest in developing
magazines for older readers or giving advertisers a chance to buy
space only in issues of their magazines that go to older
subscribers.
   Dunn said Science Digest, with a circulation of 250,000, would
be folded into Breakthroughs. Older subscribers to Health would be
encouraged to switch to Breakthroughs as well.
   The last issue of Science Digest probably will be published in
March with Breakthroughs starting in May, Dunn said.
   Health will continue to feature stories on food, nutrition,
fitness, medicine, fashion and beauty, targeting younger women, he
said.
   But Family Media said that because Health will be aimed at a
younger readership, its rate base will be cut to 800,000 in
February 1990 from 1.1 million.
   The decision to publish Health and another monthly, Savvy Woman,
only 10 times a year brings them in line with five other Family
Media magazines _ Golf Illustrated, Homeowner, Model, Taxi and Your
Family, which Family Media previously disclosed would be launched
in January in doctor's waiting rooms.
   Family Media also named two editorial directors for its
magazines.
   Paul Hoffman, 33, editor of Discover, will serve as editorial
director of of 1001 Home Ideas, Health, Homeowner and Breakthroughs.
   Neil Amdur, 49, editor of World Tennis, will be editorial
director for Golf Illustrated, Savvy Woman, Taxi, Model and Your
Family.
   Ms. Lange said her decision to resign was ``the culmination'' of
those and other recent decisions by Family Media management.
   ``When I was recruited, I was told this was to be serious
contender in health marketplace,'' Ms. Lange said.
   She said her editorial staff produced such a magazine, but that
Family Media appeared unwilling to spend enough on promotion and
distribution.
   Ms. Lange, 44, said she is ``exploring possibilities'' in the
wake of Monday's abrupt resignation. She was an editorial executive
at Self magazine for nine years before taking the top editorial
post at Health.

<HEAD>Unable To Buy Record Label, Disney To Launch Its Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unable to buy a record company at a price
it considers reasonable, Walt Disney Co. says it will launch its
own label, tentatively titled Hollywood Records, that will include
rock 'n' roll, movie soundtracks and other pop formats.
   The Disney label will start up early next year, Disney said
Tuesday. The company will be headed by music attorney Peter
Paterno, who will be joined in running the enterprise by Mike Bone,
the president of Chrysalis Records.
   ``We are not joining the shark frenzy of media acquisitions,''
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a telephone interview. ``We are going to try to create from the
ground up our own properties.
   ``The investment is not big enough that it puts the pressure on
us to have the biggest and the best right away,'' Eisner said.
``We're going to go slow.''
   He said the move was prompted in part by the booming
international demand for recorded music.
   ``The recorded music business is a bigger business than the
movie business, or the theme-park business or the television
business,'' Eisner said, referring to the other areas in which
Disney operates.
   While declining to reveal Disney's initial investment in the
record arm, Eisner said the costs were ``infinitesimal,'' less than
the average $17 million cost of a motion picture.
   Disney already has a children's record label, Walt Disney
Records, that it calls the largest children's music company in the
world. The label will operate independently of the new record
division, Disney said.
   Disney shares closed at $130 Tuesday in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading, down 87{ cents.
   Eisner said he was not concerned that the
sometimes-controversial nature of rock 'n' roll music could tarnish
Disney's well-honed family image.
   ``This is no more a Disney label than (Disney subsidiary)
Touchstone Pictures is a Disney picture,'' Eisner said. ``This is
owned by our same shareholders ... (but) this record division is
separate and completely separated from Disney, and would therefore
have no effect on anything at Disney.''
   As an attorney, Paterno has represented such heavy-metal artists
as Guns 'N Roses and Metallica.
   ``If you're going to be in the record business, you've got to
have some controversy,'' Paterno said earlier this month, when
rumors of Hollywood Records' launch circulated. ``Even the `clean'
artists like Madonna and George Michael are very controversial.''
   Eisner said the Disney label would not follow the pattern of
some recently launched record labels of signing top-dollar acts to
establish a presence and prove to the industry that the label means
business.
   ``It's going to be the opposite of that,'' Eisner said. ``Our
concept is _ as our concept has been in the movie business and the
television business _ to find new, exciting talent that becomes
your own.''
   Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst with Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. in New York, said the label could become a significant
revenue center for Disney over time.
   ``They long wanted a music division, and they've looked at many
different possibilities from the standpoint of acquisition _ just
about everybody who was up for sale in the last five years,'' Vogel
said.
   ``But they've apparently decided that it was too expensive to
buy, so they've decided to build,'' he said. ``Over the long term,
(profits) could be significant. But clearly in the next year or two
it won't amount to much.''

<HEAD>Cambridge Company to Build Fastest Computer for Pentagon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Cambridge, Mass., company will get $12
million from the Pentagon to help it build a computer that would be
1,000 times faster than today's most advanced computers.
   Thinking Machines Corp. said the new computer would be capable
of conducting 1 trillion mathematical operations per second, the
company said in a statement released in Washington on Tuesday.
   The grant will come from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, which has been awarding grants aimed at
keeping the United States the world leader in high-speed computing.
   Danny Hills, co-founder and chief scientist of Thinking
Machines, told The Washington Post in today's editions that the
company hopes to have a model with one-tenth the capacity of the
final model ready in 1992. He declined to predict when the final
product would be available commercially.
   High speed computers simulate events in the physical world
numerically. They are widely used by the government in such fields
as nuclear weapons design and weather forecasting and are used by
private companies for such things as semiconductor circuit design
and superconductivity research.
   Thinking Machines has installed supercomputers at many sites
including the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Dow Jones
Information Services.

<HEAD>Ford's Jaguar Acquisition Won't Be Opposed by FTC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s acquisition of the British
luxury car maker Jaguar PLC won't be opposed by the Federal Trade
Commission.
   The FTC and the Justice Department agreed on Nov. 21 to waive
the remainder of a 30-day waiting period begun after Ford and
Jaguar announced the acquisition plan Nov. 2, said John Sipple,
chief of the FTC's premerger notification office.
   ``We still have the option to take action, but it is rare,''
Sipple said in a telephone interview from his office in Washington.
   He said he was unaware of any other government agency dealing
with Ford's move.
   On Nov. 2, Ford and Jaguar announced an agreement that the No. 2
U.S. automaker would buy the British company for about $2.5
billion. But before any such purchase, Jaguar shareholders must
rescind a bylaw that limits any individual or company from owning
more than 15 percent of the shares.
   Michael Cook, a spokesman for Jaguar's U.S. importing and
marketing company, said Tuesday that vote is set for Friday in
London. The Jaguar board has endorsed waiving its ``golden share''
rule and is supporting the Ford acquisition.
   The Jaguar acquisition raised some eyebrows on Wall Street.
   Immediately after it was announced, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put
some of Ford's securities on its CreditWatch list for a possible
downgrade in credit rating. On Tuesday, S&amp;P removed the securities
from that list and affirmed their ratings as being in categories
that are among the highest used by the firm.
   Moody's Investor Service Inc., the other major securities-rating
firm in New York, took no immediate action after the announcement.

<TEXT>
   Southwest Bank, which made headlines by
trimming its prime lending rate three weeks ago, has quietly raised
the rate back to 10.5 percent from 10 percent.
   Southwest had stood alone in lowering the key interest rate,
which reflects a bank's cost of borrowing money and is used in
calculating business and consumer loans.
   The bank, which raised its prime on Tuesday, said it reversed
its earlier decision due to recent moves by the the Federal Reserve
to keep interest rates firm.
   The Fed, performing a quick about-face, had drained money from
the nation's banking system on Monday, driving the so-called
federal funds rate upward. The fed funds rate is the interest on
overnight loans between banks and is closely watched as an
indicator of the central bank's policy on interest rates.
   ``It looks like the Fed doesn't intend to move the rate lower,''
said I.A. Long, Southwest's chairman-emeritus, who has made his
reputation by repeatedly being the first banker in the country to
cut the prime.

   OPEC's latest production deal should help
slow a decline in oil prices in the first half of 1990 by partially
succeeding in reducing cheating on quotas by the cartel's 13
members, analysts say.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil ministers
on Tuesday signed a pact under which their daily production ceiling
will rise to 22 million barrels from 20.5 million barrels in the
current quarter.
   The group's $18-a-barrel target price becomes a ``minimum
reference price.''
   The producers' output is actually up to 23.5 million barrels a
day, and the new accord should bring it down to some 22.8 million
barrels a day, analysts say.
   That means prices for North Sea Brent Blend, for example, likely
will drop to $17 a barrel instead of to $16 a barrel, in the
spring, when demand for oil usually slackens, analysts say.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was $18.15 a barrel Wednesday morning,
down from $18.30 a barrel late Tuesday.
   OPEC's price of crude oil stood at $17.74 a barrel, said the
cartel's secretary-general, Subroto.
   ``We feel that if it deviates too much from the minimum
reference price, then we will meet,'' Subroto told a news
conference.
   In the meantime, OPEC's eight-member monitoring committee plans
to meet in March ``in order to assess the market,'' the ministers
said in a communique.
   Leading oil ministers were upeat about the pact.
   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, told
reporters that prices ``will steadily go up after the market
ascertains the durability of the agreement. There is more
discipline now, there is more commitment to the quota and the
production ceiling.''
   The deal should cut production by up to 1.3 million barrels a
day, he said.
   Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with the London investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., agreed: ``It looks better than most
people thought was possible.''
   The ministers came up with a partial solution to demands from
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for bigger portions of the
production. The two have been producing about double their current
quotas.
   Kuwait agreed Tuesday to a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day,
up from its previous quota of 1.15 million barrels a day, but below
its current output of 2 million barrels a day.
   The United Arab Emirates officially agreed to a steady daily
quota of 1.095 million barrels.
   But United Arab Emirates oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba said his
country got behind-the-scenes clearance from OPEC to produce 2
million barrels a day. That would be less than the country's
current output, which Otaiba pegged at 2.6 million barrels a day.
   Otaiba also warned that the U.A.E.'s output would surpass 2
million barrels a day if there were excesses by other OPEC members.
   ``Agreement and understanding was reached with the oil ministers
to allow the United Arab Emirates to produce 2 million barrels
daily,'' Otaiba was quoted as saying by Abu Dhabi's official news
agency WAM.
   But OPEC's overall producion still will be well above the
expected demand of 21.5 million barrels.

   A federal investigation into illegal commodity
trading has been broadened to include a fifth trading pit, Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a report published
today said.
   The Chicago Sun-Times, citing unidentified sources close to the
invetigation, said that at least seven brokers in the trading pit
have been subpoenaed as part of the probe that has resulted in the
indictments of 47 traders and one clerk.
   At least two others were expected to receive subpoenas to appear
before a federal grand jury this week, the sources said.
   Until this week the investigation had been confined to traders
in the Merc's Japanese yen and Swiss Franc pits and the Chicago
Board of Trade's soybean and U.S. Treasury Bond pits.
   Investigators either at the Merc or the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission first raised questions about trading in the
Standard &amp; Poor's pit and alerted the U.S. Attorney's office, which
took over the case, the newspaper said.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas declined comment Tuesday, as did
authorities of the Merc and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.

   The European Community Commission said
Wednesday that it was investigating alleged dumping by China of
silk used to make typewriter ribbon.
   The European Community's only producer of the silk, Spinnhuette
GmbH of West Germany, claimed the China National Silk Import and
Export Corp. sold the silk at artificially low prices.
   The complaint says Chinese silk imports rose to 250,000 square
meters the first nine months of 1989 from 150,000 square meters in
1986, giving that country a nearly 25 percent share of the EC's
market.
   Spinnhuette GmbH, the only company in an industrialized country
to manufacture the typewriter ribbon silk, claimed its share of the
market has dropped to 75 percent from 87 percent in 1986.

   State regulators have declared Pacific
Standard Life Insurance Co. insolvent by $54 million and have
ordered the company to stop conducting business.
   The California Department of Insurance said Tuesday that the
company was being run ``in a manner hazardous to its policyholders,
creditors and the public.''
   Pacific Standard, which has sold $7 billion worth of life and
indemnity insurance nationwide, acknowledged it was insolvent but
said the shortfall was less than claimed by the state.
   The company on Tuesday laid off 30 percent of its 155 employees.
It also imposed a moratorium to prevent customers from cashing out
their policies for six months, but will continue to pay annuities
and death benefits.
   Pacific Standard was acquired six years ago by Southmark Corp.,
a Dallas real estate syndicator that filed for Chapter 11 federal
bankruptcy protection in June.
   A prelimiarny estimates showed that Pacific Standard has assets
of $533 million and liabilities of $574 million, said Deputy
Insurance Commissioner Don Rosen.
   Susan Ridell, Pacific Standard's chief financial officer, said
the company's financial woes stemmed from heavy investments in
high-yield, high-risk ``junk'' bonds under former management.

<HEAD>Shearson Announces Management Reshuffle, Corporate Realignment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. announced today a
corporate realignment and management reshuffle that included the
reassignment of company president Jeffrey B. Lane to a lesser
position.
   The move reflected the continuing turmoil at the nation's
second-largest investment firm, which over the past month announced
layoffs of hundreds of workers and a sharp reduction in stockbroker
commissions.
   Peter A. Cohen, Shearson's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a statement today that the company was dividing its
businesses into four groups: Capital Markets, Investment and
Merchant Banking, Private Client and Subsidiary Activities.
   Other big Wall Street firms have made similar realignments in
recent years.
   Lane was reassigned to head the Subsidiary Activities Group,
which will include Shearson's money management businesses including
its Boston Co. division, Cohen said.
   Robert S. Fuld Jr., who currently heads Shearson's taxable
fixed-income division, was seen as replacing Lane as Cohen's
second-in-command, although Fuld was not given the title of
Shearson's president.
   Fuld was named president of Shearson's Capital Markets Group,
which will include the company's worldwide capital markets
activities. He will also oversee Shearson's administrative side.
   Shearson, which is 61 percent-owned by American Express Co.,
also announced it was disbanding its chief policy-making committee,
the 11-member policy group, but was creating a business development
committee to ``help identify future directions for the firm.''
   Today's announcement was expected. Shearson said earlier this
month that it was in the process of reshuffling its businesses.
   Last week, Shearson also said it would cut broker commissions by
1 percent to 2 percent in 1990, and on Nov. 7, it said it had begun
laying off employees in a cutback that could total 2 percent by the
end of the year.
   Analysts have said the changes at Shearson stem from American
Express' desire to reduce its stake in the investment firm, but
wants Shearson to first improve its profitability.
   The company is also trying to stave off a possible lowering of
its credit rating by Moody's Investors Service.
   In the third quarter, Shearson said it earned $66 million, but
most of that came from a one-time $77 million pretax gain from the
sale of its Lehman Management Co. and investment banking fees from
the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
   Shearson also announced today that the Investment and Merchant
Banking Group will be headed by Sherman R. Lewis Jr., and that
Hardwick Simmons will serve as president of the Private Client
Group, which is Shearson's brokerage operations.
   Lewis will also oversee Shearson's human resources department,
the company said.

   A federal grand jury convened today to
investigate a Thiokol Corp. engineer's allegations of improper
inspections of shuttle parts since the Challenger disaster.
   U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson said he could not comment on the
probe or any other matter the grand jury, holding its regular
session, might look into. He said he expects the panel to complete
its work by Friday.
   Steve Lawson, a spokesman for Utah-based Thiokol, said Tuesday
the company was asked to provide information about instrumentation
in the redesigned rocket motors that were used beginning with the
Discovery flight on Sept. 30, 1988.
   A quality control engineer for Thiokol, Dan Joos, said Tuesday
he wrote a memo to his superiors citing improper inspection
procedures in some equipment used on shuttle missions. Joos, who
has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, said his
superiors forwarded the memo NASA.
   He said Challenger and the three subsequent shuttles may have
operated with inaccurate equipment because of improper inspections.
   He said up to 50 percent of the data measured on shuttle flights
may be inaccurate _ which means ``we could lose another shuttle
today.''
   Royce Mitchell, manager of the solid rocket booster program at
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, said the grand jury
probe probably would be confined to the first three shuttle flights
after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion.
   Several hundred changes were made to the shuttle solid rocket
boosters after the Challenger exploded.
   One of the major parts of the booster that was redesigned was
the field joint blamed in the Challenger accident.
   The joints are formed when the huge booster segments are stacked
at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Cold launch
temperatures prevented O-rings from sealing the joints, allowing
gas to escape.
   A Thiokol spokesman, Rocky Raab, said Tuesday night that the
government ``has requested Thiokol Corporation to provide
additional information relating to the redesigned solid rocket
motors used in the space shuttle program.
   ``The information deals with instrumentation used on the first
three flights using the redesigned solid rocket motors
(post-Challenger flights.) The instrumentation and the motors on
which it was used were flown successfully and fulfilled NASA's
mission requirements.''
   Raab said he did not know who requested the information and said
he was not familiar with Joos.
   ``We know as little about it as you do at the moment,'' he said.
``This was all the information we were able to gather this
afternoon.''

<HEAD>Economy Up Moderately in Third Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a moderate annual
rate of 2.7 percent from July through September, the government
reported today, but analysts say growth is slowing in the current
quarter.
   The increase reported by the Commerce Department in the broadest
measure of economic health was up from an advance estimate of 2.5
percent issued last month.
   The revision was about in line with economists' expectations,
but it could still cause the Federal Reserve Board to move more
cautiously in its campaign to lower interest rates as a stimulant
to growth.
   Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipated
trade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit a
five-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made.
   Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third
quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, while
imports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump in
last month's report.
   Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising a
brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the first
quarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8
percent.
   Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,
improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annual
rate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-June
quarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate.
   The GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second
quarter and for the first nine months of the year is averaging a
3.0 percent annual rate, just above the Bush administration's
forecast for the whole year.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We always like to see increase in growth. And this report
is relatively good news in that sense.''
   Still, many analysts believe the economy will have a tough time
meeting the target because of a dramatic slowing in the current
three-month period. A few predict the country will topple into a
recession, ending the seven-year economic expansion that is
unprecedented in peacetime.
   It would take only a 1.8 percent GNP increase in the
October-December quarter to match the administration forecast,
according to a Commerce Department analyst, but most private
economists expect a growth rate of 1.5 percent or lower.
   ``My view is we can stay out of a recession, but just barely,''
said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York.
   In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said
after-tax corporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in the
third quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which
was the worst performance in three years. The decline marks the
third consecutive quarter that profits have dropped.
   But, the department attributed $11 billion of the $15.5 billion
decline to losses from Hurricane Hugo. Benefits paid by insurance
companies totaled $9 billion, while uninsured corporate losses
totaled $2 billion.
   Jones said corporate profits will continue to be weak. With the
economy softening, companies are finding it difficult to pass on
rising labor costs to their customers, he said.
   Analysts generally do not expect the third-quarter surge in
consumer spending will be repeated, attributing much of it to auto
purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing incentives.
   They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that the
strength in the dollar will stall improvement in the deficit.
   However, Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,
said Tuesday that falling interest rates should sustain economic
growth into next year.
   ``Some private forecasters believe the economy will slow. ...
But even the most pessimistic forecaster does not see a serious
downturn in the economy,'' Boskin told a conference sponsored by
the Agriculture Department.
   The Federal Reserve in June reversed its program of fighting
inflation with rising interest rates, but has lowered rates only
gradually since then. It last eased credit early this month,
nudging the rate charged among banks for overnight loans down a
quarter-point to 8.5 percent.
   Many analysts incorrectly reported last week that the Fed had
eased again, but they still expect the move to come before the end
of the year.
   In other details from today's GNP report:
   _Business capital spending, a bright spot in previous quarters,
slowed to an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the
advance estimate of 5.8 percent. Analysts say falling corporate
profits will cause businesses to further cut back in this area.
   _Housing construction, which has been in a slump as a result of
the Fed's inflation-fighting campaign, fell at an annual rate of
8.4 percent, nearly double the advance estimate of a 4.8 percent
decline.
   The various changes left the economy, after adjusting for
inflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.16 trillion in the third
quarter, $27.7 billion higher than the second-quarter pace.

   Stock prices fell in moderate trading today amid
profit-taking following the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 6.62 points to
2,695.39 at 11 a.m. EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator
was down 1.50 points.
   The decline was broad-based as losing issues outnumbered
advancers by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 775
issues down, 429 up and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 50.95 million shares.
   Analysts said investors were selling stocks and taking profits
after recent price gains. The Dow Jones industrials has gained
nearly 70 points in the last five trading sessions.
   Traders said the stock and bond markets showed little immediate
reaction to an upward revision in third-quarter Gross National
Product and to a report showing corporate profits declined 7.2
percent in the July-September period.
   Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said investors are focusing on the current quarter.
   ``As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material,''
Wachtel said. ``We now know the economy is floundering and
corporate profits are floundering.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Kenneth Cooper is keeping the aerobics
movement alive with a bottom-line pitch to executives: ``Good
fitness is good business.''
   Cooper helped start the fitness boom more than 20 years ago with
his best-selling book, ``Aerobics,'' and he has not let the profits
of the boom slip through his well-exercised fingers.
   Cooper has developed five health centers on 30 acres in one of
Dallas's most pricey neighborhoods. Some of the city's best-known
executives and celebrities pay $900 a year here to grunt, growl and
trudge their way to fitness.
   The complex includes a hotel for the health-conscious, exercise
facilities, a research institute and a clinic Cooper aims to make
``the Mayo Clinic of preventive medicine.''
   Treadmills, exercise bicycles and rowing machines are found
throughout the colonial-style complex. Outside, a mile-long
rubberized track winds around the landscaped grounds, over
picturesque footbridges and through groves of trees.
   Cooper says that many corporations foot the bill for their
executives' membership _ both as a perk to attract quality
management and in the belief healthy executives are better
executives.
   President Bush and former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach
have worked out at the complex. Still, Cooper said, ``That doesn't
mean we don't have the flight attendants (and) busboys.''
   Health club members provide fodder for studies conducted at the
Cooper's Institute for Aerobics Research. After each workout
members use computer terminals to record their performances, which
become raw data for institute researchers.
   The institute's research has led to more than 600 books,
monographs and articles, including Cooper's highly publicized,
15-year study released this month showing even a modest amount of
exercise can prolong life.
   It all was ``a great big gamble'' in 1970, when Cooper quit as
the Air Force senior flight surgeon to follow his dream of creating
``the preventive medicine center of the world.''
   No bank would lend him the money to get started, despite the
success of his 1968 book ``Aerobics,'' so Cooper borrowed $1.2
million from Tyler Corp. to buy a mansion and 22 acres on Dallas's
prestigious Preston Road. Since then _ while writing eight more
books and signing contracts for three more _ Cooper has pumped at
least $11 million into construction and the purchase of an adjacent
church to house the non-profit research institute.
   He says the institute is the reason for the rest of the
operation. Other divisions are:
   _ The Cooper Clinic, where nine doctors practice Cooper's
preaching of preventive medicine. A physical, complete with
nutritional screening and a treadmill stress test, takes at least
six hours and costs $850. Add cancer screening and the cost is
$1,159.
   _ The in-residence programs: four-, seven- or 13-day stays where
participants learn to be healthy. In addition to a physical, the
program includes visits to restaurants and grocery stores where
clients learn how to order and shop to avoid unhealthy food. The
cost runs from $1,595 for the four-day program to $4,695 for a
13-day stay in a private suite.
   Cooper defends the cost, some of which can be borne by insurance
companies, saying other programs offer less for more money.
   _The guest lodge, besides providing housing for the in-residence
programs in its two buildings, also is an operating hotel with the
usual services and amenities.
   There are other programs offered, including training for several
government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the
Bureau of Prisons.
   The budget is $12 million a year. Cooper said the center is
profitable, but wouldn't say how profitable.
   Michael Evans was one of the first to sign on at the Aerobics
Center, which opened 19 years ago.
   ``I came out here so I can stay fit so I can work more
effectively,'' said Evans, a 62-year-old insurance executive who
credits exercise for keeping him from triple-bypass heart surgery
and helping him stand the stress of a mid-career job change.
   ``This place has a sense of urgency,'' he said, pointing out
that there are no after-jogging cocktails or partying to negate the
good done by the exercise. ``Everybody's here for their own
well-being, not just that country club appearance.''
   While Cooper likes to mention how George Bush ran around the
center's track with a pack of Secret Service agents, another
well-known member brought the center unwanted notoriety.
   On May 1, 1985, CBS television sportscaster Frank Glieber was
walking around the center's track when he suffered a fatal heart
attack.
   Cooper says Glieber, whom he described as a close friend, ``had
let himself go.'' But Cooper also noted joggers have logged 7
million miles on the Aerobic Center tracks, and Glieber's death and
two ``non-fatal cardiac events'' were the only emergencies.
   The death of another jogging guru, Jim Fixx, in 1984, plus
Glieber's attack, led Cooper to write ``Running Without Fear.''
   ``There is no panacea,'' he says. ``We have to keep this thing
in perspective.''

<HEAD>Pest Pursuers Battle Over Cockroach Eradication Methods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of Combat and Raid have locked
antennae over the lucrative cockroach-killing market, trading
charges in advertising and federal court.
   Raid maker S.C. Johnson &amp; Co. has been in the business longer,
giving it an advantage over the larger American Cyanamid Co., which
introduced its Combat line only in 1985.
   Even so, American Cyanamid is posing a serious threat to S.C.
Johnson, or Johnson Wax as the privately owned Racine, Wis.-based
company is usually known.
   Cyanamid fired a double-barreled blast in U.S. District Court,
accusing Johnson Wax in separate lawsuits of false advertising and
trademark infringement.
   Johnson Wax counter-sued, charging that Cyanamid's advertising
made its own false claims. Both are asking for corrective
television commercials and damages.
   While the legal battles go on, Cyanamid's Combat has garnered
more than 12 percent of the half-billion-dollar home insecticide
market, making it second to Johnson's Raid, which has about 47
percent, according to industry estimates.
   ``Johnson Wax seems to be the one that's scrambling to do
whatever it can to defend its market-share position,'' said Harvey
Stober, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst.
   Stober said Johnson Wax's zeal may be leading it to excesses in
advertising and packaging. ``Everyone,'' he said, ``wants to be the
bigger roach killer.''
   The court cases are pending before U.S. District Judge John
Bissell. The judge dealt Wayne, N.J.-based Cyanamid a preliminary
blow in August. Another hearing is set for January.
   The story begins April 26, when Johnson Wax unveiled its Raid
Max line in a media splash at the Chicago Academy of Sciences.
Johnson Wax has said it would spend $100 million to advertise the
line, its first since Raid hit the market in 1956. The line
includes an aerosol spray killer, fogger and bait trap. Combat has
the same line-up.
   Two days after the introduction, Cyanamid launched its first
suit, accusing Johnson Wax of violating a Cyanamid trademark for
its ``Maxforce'' line, directed at exterminators and not home users.
   In court papers, the company said Maxforce products this year
would bring in $3 million. Advertising cost $1 million.
   ``Cyanamid's claim that RAID Max is likely to be confused with
MAXFORCE is, in my judgment, something no competent marketing
person would say to his peers and expect to be believed,'' said
Raid's product manager, Ravichandra K. Saligram, in an affidavit.
   To a point, Bissell agreed. In an opinion filed Aug. 30, he
refused to issue a temporary ban on the use of ``Max,'' saying
there was no compelling need for such an order in advance of a
fuller hearing.
   But even as lawyers were arguing the question on Aug. 28 before
Bissell, Cyanamid came to court with another suit.
   Johnson Wax advertisements aired last spring falsely claimed
that Raid fumigators _ bombs that release a cloud of smoke lethal
to cockroaches _ killed Combat survivors; sought out roaches while
Combat was passive; went ``everywhere;'' outkilled Combat; and
worked three hours after use, Cyanamid charged.
   Actually, Combat's maker said, Combat leaves no survivors and
kills remote roaches when they cannibalize infected victims.
Moreover, it said, the fumigators don't live up to the claims.
   Combat ads, meanwhile, had been running in August. And now it
was Johnson Wax's turn.
   In its own filing, the Wisconsin company said the Combat
commercials falsely claimed the fumigator's odor could be smelled.
   ``In fact, the user smells only the pleasant scent of aromatic
ingredients in the product,'' said the papers.
   Cyanamid also falsely claimed roaches don't come back to a home
treated by Combat, and that Combat was more powerful than a
fumigator, Johnson Wax said.

Johnson Wax's ad people, researchers and testers.
   Bissell will hold a hearing in January on the dispute, said

<HEAD>The Holiday Budget Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with the holiday festivities it brings,
December poses some of the toughest challenges of all in the battle
to manage your money.
   The rush of gift-buying, party-giving and holiday travel can
easily bust a budget that has been judiciously managed through the
other 11 months of the year.
   Experts on the subject have no single magic formula to offer
that will see you through the holidays with your finances
unscathed. Friendships, family or business circumstances may
dictate that you must spend more money at this time of year than
you otherwise would.
   But financial advisers do suggest that your chances of staying
solvent will improve drastically if you have an organized plan.
   ``It's wise to set up a budget before starting to shop,''
counsels the American Bankers Association.
   ``In addition to funds set aside for gifts, consumers should
allow for extra expenses unique to the holiday season, such as food
for parties and out of town guests, cards and postage, wrapping
paper and decorations.''
   Adds the newsletter 100 Highest Yields in North Palm Beach,
Fla.: ``Put the same number crunching to a trip to visit the
grandparents or escape the cold weather.
   ``What you don't want to do is run up a huge tab on your cards
or draw down your savings. The MasterCard or Visa bill will hang
over your head for months. Even worse, you may need cash for an
emergency and not have it.''
   The season can be especially treacherous for anyone walking
around with a wallet full of credit cards.
   ``Buying with a credit card is an added convenience during the
busy holidays, especially with long lines and harried salespeople
to contend with,'' the ABA says.
   ``However, consumers should keep a wary eye on impulse buying by
setting a limit on how much they intend to charge on their cards
and sticking to it.''
   If you are among the approximately two-thirds of all bank-card
holders who don't pay off the full balance due each month, there is
an added incentive this year to keep a rein on credit purchases.
   Credit card interest, which always has been expensive, will get
more so Jan. 1 under a change mandated by the Tax Reform Act of
1986. In 1989, 20 percent of personal interest is still
tax-deductible. Next year the percentage drops to 10 percent,
before going to zero in 1991.
   ``For consumers who don't ordinarily work with a defined
budget,'' the ABA says, ``a general guideline is that credit
obligations _ including credit cards, car payments and student or
personal loans _ should not exceed 10 to 15 percent of take-home
pay.
   ``These credit expenses plus mortgage or rent payments should
not exceed 35 to 40 percent of gross income.''
   Adroit holiday money-management can have multiple rewards. In
the waning days of the year, money that isn't spent shopping can be
used for charitable contributions, mortgage payments, state and
local taxes, or any number of other things that might qualify as
deductions on your 1989 tax return.
   Such planning may not do much to make your holiday merrier. But
it can be considered an investment toward a happy new year.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Little Changed In Quiet Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders awaited news of new
export sales.
   In the absence of significant new foreign sales of U.S. grain,
talk among traders turned to this weekend's superpower summit
meeting and the prospects that it could lead to more grain sales to
the Soviet Union.
   ``They have more than a passing interest in the Bush-Gorbachev
talks,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department
Inc., a brokers' advisory service in Chicago.
   Hopes for future export sales of wheat were supported by a
prediction from a U.S. Agriculture Department official that the
Soviets may re-enter the U.S. wheat market in January.
   But the official, Frank Gomme, a USDA food grains marketing
specialist, also said China's wheat import needs were filled
through March.
   Contracts for spring and summer deliveries of wheat gained
slightly in reaction to Tuesday's National Weather Service
forecasts for below-normal precipitation in the great plains this
winter.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06} a
bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to \ cent higher with
December at $2.33} a bushel; oats were { cent lower across the
board with December at $1.43\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to
3\ cents higher with January at $5.79} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, led by limit losses in the pork-belly market
in reaction to news that the USDA had accepted offers on 920,000
pounds of pork bellies for export to Poland at 78.84 cents to 80.45
cents a pound.
   Live cattle futures were .42 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
December at 75.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with November at 83.60 cents a pound; live hogs
were .25 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December at 50.60 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to the limit 2 cents
lower with February at 60.55 cents a pound.

   The stock market remained broadly lower in dull
trading today after a round of profit-taking at the opening.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.55 points to
2,696.46 at noon EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator was
down 6.62 points.
   The decline was broad-based as losing issues outnumbered
advancers by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 839
issues down, 450 up and 536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 70.74 million shares.
   Analysts said the market had turned generally lackluster, with
some institutional selling helping depress prices.
   ``There's not much action in the market right now,'' said
Emanuel Geronimous, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   The market came under pressure starting at the opening as
investors sold stocks to take advantage of recent price increases.
The Dow Jones industrial average has gained nearly 70 points in the
last five trading sessions.
   Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports
on third-quarter Gross National Product and corporate profits.
   Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said investors are focusing on the current quarter.
   ``As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material,''
Wachtel said. ``We now know the economy is floundering and
corporate profits are floundering.''
   The Commerce Department reported today that the economy grew at
an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher
than the 2.5 percent forecast last month.
   A second report showed that corporate profits were down 7.2
percent in the July-September period.
   Analysts said the data was not likely to prompt any action by
the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate the
economy.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.64 to 190.70.

<HEAD>Braniff's Creditors Question Airline Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. is struggling along with 275
employees as a small charter carrier, the airline's top executives
say, but a favorable court ruling on aircraft purchases and leases
may help it get some needed cash.
   The future remains cloudy for the airline, Braniff officials
told a group of disgruntled creditors Tuesday. Orlando-based
Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 28, its
second such filing in seven years, and cancelled all its regularly
scheduled flights earlier this month.
   Howard McKinnon, Braniff's chief operating officer, said the
company has ``a number of alternate plans'' but lack of financing
``prevents us from having any meaningful discussion or planning.''
   He and Chairman Bill McGee are still trying to interest
investors or buyers in Braniff.
   Meanwhile, a bankruptcy judge's ruling this past weekend will
work in favor of Braniff, allowing it to add to its physical assets
_ its aircraft fleet _ with long-term lease and purchase agreements
for 50 Airbus A320 jets, said company lawyer Howard T. Glassman.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge C. Timothy Corcoran ruled last Saturday
that Braniff's contracts for the 50 airplanes with a number of
aviation companies are valid, despite the bankruptcy proceedings.
In addition, Braniff has an option to buy another 50 Airbuses.
   Braniff considers those contracts ``the linchpin to enable the
debtor to go forward,'' Glassman said, meaning that the airline can
sublease the planes or sell the contracts. The agreements also make
Braniff more attractive to potential buyers.
   However, the carrier failed to come up with $3 million in lease
payments for five Airbuses it has already received from GPA Group
Ltd., and may have to return the jets.
   GPA, an Irish leasing company, is expected to sue Braniff to get
the five planes returned. Glassman said, however, that Braniff may
appeal the ruling, hoping to extend the payment deadline by 60 days.
   ``But that's a totally separate issue,'' he told reporters. ``If
I lost the planes on the ground because we couldn't pay the $3
million, that doesn't impact the other 95 planes. The five are not
critical, as much as we'd like to have them.''
   What's important, he said, is the overall ruling that the
agreements are valid.
   ``All we want is to market this position and raise money based
on these planes.''
   Mark Osterberg, Braniff's senior vice president for finance,
said in response to questions from lawyers for creditors that the
company had about $500,000 cash on hand and has current monthly
expenses of about $1.7 million, including some $1 million in
payroll for remaining employees. But this does not include hefty
legal fees, the charter operations and other non-scheduled
expenses, he said.
   Osterberg also said the company pays $1 million in rental costs
every month. Braniff anticipates some $3 million to $4 million in
credit card fees and another $1.5 million from other sources in
December, he said.

<HEAD>Shell Agrees to $19.75 Million Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. has agreed to a $19.75
million settlement for its 1988 spill of more than 400,000 gallons
of crude oil that oozed over a 15-mile stretch of Carquinez Strait
shoreline and nesting places, the city announced today.
   Martinez Mayor Mike Menesini said the bulk of the settlement,
$11 million, wil be used to help restore wetlands damaged by the
spill.
   The April 23, 1988, oil spill in the environmentally sensitive,
100-acre Peyton Marsh adjacent to Shell's Martinez refinery soiled
400 boats, killed at least 300 birds and animals, and coated
critical wildlife habitats with black muck. Salmon were migrating
through the Carquinez Strait during the spill.
   For comparison purposes, 365,000 gallons of oil is enough to
operate 700 buses for a year and would cover 32 football fields at
a depth of one-half an inch.
   The oil company admitted it illegally allowed storm water drain
from the top of a 12.5 million gallon oil storage tank, and oil
leaked through a flexible pipe in the middle of the tank, then into
the slough.
   As part of the settlement, Shell will pay $4.7 million in civil
penalties for violating federal rules when it allowed the oil to
bypass a collection dike and pour into the scenic waterway about 40
miles northeast of San Francisco.
   Shell also will pay $1.3 million for environmental studies of
the areas affected by the spill, including locations in Benicia and
Solano County.
   The City of Martinez will receive $500,000 to rebuild and
improve fishing facilities at its shoreline, where fishing and
marina business was hurt by the spill, Menesini said. The oil
company also will give the city $250,000 to compensate for damages.
   ``This $19.75 million agreement is the largest monetary
settlement of an oil spill in the history of ... California,''
Menesini said. ``It provides a clear warning that harm to our
environment will not be tolerated.''
   The six-month cleanup and restoration work cost Shell $14
million, according to the company's own estimates.
   Negotiations have been underway between Shell and 16 federal,
state and local agencies since the spill, according to the state
Department of Fish and Game.
   Additional settlement details were to be released at a news
conference in San Francisco later today.

   Prices finished generally higher in thin trading
Wednesday on London's Stock Exchange with few substantive
developments to affect the overall market.
   Traders said shares in financial and insurance sectors sold
well, with some insurance stocks invigorated by takeover
speculation.
   ``People are gearing themselves into a cautionary mode,'' one
trader said. ``It must be because they think the market is going
down and the only sector for dividend growth is financials.''
   Lingering uncertainty over the direction of British interest
rates has subdued buying interest, dealers said.

   London dealers complained that Wall Street provided little
leadership during the afternoon and movements in New York were
largely shrugged off.

<HEAD>Net Earnings Fall 54 Percent at Britain's Hanson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanson PLC, a British industrial conglomerate
with large U.S. holdings, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit
fell about 54 percent as a result of one-time factors, while
operating profit was higher.
   Hanson's net profit, according to British accounting principles,
fell to $318 million from $685 million in the quarter ended Sept.
30. The decline came because of a tax charge in the 1989 quarter
and large one-time gains on asset sales made in the 1988 quarter,
Hanson said. Profit before taxes and one-time items rose to $520
million from $444 million.
   Earnings per American depository receipt on a fully diluted
basis rose to 44 cents a share from 39 cents a share, according to
British accounting principles. In Britain, earnings per ADR are
calculated on pre-tax profits, before tax and extraordinary
one-time items.
   Sales in the quarter rose to $3.04 billion from $2.95 billion a
year earlier.
   For the full fiscal year, net income fell to $1.78 billion from
$1.81 billion because of decreased gains from asset sales. Profit
before taxes and one-time items rose to $1.72 billion from $1.42
billion.
   Earnings per American depository receipt on a fully diluted
basis rose to $1.49 a share from $1.28. Yearly sales fell to $11.3
billion from $11.9 billion.
   Lord Hanson, the chairman, said Hanson ended the year with $8.5
billion in cash and a substantial borrowing capacity, putting it in
a ``commanding position'' to make more acquisitions when they
become available at realistic prices.
   Hanson's U.S. properties include SCM Chemicals, Jacuzzi,
Farberware, Endicott Johnson and Frye footwear, Universal Gym, Gold
Fields Mining and minority interests in Smith-Corona typewriters
and Newmont Mining. British properties include Imperial Tobacco and
Consolidated Gold Fields, which it acquired earlier this year for
$5.7 billion, Britain's largest takeover ever.
   Dollar figures for the 1989 and 1988 periods were converted from
British pounds at the Sept. 30 rate of $1.615 to the pound.
   Each ADR represents five British shares.

   Cyclops Industries Inc. said it has
ended plans to sell its specialty steel unit to its employees under
a stock ownership plan.
   The company declined to comment on why negotiations, which began
last June, failed.
   However, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers union said

million offer for Cytemp Specialty Steel Division.
   Virgil Colucci, president of United Steelworkers Local 178, said
bankers balked at providing all of the money for the buyout but
that employees still held out hope something could be worked out.
   James F. Will, Cyclops president and chief executive officer,
said, ``We have not totally broken off discussions with the
proposed ESOP, but a transaction with this group appears unlikely.''
   The division's 1,200 employees produce alloys, high-performance
stainless and other steels at plants in Titusville, Bridgeville and
Pittsburgh.

   Great Western Financial Corp., the
nation's second largest thrift holding company, estimates it will
lose $75 million in the fourth quarter as a result of its decision
to raise reserves for troubled real estate loans.
   The company said Tuesday that it will add as much as $200
million to its reserves to cover problem loans in 22 states.
   The projected quarterly loss, which amounts to 60 cents a share,
would be the first in seven years for Great Western, which has
assets of $37 billion and is considered to be one of the nation's
healthiest and conservative savings and loan companies.
   For the first nine months this year, Great Western had net
income of $177 million, or $1.37 a share. During the 1988 fourth
quarter, the company earned $59.7 million, or 47 cents a share.
   Analysts had expected Great Western, whose principal subsidiary
is Great Western Bank, to show some problems with loans. But they
said the write-downs were greater than expected.
   ``Great Western is one of the Rolls-Royces of the business,''
said Jonathan Gray, of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York.
``It's not a case where you expect to see any engine trouble, or
even any sputtering.''

<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp. said Wednesday its board
deferred taking a position on a revised $3.4 billion offer from
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. for a controlling interest in
the company.
   LIN has already reached an agreement with BellSouth Corp., the
regional telephone company based in Atlanta, for a merger of their
cellular interests.
   That proposal is being presented to LIN shareholders for a vote
on Jan. 12.
   The New York-based cellular concern, which also owns seven
television stations and a specialty publishing business, said its
board will continue its evaluation of McCaw's offer and expects to
``come to a determination in the near term based on all then
relevant information and developmnets.''
   ``Pending such determination, the board continues to recommend
that stockholders not tender common stock to McCaw at this time,''
the statement said.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, has
offered $150 a share for 22.5 million shares of LIN stock, an
amount that would lift its stake in LIN to 51.2 percent.
   It has also asked that LIN submit its offer to shareholders for
a vote at the same time as they vote on the LIN-BellSouth deal.
   If it refuses, McCaw has threatened to mount a proxy fight for
control of the LIN board at the Jan. 12 meeting.
   The LIN board set the close of business Dec. 8 as the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to participate in
McCaw's consent solicitation to replace a majority of the board
should McCaw decide to pursue that course of action.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a lackluster session
marked by lack of significant supply-and-demand developments.
   Much of the attention was focused on U.S.-Soviet relations and
the chances that this weekend's superpower summit could lead to
more sales of U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union.
   Hopes for future export sales of wheat were supported by a USDA
official's prediction that the Soviets may re-enter the U.S. wheat
market in January.
   But some traders took it as a bearish sign that Soviet
legislators had adjourned for the year without liberalizing
emigration policies.
   The United States has tied Soviet emigration policies to trade,
indicating it may grant the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trade
status if the Soviets relax emigration restrictions.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.05} a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 2 cents higher with December at $2.34} a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.42} a

at $5.79 a bushel.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Announces New Services for Mexican Border Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said
Wednesday it was giving the Mexican economy a ``vote of
confidence'' by upgrading its offerings of products and services to
U.S. maquiladora factories in northern Mexico.
   The maquiladoras are border assembly plants permitted under a
tariff-reduction agreement between the countries that provide jobs
to Mexicans and low-cost assembly to American companies.
   AT&amp;T's upgraded offerings include 800 toll-free service, private
lines, office phones and switches, facsimile machines and computers.
   AT&amp;T's announcement comes on the heels of a U.S. trade mission
to Mexico last week that included Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher and John Hinds, president of AT&amp;T International.
   ``We're very encouraged by what President (Carlos) Salinas and
his team have accomplished and the track they're on,'' Hinds said
in an interview.
   Hinds said AT&amp;T hopes to offer upgraded products and services
throughout Mexico in coming months, working with Mexico's telephone
administrations, Telmex and Telnor, as well as the Secretariat of
Communications and Transportation.
   MCI Communications Corp. is negotiating with Telmex on upgrading
service offerings, spokeswoman Jane Levene said. MCI currently
offers basic long-distance and telex services.

<HEAD>Bloomingdale's Chief Trying to Drum Up Buyout Backing in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub, seeking
financial support for his proposed buyout of the widely known
department store chain, on Wednesday said he has had ``serious''
talks with Japanese retailers.
   One major Japanese retailer, however, said it turned down an
offer from Traub.
   Traub also indicated the Bloomingdale's name may be affiliated
with retailing in Japan in the future.
   ``I am excited, as a longtime retailer, with opportunities to do
retail business in Japan,'' he told reporters. ``I will be very
pleased to have Bloomingdale's cooperate with premium retailers in
Japan to successfully exploit our name and reputation.''
   Traub did not reveal details of his negotiations in Japan. The
17 Bloomingdale's stores have been put up for sale by Campeau
Corp., a Canadian-based conglomerate burdened with $11.5 billion in
debt.
   The Bloomingdale's chairman said he had been negotiating with
four Japanese groups about backing a management buyout, but he
declined to identify them.
   ``We are having serious, constructive conversations with parties
in Japan,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Osaka-based Hankyu Department Store told The
Associated Press that it had turned down an offer from Traub.
Spokesman Katsuhiro Hayashi said Hankyu President Shoji Fukumitsu
had met with Traub on Tuesday at Traub's request in Osaka.
   The spokesman gave no details of the offer rejected by
Fukumitsu, whose company had sales of $2.6 billion last year.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading Japanese economic
newspaper, reported that Traub asked Hankyu to finance $250 million
out of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion needed for the management
buyout.
   Officials of Tokyu Department Store, another major retailer
mentioned in press reports as a possible investor in
Bloomingdale's, declined to comment.
   Parties to the proposed buyout, Traub told reporters, were about
75 Bloomingdale's executives willing to put up their own money, a
group of ``first-class Japanese retailers'' and financial
institutions in the United States, Japan and Europe.
   Other potential bidders are believed to be interested in the New
York-based Bloomingdale's. Crown American Corp., a privately held
company that is among the leading developers of U.S. shopping
malls, has said it may go after Bloomingdale's.
   Traub, who started working for Bloomingdale's in 1950 and has
been its head since 1978, said he expected the management buyout to
be settled by mid-December, and the process to be completed in
early 1990.
   ``We think the chance of our success is good,'' he said.

   The stock market fell in generally lackluster
trading today amid continued uncertainty about interest rates.
   Analysts said computerized trading strategies helped push stock
prices lower in the final hour of trading.
   Stocks came under pressure from the opening as investors took
profits after the market's recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average has gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading
sessions.
   Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports
on third-quarter Gross National Product and corporate profits.
   Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said investors were focusing on the current quarter.
   ``As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material,''
Wachtel said. ``We now know the economy is floundering and
corporate profits are floundering.''
   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at an
annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher
than the 2.5 percent forecast last month.
   A second report showed that corporate profits were down 7.2
percent in the July-September period.
   Analysts said interest rate worries continued to plague the
market after the Federal Reserve both added and drained reserves
from the banking system in recent days.
   Many assumed the Fed's action last week pointed to an easing of
interest rates. But the central bank confused the market with this
week's draining move that sent short-term interest rates higher.
   Bank stocks came under pressure today after Southwest Bank of
St. Louis announced it was raising its prime rate back to 10.5
percent from 10 percent after cutting it three weeks ago.
   Some analysts said, however, that the market's sluggishness was
merely a pause after the recent runup in stock prices and before
the start of a pre-Christmas rally.
   ``It's two days overdue,'' said Ralph Bloch, chief market
analyst with Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   Bloch said the recent stock gains were reminiscent of the
October market when a handful of blue-chip issues led the market
higher before prices plunged on October 13.

<HEAD>Chrysler Defends Plant Closing; UAW Sees Possible Strained Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. executives on Wednesday
defended the planned closing of a Detroit car assembly plant, a
move United Auto Workers union leaders say could worsen labor
relations with the nation's No. 3 automaker.
   The executives and UAW leaders met during their annual weeklong
gathering for exploring ways to ease tensions.
   Much of the discussion Wednesday centered on the planned Feb. 2
closing of the Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit, where
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars are made.
   Union members contend the closing, which will result in layoffs
of about 1,700 workers, violates local and national contracts.
Chrysler maintains the closing is permitted because of slumping
sales of the Omni and Horizon.
   Chrysler is building a new assembly plant next to the Jefferson
Avenue factory and it will employ many of the people now making
Omni and Horizon cars. But training for those workers won't begin
until Fall 1991.
   ``We're a little upset at being the last person to know of the
closing of the Jefferson plant,'' said Robert Bowling, president of
UAW Local 110 in St. Louis. ``The press knew before we did, and we
don't think that's right.
   ``(UAW President) Owen Bieber said it pretty well this morning.
He told them that he didn't appreciate it.''
   The company announced on Nov. 3, shortly after a story about the
closing appeared in The Wall Street Journal, that it was halting
production at the Jefferson Avenue factory and trimming production
at its car plant in St. Louis.
   Anthony St. John, Chrysler's vice president for labor relations,
said the first 2{ days of the meeting were constructive, as union
and company officials talked about joint training programs.
   ``Today, there was some initial tension because there was some
concern over the way the Jefferson situation had been handled,'' he
said Wednesday. ``There was a lot of frustration there from an
employee's standpoint.''
   St. John also said Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald told
union members that the Jefferson Avenue plant had fallen victim to
slow cars sales.
   ``Basically, one-shift production is 470 units a day and (daily)
sales orders were averaging about 220, indicating that we were
losing money on each vehicle,'' St. John said.
   Bowling said Greenwald told the union leaders that Chrysler
would try to better handle announcements such as the Jefferson
Avenue plant closing. Bowling said he would be satisfied if the
company kept its commitments.
   Upper-level Chrysler and UAW officials have been gathering for
similar annual meetings since 1986 and Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca has spoken at the previous ones.
   Iacocca skipped this year's opportunity to address union
representatives, saying there was a longstanding previous
commitment.
   The meeting began eight days after hundreds of angry UAW members
paraded outside Chrysler headquarters in the Detroit enclave of
Highland Park, protesting the planned Jefferson Avenue closing.
   Contract talks between the union and the nation's Big Three
automakers _ General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler _
begin next summer. Union contracts with the companies expire at
midnight, Sept. 14, 1990.

<HEAD>Gold Price Slide Steepens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell sharply Wednesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, steepening a slide that represents either a temporary
setback in a bull market or gold's retreat from its highest point
in nearly a year.
   ``I think the verdict is still out on that one,'' said John
Jonat, a trader with Deak International Inc., a New York-based
dealer of precious metals and foreign currencies.
   On other futures markets Wednesday, pork-belly futures fell the
limit for the second straight day; energy futures advanced; and
grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.90 to $4 lower on the Comex with the
contract for delivery in December down $4 at $409.50 a troy ounce.
Silver fell 9.5 cents to 9.7 cents with December settling at $5.60
a troy ounce.
   The December gold contract has dropped more than $10 since
Friday, when it peaked at $419.70, the highest Comex gold price
since mid-December.
   Jonat said he was surprised gold fell so sharply after Tuesday's
very slight loss, which he had taken as a sign that a wave of
profit-taking had passed.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``I'm reluctant to say the path is going
to be down.''
   Analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co., a New York-based
futures brokerage, blamed the decline on selling ahead of the first
notice day for the December gold contract.
   Under Comex rules, Thursday is the first day for traders to
declare their intention to deliver gold against the December
contract. A relatively large number of delivery notices are
expected, and traders on the ``buy'' side of December contracts
must sell contracts to avoid taking physical delivery.
   ``The market has been in a little bit of a nervous condition
ahead of this delivery position,'' Tierney said. ``After the
pressure is out of the way from the first day of deliveries, the
market will then resume its trend.''
   Pork-belly futures prices slammed down the 2-cents-a-pound daily
limit for the second straight day on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after the government announced it had accepted bids for
920,000 pounds of pork bellies to be shipped to Poland as part of a
food aid package.
   The announcement follows last week's announcement of a
280,000-pound government purchase, bringing to 1.2 million pounds
the amount of bellies the government has bought to ship to Poland.
   The market's reaction reflected disappointment that the
government is not moving more quickly toward obtaining the total of
22 million pounds that it is expected to buy.
   ``At this pace, it would take forever to fill up a cargo to send
over there,'' said Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent to .72 cent lower with
December at 75.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower
to .17 cent higher with November at 83.72 cents a pound; live hogs
were .15 cent to .63 cent lower with December at 50.52 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.98 cents to 2 cents lower with
February at 60.55 cents a pound.
   Energy futures rose moderately on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting sentiments that the market had overreacted
Tuesday to OPEC's decision to raise its crude-oil output on Jan. 1
to 22 million barrels per day from 20.5 million.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 15 cents
higher with January at $19.40 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent to
.59 cent higher with December at 60.61 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .19 cent to .35 cent higher with December at 49.72
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a lackluster session.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with
December at $4.05} a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher
with December at $2.34} a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower
with December at $1.42} a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 3{

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed as West German Mark Dominates Trading; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance
Wednesday as the West German mark continued to dominate the foreign
exchange markets.
   Gold prices fell sharply in New York after edging higher
overseas.
   ``The dollar was relatively neutral'' as most currency traders
focused on the mark, said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris
Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   The mark fell amid profit-taking in response to a surge since
East Germany opened the Berlin Wall Nov. 9. The opening of the wall
raised expectations that West German industry would benefit from
the relaxation of East-West tensions.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the gross
national product grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent during the
third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent rate originally
reported last month. The news gave the dollar some support but
tended more to prompt selling of the mark, Holzer said.
   The dollar gained against the West German currency in New York,
rising to 1.7875 marks from 1.7770 late Tuesday. In earlier
Frankfurt trading, the dollar closed at 1.7825 marks, down from
1.7880.
   The British pound edged up to $1.5678 in New York from $1.5670
late Tuesday, and sterling also rose earlier in London, closing at
$1.5655, compared with late Tuesday's $1.5625.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5920 Swiss francs, up from 1.5880;
6.0935 French francs, up from 6.0710; 1,318.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,312.75; and 1.16525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6645.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.12 Japanese yen to a closing 143.53
yen. Later, in London, it fell further to 143.15 yen and in New
York, it was quoted at 142.855 yen, down from 143.20.
   The dollar declined in Europe, but dealers said the U.S.
currency had regained some ground before the close.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.5895 Swiss francs, down from 1.5950; 6.0810
French francs, down from 6.1035; 2.0100 Dutch guilders, down from
2.0270; 1,315.50 Italian lire, down from 1,319.50; 1.1658 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1674.
   Gold prices declined sharply in New York after rising slightly
overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold fell
$4 to $409.50, while Republic National Bank's late bid for gold
slipped $5.65 to $407.70 a troy ounce.
   Stephen Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago, said the dollar's gains following its recent slide
probably contributed to Wednesday's decline in gold.
   Profit-taking and a decline in platinum prices also were
factors, he said. Gold recently crossed the $400 an ounce level for
the first time since January. Platinum fell nearly $16 to $513.20 a
troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday.
   In London trading, gold rose to a late bid price of $412.50 a
troy ounce, up from $411.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to
$411.70 bid from $410.50 bid late Tuesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.16 to close at a bid $411.35.
   Silver fell 9.5 cents to $5.600 on the Commodity Exchange after
rising earlier in London to a late bid price of $5.65 a troy ounce,
up from $5.64 late Tuesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices rebounded Wednesday in
a technical reaction to Tuesday's selloff.
   Forecasts of continuing cold weather in the Northeast spurred
buying of wholesale home heating oil.
   Despite the rebound, the renewed buying in the energy futures
pits was restrained because traders still were downcast about the
new OPEC production agreement. The cartel's higher output ceiling
is expected to weigh on prices.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, made up less than half of Tuesday's
38-cent loss. It rose 15 cents to close at $19.40 per 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for delivery
in February through April finished with smaller gains.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
No.2 heating oil for December delivery rose 0.30 cent to 60.61
cents a gallon after falling 0.61 cent on Tuesday. The January
through March contracts ended with larger increases.
   Mary Haskins, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst, said
expectations of an extended cold snap on the East Coast and in
other parts of the country probably boosted heating oil demand
slightly. For much of the autumn, unusually mild temperatures
caused a buildup in heating oil stocks in the Northeast.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery finished 0.19
cent higher at 49.72 cents a gallon, erasing a small portion of
Tuesday's drop of 1.36 cents. Contracts for later delivery posted
larger gains.
   Energy market analysts said traders still were preoccupied with
the outcome of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
winter conference.
   At a meeting in Vienna, ministers from the cartel's 13 members
agreed to raise their self-imposed daily production limit to 22
million barrels for the first half of next year from the current
20.5 million barrels.
   Other than the OPEC developments, there was little news for
traders to act on. The energy markets had slumped Tuesday on word
of the OPEC agreement. The selling may have been overdone and
Wednesday's modest recovery was described by traders as a technical
correction.

   Interest rate jitters continued to pressure the
stock market Wednesday, pushing prices lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to
2,688.78.
   Losing issues outpaced gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 892 issues
down, 595 up and 484 unchanged.
   Trading activity was generally sluggish throughout the session.
Big Board volume totaled 147.27 million shares, down from 153.77
million in Tuesday's session.
   Bank stocks took the biggest hit, reflecting disappointment over
the recent mixed signals by the Federal Reserve as well as the
decision by Southwest Bank of St. Louis to raise its prime rate
back to 10.5 percent. The small Midwestern bank, which often leads
prime rate moves by bigger banks, had cut the rate to 10 percent
recently.
   ``This certainly doesn't bode well for the short-term,'' said
Jack Baker, head of block trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The Fed confused the financial markets by first letting key
short-term interest rates fall last week, which led analysts to
conclude that the central bank was easing credit to stimulate the
economy. But Monday, the Fed sent a strong signal that it wasn't
easing credit. Stock prices nonetheless had advanced in the
previous two sessions.
   The market came under pressure at the opening bell Wednesday
from profit-takers anxious to cash in on the recent gains. A
handful of blue-chip issues led a narrow rally by midday but the
broader market did not follow and the gains were quickly erased.
   Two separate reports that showed an upward revision in the Gross
National Product and lower corporate profits in the third quarter
were generally overlooked by investors.
   The government reported that the economy grew at an annual rate
of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5
percent previously forecast. And corporate profits fell 7.2 percent
in the July-September period, a second report showed.
   Some Wall Street analysts attributed the market's sluggishness
to a pause after the recent runup in stock prices. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading
sessions.
   ``We're looking for a year-end rally. But to make it
worthwhile...we need to work off the overbought conditions by
perhaps going lower,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, equities analyst
with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.40 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $17.871 billion, or
0.53 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.09 to 190.25.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Great Western
Financial fell 1[ to 18[, reflecting the news that it expects to
report a fourth-quarter loss due to difficulties with its
commercial real-estate loans.
   BankAmerica lost 1\ to 27|, Chemical Bank slipped { to 32[ and

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.62 to 392.67, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 2.17 to 343.60.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

   Philip Morris Cos. announced Wednesday it is
beginning a stock buyback program under which the food and tobacco
giant will repurchase $1.5 billion worth of its shares.
   Philip Morris stock closed at $41.87{, up 37{ cents a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday. At that price,
the company would repurchase more than 35.8 million or 2.4 percent
of its 928 million outstanding shares.
   The company said it would purchase the shares on the open market
from time to time. It did not set a deadline for completing the
buyback.
   Many corporations periodically announce share buyback plans,
often as a defensive precaution or as a method of raising the price
of their stock.

   Delta Air Lines has announced plans to raise
economy and first-class fares, while Pan Am Corp. said it would
increase the price of discount tickets.
   Pan Am said Tuesday it plans to raise its MaxSaver fares, the
most deeply discounted advance-purchase fares, by $10 to $20 round
trip starting Dec. 16. The MaxSavers would be increased by $10 on
flights of less than 1,000 miles and $20 on longer trips.
   ``I would think the other airlines would follow Pan Am because
we're seeing costs increase pretty sharply,'' said Edward J.
Starkman, an airline analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   ``It's going to be a carrier-by-carrier decision,'' he said.
``They're going to have to look at their advance bookings and
decide.''
   Passenger traffic normally begins increasing at this time of
year, a peak holiday travel season.
   Last week, in a bid to bolster sagging revenues, a number of
major carriers led by United Airlines said they plan to raise fares
on most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by
business travelers. The increases didn't apply to the popular
MaxSavers, however.
   Atlanta-based Delta, which announced its move Tuesday, is the
last major airline to follow United's lead. Under the change,
first-class, one-way fares will increase by $8, while full-fare and
some discounted coach prices will go up by $5.
   United decided Wednesday to postpone the fare hikes until Dec.
8, spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said. They originally were scheduled
to take effect Thursday. Other carriers, including American
Airlines, also said they were postponing the increases.

<HEAD>Insurance Regulators Open Hearings on Hoylake Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to sell Farmers Group Inc., the nation's
third-largest auto insurer, as part of a hostile takeover bid for
parent BAT Industries is questionable and should be rejected,
attorneys for Farmers told state insurance regulators Wednesday.
   But Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier whose
Hoylake Investment Ltd. is mounting the bid, dismissed the argument
as a desperate tactic in BAT management's ``no-holds-barred
takeover defense.''
   The Illinois Department of Insurance hearings that began
Wednesday are to determine the suitability of Hoylake to become
Farmers' parent through the proposed acquisition of BAT, the
London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services
concern.
   Goldsmith's $21.1 billion BAT takeover plan was suspended
earlier this year to allow Hoylake to seek approval from U.S. state
insurance commissioners to change Farmers' ownership.
   Hoylake has vowed to sell off all of BAT's non-tobacco holdings
under the buyout plan. Farmers would be sold to French insurer Axa
Midi Assurance for $4.5 billion.
   Los Angeles-based Farmers operates in Illinois and eight other
states. Illinois is the first to begin review of the takeover bid
to determine if it is in the best interest of insurance
policyholders.
   Goldsmith has attempted unsuccessfully to block the reviews,
arguing that state regulators have no constitutional right to pass
judgment on a foreign buyout.
   During Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for Hoylake argued that
the question of the company's suitability to own or operate an
insurance carrier is irrelevant because if the BAT takeover is
successful, Hoylake plans to simultaneously sell Farmers to Axa
Midi.
   ``Hoylake's consistent position is and has been that it has no
wish to own and operate an insurance company in the United States _
and Farmers in particular,'' Hoylake attorney Robert L. King said
in opening statements before Seymour Simon, the former state
supreme court justice serving as hearing officer.
   Hoylake has entered into ``irrevocable contracts ensuring that
Axa Midi will own and control'' Farmers, King said.
   ``Hoylake does not seek approval to own and operate Farmers,''
he said, but rather authority to ``act purely as a conduit'' in the
sale of the company to Axa Midi.
   But Farmers attorney Doug Broadwater questioned whether an
immediate sale was a certainty.
   Hoylake had already offered state insurance regulators three
possible plans for the sale, only to change them later.
   ``Every time Hoylake comes up with yet another possible scheme,
this department is assured that nothing could go wrong,''
Broadwater said, calling the takeover plan ``legally bizarre.''
   He also said Hoylake's financial position is precarious and that
it lacks the qualifications to run an insurance business.
   ``It is an offshore company engaged in no business other than to
acquire BAT,'' Broadwater said.
   Goldsmith said in a statement that Farmers' argument was an
attempt to divert attention away from the merits of acquisition of
the company by Axa Midi.
   ``The suggestion that there is any danger of Midi not completing
the acquisition of Farmers is ludicrous,'' he said.
   A hearing on the takeover plan before California regulators is
scheduled for January. Those in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington are expected later next year, a Goldsmith spokesman said.
   Hearings in Kansas, Ohio and Texas haven't been scheduled, he
said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Eastern Airlines Machinist union leaders
and striking workers could face federal civil contempt charges
stemming from an altercation between pickets and working employees,
according to an order issued Wednesday.
   A modification to a four-month-old temporary restraining order
calls for the 13 defendants to appear Dec. 12 in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York for a hearing on Sunday's disturbance in Atlanta.
   Seven strikers were arrested on charges of unlawful assembly
when they refused to leave Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport
after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a
working Eastern employee.
   On Monday, Atlanta Aviation Commisioner Calvin O. Carter ordered
the strikers to dismantle a tent city erected on airport grounds
shortly after the Machinists went on strike March 4. The strikers
have established a new compound near the airport.
   The show-cause order issued by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland cites ``willful defiance'' of a July 17 temporary
restraining order prohibiting the Atlanta pickets from threatening
or injuring Eastern workers.
   Lifland is overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
of the Miami-based airline, which filed for protection five days
after the strike began.
   Machinist union leaders, meanwhile, huddled in Washington to
assess the impact the defections of pilots and flight attendants
would have on their strike and pledged to continue their walkout
``however long it takes.''
   Machinists union President George Kourpias said the union would
try to pressure Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, and the
bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into a
settlement.
   The plans include demanding that Lifland remove himself from the
case. Kourpias and other Machinists leaders have accused Lifland of
bias in favor of Texas Air.
   The Machinists cited in the order could face fines and court
costs if found in contempt, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
They include Charles Bryan, head of the Eastern Machinists, and
Robert Taylor and Charles Pecca, Machinist officials based in
Atlanta.
   Lifland's order also requires that a special union telephone
message in Atlanta carry a statement from Local 1690 General
Chairman Bob Taylor condemning the Sunday incident and saying the
union ``does not condone these acts or are they part of the ...
strike strategy.''
   Anthony Chapman, vice president of the Atlanta Machinists'
local, said Wednesday he had not received the filing and declined
to comment.
   Defendants are expected to receive the order no later than
Friday.
   Matell noted that the temporary restraining order and the
show-cause order only affect Atlanta.
   In Miami, meanwhile, talks opened Wednesday between Eastern and
its flight attendants union, which joined pilots last week in
ending an 8{-month-old sympathy strike.
   Matell said the two-hour meeting produced no agreements, and the
flight attendants are scheduled to make a contract proposal Monday.
   Sandra Mickley, a spokeswoman for the Transport Workers Union,
declined to give details of the contract offer. The TWU represents
flight attendants at Eastern.
   She said topics raised at Wednesday's meeting included the
company policy for rehiring workers and the union's suit against
the airline seeking back union dues.
   Eastern currently has about 3,400 flight attendants. The union
represented about 6,000 workers at the beginning of the strike, but
it is unknown how many remain, said Ms. Mickley.
   National Mediation Board representative Sam Cognata held the
first negotiating session Tuesday between the Air Lines Pilots
Association and Eastern management, which began rebuilding without
its unions following the walkout.
   The airline has asked U.S. District Court in Miami to clarify
the rights of employees and those of strikers who wish to return to
work. Matell said no hearing date had been set on that request.

<HEAD>Boeing Engineers Call in Mediator, Machinists File Grievance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal mediator was called Wednesday into
contract talks between The Boeing Co. and its engineers, while the
machinists union that ended a strike only 10 days ago filed a
grievance against the aerospace giant.
   Negotiators for the second-largest union at Boeing, the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association, contacted a federal
mediator after receiving a ``disappointing'' money offer from
Boeing on Monday, union general counsel Dan Mahoney said Wednesday.
   ``Their view of an acceptable offer doesn't harmonize with
SPEEA's view,'' Mahoney said. ``This is always the way it is; you
never flat-out accept what they lay on the table. To expedite
whatever movement there might be, we thought it was wise to get the
mediator in there to talk to both parties.''
   Mediator Ben Youtsey started moving between company and union
negotiating teams Wednesday morning.
   Non-economic and some economic issues had been resolved, but a
number of money disagreements remained, including the ``entire wage
offer,'' Mahoney said. He declined to elaborate.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder also refused to discuss details of
the offer Wednesday.
   ``At this point in negotiations it's not uncommon for a mediator
to come in to assist in reaching a final agreement,'' Binder said.
   SPEEA executive director and chief negotiator Walt Baer said
Wednesday he hoped to conclude talks within the next few days and
mail an offer to members.
   SPEEA has two contracts under negotiation, covering a total of
about 27,800 workers. The contracts expire Friday, but have been
extended until new contracts are reached.
   Machinists, who comprise the largest union at Boeing, used
federal mediator Doug Hammond for much of their talks with Boeing
negotiators and Hammond proposed the compromise package finally
accepted by both sides, bringing the 48-day strike to an end on
Nov. 20.
   The machinists contract affects some 57,800 Boeing workers.
   But the machinists' union, District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
filed a grievance with Boeing Wednesday complaining the company
violated strike settlement and collective bargaining agreements by
reassigning 838 employees to lower-ranked and lower-paying posts as
they returned to work because of the strike.
   The union asks that each employee be returned to the work
location, shift, labor grade and job classification that he or she
held on the day of work prior to the strike, and that all employees
be compensated for any loss of benefits and wages.
   Binder acknowledged receipt of the grievance but said Boeing
maintains no employees ``received any reduction in pay or
anything.''
   He declined to discuss the issue further.
   The 27,800 engineers, scientists and technical aides covered
under SPEEA contracts at Boeing have never gone out on strike.
Ninety-five percent of them work in the Seattle area.
   SPEEA and Boeing negotiators have been meeting every week day
sinc Nov. 2, plus last weekend.
   SPEEA had asked for a salary adjustment of 35 percent over three
years, including 14 percent in the first six months. But Mahoney
said the union had made some reductions since presenting its first
proposal.
   Pay for Boeing engineers and scientists averages about $39,000
annually, while technical aides earn an average of $29,000.
   The machinists won annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent
and 3 percent, plus bonuses of 10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent,
and a cost-of-living adjustment equal to almost 100 percent of
inflation.

<HEAD>Joint Venture To Construct $2 Billion Petrochemical Plant in Siberia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Combustion Engineering Inc. said
Wednesday it has entered a joint venture with the Soviet Union and
a Finnish company to build a $2 billion petrochemical complex in
western Siberia.
   The complex in the town of Tobolsk will produce petrochemicals
such as propylene and polypropylene, using western Siberia's rich
supply of natural resources, the industrial services company said.
   The petrochemicals are to be used in consumer goods, as well as
products for the automotive and medical markets.
   The first three plants in the complex in Tobolsk, located 1,100
miles east of Moscow, are expected to be finished in 1993,
Combustion Engineering spokeswoman Karen Amour said.
   A second phase would add more plants that would produce
different chemicals, while the third phase calls for another
complex in the Soviet town of Surgut, 270 miles northeast of
Tobolsk.
   The joint venture is between Tobolsk Petrochemical, formed by
the Soviet department of chemicals and oil refineries, and a
consortium of Western companies led by Combustion Engineering and
Neste Corp. of Finland, a petrochemical company.
   Combustion Engineering is to manage the project and handle
foreign currency financing. Neste is to market the products
worldwide.
   Armour said Combustion Engineering and Neste have agreed to put
up a total of 15 percent of the seed capital, with the Soviets
contributing the rest.
   She said most of the project's $2 billion cost will be raised
through debt financing. Several banks are providing the credit,
including the First Bank of Chicago, Credit Lyonnais of France and
a Finnish bank.
   Plans for the second complex would be developed during the
second construction phase in Tobolsk, Amour said.
   Combustion Engineering also produces software programs as well
as instrumentation and control products used in the hydrocarbon
business under a 1987 joint Soviet venture. Armour said the venture
has been operating since early this year.
   Combustion Engineering, which had sales of $3.5 billion last
year, provides products and services used in the power and process
industries, including power plants, oil refineries and
waste-to-energy plants.

   Federal authorities probing trading abuses at the
city's commodity exchange reportedly have expanded the
investigation to include stock-index futures trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Separately, the Merc said it had expelled and fined $100,000 a
trader who previously pleaded guilty to federal charges.
   Six traders from the Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures
pit received subpoenas earlier this week to testify before a
federal grand jury regarding trades they made during the 1987
stock-market crash, The Wall Street Journal reported in Wednesday's
editions.
   The Chicago Sun-Times said at least seven S&amp;P 500 traders had
received subpoenas and two more were expected to be called before
the grand jury.
   The newspapers, both citing unidentified sources, said the
subpoenas represented a widening of an investigation that so far
has resulted in the indictments of 47 traders and one clerk at the
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas declined comment on the reports.
   Andrew Yemma, a Chicago Mercantile Exchange spokesman, said he
could not confirm the reports.
   ``We've always been aware that it is a continuing
investigation,'' Yemma said.
   Until this week, the investigation had been confined to traders
in the Merc's Japanese yen and Swiss Franc trading pits and in the
Chicago Board of Trade's soybean and U.S. Treasury Bond pits.
   In those cases, FBI agents worked undercover as traders for more
than two years to gather evidence of alleged cheating of customers
by brokers while executing their orders in the pits.
   In contrast, the new twist in the investigation reportedly
targets traders who already have been disciplined by the Merc for
alleged trading abuses during the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of
stocks, such as those represented by the S&amp;P 500 index, for a
specified price on a future date. Index futures are used variously
for hedging against losses in the stock market and for speculating
on the market's movements.
   The Merc's S&amp;P 500 pit is the world's largest and most active
stock-index futures market.
   Stock-index futures are frequently used in computerized program
strategies that some experts believe contributed to the Oct. 19,
1987, stock market crash and the market decline of last Oct. 13.
   In one such strategy known as index arbitrage, traders move huge
amounts of stock rapidly in attempts to profit from brief
discrepancies between prices of stocks and the index futures. Other
program trading strategies also have been blamed for contributing
to the severity of the market's downturns.
   However, the futures industry contends the index futures markets
provided a relief valve for selling during those steep market drops
and prevented the stock market from falling even further.
   In a statement, the Merc said it had expelled Brian Sledz, one
of the 21 traders of Japanese yen futures indicted on Aug. 2, and
fined him $100,000 for making pre-arranged trades with his brother
James in April 1987.
   The Merc said Brian Sledz ``participated in an ongoing pattern
of illegal transactions in which brokers deliberately converted
customer funds and market opportunities to their own use and the
use of others.''
   The Sledz brothers were among the first of the traders indicted
last August to reach plea agreements with federal prosecutors.
Brian Sledz has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one
count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act. James Sledz has
pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of
violating the Commodities Exchange Act.
   The Merc said the offenses for which it expelled Brian Sledz
were the same as the federal offenses to which he has pleaded
guilty.

<HEAD>Interior Department To Renew Controversial California Contracts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Interior Department announcement.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department said Wednesday it will
renew controversial long-term water contracts in central
California, assuring farmers will get the current volume of
irrigation water well into the next century.
   At the same time, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan directed a
formal environmental review of how the massive diversion of federal
water for irrigation affects the environment.
   But officials acknowleged the review will not hold up contract
renewals, nor affect the duration of the new water leases or the
amount of water supplied.
   Lujan did say the price of the water will more than quadruple,
and price and other terms could be affected by the review.
   Lujan said the leases would commit the government to supplying
current levels of water _ 1.5 million acre-feet, or 489 billion
gallons per year _ to scores of local irrigation districts in the
San Joaquin River Basin over the next 40 years. An acre-foot or
326,000 gallons is about what a family of five uses at home in a
year.
   The renewal of the California water contracts, one of the
thorniest water issues in the West, has developed into a major
environmental test for the Bush administration.
   The administration has been split on the issue with the
Environmental Protection Agency and the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, supported by environmental groups, arguing
that formal environmental reviews should be conducted before the
government commits itself to renewal.
   One lease, to the Orange Cove irrigation district came due last
April and was renewed amid strong criticism from environmentalists.
Several of the leases are expected to be up for renewal within
weeks.
   The Interior Department said the contracts when renewed would be
subject to ``adjustments'' based on the findings in the
environmental review. These adjustments could included changes in
water price, requirements for increased conservation and manner of
delivery.
   But Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein said the 40-year lease
duration and the quantity of water _ 1.5 million acre-feet a year _
would not be subject to change.
   Under the plan announced Wednesday, a formal study would be
initiated to determine the effect of the water diversion on
wildlife, water quality and natural resources. In additon, the
department's Fish and Wildlife Service will study the effect on
endangered species.
   At a news conference in Fresno, Calif., Rep. Charles Pashayan,
R-Calif., whose district is in the San Joaquin Valley, called the
decision ``a profound victory for farmers.''
   But Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the water, power
and offshore energy resources subcommittee of the House Interior
Committee, said Lujan's decision to renew the leases without
waiting for completion of the environmental studies amounted to ``a
case study in duplicity.''
   ``What value is an environmental study of the impact of water
diversion if the amount of water divered is non-negotiable?'' said
Miller.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, a long-time opponent of
the government's policy of selling water to some California farmers
for $8 an acre-foot when it costs eight to 10 times that much, said
in San Francisco it was pleased the department had decided to
require an environmental impact statement.
   ``But we take strong exception to Interior's decision not to
review the most important terms of the new contracts in its EIS,
namely the quantity of water to be diverted from the San Joaquin
River for agricultural purposes,'' consultant Karen Garrison said.
   She added that the group ``will continue to pursue an EIS on all
the terms.''
   In a lawsuit against the department filed by environmental
groups, a federal judge in Sacramento, Calif., has said any
contract renewals would be subject to provisons of his eventual
ruling.
   The long-term irrigation leases are expiring at a time when
California is struggling to develop new water distribution and
water quality protection plans. Disputes over water for decades
have pitted Northern Californians against those in the southern
part of the state, and city-dwellers against farmers.
   Critics also argue that the large water diversions at below-cost
prices have kept farmers from conserving water when growing urban
centers, willing to pay high prices for water, are having trouble
arranging future supplies.

   The application with the U.S. Department of Transportation is
part of Pan Am's expansion at Miami International Airport, where it

   The Miami-Madrid route presently is served only by foreign
carriers, said Armand Arel, Pan Am managing director in Miami.
   The application seeks daily non-stop service to begin May 1 with
Boeing 747 aircraft. Pan Am operated a Miami-Madrid route from 1978

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it is paying for the right to show 1,000 feature films
owned by Columbia Pictures Television Inc. on its two cable
stations.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   The film library, which includes a variety of movies dating from
1935 to 1983, would be shown on Turner Network Television and
SuperStation WTBS.
   ``This package contains just the right mix of action-oriented
films and popular comedies to support TBS' continued growth in the
1990s,'' said Bob Levi, a TBS executive vice president.
   The library is licensed for a two-year period that begins in
January and is subject to renewal.
   TNT and TBS will share rights to the titles, but company
officials said the majority of the films will air on TNT, Turner's
mostly-movie channel.
   Among the titles in the package are ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
``Tootsie,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Turner's film library already includes the pre-1986 MGM films,
pre-1950 Warner Brothers films and a number of RKO titles.

   Varity Corp.'s proposed $579 million acquisition
of K-H Corp., formerly Fruehauf Corp., was approved by K-H
stockholders Wednesday, the company said.
   The sale is the last stage in the dismantling of Fruehauf to pay
debt from a leveraged buyout arranged to fight off a 1986 takeover
attempt.
   K-H's main holding is Kelsey-Hayes Co., a producer of aluminum
wheels and anti-lock braking systems.
   Fruehauf changed its name to K-H on Aug. 4 after selling
maritime operations and the truck-trailer manufacturing business
that had been its mainstay. The trailer business continues as
Fruehauf Trailer Corp., a Terex Corp. subsidiary.
   K-H Corp. will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Varity,
formerly Massey-Ferguson, a Toronto-based maker of farm and
industrial machinery.
   The transaction could be completed Thursday or Friday, K-H
spokesman David Hladik said.
   Fruehauf borrowed $1.5 billion in 1986 in a restructuring
arranged in conjunction with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt by investor Asher Edelman.
   Weighed down with debt, the company ran into ill-timed reverses
in the truck trailer business, including increased competition and
a surge in materials costs, such as the price of aluminum, Hladik
said.
   ``We ended up selling off all our assets to pay off the debt,''
he said.
   Those included a fleet of 5,000 leased trailers, a financial
subsidiary and an aerospace unit.
   The trailer and maritime operations _ including two shipyards
and a heavy crane and cargo handling equipment division _ were sold
to Terex on July 14 for $232.5 million.
   ``The sale of the trailer operation was more or less the end of
Fruehauf,'' Hladik said.
   Varity agreed to acquire K-H for about $579 million. That
included $41.3 million in cash, the transfer of 37.8 million worth
of new Varity common shares to K-H stockholders, and assumption of
$436.8 million in K-H debt by Varity.
   K-H employs about 7,000 people. It has seven plants in Michigan,
three in Ohio, two in California, one each in Indiana, Kentucky and
Missouri and four in Canada, Hladik said.

   Toyota Motor Corp. said its U.S. auto plant on
Thursday began producing engines for the company's popular Camry
models, which in the future will be exported to Japan.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, said in a release Thursday
that annual production at Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. Inc. at
Georgetown, Ky., will be increased to 300,000 units in 1992.
   Toyota's Kentucky plant employs 3,000 workers and currently
produces 200,000 Camry sedans a year, the company said.
   A total of 40,000 right-hand-drive vehicles and 100,000 engines,
produced at the $1.1 billion plant, will be shipped to Japan
beginning in 1992, as previously planned, it said.
