   A transit bus collided head-on with a school
bus returning from a field trip Tuesday, injuring 16 adults and 33
first-graders, authorities said.
   In Centreville, Mich., a school bus carrying handicapped
students veered into a ditch in southwestern Michigan, critically
injuring two children.
   In Philadelphia, two women were hospitalized in critical
condition but only one child was seriously injured in the accident,
which occurred shortly after 2 p.m., authorities said.
   The vehicles collided after the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority bus strayed slightly over the center line,
police Sgt. John Bradley said. He said the bus may also have been
traveling too fast on the rain-slick street.
   Eight people, including the driver, were on the SEPTA bus and 44
people were on the school bus, Bradley said. He said he did not
know how many of the passengers were children.
   The first-graders from Resurrection of Our Lord School were
returning from a field trip to the Philadelphia Zoo when the
accident occurred, officials said.
   Zelma Finegan, 48, was in critical condition with head injuries
at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and Linda Girmsheild, 41,
was in critical condition with multiple injuries at Hahnemann
University Hospital, spokeswomen said.
   A child who suffered a broken leg was the only youngster
admitted to a hospital. The others were treated at hospitals and
released.
   The 29-year-old SEPTA driver, David Lewis, 29, was in stable
condition at Presbyterian Hospital.
   The driver of the school bus was in surgery Tuesday night, and
the other adults were treated at hospitals and released, officials
said.
   In the Michigan accident, the driver told police she looked away
from the road when a student loosened a seat belt. The bus swerved
across the center line, ran off the road and stopped in a ditch,
the St. Joseph County Sheriff's Department said.
   Students Jenny Ware, 17, and Christine Bathgate, 6, were
hospitalized in critical condition.
   The driver and 11 other students were treated and released,
Sheriff Matt Lori said.

   A private investigator hired by Hank
Williams Jr.'s manager says there is evidence to support the
singer's claim that someone slipped him drugs before a concert he
failed to complete.
   Williams performed a make-up concert Tuesday night before an
enthusiastic sell-out crowd of about 10,000 people in Baton Rouge,
La., where on May 6 he failed to finish a single song, cursed and
stumbled offstage after 20 minutes.
   At about the same point in Tuesday night's performance, he
interrupted the music to repeat his claims that someone else was at
fault.
   ``I don't carry bodyguards around, but I'm going to have to
after what happened here,'' Williams said.
   ``Mr. Williams' explanation may not seem believable to some;
however, in this case there is evidence that lends support to his
explanation,'' said a report by private investigator Bruce
Childers. The report was released Monday by Kathy Gangwisch, a
spokeswoman for Williams.
   The report by Childers said blood and urine tests taken four
days after the concert were positive for ``a foreign substance
available only by prescription and which Mr. Williams stated he did
not take or possess.''
   The substance was Valium, Ms. Gangwisch said. The report also
quotes witnesses not associated with the singer as saying Williams
underwent a drastic mood change in less than an hour after arriving
at his hotel.
   Two days after the concert, Kent Arwood, a publicist for
Williams, said the three-time Academy of Country Music Entertainer
of the Year told him someone slipped ``drugs or something'' into
his drink.
   Arwood said Williams told him he knew what it was like to be
drunk, and he wasn't drunk.
   Asked if the report couldn't simply mean that Williams had taken
Valium himself, Ms. Gangwisch said that ``could have been except
that he doesn't even take aspirin.''

<HEAD>Superconductivity Group Formed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major high-technology companies and a
leading research university announced Tuesday that they are forming
a consortium to develop commercial uses for superconductors.
   The consortium consists of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.,
International Business Machines, and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   Other companies, universities, and government institutions will
be invited to join the consortium, the three said.
   Superconductors are ceramic materials that are cooled to beyond
minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they can let
electricity pass through them without resistance.
   Both the United States and Japan are researching superconductors
and if they are developed, they could have a wide variety of
commercial applications.
   The United States now has an advantage in basic research on
superconductors. The consortium's goal is to make sure American
firms, rather than those from Japan, have the advantage in
commercial application of the research.
   ``This will be a consortium of open communication among the
researchers involved,'' the three organizations said in a joint
statement. ``The combining of their scientific knowledge and their
knowledge of applications will benefit the nation.''
   The new organization will be called the Consortium for
Superconducting Electronics. Researchers will remain at their
present locations but will share information.
   According to The Washington Post, the group was formed at the
advice of the White House Science Council, which said in January
that such an organization was needed if the United States wanted to
avoid what occurred in laser and videotape technology.
   Both were created in the United States but were commercially
exploited by Japan.
   The consortium announced that research efforts will be
concentrated in four areas, including signal distribution;
high-temperature materials and technology; advanced devices and
integrated circuits; and junctions.
   The consortium will focus on applying superconductor technology
to high-speed microelectronic devices for use in computers,
telecommunications and military systems, the New York Times
reported in Wednesday's editions.
   ``It is a model of how universities, government labs and
industry have to cooperate in the future to address a number of
issues,'' MIT Provost John Deutch told the Times.
   Ralph E. Gomory, IBM senior vice president for science and
technology, said the consortium would seek $4 million to $6 million
in financing from a Defense Department research agency, most of
which would go to MIT.
   IBM and AT&amp;T already have substantial programs in
superconductivity, the Times said.
   Robert C. Dynes, director of chemical physics research at AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories, told the Times that consortium organizers
thought having big organizations involved would give the group
weight to attract other members.
   ``I don't regard this as the big guys banding together and
wiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys an
ability to get in the same building as us,'' he said.

   Stauchly anti-communist South Korea
today opened a new library featuring 10,000 books, periodicals and
films on rival North Korea and other communist nations.
   The library, located in a downtown post office, includes 4,500
books and documents on communist ideology and 50 magazines and
daily newspapers such as Pravda from the Soviet Union. It also has
5,000 books and 300 films on communist North Korea, a spokesman
said.
   The National Unification Board said the library was opened to
meet a growing demand for information as a result of the increasing
contacts and trade relations between South Korea and communist
countries.
   South Korea has been strongly anti-communist since the division
of the Korean peninsula into the communist north and the capitalist
south at the end of World War II.
   The Seoul government has diplomatic relations with only one
communist nation, Hungary, but has encouraged trade contacts with
others as a means to ease tension on the peninsula.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted two men of
extortion, racketeering and fraud in a billion-dollar North Slope
construction boom in the early '80s, the longest criminal trial in
Alaskan history.
   Lewis Dischner and Carl Mathisen were convicted of using their
influential positions as advisers to former North Slope Borough
Mayor Eugene Brower to take in millions of dollars in kickbacks and
steer construction contracts to companies they secretly owned.
   Dischner, 71, and Mathisen, 56, listened impassively as U.S.
District Judge H. Russel Holland read the lengthy list of verdicts.
   Dischner was convicted on 21 counts of racketeering, extortion,
and wire and mail fraud, and acquitted on four income-tax charges.
Mathisen was convicted on 22 counts.
   ``We're obviously pleased,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan.
``We hope that it will change the way that business is done in
Alaska.''
   Dischner's attorney, Douglas Pope, lashed out at Spaan and the
team of state and federal prosecutors who handled the case,
accusing them of railroading his client.
   ``There are some ambitious prosecutors who saw an opportunity to
take Lew Dischner's scalp and make a career out of it,'' Pope said.
   Pope and Mathisen's lawyer, Laurence Finegold, said their
clients would appeal.
   The complicated trial lasted more than seven months, and the
11-member jury deliberated for more than three weeks. One juror was
dismissed after being injured in a horseback-riding accident.
   Holland rejected defense requests for a mistrial, saying federal
court rules allow 11-member juries under special circumstances.
   Prosecutors said the two men pocketed $21 million while Brower
was mayor from 1981 to 1984. They said $3 million came from their
salaries, $9 million from contracts with companies Dischner and
Mathisen owned and $9 million from a 10 percent fee assessed all
companies doing business with the borough.
   Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and Mathisen added $73
million to the cost of the borough's massive contruction program,
an attempt to provide 20th century amenities in the harsh arctic
environment.
   The government claimed Dischner and Mathisen manipulated Brower,
an Eskimo leader they characterized as naive. Brower testified for
the government as part of a plea bargain.
   He admitted lying to the grand jury to protect Dischner and
Mathisen, but said he had a change of heart when he learned the
extent of their secret financial interests. Brower was sentenced to
30 days in jail and fined $5,000 for tax evasion.
   Defense lawyers attributed the inflated cost of the borough's
capital construction to difficult working conditions, a rush to
finish the work and the Brower administration's desire to create
jobs.
   They admitted Dischner and Mathisen made money during Brower's
term, but insisted it was legitimate.
   Government witnesses told of lavish gifts showered on Brower and
other borough officials to cement Dischner and Mathisen's influence.
   Clothes, gambling junkets, boats, guns, sporting goods,
expensive home-remodeling projects, cars and a flashy $45,000
diamond ring were among the currency of corruption, prosecutors and
government witnesses said.
   But defense attorneys said the gifts were misinterpeted because
of profound cultural differences. They said Dischner and Mathisen
were godfathers to Brower's children, and that in the Inupiat
society, sharing is fundamental.
   Spaan said there will be a forfeiture trial to determine what,
if any, assets Dischner and Mathisen will have to surrender to the
government. No date has been set for that trial.
   The two men will be sentenced in August or September, Holland
said.
   Dischner once was one of the state's most powerful lobbyists. He
was labor commissioner under the late Gov. Bill Egan, and a
longtime labor and Democratic Party activist.
   Mathisen has North Slope ties dating back to the early 1970s.
   Others were snared with Dischner, Mathisen and Brower.
   Former Public Works Director Irving Igtanloc pleaded guilty to
tax evasion in return for his testimony. Three engineers and
architects implicated in the investigation are scheduled to go on
trial later this year.
   The trial also triggered an ethics investigation into the
activities of Democratic state Sen. Al Adams, who was chairman of
the House Finance Committee with control over state spending in the
borough during the early 1980s.
   The murder trial of John Kenneth Peel in state court last year,
which lasted six months, was the longest previous criminal trial.

   Popular Gov. Thomas H. Kean ended nearly a
year of speculation Monday and said he will not endorse a candidate
in the heated Republican primary to succeed him.
   The GOP governor said in a statement that he had watched the
candidates in three televised debates, and felt any of the four
leading contenders would make a good competitor in the fall general
election and a good governor.
   Kean, who by law cannot seek a third consecutive term, urged
voters to ``concentrate on what the candidates are saying, the
positions they are adopting, and the solutions they are proposing.''
   With most polls showing up to half of the Republican primary
voters undecided, an endorsement by Kean was widely considered to
be a key weapon in swaying voters at the polls June 6.
   Some campaigns have said Kean's backing could help deliver up to
30,000 votes, a significant boost for an election in which some
believe as few as 100,000 votes may be enough to secure the
nomination.
   Kean spokesman Carl Golden said the governor weighed the
candidacies of former Attorney General Cary Edwards, Rep. James
Courter, Sen. William Gormley and Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick.
Polls show the four men have a significant lead over a fifth
candidate, Sen. Gerald Cardinale, who has said he did not want the
backing of the moderate governor.
   An endorsement would have been a tough decision for Kean because
all four men have close ties to the governor.
   Courter ran Kean's 1981 and 1985 campaigns, and Edwards has been
a top adviser. Gormley has been a loyal point man in the Senate and
Hardwick helped push many Kean initiatives through the Assembly
before breaking with the governor over several issues in the past
year.
   The decision was greeted happily by the Hardwick campaign, which
was considered the least likely to get Kean's endorsement.
   The other campaigns all said they would have welcomed an
endorsement, but have not planned strategy around the governor's
backing.
   Three other candidates also are seeking the GOP nomination, but
are considered longshots by observers.

   A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered for a
Maryland woman who said she crashed her car through the gate at
Camp David because Iranians told her to kill Vice President Dan
Quayle, authorities said Monday.
   Mary Louise Tasler, 48, was arrested and hospitalized after the
incident the evening of May 10 at the presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains. No guests were at Camp David at the time.
   According to court papers filed in U.S. District Court here, Ms.
Tasler told authorities, ``My Iranian friends, they are forcing me
to do it, to kill the vice president.''
   Investigators said Ms. Tasler, who lives within blocks of Camp
David, had been dating an Iraqi diplomat for at least a month.
   She was charged with knowingly and willfully threatening the
life of the vice president, which carries a maximum penalty on
conviction of five years in prison and a $1,000 fine, said Joe
Coppola, the chief Secret Service agent in Baltimore.
   She was driving a 1987 Pontiac Fiero with temporary Maryland
license plates when it crashed into the heavily reinforced gate.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said the car sustained heavy
damage, but did not go through the gate.
   Ms. Tasler was taken to a Hagerstown hospital for treatment of
head and possible internal injuries, Cooper said. She was
transferred to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in
Baltimore.
   Ms. Tasler appeared Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Catherine C.
Blake, who ordered her to undergo a psychiatric examination to
determine whether she is competent to stand trial.
   Ms. Tasler was taken to a medical center at the Federal
Correctional Institution in Lexington, Ky. Coppola said he expected
Ms. Tasler to be at the hospital for at least a month.

   Prince Philip has started a trust that
will fund the first authorized English translations of the Koran
and other holy books.
   The $7 million trust also will finance translations of the
Eastern Orthodox Christian Bible and of texts of the Baha'i faith,
Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism and the oral
traditions of Australian Aborigines, the Yanamamo of South America
and the Japanese Shinto faith, trust organizers said Monday.
   The translation of the Koran, authorized by the Moslem World
League and religious leaders in Mecca, is especially significant
because most Islamic authorities believe that Arabic alone is the
language of revelation.
   Previous English translations often have been poor and have
differed widely because of the difficulty of interpreting classical
Arabic.
   Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and husband of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II, said the new International Sacred Literature Trust
would seek out the highest religious authorities of each faith and
ask them to designate an approved translator for each text to
ensure accuracy. A second expert would ensure the text's literary
grace and integrity before publication.
   The trust is being financed largely with $5 million from a Saudi
Arabian philanthropist, Mohammed Said Abdul Jawad, a former Saudi
envoy to New York, London and Somalia.

   Oprah Winfrey brought her talk show to a
community known locally as ``cancer alley'' to raise national
consciousness on the health hazards of pollution.
   The syndicated TV show was filmed Monday at the civic center in
Iberville Parish, an area of many chemical plants on the
Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
   The main topic was the miscarriage rate around the region, and
the audience included parents of cancer victims, women with a
history of miscarriages and representatives of chemical companies.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta are
conducting a study of the area's miscarriage rate to determine if
chemicals are responsible. Some previous studies have indicated
high smoking and drinking rates may share the blame for Louisiana's
high cancer rates.
   Pharmacist Kay Gaudet, who began raising alarms a few years ago
after her sister and other women suffered miscarriages, told the
audience she wanted to be assured by industry that chemicals have
not caused one miscarriage.
   She said 63 women in her community had 75 miscarriages from 1983
to 1985.

   Adrienne Brown, 39, pleaded guilty Monday to one count of
possession. Augusta police found two vials of PCP in her possession
after she arrived at Bush Field airport a year ago.
   District Attorney Michael C. Eubanks said his office will ask
for an unspecified fine at Mrs. Brown's June 21 sentencing and
request that she undergo drug and alcohol tests.
   When she was arrested, Mrs. Brown said she had been set up by a
friend of her husband. Police said they were acting on a tip in
searching her.
   Last week, Mrs. Brown's South Carolina driver's license was
suspended for six months and she was fined $600 for a Jan. 23
drunken driving conviction.
   Her 56-year-old husband is serving a six-year sentence at the
State Park Correctional Center near Columbia, S.C., for fleeing
police and trying to run over two officers during a car chase on
Sept. 24.
   Brown will be eligible for parole in May 1991.

   Women who took birth control pills while
teen-agers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of
breast cancer before they reach menopause, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Sweden, is one of several recent
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of
breast cancer
   While describing their findings as ``alarming,'' the researchers
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since
their introduction, and newer pills may not heighten the risk of
breast cancer.
   The research, directed by Dr. Hakan Olsson and colleagues from
University Hospital in Lund, was presented Monday at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   At the meeting, an Italian specialist described a new approach
to treating breast cancer that he said could virtually eliminate
the need for mastectomies, which have been the standard approach to
the disease for nearly a century.
   Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among American women
and strikes one in 10.
   Olsson's study was conducted in southern Sweden, where the pill
was widely used by teen-age girls after its introduction in the
1960s.
   He said that the incidence of breast cancer among women under
age 40 has risen in Sweden since the advent of the pil. And while
his study cannot conclusively blame the pill, ``we have no other
explanation for the increase of breast cancer in young women.''
   However, even if pill use during the 1960s has increased the
chances of breast cancer, the risk is still relatively small among
women before they reach menopause. Olsson said that the overall
chance of breast cancer before menopause is about 1 percent, while
the risk among early pill users is about 5 percent.
   The increased risk appears to be limited to those who began
taking the pill while young. The research found no increased breast
cancer among women who started on the pill after age 25 or after
their first full-term pregnancy.
   Olsson said 10 studies since 1983 have reported links between
the pill and breast cancer.
   Dr. Jules Harris, director of Rush Cancer in Chicago, said the
Swedish study ``strongly suggests that birth control pills are
linked to early, pre-menopausal breast cancer.''
   Despite the mounting research evidence, however, some experts
have been skeptical. In January, a panel convened by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration concluded that the reported links between
the pill and breast cancer were still inconclusive.
   Doctors also point out that the pill's potential dangers must be
balanced against its benefits. For instance, the pill appears to
substantially reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus and ovaries.
   Olsson's study was based on a comparison of 174 breast cancer
patients with 454 healthy women. Besides showing that teen-age pill
users were five times more likely to get breast cancer, the study
found that their tumors were larger and their outlook worse than in
those who had not used the pill so early in life.
   In a report on changes in treating breast cancer, Dr. Gianni
Bonadonna of the National Cancer Institute in Italy described his
initial results in 97 patients with a new approach to avoiding
mastectomy.
   Although doctors are increasingly removing just the cancerous
lump when the tumor is small, total removal of the breast remains
the standard therapy for larger tumors.
   Bonadonna and colleagues are experimenting with giving
chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the lumps. Then surgeons are
able to take out just the tumor and leave the rest of the breast.
   This approach worked in 87 percent of women with large tumors
who otherwise would have needed mastectomies.
   Bonadonna acknowledged that his approach is likely to be
controversial, and more followup will be needed. Many doctors
believe that mastectomy still gives women the best chance of
avoiding recurring cancer later in life, even if their tumors are
relatively small.

<HEAD>Chinese, Soviet Reforms Produce Different Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In China, the shelves are full of consumer
goods but the streets are filled with political dissent. In the
Soviet Union, the shelves are mostly empty, but much of the
political griping remains confined to meeting halls.
   The contrast is unlikely to have been lost on Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev during his just-completed visit to China, say
U.S. experts on the two communist giants.
   ``I imagine that Gorbachev is saying that his way is not such a
bad idea,'' says Ed Hewett, an expert on the Soviet economy at the
Brookings Institution in Washington.
   ``His reforms have allowed the society to let off some steam,''
Hewett said. Thus Gorbachev can tell conservatives that the Soviet
Union needs political reforms to avoid cataclysmic unrest, and he
can tell radicals that ``if ou go too fast, if you take off all the
controls, you can lose it all.''
   The unreformed Soviet economy is in shambles, but Gorbachev
still has a firm grip on power. It is hard to say the same for
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Deng began economic reforms a decade ago by gradually
introducing a pluralistic economy, in which major enterprises are
run by the state but farmers, small manufacturers and cooperatives
set their own production rates. Political reforms have been modest,
but real economic growth has been a phenomenal 10 percent.
   Gorbachev, by contrast, found that entrenched Communist Party
officials blocked his early efforts at economic reform. His
solution was glasnost, or greater openness, allowing the media to
uncover corruption and waste in the bureaucracy.
   Although he has consolidated power, Gorbachev has balked at the
two critical elements of the Chinese economic reform,
decollectivizing agriculture and eliminating the artificial
subsidized price system.
   ``On the Chinese side, the economic accomplishments were
considerable in the first 10 years. But part of the reason for the
student discontent is that problems arise, inflation, corruption
and things of that kind,'' said A. Doak Barnett, China scholar at
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington.
   The inflation rate in China after price reform has been about 30
percent, said Kenneth Liberthal, director of Chinese studies at the
University of Michigan.
   Deng, unlike Gorbachev, took power when his country was in
crisis, after the turmoil of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that
severely weakened the Chinese equivalent of the apparatchiks that
blocked Soviet economic reforms, said Liberthal.
   ``The apparatchiks had been clobbered,'' said Liberthal. ``Deng
went at the economic restructuring with a vengeance. So the Chinese
economic reform has gone far beyond what the Soviets have done.''
   The dilemma shared by reformers in Moscow and Beijing is the
fate of the Communist Party _ when it loosens its grip on politics,
as in the Soviet Union, or on the economy, as in China.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger credits Deng with
starting ``a pluralistic economic system. And the political
consequences were inevitable. They came too fast for his own
reputation in history, for the stability of his country.''
   Soviet conservatives ``might draw the conclusion that if
liberalization goes beyond a certain point, the party loses
control. And in fact, it is inherent in the economic reform that
the party must lose control. Because if the party no longer runs
the economy, what other function does it have? They become
supernumeraries,'' Kissinger said on ABC-TV Sunday.
   Gorbachev ostensibly is trying to transfer some power from the
Communist Party to parliamentary structures, such as the Congress
of Peoples' Deputies, scheduled to meet for the first time this
week.
   But it is by no means clear how much power will go to the
government, which in Russia has been a poor relative of the mighty
Communist Party, said Dmitri Simes, a Soviet emigre at the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace in Washington.
   ``There is a great deal of experimentation going on'' under
Gorbachev, Simes told a congressional panel last week. ``It not as
though he knows exactly what he wants to do.''
   The role of the party in China has also been changing because
reforms have weakened its control over economic decision-making,
because there have been some political reforms, and because of
negative feelings built up during the Cultural Revolution.
   ``In fact, there has been very considerable liberalization in
China,'' said Barnett. ``The students are asking the leaders to
move ahead with reforms that they have already committed themselves
to.
   ``You could not have had this mass demonstration in China if
there had not been a loosening up. It is true that the leadership
in China has been more cautious about political change, and has
tried to do it incrementally. But these things do develop a
momentum.''

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Urges Court To Allow Seabrook Atomic Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's energy chief is urging a federal
appeals court to permit nuclear testing at the Seabrook, N.H.,
plant, warning that the power is desperately needed for a region
that could be battered by brownouts this summer.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins filed an affidavit with the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here Monday supporting the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's plan to issue a low-power operating license
to Seabrook, the subject of intense battles between pro- and
anti-nuclear forces for more than a decade.
   ``New England urgently needs the power that Seabrook is ready to
provide, and there are no satisfactory near-term alternative
sources of supply,'' said the retired Navy admiral in entering the
latest battle in the 20-year war over Seabrook. ``Any unnecessary
delay in bringing this plant on-line would be, quite simply, bad
energy policy and flatly inconsistent with the public interest.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, Attorney General James
Shannon and other Seabrook opponents are asking the court for an
emergency order blocking the license until a full appeal can be
heard.
   Last week, the NRC said the license could be issued Thursday
afternoon in the absence of a court order. It was not known when
the court would rule.
   Seabrook critics say the coastal area around the southern New
Hampshire reactor cannot be evacuated quickly. They also charge
that Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the plant's principal
owner, is financially unsound to run the plant. Public Service
filed for federal bankruptcy protection last year.
   Watkins, in his seven-page affidavit, did not address safety and
financial concerns but instead stressed regional power needs and
national energy security.
   Without Seabrook, the region could fall below the 20 percent
surplus energy standard later this year, even if it experiences
only moderate growth in demand, Watkins warned.
   ``During the past year, in fact, New England suffered repeated
`brownouts' and rolling `blackouts,' and similar emergency
procedures will probably again become necessary as soon as this
summer,'' the energy secretary said.
   Watkins has taken an unusually high profile in arguing for both
the Seabrook plant and the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island.
   ``An unreliable electricity supply system can inhibit regional
economic growth and diminish the quality of life of our citizens,''
Watkins said. ``For New England, the danger of falling below the
point where adequate electric service can be assured is both real
and immediate.''
   Watkins said Seabrook, already a decade behind schedule, could
receive its full-power commercial license by Sept. 30.
   Opponents, however, say regulatory and court challenges will put
off a final decision on commercial operation for years. The fight
over the low-power license has taken three years.
   Watkins said there is no ``economically sound alternative'' to
Seabrook. Coal-fired plants are strongly opposed by
environmentalists and would take at least five years to build, he
said. New natural gas pipelines could not be ready until the
mid-1990s and conservation efforts cannot keep up with the region's
rapid economic growth, Watkins added.

   A District of Columbia Superior Court judge is
trying to decide whether sending a juvenile back to Alabama to face
a possible death sentence would violate the district's ban on
capital punishment.
   Judge Stephen F. Eilperin has promised a ruling today on
Alabama's bid to extradite the 17-year-old, identified only by the
initials O.M. The youth is charged with arson and murder in the May
1988 firebombing of a Gadsden, Ala., apartment that killed
14-month-old Tamel Jackson.
   Regardless of how he rules, Eilperin has promised to stay his
order until next week to give the losing side a chance to challenge
the decision before the D.C. Court of Appeals.
   The youth's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued at a hearing Monday
that the district must apply legislation passed by the City Council
outlawing the death penalty to the interstate agreement governing
juvenile extraditions.
   But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the district
government, said the council's ban on capital punishment did not
change the city's obligation to enforce the interstate agreement.
   Eilperin said a ``major problem'' with the defense argument was
that O.M. is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried as
a juvenile. And if Alabama decides to try the boy as an adult,
Eilperin said, he would be obligated under the Constitution to
approve the extradition, regardless of the ban on capital
punishment.
   But Fisher said Alabama authorities cannot certify O.M. for
trial as an adult, which would subject him to a possible death
sentence, unless he first is returned to the state.
   O.M. has been fighting extradition since he was arrested by
district authorities in December. His uncle, Yul Devoe Guice, 31,
was arrested by Alabama authorities soon after the bombing and
charged with murder and arson.
   The boy's grandmother, Alice Guice Thomas, testified at a
hearing last month that O.M., who is black, cannot get a fair trial
from the white authorities of Etowah County, Ala., because the
county's law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendetta
against her family.
   But Alper argued that the fairness of the Alabama judicial
system was not at issue in the case. He said district officials
``would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabama
attempted to pass judgment on our system of justice.''
   Alper also contended that if the district refused to enforce the
interstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this case, the
nation's capital would quickly turn into ``a haven for fleeing
fugitives.''

<HEAD>Crops and Livestock Prices Rise Higher Than Anticipated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for crops and livestock have edged
higher than Agriculture Department analysts expected and may boost
farmers' cash income prospects for 1989 by at least $2 billion from
the forecast of just a month ago.
   Greg Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service said
figures for the fourth quarter of 1988 showed that cash receipts
for sales of major commodities produced on the nation's farms
``were stronger than forecast'' initially and that the momentum
continued into the first quarter of 1989.
   ``Our crop receipts are projected to set an all-time record in
1989,'' Hanson said Monday in an interview. ``There has been price
strength in both crops and livestock.''
   The latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock at
around $81 billion, with sales of crops at $76 billion. But
expenses are rising, too, as farmers put more cropland back into
production and direct federal payments to farmers decline.
   Nationally, including all farm-related cash receipts, the gross
cash income of farmers could be in the range of $168 billion to
$173 billion, compared with about $170 billion in 1988. Expenses
are forecast at $115 billion to $119 billion, compared with $113
billion last year.
   As a result, Hanson said, farmers this year could see net cash
income in the range of $50 billion to $55 billion. That would be
down from the 1988 record of $57.7 billion.
   Just a month ago, the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at
$48 billion to $52 billion.
   Net cash income is the annual difference between gross cash
income and cash operating expenses. As defined by the agency, it is
the amount of money farmers have available to pay debts, make
purchases and pay for family living expenses.
   Net cash income during a calendar year can include proceeds from
sales of crops produced in earlier years.
   In another method of bookkeeping, the agency computes net farm
income as a measure of the net value of agricultural production
during the calendar year, whether sold or stored on the farm.
   Under this method, changes in inventory values are taken into
consideration, along with values assigned to ``non-money'' income
such as an allowance for a farm family's dwelling and other factors.
   According to USDA's latest projections for 1989, net farm income
could rebound to record levels of $47 billion to $52 billion. Last
year, when inventories were drawn down sharply, net farm income was
about $41 billion, down from $46.3 billion in 1987.
   Hanson's comments followed an outlook report Friday in which
analysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are ``not much
changed'' from earlier forecasts, except that the weather has
shifted the distributions.
   ``Wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with large
carry-in stocks (inventories) will have higher incomes because
prices are up,'' the report said. ``But wheat producers who were
hit by the dry weather this winter and spring, and who lack stocks
or crop insurance, will sustain losses.''
   Some other observations in the report:
   _Higher beef production and lower prices are expected through
July. Record numbers of cattle entered feedlots in the first
quarter of this year. Fewer replacement heifers may be held for
herd expansion, reflecting dry pasture conditions, especially in
some Great Plains states.
   _The Federal Reserve's tightening of the U.S. money supply has
cooled the underlying inflation rate, so further tightness seems
unlikely. This points to falling interest rates and a real economic
growth rate in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year. This
adds up to an economic environment that ``should mildly support''
agriculture.
   _An agency economic study suggests consumers would pay $3
billion to $5 billion more annually in the short run for tomatoes,
potatoes and tobacco if soil fumigants are banned, a possibility
being considered by the Environmental Protection Agency.

   The Agriculture Department is instituting new
procedures to tighten the testing and detention of ready-to-eat
meat and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by the
bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said Monday the new policy will take effect as
soon as the revised testing procedures are ready, in about six
weeks.
   Crawford said that on April 14, the Centers for Disease Control
``confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the United
States caused by meat or poultry.'' The case involved a nationwide
recall of turkey franks made by Plantation Foods Inc., of Waco,
Texas.
   Under the Listeria monitoring program, the agency will increase
the number of samples tested each year. Other procedures are being
put into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reach
consumers until the problem has been corrected, he said.
   The bacteria have the potential to cause serious illness,
particularly among those with weakened immune systems such as
infants, pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill.
   However, Crawford said, healthy persons are ``essentially at
little risk'' from the disease, which can cause flu-like symptoms,
including fever, chills, headache and sometimes abdominal pain and
diarrhea.

<HEAD>White House Wary as Japan and West German Unrest Push Dollar Upward</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political unrest in Japan and West Germany
presents a dilemma for the Bush administration not only in the
diplomatic arena but also in its battle against a bulging dollar.
   The White House on Monday took the unusual step of issuing a
statement encouraging intervention by central government banks to
drive down the dollar's value abroad.
   The step was taken in conjunction with a sell-off of dollars by
the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and several European central
banks.
   The decision to issue a statement was propelled by
administration fears that too high a rise in the dollar against
other major currencies will erase hard-won recent improvements in
the U.S. trade deficit.
   The deficit, aided by record export sales, fell dramatically to
$8.86 billion in March, a 9.8 percent drop from February's
imbalance of $9.82 billion, according to the Commerce Department.
The drop continued a downward trend in the trade deficit that
started early last year.
   As the dollar goes higher against other major currencies,
imported goods become less expensive here and prices of U.S.
products go up abroad, aggravating the trade deficit.
   Despite the selling of dollars by central banks, the dollar has
continued to climb, surging to more than 2 West German marks and to
140 Japanese yen, the upper limits of trading ranges unofficially
set by the seven major industrial nations.
   A reason for the dollar's unrestrained climb is that political
problems faced by ruling administrations in both Japan and West
Germany are undermining trader confidence in the yen and the mark,
enhancing the attractiveness of the dollar.
   In Japan, the announcement by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
that he would resign to take responsibility in the payoff scandal
that has rocked Japan is causing investor unrest, analysts said.
The governing party's search for a successor has been complicated
by the scandal's links to most of its senior members.
   And in West Germany, the current dispute over nuclear
disarmament is causing problems for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Although his advocacy of early U.S.-Soviet talks on eliminating
NATO's short-range nuclear missiles is posing a problem for the
United States in the upcoming NATO summit, Kohl is under even more
political pressure at home to take a stronger stand against the
missiles.
   ``Financial markets are getting nervous that Kohl is going to
lose the election. And in Japan, we still don't know who the new
prime minister will be,'' said David Wyss, chief financial
economist for Data Resources Inc.
   ``This makes people holding onto yen or marks very nervous, so
they buy dollars. And the interest rate on dollars
(dollar-denominated investments and securities) is still very high
compared to those in Germany and Japan,'' Wyss continued.
   Monday's White House statement by deputy press secretary Roman
Popadiuk said the climbing dollar ``is a matter of concern'' that
``has also prompted questioning of the administration's commitment
to the process of economic policy coordination'' among the Group of
Seven major industrial democracies.
   They are the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada. The seven have agreed to take steps to
coordinate their economic policies _ including interest rate
changes and direct intervention on exchange markets _ to keep major
currencies stable.
   ``This administration remains fully committed to this process,''
the White House statement continued.
   ``If the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies is
sustained for a prolonged period, or extended, it could undermine
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances,'' the
statement said.
   Since the White House usually does not make such comments, the
statement appeared to be designed largely for its psychological
impact on traders, analysts suggested.
   ``The dollar is getting out of hand, so they (the government)
had to do something. But they're going to have to back it up with
action, to spend billions to move dollars around,'' said Michael K.
Evans, who heads a private Washington-based economic consulting
firm.
   Despite the White House plea and repeated central-bank selling,
however, the dollar surged anew on Monday, hitting a new 2{-year
high against the mark and a 1{-year high against the yen.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in an
interview in Monday's editions of the Milwaukee Journal that world
unrest was a major factor in the dollar's rise because it was
perceived as a safe investment haven.
   ``You have a million Chinese rioting in the streets,'' he said.
``You have NATO in an unsettled state of affairs. You have, in
Japan, lack of clear definition of leadership really for the first
time since the second World War. So it doesn't surprise me that
people pause for a moment and want to put their money in a country
where the people have settled their leadership question,'' Brady
said.

<HEAD>A Case of Antagonism Between Light- and Dark-Skinned Blacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Friction between light- and dark-skinned blacks
underlies an unusual federal lawsuit in which a black woman says
she lost her job because of her light complexion.
   Tracy Lynn Morrow said she sued to get her Internal Revenue
Service job back and to fight prejudice within her race.
   ``If there is this problem within our black society, then I
think we have to correct it,'' Ms. Morrow said Monday. ``That would
make us stronger, too. I feel it would help us as a race.''
   Earlier this month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss
the case, ruling Ms. Morrow could claim job discrimination if she
could prove her supervisor, also black, harassed and ultimately
fired her over skin tone.
   Ms. Morrow, who turns 27 on Wednesday, was fired as a
clerk-typist in March 1986. Last July, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission allowed her to sue.
   Ms. Morrow contends her supervisor, Ruby Lewis, harassed her
soon after Ms. Lewis was promoted in 1985.
   ``She tortured me mentally,'' Ms. Morrow said. ``I heard it said
that the only reason I got the job was because I had light skin.''
   Ms. Lewis replied in court documents that Ms. Morrow was fired
because of incompetence and job attitude, not skin color. The
Associated Press was unable to locate Ms. Lewis on Monday for
further comment.
   ``Since hues of skin have never been a consideration with me,
and I never even thought about it until Tracy presented it as an
issue in this case, it's impossible for me to have discriminated
against her on that basis,'' Ms. Lewis said in court documents.
   No trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Ms. Lewis, the
IRS and the U.S. Treasury secretary.
   It apparently is the first case of its kind in the United
States, said Norman Harris, director of the Department of
African-American Studies at the University of Georgia. But
discrimination within black society based on skin shade is not new.
   ``There are black folks who would want to look as much like
Europeans as possible,'' Harris said, because lighter skin in the
past has brought social advantages in white-dominated society.
   That attitude has sparked resentment. Black historian and
sociologist W.E.B. DuBois wrote about the ``double consciousness''
of the lighter-skinned black person. Other black authors have
written about the ``tragic mulatto,'' Harris said.
   ``This was a person who was not fully African or American, who
was confused about identity,'' Harris said. ``It's usually somebody
who doesn't recognize the heritage of the black community.''
   Lighter-skinned blacks often received preferential treatment
from slaveowners, and a greater percentage of free blacks before
the Civil War were fair-complexioned, said John M. Mathews, a
Georgia State University history professor specializing in black
studies.
   The division continued after emancipation, Mathews said, with
lighter blacks finding it easier to get jobs and gain entree into
other levels of society.
   ``They had a bit more cachet,'' Mathews said. ``It was a
distinction that black people often made among themselves.''
   In the 1987 movie ``School Daze,'' filmmaker Spike Lee
satirically portrayed a campus rivalry between lighter-skinned
blacks who try to enter white-dominated society by taking on white
traits, and darker blacks who view them with disdain.
   Ms. Morrow's case has stirred debate among Atlanta's blacks
about whether variations in skin tone still trigger any racial
prejudice and resentment.
   Radio station WVEE-FM held a call-in show Monday on the case.
Producer Nate Quick said calls ran about 2-to-1 against Ms. Morrow,
with most callers saying racial prejudice between blacks is not
widespread.
   ``Most people said this was an isolated thing,'' Quick said.
``But there were some who said they'd run into the same kind of
thing in their jobs.''
   Ms. Morrow said she expects some criticism from blacks concerned
about the image projected by the case.
   She added, ``We have come a long way since we were treated like
animals, and we have to stick together as a race.''

<HEAD>Bush Weighs Advice on New Trade Law's `Hit List'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is weighing conflicting advice
on how to implement the new trade law's controversial mandate that
the administration issue a hit list of nations that have erected
the most harmful barriers against U.S. products.
   Bush attended a session of the cabinet-level Economic Policy
Council on Monday to hear arguments from both sides but gave no
indication which way he would decide, according to one participant.
   Under the 1,000-page rewrite of the trade law passed by Congress
last year, the administration must issue by May 28 a list of
nations judged to have erected the most flagrant trade barriers
against U.S. products.
   The administration then has 18 months to negotiate the removal
of the barriers. If unsuccessful, it can retaliate by levying
tariffs up to 100 percent against imports from an offending
country, effectively doubling the price of those goods.
   An administration source, who spoke on the condition that his
name not be used, said that Bush would settle the matter before he
left Friday for a trip to the 40th anniversary meeting of the NATO
alliance.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said after
Monday's meeting that Bush had not made up his mind.
   One option reportedly under consideration would be to narrowly
target certain trade practices in Japan, India and Brazil rather
than pursue a longer list of trading abuses.
   The specific practices reportedly under consideration include
Japan's refusal to buy American-made satellites and supercomputers
and its restrictions on U.S. lumber imports, Brazil's
import-licensing practices, and India's restrictions on foreign
investment and foreign insurance companies.
   By targeting particular trading practices but not listing the
offending countries by name, the administration would blunt the
sting of the hit list, which has come under heavy attack by foreign
governments.
   The provision, which reflects congressional frustration over the
huge trade deficits America has run up in recent years, has deeply
split the administration.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills have said that failure to name several
countries, including Japan, to the hit list runs the risk of a
protectionist backlash in Congress.
   But Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, and
Budget Director Richard Darman have countered that targeting Japan,
America's closest ally in the Pacific, would harm broader U.S.
interests.
   Boskin earlier this month warned that U.S. efforts to retaliate
against its trading partners could spark a trade war and lead to a
worldwide recession.
   Hills recently told reporters that in the last month she has
seen a parade of trade officials seek to make concessions in an
effort to stay off the so-called Super 301 list.
   Because of such concessions, it's considered likely that South
Korea, Taiwan and the European Community will not be named to the
list.
   South Korea has moved aggressively to reduce the number of
outstanding trade disputes with the United States, agreeing just
last week to remove several barriers to American products.
   On Friday, Hills and Frans Andriessen, her counterpart with the
12-nation European Community, announced that the two sides had
agreed to follow procedures established by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in resolving U.S. complaints about European
subsidies for oilseed and a European complaint involving U.S. sugar
quotas.
   The announcement was seen as an effort to ease trade tensions
between the United States and the EC. But Andriessen also warned
Hills that the Europeans would challenge the new trade law before
GATT if Washington put the community on the upcoming trade hit list.
   That possibility could put the United States in the embarrassing
position of having an international tribunal declare the key
section of the new trade law in violation of global trading rules.
   GATT, a global trade charter signed by 96 nations, serves as the
international trade agency that tries to resolve trade disputes.

<HEAD>Federal Researchers Inject First Patient With Genetically-Altered
Gene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists searching for new ways to battle
cancer have for the first time injected genetically altered cells
into a human.
   The lead researcher in the federally approved experiment
launched early Monday at National Institutes of Health, Dr. Steven
A. Rosenberg, said a milky-colored fluid containing cells that were
genetically manipulated using a mouse virus was intravenously
administered to a cancer patient.
   NIH officials would identify the patient who underwent the
30-minute procedure only as a male suffering from malignant
melanoma, the extremely virulent disease also known as black mole
cancer.
   ``Today was the first ever,'' said Rosenberg. ``It is the first
time that a new gene has been introduced into a human.''
   A federal court suit settled last Tuesday cleared the way for
the experiment. The Foundation on Economic Trends and its
president, Jeremy Rifkin, had sued earlier this year to block the
research, claiming the experiments had been approved by the NIH
without proper public hearings.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit after the NIH, located in
suburban Bethesda, Md., agreed that a committee that evaluates
human gene research will hold all its deliberations and votes in
open public hearings.
   Rosenberg, a National Cancer Institute researcher, and his
collaborators Dr. R. Michael Blaese, also of NCI, and Dr. W. French
Anderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, are using
a mouse virus to study a cancer-treating technique that uses white
blood cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs.
   The researchers earlier had removed TIL cells from a patient's
tumor and spurred them to multiply by bathing them in the growth
factor interleukin-2, or IL-2. The cells and the IL-2 were then
injected back into the patient, where scientists believe they
attack the cancer directly and exclusively.
   Earlier research showed the technique suppressed tumor growth in
12 of 20 patients tested, Rosenberg reported.
   The researchers want to determine why the therapy worked in some
patients but not in others. To do this, they mark the TIL cells
with a bacterial gene that can be easily identified, enabling the
researchers to track their distribution and effectiveness.
   The scientists mark the TIL cells by using a mouse leukemia
retrovirus that could change the genetic pattern of the TIL cells.
A bacterial gene that is resistant to neomycin, an antibiotic, is
introduced into the mouse virus. The virus, in turn, is exposed to
the TIL cells and transfers into those cells the bacterial gene.
   The resulting ``soup,'' a milky-white fluid, is then injected
into the patient. By tracking the distribution of the
neomycin-resistant gene, the researchers can determine where the
TIL cells go in the body and how long they live.
   Rosenberg said the mouse virus has been crippled so it cannot
reproduce, and the virus dies after completing the gene transfer.
   ``Three or four'' tests were to be run within 24 hours and many
more over the course of several weeks on the patient who received
the first gene-altered cells, Rosenberg said.
   A second patient will receive the cells later this week and ``in
the incubator right now, we have cells for another half dozen
patients,'' Rosenberg said.
   Under the approved research plan, up to 10 patients will receive
genetically-altered cells.
   Rosenberg said the agreement specifies that all the patients
must be terminally ill with malignant melanoma and expected to live
only about 90 days. The patients, who will not be identified, are
all volunteers and have given written consent for the tests after
being fully informed of the procedure, the NIH said.
   Rosenberg said the ultimate goal of the experiments is to
develop genetically-altered cells that would be more effective in
battling cancer. The technique may eventually be applied to a
variety of tumors, he said.
   ``We're trying to develop more effective cancer treatment, and
this is just a tool to help us do that,'' he said. ``We're working
in the lab to develop other genes that will make the cells more
effective as anti-cancer agents.''
   Rosenberg said other researchers are closely following the
experiments in hopes of finding ways that genetically-altered cells
could be use to combat other diseases.

<HEAD>Lebanon's Seat Remains Empty As Summit Gets Under Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League convenes a summit
meeting today marking the return of Egypt to the councils of the
Arab world, and for the first time in league history Lebanon's seat
is vacant.
   The reinstatement of Egypt to league membership following a
10-year suspension was accepted reluctantly by Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi, who held out to the last moment to try to prevent it.
   An uneasy compromise on Lebanon, on the other hand, resulted in
the temporary suspension of Lebanon's league membership.
   Morocco's King Hassan II hugged President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
upon Mubarak's arrival in Casablanca on Monday and a 21-gun salute
boomed.
   Egypt had been excluded since 1979 for signing the Camp David
peace treaty with Israel. Most Arab nations warmly welcomed Egypt's
return to the 22-member League.
   ``Egypt has never ceased ... to serve the causes of our nation,
whether on the Palestinian front or in connection with the bloody
war which raged for eight long years between Iran and Iraq,'' said
Arab League Secretary-General Chadli Klibi.
   It was only after days of frantic mediation efforts by Syria,
Algeria and Tunisia that Gadhafi agreed to attend the Casablanca
summit. For a week prior to the meeting, he maintained that it
would be a waste of time because it could handle no urgent Arab
problems at the moment.
   A last-moment mini-summit of four nations in Tripoli, and later
in Oran, in western Algeria, apparently convinced Gadhafi that it
was better to attend reluctantly than be isolated in the Arab world.
   The Libyan news agency JANA announced his attendance without
explanation. JANA quoted the leaders of the four countries _ Libya,
Algeria, Syria and Tunisia _ as saying they agreed to ``confront
any concessions'' at the summit to the enemies of the Palestinian
people.
   The summit was called to offer support to the PLO in its
campaign for acceptance in the Arab-Israeli peace process and to
discuss ways to stop Lebanon's civil war.
   But delegates said privately that Gadhafi was, in fact, correct:
No urgent need for an Arab summit existed other than to arrange the
ceremonial re-entry of Egypt into the Arab family.
   At a preparatory meeting, foreign ministers failed to make
progress on the Palestinian problem and the division of Lebanon
under two rival administrations.
   Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization were at
loggerheads over PLO peace moves, and Iraq was outspoken in defense
of Lebanese Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Because of its inability to solve the Lebanese crisis, a
ministerial preparatory committee came up with the unprecedented
solution of leaving Lebanon's seat empty for now.
   The committee felt that allowing both Aoun and his Moslem rival,
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, to take the Lebanese seat jointly
would perpetuate the division of Lebanon, conference sources said.
   It decided that neither would be admitted as a delegate, but
both would be present in Casablanca. The final decision on who
represents Lebanon was left to Hassan.
   The PLO presented to the committee a document expressing concern
about the more than $600 million in Arab funds it was promised to
keep the 17-month-old uprising going. The PLO claims barely 10
percent has been paid.

<HEAD>Tanker Skipper Indicted on Felony Charges; Cleanup Worker Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has added three felony
counts to the criminal charges facing the former skipper of the
Exxon Valdez.
   Meanwhile, a worker was killed Monday aboard a ship housing
workers involved in the cleanup of the massive oil spill caused by
the wreck of the tanker.
   In Anchorage, Joseph Hazelwood was charged with three counts of
second-degree criminal mischief, District Attorney Dwayne McConnell
said.
   The indictment accuses him of reckless actions before the
987-foot tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef. If convicted of all
three, Hazelwood could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and
fined $150,000, McConnell said.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., was charged in Valdez in
late March with three misdemeanors: operating a boat while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent pollution.
   McConnell said the state will ask to have all the charges
consolidated into a single trial. Hazelwood is free on $50,000 bail
on the misdemeanor charges pending a June 20 trial. No date has
been set for his arraignment on the felony charges in Superior
Court.
   Hazelwood's blood alcohol content was illegally high nearly 11
hours after the accident, the Coast Guard said. He had turned over
control of the tanker to the third mate, who was not certified to
pilot the ship in Prince William Sound.
   Several crew members said at last week's National Transportation
Safety Board hearings in Anchorage that they drank with Hazelwood
before the ship left the Valdez terminal for the trans-Alaska
pipeline. Others testified they smelled alcohol on his breath, but
said he didn't seem to be impaired.
   On Monday, a food worker aboard one of the vessels housing
cleanup workers in Prince William Sound was crushed by a freight
elevator aboard the Coastal Star, a headquarters ship anchored
about 55 miles southwest of Valdez, Coast Guard Chief Mark Kennedy
said.
   The victim's identity was being withheld until relatives could
be notified.
   Exxon has several thousand workers cleaning beaches in the sound
and along the southern Alaska coast, most of them housed on ships
like the Coastal Star. Exxon has leased more than 600 vessels for
the cleanup.
   Meanwhile, Exxon and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announced
a special rehabilitation center will be opened in Anchorage for
bald eagles and other flesh-eating birds as the toll of wildlife
continues to mount.
   At least 43 birds of prey are among the more than 17,000 birds
confirmed dead as the result of the March 24 spill of nearly 11
million gallons of oil by the tanker.
   Exxon said it was giving an Anchorage veterinarian $100,000 for
the bird facility. The oil company said James Scott will be
assisted by Pat Redig, director of the raptor center at the
University of Minnesota.
   Exxon said last week it already had spent nearly $100 million
trying to clean up the oil that has stained Alaska's southern
coastline. The state Department of Environmental Conservation said
it has inventoried more than 700 miles of contaminated beach.
   The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the company which operates the
tanker terminal in Valdez and is responsible for initial spill
response, said the first of four tanker escort vessels has arrived.
   Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said the Liberty Service and three
other vessels on their way from Seattle will carry containment
booms and other equipment to deal with spills.
   Alyeska was criticized harshly after the Exxon Valdez spill
because its response vessel didn't reach the scene until nearly 11
hours after the tanker ran aground.
   Scientists plan to attack the spill by stimulating natural
bacteria to break down poisonous components, the first such
large-scale experimental attack, The New York Times reported in
today's editions.
   Scientists plan to apply powdered fertilizer to about 1,500 feet
of beach on Naked Island to stimulate bacteria, the Times said,
quoting U.S. Environmental Protection Administration officials.
   The experiment will not involve recombinant or selectively bred
organisms, and will rely wholly on common microbes alreadly present
in Alaskan waters, the newspaper said.

   The government says it will halve the number of
Nepalese Gurkhas serving in the British army before the 1997
transfer of Hong Kong to China. Most of them serve as guards in the
British colony.
   The Gurkhas have fought alongside British troops since 1815,
including during the two world wars and the 1982 Falklands war with
Argentina, said Defense Secretary George Younger.
   He announced in the House of Commons on Monday that a
``progressive restructuring'' of the Gurkhas' five infantry
battalions will begin in 1992, reducing their number to 4,000
soldiers.
   Britain first encountered the Gurkhas when they fought British
attempts to establish trade routes from India to Tibet. Armed with
13{-inch Kukri fighting knives, their primary skill is jungle
warfare but they have evolved into a key ``fast reaction'' force
for the army.
   They have proved a vital source of funds for Nepal, one of the
world's poorest nations. In some years, as many as 80,000
applicants have sought only 225 places.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today rejected
criticism leveled by Secretary of State James A. Baker III of
Israel's policy of continuing to support new Jewish settlements in
the occupied lands.
   ``Now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, the
unrealistic vision of a greater Israel,'' Baker said in a speech in
Washington on Monday.
   Shamir, interviewed by Israel radio, said, ``I don't know how
anyone could speak at all of a large Israel. Israel is a very small
country and all of us know that its territory is very limited. It
really rings ironic to speak of Israel as big.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens also dismissed Baker's call on
Israel to halt Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and give up aspirations of annexing the territories.
   ``These are our dreams. We are speaking about our country and we
have proven that we fulfill our dreams,'' Arens said on the radio,
interviewed from Brussels.
   Shamir, who was on a visit to London, said of his disagreement
with Baker over Jewish settlements in the territories: ``It is
clear there are differences of opinion between us and that isn't
new. I don't see any link between settlements and the subject of
the peace process.''
   He added that he had explained his views on the settlements
``fully and explicitly'' when he visited Washington last month.
   Israel has built more than 130 settlements in the occupied
territories since capturing them in the 1967 Middle East War.
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc considers these lands to be integral
parts of historic Israel.
   About 70,000 Jews live in the settlements, which are scattered
among Arab towns, villages and refugee camps whose population
totals 1.7 million.
   The United States has long criticized Jewish settlement building
in these territories as an obstacle to peace. But Baker's comments
in a speech to an American Jewish lobby group on Monday were seen
as one of the sharpest American statements on the issue.
   Baker urged Israel to ``foreswear annexation. Stop settlement
activity. Allow schools to reopen,'' referring to Palestinian
schools shut by Israel in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a
crackdown on a 17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
rule.
   Israeli newspapers headlined Baker's criticism of Israel, giving
little attention to his calls to Palestinians to be more
conciliatory toward Israel and to abandon ``the illusion of control
over all of Palestine.''
   The Haaretz daily quoted unnamed diplomats in Washington as
saying they found Baker's speech to be ``very disappointing from
Israel's standpoint.'' The newspaper also said the speech was one
of the ``worst'' for Israel made by an American leader in the last
decade.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reactivation of Egypt's membership in
the Arab League seals President Hosni Mubarak's success in
returning to the fold without significant concessions.
   Few Egyptians, however, expect it to signal a return to the
heady days of the 1960s, when the magnetism of Gamal Abdel Nasser
put Egypt alone in the forefront of the Arab world.
   Magazine editor Makram Mohammed Ahmed, a Mubarak confidant,
said, ``Mubarak's Egypt has managed, with patience and perseverance
and consideration for Arab interests, to return to the Arab fabric.
   ``I don't think that Mubarak's Egypt wants a repeat of the role
(Egypt) played in the 1960s. The direction has changed.''
   All Arab League members except Libya approved of inviting Egypt
to the emergency summit today and Wednesday in Casablanca, Morocco.
   Even the Libyans did not directly attack Cairo's invitation but
professed to see no need for a summit. Syria, previously almost as
virulently anti-Egypt as Libya, welcomed the move.
   The summit was called to offer support to the Palestine
Liberation Organization in its campaign for acceptance in the
Arab-Israeli peace process and to discuss ways to stop Lebanon's
civil war.
   The Arab League suspended Egypt in 1979 to retaliate for the
peace treaty President Anwar Sadat signed that year with Israel.
All Arab states except Sudan, Somalia and Oman broke diplomatic
ties.
   Almost nine years later, in November 1987, with Iraq under
pressure from Iran in their long war, the league allowed its
members to resume ties with Egypt. All did except Libya, Syria and
Syria's client, Lebanon.
   Despite the realization at that summit that Egypt's strong
military was vital to counter threats from non-Arab Iran, the
league gave in to Syrian objections and did not reinstate Cairo.
   Its membership in the league reactivated, Egypt will achieve an
important victory _ ending 10 years' ostracism without touching
what still is the Arab world's only peace treaty with Israel.
   Until 1987, scrapping the treaty was an Arab condition for
restoring normalcy with the country that traditionally has served
as a political and military anchor for the Arabs.
   Despite Syria's apparent decision to ignore that condition, it
professes to expect Egypt to join Arab ranks against Israel. An
official statement said Damascus ``approves the return of Egypt to
its natural place in the (Arab) struggle,'' adding that Syria's
President Hafez Assad ``is aware that President Mubarak is not
Anwar Sadat.''
   If Mubarak is not Sadat, neither is he Nasser, Egypt's
charismatic president who called the first Arab League summit in
Cairo in January 1964 and inspired among Arab leaders a strong
sense of unity and identity.
   In the late 1950s, Nasser merged Egypt with Syria and, for a
while, North Yemen in a strongly anti-Western, pro-Moscow union
that dissolved in 1961. He sided with a new republican regime in
Iraq in 1961 and four years later sent 50,000 troops to help Yemeni
rebels overthrow their king.
   That move cost Egypt millions of dollars and the support of
Saudi Arabia, allied to Yemen's royal family. Military experts said
it also so weakened Egypt's military that Israel scored a stunning
victory in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shunning such impulsive acts, Mubarak used careful, calculated
decision-making to shepherd Egypt back into the Arab fold.
   Mubarak has said repeatedly that the Arabs have learned to look
for mutual interest and economic welfare rather than emotional
rhetoric to deal with their friends. He said that is the attitude
that led to formation of a four-nation Arab Cooperation Council
with Jordan, Iraq and Yemen this year.
   ``Union cannot be achieved in an emotional venture by a
charismatic leader, or by a pioneering state, but ... by organized
work over a long time, based on the reality of differences and of
economic interests,'' Ahmed wrote in his column in last Thursday's
edition of his magazine Al-Mussawar.
   ``The power balance has changed. Egypt is not the greatest and
richest anymore. Egypt cannot assume the role or the responsibility
for the (Arab) community ... as in the '60s, because this has
exhausted it and created many problems.''
   Such talk would have been anathema to Nasser and is anathema to
Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, a devout follower of Nasser's ideas of one
borderless Arab nation from the Euphrates to the Atlantic.
   Since he took power in a 1969 coup that ended Libya's monarchy,
Gadhafi has been trying to merge his country with others in the
Arab world. The genesis of his quarrel with Egypt was Sadat's
rejection of a unity move in 1972.
   After Egypt disclosed that Mubarak would attend the Casablanca
summit, Libyan media announced a flurry of contacts between Tripoli
and the other Arab governments evidently designed to head off the
invitation or, failing that, the summit itself.
   No indication emerged that the others paid any attention.

changed by their manufacturers, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission says.
   ``The Spinning Bee,'' a toy top made by Artsana of America,
contains a small toy bee with four rubber feet that could cause
small children to choke, the CPSC said Monday.
   About 100,000 of the toys were sold and purchasers are asked to
remove the four rubber feet and send them to Arsana of America, 200
Fifth Avenue, Room 910, New York, NY 10010. Purchasers will receive
a $3 gift certificate.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is recalling 325 ``Smurf'' and ``Snoopy''
ceiling fans because a defective mounting bracket could cause the
fans to fall, the CPSC said.
   Sears said there have been three incidents of the fans falling,
although no one was injured. Consumers who return the fan to Sears
stores will receive a full refund of the $129.99 price, the company
said.

<NOTE>EPA Understates Smog Problem, Environmentalist Group Says</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group says the Environmental
Protection Agency routinely understates the severity of the smog
problem in urban areas because it relies on too few monitoring
devices.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said Monday that in many
large American cities unhealthy levels of smog are twice as
frequent during the hot summer months as EPA estimates would
indicate.
   Last March the EPA released 1988 air pollution figures that
showed ozone pollution, which is a chief component of urban smog,
as being the worst in a decade and ``clearly the most pervasive air
pollution problem'' the country faces.
   The agency indicated nearly 100 areas of the country have
unhealthy levels of ozone pollution during at least some periods of
the summer.
   Nevertheless, according to the environmental group, those EPA
statistics reflect only a fraction of the ozone pollution problem.
   The environmental group said the EPA estimates of days in which
there are unhealthy levels of smog in an area are often based on
smog readings from a single monitor.
   ``This approach seriously underestimates the extent of the smog
problem in most large urban areas,'' said David Hawkins, an
attorney for the environmental group and a former assistant
administrator at the EPA.

   One of the nation's most profitable savings
and loans has lost a bid to switch its insurance coverage from the
fund that backs thrifts to the more healthy one that insures bank
deposits.
   The application by Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
was denied Monday by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which
rejected the institution's claim that it was exempt from a
temporary ban on defections from the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp.
   Great Western, the nation's second-largest FSLIC-insured
institution, had filed an application claiming it was eligible to
convert from coverage by FSLIC to insurance with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The application was seen as a test case on whether regulators
would allow widescale defections from the FSLIC, although several
smaller S&amp;Ls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts'
insurance fund.
   The FDIC is considered the more attractive insurance fund
because it retains big assets while the FSLIC has been largely
depleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry.
   Legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leaving
FSLIC until Aug. 10, 1988, and Congress has since extended the
moratorium until Aug. 10, 1989.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says Decree Allows Criticism of Officials, Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People whose criticism of officials or government
agencies amounts to the unpleasant truth cannot be jailed for
speaking out, the Supreme Court has ruled in limiting the scope of
a widely assailed new decree.
   The decree, enacted April 8, bans discrediting officials and
government bodie. Reformers and human rights activists have
condemned it as being open to abuse.
   ``Well-founded, argumentative criticism of the action and
decisions of these organs and officials by citizens, acting
publicly in the framework of socialist law, cannot be viewed as a
criminally punishable act,'' the court said on Monday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is seeking to strengthen the role
of law in Soviet society, and Monday's ruling constitutes one of
the rare times the court has acted to ensure a controversial law is
applied consistently.
   The official Tass news agency said that since the leadership of
the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, passed the decree citizens have
been arrested under differing interpretations of the law.
   The Supreme Court told lower courts the decree touches only
``intentional public distribution of slanderous inventions'' that
undermines faith in officials.
   It said the decree does not apply to ``dispatches in the press
and any other form of information reflecting insufficiencies in the
activity of these organs, social organizations and officials.''
   The ruling represents an effort to protect officials from
insults and slander, and protect the rights of individuals to
express their views, the court said.
   Tass did not say how many criminal cases have been filed on the
basis of the new law or give any details of cases.
   Critics of the law include human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov and Alvydas Juozaidis, a spokesman for Lithuania's
grass-roots Sajudis group, who have called the decree ``pure
Stalinism.''
   Some opponents have called on the Congress of People's Deputies,
the country's new legislative body that meets for the first time on
Thursday, to overturn the law.
   Soviet officials have said the decree is more specific and less
subject to abuse than Articles 70 and 190 of the criminal code,
which for years have banned ``anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda'' and ``anti-Soviet slander.''
   Dissidents were imprisoned under those laws for years. Last
year, however, the Soviet Union said it intended to overhaul the
laws and hundreds of people arrested under them have been released.
   But reformers and dissidents reacted angrily to the new decree,
claiming its provision against discrediting officials was worse
than the previous laws.
   The decree also bans public calls to overthrow the government,
and ``premeditated'' acts aimed at inciting national or racial
animosity.
   Also Monday, the Supreme Court continued its rehabilitation of
Soviets who were convicted of anti-Soviet activity from the 1930s
through the 1960s.
   The actions are seen as an effort to right the legal abuses of
the past.
   Those rehabiliated Monday included former middle-level officials
who were accused under Josef Stalin of being German spies or taking
part in a conspiracy to kill the popular Leningrad party chief
Sergei Kirov in 1934.
   A Latvian poet, K.E. Skueniek, who was convicted in 1962 of
anti-Soviet agitation, also was cleared.

   The Bush administration is gradually
prescribing a Middle East settlement that excludes Israeli control
over the occupied West Bank and Gaza, telling Israel to ``forswear
annexation.''
   In a speech Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III also
demanded an end to further settlement of Jews on the land taken by
Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967.
   The speech followed statements by President Bush last month
ruling out Israeli sovereignty over the territories.
   Baker mixed in demands that the Arabs accept Israel, end their
economic boycott of the Jewish state and repudiate the 1975 U.N.
General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.
   Baker called for ``full recognition of Israel as a neighbor and
partner in trade and human contact.''
   He also advised the Palestinians to abandon the ``illusion'' of
controlling all of Palestine. Baker's reference was to Israeli
territory apart from the West Bank and Gaza.
   The West Bank and Gaza, which Jordan and Egypt lost to Israel in
the Six-Day War, are predominantly Arab. But since Israel took
control Jews have been establishing settlements there.
   Baker urged Israel to ``stop settlement activity,'' which
apparently would rule out expanding current Jewish settlements as
well as starting new ones. And his demand to ``forswear
annexation'' would rule out incorporating any of the territory into
Israel.
   ``The United States does not support annexation or permanent
Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza, nor do we support the
creation of an independent Palestinian state,'' Baker said.
   The speech was delivered to the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, a private research and lobbying group, just before Baker
met at the State Department with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
   Rabin said his meeting with Baker concentrated on trying to
implement Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for elections to
select Palestinian leaders to negotiate self-rule on the West Bank
and in Gaza.
   Today, Shamir rejected Baker's criticism of Israel's policy of
continuing to support new Jewish settlements in the occupied lands,
including Baker's statement that ``Now is the time to lay aside,
once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''
   Shamir, interviewed by Israel radio, said, ``I don't know how
anyone could speak at all of a large Israel. Israel is a very small
country and all of us know that its territory is very limited. It
really rings ironic to speak of Israel as big.''
   Shamir, who was on a visit to London, said, ``It is clear there
are differences of opinion between us and that isn't new. I don't
see any link between settlements and the subject of the peace
process.''
   Rabin said he had not read Baker's speech. But later, he told
Israeli reporters he wished Baker had directed more of the speech
to the Palestinians.
   Today, Rabin meets with members of Congress and attends a dinner
at Blair House hosted by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He sees
Bush on Wednesday.
   Baker's approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict is different from
past U.S. administrations in that he has not put forward a U.S.
plan for negotiations or settlement.
   Instead, Baker has given lukewarm support to Shamir's proposal
for elections to be followed by negotiations on an overall
settlement.
   ``Neither the United States nor any other party, inside or
outside, can or will dictate an outcome,'' he said.
   However, Baker added: ``We do have an idea about the reasonable
middle ground to which a settlement should be directed.'' And he
went on to state the administration's position on several
controversial issues.
   ``Now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, the
unrealistic vision of a greater Israel,'' he said.
   Baker also called for the reopening of schools in the occupied
territories. Shamir said later that schools were open in Gaza.
   An American Jewish leader, Seymour D. Reich, said that in his
judgment Israel would have few problems taking Baker's advice.
   ``Annexation of the territories is nowhere in Israel's present
plans, so far as I understand,'' said Reich, chairman of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   And, Reich said in a statement: ``Israel would be more than
eager and follow Mr. Baker's suggestion to open the schools
provided they are used as educational institutions and not as a
staging area for the intefadeh (uprising).''
   At the same time, Reich said Baker deserved praise for calling
on the Palestinians to abandon violence and to reach out to Israel.

<HEAD>Libyan Leader Says Two-State Palestinian Solution Impossible</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Arab Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, said in an
interview on French television that a Palestinian state and an
Israeli state could never co-exist in the Middle East.
   ``We recognize only one Palestinian state on Palestinian land,''
Gadhafi told the interviewer for France's TF1 network on Monday.
``One Palestinian state in Palestine. The Palestinians, whether
they are Arabs or Jews, constitute a Palestinian state.''
   Asked if co-existence was impossible, he responded:
``Impossible, and even the Israelis know that it is impossible.''
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat has opted for a two-state solution in
the Middle East and staked out the West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip for the Palestinians.
   At the last session of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
legislative branch, the organization recognized Israel and
renounced terrorism. That position was stated more firmly by Arafat
later.
   Israel continues to refuse to talk to the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist organization.
   During a visit to Paris, Arafat tried to remove another obstacle
to talking with Israel by declaring the PLO charter, which calls
for eliminating Israel, ``outdated.''
   Gadhafi was asked about Arafat's statement on the charter.
   ``It is simply a way to expose the Israelis, because the
Israelis will never accord the Palestinian people their rights,
even if they (the Israelis) get all of the concessions possible,
and Arafat only wanted to unmask the Israelis in the eyes of the
world.
   ``When the Arabs were in Andalusia (Spain) nearly 800 years ago,
we accepted no concessions and we didn't leave Andalusia until
defeated. It's the same thing.''
   Asked if he still was trying to undermine the West, Gadhafi
said: ``Only undermine imperialism and colonialism and struggle
against expansionism.''
   The Libyan leader said he condemned terrorism, ``but do not mix
up terrorism and the sacred struggle for liberty.''

<UNK>Report: Record 8.43 Million Japanese Traveled Abroad Last Year</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 8.43 million Japanese traveled abroad last
year, up 23 percent from 1987, the government said in a report
released today.
   The Prime Minister's Office also said a record 2.36 million
foreigners visited Japan, surpassing the previous record 2.33
million posted in 1985.
   The rise in the number of Japanese travelers was attributed to
the ``continuing trend of making overseas trips ... thanks to the
yen's appreciation'' against the dollar, said Noboru Kawana of the
Prime Minister's Office.
   The yen's appreciation since late 1985 has given the Japanese
more spending power abroad.
   Hawaii remained the most popular destination for Japanese
travelers, with 1.17 million visiting there. Hong Kong was next
with 1.24 million Japanese visitors, followed by South Korea with
1.11 million and Taiwan with 920,000.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
65.90 points Monday, shed 251.25 points, or 0.74 percent, to end
trading at 33,816.61.
   The dollar closed at 141.95 yen, up 1.50 yen from the previous
day's 140.45-yen finish. The currency started higher at 142.05 yen
and moved between 141.82 yen and 143.03 yen.
   The dollar, which opened sharply higher in Tokyo following a
similar upswing on overseas markets, was still bullish despite the
Bank of Japan's dollar-selling intervention, traders said.
   ``Even though a discount-rate hike is expected, it might not be
enough to make the yen attractive, unless the hike is far more than
0.5 percent,'' said an analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The central bank is expected to raise the official discount rate
by at least 0.5 percent from the current 2.5 percent. But the bank
has made no official announcement.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said early
Tuesday that a decision on the discount rate could be based on
upcoming end-of-the month price data.
   He said, however, the dollar's current strength still does not
warrant a statement by Group-of-Seven nations at this time.
   ``It's not that kind of movement,'' he said.
   He also said that currency rates are only one factor in
formulating Japan's monetary policy, indirectly denying speculation
that the Bank of Japan would raise its discount rate solely on
foreign exchange considerations.
   Citing the White House's statement that the dollar's rise
against the yen is ``a matter of concern to the U.S.,'' Murayama
said the Bush administration is opposed to the stronger dollar but
noted that market movements are difficult to control.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the plunge was largely due
to the yen's sharp drop against the dollar.
   Kenji Ishizuka, a dealer with Daiwa Securities said share
prices, which were lower across the board, fell further following a
news report that the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry reached
an agreement to raise the official discount rate soon.
   ``It's been quite difficult for investors to determine the
direction of trading because of uncertainties over the exchange
rates,'' he said.
   The majority of market players remained cautious, trying to
watch the currency market movements, Ishizuka added.
   Higher interest rates usually discourage stock investment.

<TEXT>
   Gay rights advocates hailed a unanimous
vote by the city's Board of Supervisors to adopt a domestic
partnership law recognizing the unions of homosexuals and unmarried
heterosexual couples.
   The supervisors voted 10-0 with one member absent Monday to
approve an ordinance allowing unmarried couples, homosexual or
heterosexual, to register with the city as domestic partners. They
also urged the mayor to consider extending health benefits to
live-in lovers of city employees.
   The legislation, a first for a major U.S. city, faces a second
procedural vote next week before going to Mayor Art Agnos, who has
said he will sign it.
   Homosexual rights groups gave cautious praise to the legislation.
   ``It's an important first step,'' said Roberta Achtenberg,
executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
``There is no one piece of legislation that could've gone far
enough.''
   The precise benefits of the legislation remain unclear because
no one knows if health care benefits will ultimately become
available to domestic partners of city employees, she said. Still,
she predicted that many homosexual and unmarried heterosexual
couples will register.
   The Roman Catholic Church helped defeat a similar proposal in
1982. But after Monday's vote, Deacon Norman Phillips of the San
Francisco Archdiocese expressed resignation.
   ``We could always hope that it wasn't going to happen, but I
think sensibly, it looked like it was going to,'' Phillips said.
``I think our hope would be that they might reconsider.''
   The church is opposed to the ``pseudo-marriage'' provision of
the legislation, although it supports the extension of civil rights
benefits and health coverage, Phillips said.
   But some advocates complained that while the burdens of domestic
partnership are substantial under the ordinance _ including
becoming responsible for each other's basic living expenses _ the
benefits remain somewhat unclear.
   Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt, author of the
measure and a leader of the city's politically powerful gay
community, acknowledged the doubts but was confident nevertheless.
   ``There are still obstacles ahead of us, in terms of working out
the health insurance part of this,'' said Britt. ``We're sure we
can do it, and that we can do it without any negative effects on
anybody. It's not going to cost the taxpayers any money.''
   Some city employees worry that health care premiums could rise
if the cost of insuring domestic partners _ including AIDS
patients, in the city with the highest per capita number of such
patients in the nation _ drains city funds. Health and insurance
officials, however, claim the newly eligible people will have a
negligible effect on the city because employees' dependents must
pay monthly premiums of about $150.
   Despite the criticisms, Britt spoke passionately of the
fundamental right of people to pursue love on their own terms.
   ``If my heart tells me and your heart tells you that we should
share our lives together and take care of one another ... the
government has no business telling us that we're going to be
discriminated against,'' he said.
   ``I hope that other cities around the country ... will be
looking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of the
way people live,'' Britt said.
   A few other cities, including Berkeley, across the San Francisco
Bay, have adopted policies extending health benefits to live-in
lovers, and 219 couples in West Hollywood have registered since
1985 for a domestic partnership certificate.
   San Francisco would be the first major metropolitan city to
allow non-married couples to register their relationships as
traditional couples file marriage licenses.
   The law defines domestic partners as any ``two people who have
chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed
relationship.'' The ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' form
would be filed with the county clerk for a $35 fee.
   Under the partnership law, 25,000 city workers would be entitled
to the same bereavement leave that is accorded married couples, and
hospital visitation rights would extend to live-in lovers.

   ``Lardy'' and ``Jughead'' know one of the
first rules of rural politics in Kentucky: Don't get too uppity
with the folks that put you in office.
   They are among more than 200 candidates in primary elections
today who have chosen to put their nicknames on the ballot.
   A name with quotation marks in it is the great equalizer, said
Flatwoods Mayor T.L. ``Lardy'' Groves, 71, who is running for
Greenup County judge-executive.
   ``Anytime you got (a nickname), it brings you down on the same
level with the ol' country boys out in the county,'' Groves said.
``They say, `He's not one o' them big shots.'''
   Besides, almost nobody knows him by his real name. Since Groves'
playmates named him ``Lardy'' at a swimming hole more than 60 years
ago _ ``I was a little, round boy,'' he said _ the label has stuck.
   Earl ``Jughead'' Mastin, 61, was born in Sardis, ``a little ol'
rough town'' in Mason County, he said.
   Mastin said his nickname comes from when he weighed less than
three pounds when he was born, but his head grew quickly. And the
townspeople dubbed him Jughead.
   ``That's an awful name, isn't it?'' he said.
   But he put it on the ballot.
   ``That's the way I'm known,'' he said.

   Cattle roundups do not appear anywhere in
the training manuals for city police officers.
   ``I don't think the academy prepared us for this,'' said Carl
Rust after he and his partner helped round up about 30 cows.
   Rust and his partner, Dave Bardascini, were not the only ones
surprised to see the cows Saturday morning, wandering the streets
of this city of 21,000 people located 40 miles west of Albany.
   ``At first I saw a couple of cows, and I thought I was seeing
something,'' said Nora DiCaprio, whose yard became an impromptu cow
pasture.
   The cows, owned by Joseph F. Korona of nearby Fort Johnson,
knocked down a pasture fence after being frightened by three dogs
and headed for the city, according to Korona's son, Joseph J.
Korona.
   Rust said he and Bardascini were dispatched to a city
neighborhood after police received a report of large animals
walking on the road.
   ``We got the call, and the dispatcher told us it was one cow.
And we turned the corner and it was about 20 to 22 cows,'' Rust
said.
   Rust said the cows began running through backyards and then
split into two groups, with about 13 of them heading for the
Amsterdam Municipal Golf Course.
   It eventually took the Korona family and some friends six hours
to round up the animals.

   It was no secret when two members of the
``Swamp Stompers'' motorcycle club tied the knot at the sixth
annual Dermott Crawfish Festival.
   Townspeople who were not on hand to see the wedding Saturday
likely heard about it.
   Before the wedding, the groom, Carey Rowland, 38, and the bride,
Helen Clemis, 33, rode around town on his Harley-Davidson
motorcycle followed by 100 other bikers.
   After Miss Clemis changed out of her blue denim biker attire
into a light blue wedding gown, the other bikers lined their big
choppers one across from the other in downtown Dermott, making a
long aisle that Miss Clemis walked down.
   The ceremony took about 45 minutes, said Justice of the Peace
James Scucchi, and was witnessed by at least 10,000 people
attending the festival in southeast Arkansas.
   Afterward, Rowland directed the bikers to rev their engines,
which they did, making them roar louder and louder each time.
   ``Oh, man, it was real loud. It was something,'' Scucchi said.
``The crowd just really got a kick out of it. Everybody said it was
the shortest, simplest and best wedding they had ever been to.''

   Three Latin American foreign ministers,
fulfilling a mandate from the Organization of American States,
headed to Panama today to promote a democratic transfer of power.
   Panamanian authorities have promised to cooperate with the
mediators but Bush administration officials said initial comments
by Panamanian authorities have not been encouraging.
   A pro-government party in Panama said Monday it wants the OAS to
focus on U.S. ``aggression'' against Panama.
   The foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Sahadeo Basdeo,
arrived Monday night and said the delegation is ``not here to
interfere with the internal affairs of Panama. We came as friends
and neighbors.''
   The other two, from Ecuador and Guatemala, were to fly
separately to Panama and planned to join OAS Secretary General Joao
Baena Soares of Brazil.
   OAS foreign ministers last week blamed Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega for ``the grave events and abuses'' in Panama following the
failed election process in that country earlier this month.
   After a vote count that international observers said was marred
by massive fraud, Panama's electoral tribunal threw out the
results. The Bush administration has maintained that the opposition
slate, based on an independent count, won the election by a 3-1
margin.
   Opposition candidates subsequently were beaten and bloodied by
Noriega supporters during a post-election demonstration.
   The United States claims that Noriega has disrupted
constitutional processes on two occasions in 15 months. The first
was the ouster of then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February
1988 and the second was what the administration says was the theft
and subsequent annulment of the May 7 election.
   In addition to Baena Soares, the delegation is made up of the
foreign minister of Ecuador, Diego Cordovez; of Trinidad, Sahadeo
Basdeo; and of Guatemala, Mario Palencia.
   The OAS resolution calls for the mediators to ``secure a
national accord, within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest
time possible, to ensure the transfer of power with full respect
for the sovereign will of the Panamanian people.''
   The tentative plan is for the ministers to report back to their
OAS colleagues on June 6. If Panamanian authorities show no
interest in complying with the spirit of the OAS resolution, the
Bush administration is expected to support an escalation of OAS
pressure against Noriega.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said Monday that
Noriega has raised the possibility of resolving the crisis by
inviting opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara to join
a three-member junta. The other members would be Noriega allies.
   ``Noriega is proposing one of you and two of us,'' said the
official, suggesting that any such proposal would not be acceptable
to OAS ministers.
   The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition of
their victory claim in the election, shook hands and passed out
leaflets in Panama Monday welcoming the OAS delegation.
   ``The OAS will not solve all our problems, but it will create
the environment. They have come to investigate,'' said Endara.
   A pro-government party Monday criticized the OAS for condemning
Noriega and said its delegation could not mediate among Panamanians.
   ``We call on the OAS to adopt a virile attitude toward
aggression against our people by the United States,'' said a
statement issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party, the largest
pro-government group.
   Noriega and his allies have consistently maintained that
Panama's problems stem from a systematic U.S. effort to subvert the
country's democratic process, citing accounts of a $10 million CIA
contribution to the opposition coalition.

   Women who took birth control pills while
teen-agers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of
breast cancer before they reach menopause, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Sweden, is one of several recent
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of
breast cancer
   While describing their findings as ``alarming,'' the researchers
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since
their introduction, and newer pills may not heighten the risk of
breast cancer.
   The research, directed by Dr. Hakan Olsson and colleagues from
University Hospital in Lund, was presented Monday at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   At the meeting, an Italian specialist described a new approach
to treating breast cancer that he said could virtually eliminate
the need for mastectomies, which have been the standard approach to
the disease for nearly a century.
   Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among American women
and strikes one in 10.
   Olsson's study was conducted in southern Sweden, where the pill
was widely used by teen-age girls after its introduction in the
1960s.
   He said that the incidence of breast cancer among women under
age 40 has risen in Sweden since the advent of the pil. And while
his study cannot conclusively blame the pill, ``we have no other
explanation for the increase of breast cancer in young women.''
   However, even if pill use during the 1960s has increased the
chances of breast cancer, the risk is still relatively small among
women before they reach menopause. Olsson said that the overall
chance of breast cancer before menopause is about 1 percent, while
the risk among early pill users is about 5 percent.
   The increased risk appears to be limited to those who began
taking the pill while young. The research found no increased breast
cancer among women who started on the pill after age 25 or after
their first full-term pregnancy.
   Olsson said 10 studies since 1983 have reported links between
the pill and breast cancer.
   Dr. Jules Harris, director of the cancer center at Chicago's
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, said the Swedish study
``strongly suggests that birth control pills are linked to early,
pre-menopausal breast cancer.''
   Despite the mounting research evidence, however, some experts
have been skeptical. In January, a panel convened by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration concluded that the reported links between
the pill and breast cancer were still inconclusive.
   Doctors also point out that the pill's potential dangers must be
balanced against its benefits. For instance, the pill appears to
substantially reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus and ovaries.
   Olsson's study was based on a comparison of 174 breast cancer
patients with 454 healthy women. Besides showing that teen-age pill
users were five times more likely to get breast cancer, the study
found that their tumors were larger and their outlook worse than in
those who had not used the pill so early in life.
   In a report on changes in treating breast cancer, Dr. Gianni
Bonadonna of the National Cancer Institute in Italy described his
initial results in 97 patients with a new approach to avoiding
mastectomy.
   Although doctors are increasingly removing just the cancerous
lump when the tumor is small, total removal of the breast remains
the standard therapy for larger tumors.
   Bonadonna and colleagues are experimenting with giving
chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the lumps. Then surgeons are
able to take out just the tumor and leave the rest of the breast.
   This approach worked in 87 percent of women with large tumors
who otherwise would have needed mastectomies.
   Bonadonna acknowledged that his approach is likely to be
controversial, and more followup will be needed. Many doctors
believe that mastectomy still gives women the best chance of
avoiding recurring cancer later in life, even if their tumors are
relatively small.

<HEAD>Report: Spanish Police Contradict Britain Over IRA Slayings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish police have flatly contradicted crucial
parts of the British government's justification for the slaying of
three unarmed IRA guerrillas in Gibraltar last year, a London
newspaper reported today.
   British authorities have always maintained that Special Air
Service commandos shot to death Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and
Daniel McCann in the British colony on March 6, 1988 because they
feared the guerrillas were about to detonate a car bomb.
   But The Independent said in today's editions that five senior
Spanish police officers involved in the case have told the paper
that:
   _ British security forces were told the guerrillas' car was in
place in Gibraltar the day before the shootings, giving them at
least 15 hours to verify Spanish advice that it contained no bomb.
   _ The three guerrillas were not discovered by chance in
Gibraltar the day they were shot. Hours before they were killed,
they had been tracked by Spanish authorities to the border, which
they crossed on foot. The surveillance operation was then passed on
to the British.
   The paper did not name the Spanish police officers but reported:
``These claims undermine the British authorities' explanation...
   ``The (British) security forces claimed to have been taken by
surprise by the sudden arrival of the trio and the car and blamed
the Spanish police for sloppy surveillance work which allowed the
IRA members to slip undetected onto the Rock'' of Gibraltar.
   It quoted one senior Spanish police officer as saying: ``We told
the British we were 90 percent certain that the car contained no
bomb.''
   The paper commented in a separate editorial: ``The information
published today... makes it appear more likely that the three
terrorists were, in effect, executed.''
   A spokesman at the Ministry of Defense in London refused to
comment on the report. ``An inquest was held into these events and
that inquest came to its conclusions. There is nothing further we
would add,'' he said. The spokesman, in accordance with British
practice, declined to be named.
   The jury at a month-long inquest in Gibraltar that ended last
Sept. 30 ruled in a 9-2 vote that the three were lawfully killed.
   British authorities have said the guerrillas were preparing to
explode a car bomb during a parade by British soldiers. No bomb was
found in Gibraltar but two days after the shootings, Spanish police
found a car packed with explosives in Marbella that had been rented
by one of the three.
   The IRA said the three were on active service _ a euphemism for
a bombing or shooting mission _ when they were shot.
   The shootings raised a storm of protest among IRA supporters in
Northern Ireland and abroad, drew criticism from Prime Minister
Charles Haughey's government in the Republic of Ireland, and
triggered a wave of violence in Northern Ireland in which nine
people, including two British soldiers, died.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule there. It
wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95
percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   The human rights group Amnesty International said last month
that the inquest jury acted on incomplete evidence and conflicting
testimony.
   Amnesty renewed its demand for a judicial inquiry and said the
inquest failed to allay suspicions of ``an official policy of
deliberate planned killings.''
   The Independent said ministers in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government remained adamant that the British version of
events given at the inquest was correct.
   The paper said some ministers dismissed the reported assertions
by Spanish police as part of a power struggle in Spain's socialist
government.
   It said both Spain and Britain were concerned that the
continuing dispute about the shootings could harm relations.

   The racketeering convictions of two
powerful North Slope officials should put an end to the days of
feasting on oil-bloated public works projects in the state, a
federal prosecutor says.
   A federal court on Monday convicted lobbyist Lewis Dischner and
consultant Carl Mathisen in Alaska's longest criminal trial.
   The advisers to former Borough Mayor Eugene Brower used their
positions to pocket millions in kickbacks and steer construction
contracts to companies they secretly owned, the trial showed.
   Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and Mathisen added $73
million to the cost of the massive contruction program in the early
1980s aimed at providing 20th Century comforts for the nation's
northernmost communities.
   The North Slope borough is the Eskimo-led government of the vast
northern region of Alaska.
   Dischner, 71, was convicted on 21 charges, ranging from
racketeering to extortion to wire and mail fraud. Mathisen, 56, was
convicted on 22 similar charges. The jury acquitted Dischner on
four income tax counts.
   ``We're obviously pleased,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan.
``We hope that it will change the way that business is done in
Alaska.''
   The complex trial lasted more than seven months. The verdict
came in the fourth week of deliberations by an 11-member jury. One
juror was dismissed after being hurt in a horseback-riding accident.
   Prosecutors said Dischner and Mathisen socked away $21 million
during Brower's administration from 1981 to 1984 _ $3 million in
salaries; $9 million from contracts and $9 million from a 10
percent fee assessed all companies doing business with the borough.
   The government claimed Dischner and Mathisen manipulated Brower,
an inexperienced leader whom they had helped elect. Brower
testified for the government as part of plea-bargain that included
a 30-day sentence and a $5,000 fine for tax evasion.
   Defense lawyers attributed the inflated cost of the borough's
capital construction to harsh arctic conditions, a rush to finish
the work and the Brower administration's desire to create jobs.
   Federal racketeering statutes under which Dischner and Mathisen
were prosecuted allow the government to seek forfeiture of money
and property obtained illegally.
   Lawyers for the pair said they will appeal.
   Sentencing was scheduled for August or September. Dischner and
Mathisen will remain free on personal recognizance until then, said
U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland.

<HEAD>Ex-HUD Secretary Accused of Choosing Subsidy Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce personally
decided which projects were subsidized under a program being
investigated as an improper source of Republican political funds, a
former HUD official said.
   The official, Thomas T. Demery, accused Pierce of improperly
promoting certain housing projects over others so that they would
receive millions of dollars in subsidies, The New York Times
reported in today's editions.
   Pierce headed the Department of Housing and Urban Development
throughout the Reagan administration.
   The program under fire provided an incentive for developers to
renovate housing by subsidizing rents for 15 years. An HUD audit
found widespread abuses in the program, including an absence of
competitive bidding.
   Demery told the Times that Pierce ordered allocations for some
projects as a result of requests from members of Congress and other
politicians.
   The HUD audit found that housing developers involved in the
subsidy program paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to prominent
Republican consultants who often had little or no experience in
housing.
   The audits suggested that the consultants were paid to make
contact with Pierce.
   The audit criticized Demery's role in the project, but Demery
blamed Pierce for ordering him to give the subsidies to certain
programs.
   The newspaper said Pierce did not return telephone calls. Pierce
is to testify before a House panel on Thursday.

<HEAD>Women From Around The World Compete For Miss Universe Title</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seventy-six young women with diverse
backgrounds from around the world are competing for tonight's
crowning of Miss Universe 1989, $300,000 worth of prizes and the
prestige of worldwide visibility.
   The event, featuring ``Dynasty'' television program stars John
Forsythe and Emma Samms as hosts, is being beamed to more than 60
nations around the world, reaching a potential audience of 600
million viewers.
   Crowning the winner will be the woman who won the title last
year, Porntip Nakhirunkanok of Thailand.
   The contestants are judged in three categories: swimsuit,
evening gown and personality interview. Promoters say each
contestant is interviewed for five minutes with each judge before
the main event tonight.
   Rehearsals and taping began two weeks ago in this Caribbean
resort on the Yucatan Peninsula, which was ravaged last September
by Hurricane Gilbert.
   On their last day of rehearsals Monday, contestants danced, sang
and practiced their lines, getting ready for one of the biggest
events in their young lives.
   Between numbers, they wrote letters back home, chatted, buried
themselves in paperbacks or listened to coaching from advisers.
   During a break, Flavia Cavalcante Rebelo, Miss Brazil, said the
event was more than a simple beauty pageant.
   ``I need to represent my country well. People ask me about
Carnival, ecology in the Amazon. It's the lungs of the world.''
   Miss Haiti, Glaphyra Gregor Irma Jean-Louis, who is a physician,
said, ``All my life I've wanted to be in the Miss Universe
pageant.''
   ``No one expects to win,'' said Mike Clark, president of the
company producing the show. ``But each one hopes to win.''
   Although only one woman will wear the Miss Universe 1989 crown,
there have already been winners in several categories. Local judges
gave the best costume award to Miss Brazil for a colorful Carnival
outfit. Judged by her peers for the amity award was Miss Turks and
Caicos, Sharon Simons. The photographers gave Miss Australia, Karen
Wenden, the photogenic award.
   Clark describes all the contestants as winners.
   While organizers and participants are enthusiastic about the
beauty contest, some people consider this type of event demeaning
to women, saying it judges a woman's value on the basis of her
physical attractiveness.
   But Clark said the contestants don't feel degraded, adding that
physical beauty is not the only determining factor in who wins.
   ``Each girl has an equitable chance at winning,'' he said.
``When you talk to her, she's intelligent, she has a heart. I find
that in each of these women.''
   The judging process is ``an effort to get to know the girls
better,'' Clark said. ``They see there's a woman behind the body.''
   Pageant officials say the winner must devote her year-long reign
to charitable causes, as well as the promotional work for pageant
sponsors.
   For instance, Miss Universe 1988 has spoken at the United
Nations and with world leaders, including President Bush, about the
plight of underprivileged children.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to rise sharply against the
Japanese yen today, pushing down share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 65.90-point gainer Monday,
shed 251.25 points, or 0.74 percent, closing at 33,816.61.
   The dollar closed at 141.95 yen, up 1.50 yen from Monday's
140.45-yen finish. The dollar has climbed 7.51 yen since May 11,
and its closing today was the highest since 142.00 yen on Oct. 27,
1987.
   It opened at 142.05 yen and ranged between 141.82 yen and 143.03
yen in wide fluctuations that Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with
Daiwa Bank, likened to ``a jet coaster.''
   Traders said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market in
efforts to check the dollar's rise.
   But continuing rumors that the central bank would soon raise its
discount rate, as well as feelings that the dollar would have
trouble staying above 143 yen, also helped bring the U.S. currency
down from today's highs, they said.
   ``The dollar's slip later in the afternoon was not because of
the Bank of Japan's dollar-selling effort but because of news that
the bank and the Finance Ministry agreed to raise the official
discount rate soon,'' Kinugasa said.
   Market players and analysts expect the central bank to raise the
key rate at least by 0.5 percentage point, from the current 2.5
percent. The rate affects interest charges by commercial banks and
higher interest rates tend to make the yen more attractive to
investors.
   ``When the authorities announce the decision, it could encourage
yen buying for a little while, but it will fade away by the time
the discount rate actually goes up,'' Kinugasa said.
   Another trader with a Japanese commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said a discount rate increase
``might not be enough to make the yen attractive, unless the hike
is far more than 0.5 percent.''
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama, meanwhile, told Kyodo
News Service he had no knowledge of any decision to raise the rate.
   He said earlier today that a decision could be based on price
data compiled at the end of May.
   Noting a White House statement that the administration of
President Bush opposes a stronger dollar, Murayama said market
movements are difficult to control.
   Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said the central bank would
take appropriate measures when necessary to curb inflation.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said today's plunge was mainly
due to the yen's weakness against the dollar.
   ``The Nikkei was losing some 500 points at the beginning of the
afternoon session, but started to recover as short-term interest
rates stopped rising,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Higher interest rates discourage stock buying.
   Japanese investors are now watching moves on the foreign
exchange market, as well as the timing of any official discount
rate hike, the analyst said.
   ``But the discount rate hike might not be as discouraging as it
could be because it's been speculated for quite some time, so the
majority of market players have been well prepared for the hike,''
he said.
   Daiwa Securities dealer Kenji Ishizuka said, ``It's been quite
difficult for investors to determine the direction of trading
because of uncertainties over the exchange rates, which have become
very speculative.''
   The majority of market players remained on the sidelines
watching currency market movements, he said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 700
million shares, up from Monday's 550 million.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Says Honduras Blocking Deployment of U.N. Observers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Honduras is blocking a U.N. plan to deploy
military observers who would try to stop cross-border attacks by
rebels fighting the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan governments, the U.N.
secretary-general said.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar made the comments in a letter last month
to five Central American countries. The correspondence, released
Monday, was part of an exchange of letters on the issue.
   U.N. officials have drawn up a plan to send about 100 military
observers and 60 pilots, drivers and administrators to monitor
Central American border areas, especially the Nicaragua-Honduras
and El Salvador-Honduras borders.
   Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras and receiving
support from the United States, operate from bases in Honduras.
   El Salvador says rebels fighting its government operate from
bases in Honduras _ without the Honduran government's permission _
and that Nicaragua supplies the Salvadoran insurgents.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras sent Perez
de Cuellar a handwritten note, also released Monday, that said his
country would agree to the border patrols only if Nicaragua drops a
case it has filed in the World Court against Honduras.
   Nicaragua made public a letter in which it said the World Court
ruled unanimously in December that Nicaragua has the right to
pursue its case, which accuses Honduras of cooperating with the
Contras.
   Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel d'Escoto, said in the
letter that Honduras has tried for two years to ``sabotage the
creation and establishment'' of a U.N. border patrol.
   Perez de Cuellar said in his letter that he could not send the
U.N. observers if Honduras links their deployment to ``conditions
over whose fulfillment I have no control.''
   The letter, sent to the foreign ministers of Honduras,
Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica, did not mention
Nicaragua's case in the World Court.
   Canada, Spain and West Germany have agreed to send personnel to
participate in the border patrol and the U.N. draft calls for at
least one Latin American contingent.
   Venezuela is ``under active consideration,'' said a U.N.
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   China's rebelling students at first asked only to
talk to the government as equals. Now they want the government to
fall.
   The turning point in China's student movement came Saturday,
when Premier Li Peng, charging that the students were being used by
malcontents determined to overthrow the Communist system, imposed
martial law on most of Beijing.
   During the first month of the students' drive for democratic
reform, their demands were modest. They wanted senior leaders to
meet them as equals, in a nationally telecast dialogue on how to
make China a freer and less corrupt society.
   The dialogue must also mean recognition of their newly formed
independent student unions, the activists said.
   In a more general sense, the students sought freedom of the
press, greater funding for education, public disclosures of the
incomes of high officials and a more sincere attempt to wipe out
the corruption that is endemic to the Communist Party and China's
bureaucracy.
   There were no deadlines or threats. Although some students put
up posters condemning the Communist system or calling for
multiparty elections, the majority stressed that they were willing
to work within the system.
   They said the marches, sit-ins, class boycotts and hunger
strikes would end if the government merely talked to them.
   Instead, the government declared martial law and ordered troops
to sweep the students from Tiananmen Square.
   That move has radicalized the student demands. Li, who a week
earlier visited hunger strikers in their hospitals, has taken on
the role of the villain, the military dictator who must be
overthrown.
   Students also are demanding the resignation of 84-year-old
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the pragmatic author of China's reform
program. The students say he now is too old to grasp the needs of
changing China.
   Today, hundreds of thousands of students, workers and
intellectuals marched through Tiananmen Square to demand the
resignation of Li and Deng.
   ``Li Peng, step down, Deng Xiaoping, step down,'' the crowds
chanted.
   Dialogue, the students say, has no meaning when the opposing
party has resorted to military force to suppress them.

<HEAD>Government Announces Mexicana Airline Will Be Sold To Private Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA SNOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-owned Mexicana Airline will be sold
to the private sector as part of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's program to inject new vigor into the nation's economy,
the government says.
   The Treasury Department announced late Monday that the
International Bank will coordinate the sale of the airline to the
Mexican or foreign investors who make the most attractive offer.
   The other government-owned airline, Aeromexico, was sold to a
consortium of Mexican investors in November. If purchased by
foreigners, Mexicana would be the first sold to non-Mexican
investors under newly relaxed investment regulations.
   Both airlines have domestic and international flights.
   The sale is part of Salinas' plan for cutting inflation and
reviving the economy. He has said he supports the sale of many
state-owned companies to the private sector in a bid to increase
competition.
   The government announced on May 15 that it will open some
sectors of the economy that have for years been sheltered by
protectionism, and increase the amount of foreign investment
allowed in others.
   The Treasury Department said the sale of Mexicana will help
``modernize'' the country's air transportation industry and is ``of
fundamental importance for the future development of the national
economy.''
   According to the Excelsior news service, Mexicana has 42 jets
and transported an estimated 8.5 million passengers last year. The
company has about 1,500 flight attendants and 7,500 ground workers.
   Aeromexico was sold for $335 million after it went bankrupt and
its employees went on strike.
   The government blamed fat union contracts, chronic losses and
poor service for its financial failure. The airline had 54 jets and
12,500 employees.
   Grupo Dictum, a consortium of the Mexican Maritime
Transportation Co. and several private investors, bought 75 percent
of the airline and the Aviation Pilots Union owns the rest.

<HEAD>South African Pianist Dead At Age 36</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African pianist Steven
de Groote, a Van Cliburn contest gold medal winner in 1977, has
died in a Johannesburg clinic of tuberculosis of the liver, the
hospital said today.
   De Groote, 36, died Monday at Brenthurst Clinic about 10 hours
after being transferred to the intensive care unit.
   A hospital spokesman, who did not want to be identified, said de
Groote had severe respiratory problems as well as the liver
problem. He was admitted to the clinic on May 8, suffering from
severe abdominal pains, the spokesman said.
   De Groote had recorded and played international concerts
extensively since winning the prestigious Van Cliburn piano
competition in Fort Worth, Texas in 1977. He was named artist in
residence at Texas Christian University, which plays host to the
preliminary rounds of the quadrennial competition.
   De Groote had come to South Africa to perform concerts with the
National Symphony Orchestra in Johannesburg, but that performance
last week and others were cancelled when he was admitted to the
clinic, according to the South African Broadcasting Corp.
   A Johannesburg newspaper, The Citizen, said De Groote's pianist
brother Andre had been at his bedside since Sunday.
   The paper said he is also survived by his father, former South
African Broadcasting Corp. orchestra leader Pierre de Groote, a
brother Oliver, a clarinetist, a brother Phillip, a cellist, a step
brother and step-sister.
   The Citizen said de Groote had been an associate professor of
music at Arizona State University from 1981 and a frequent visitor
to South Africa after leaving to study in the United States.
   De Groote's health had suffered since 1985 when he was in a bad
plane accident in Arizona.

   The dollar was mostly lower in early European
trading today. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was rife with rumors
and speculation about higher interest rates or a new currency
stabilization initiative by the Group of Seven industrialized
nations.
   ``I see it (the dollar) move up a bit more, but then the central
banks will come in again,'' said a dealer at a Frankfurt bank.
   Others said recent concerted central bank intervention has been
weakened by the absence of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.50 yen to a closing 141.95 yen despite
intervention by the Bank of Japan for the second day in a row.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 141.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _2.0075 West German marks, down from 2.0088
   _1.7825 Swiss francs, down from 1.7922

   In London, it cost $1.5805 to buy one pound, compared with

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $363.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $360.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $363.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.50 compared with $359.80 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.76 to close at a bid $363.97.

<TEXT>
   The winery worker charged with seven
slayings called a newspaper to thank the man who found his
surviving daughter in a county dump with her throat slashed.
   ``I want to thank the guy who found my daughter,'' said Ramon
Salcido in a telephone call Monday night to The Press Democrat in
Santa Rosa.
   Salcido also said he wanted to thank Petaluma Valley Hospital
for its care of 3-year-old Carmina who has recovered and is living
with her grandfather.
   ``I love her and I'm thinking about her,'' he said. ``She's my
daughter and I love her. She's everything I have.''
   Salcido refused to answer questions about the case or conditions
at Sonoma County jail, although at one point he described them as
``a living hell.''
   ``I'm sorry, I can not answer anything like that,'' said
Salcido. ``I'm sorry but I cannot talk.''
   Salcido, 28, is charged in the deaths of his wife, two
daughters, his mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a co-worker.
He allegedly slashed the throats of his three young daughters; only
Carmina survived.
   She was found by Mike Miskell who was looking for auto parts.
   Salcido admitted the slayings after he was captured in Mexico on
April 19, five days after the killings.
   Sheriff's Capt. John Sully said Salcido is isolated from other
prisoners, but has the same access to the telephone as other
prisoners, which means he can call when the phone is free. Sully
confirmed Salcido made the call.
   Salcido called the newspaper Monday night, saying it was the
first call he had made since being in jail and added there was no
one else he wanted to call. The newspaper reported on the call in
today's editions.

<HEAD>`Dynasty' Ends, `Hooperman' Busted In New ABC Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC is toppling its long-running prime-time
soap ``Dynasty'' and busting ``Hooperman'' to make room for six new
comedies, two dramas and a weekly news program in its fall schedule.
   The second-place network announced Monday its new lineup
includes comedian Jackie Mason's first television series, ``From
this Moment On;'' ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' from ``L.A. Law'' creator
Steven Bochco; and ``Prime Time,'' an informational series hosted
by Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer.
   Low ratings of late have tarnished ``Dynasty,'' the once-popular
opulent soap starring Joan Collins, Linda Evans and John Forsythe.
It will be replaced on Thursdays by ``The Kid'' (9 p.m.-10 p.m.), a
new drama about young men working for the Pony Express in the 1860s.
   ``Hooperman,'' a comedy cop show featuring John Ritter as a
detective beset by various professional and personal hurdles, will
be supplanted on Wednesdays by ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' (9:30
p.m.-10 p.m.). ``Doogie Howser'' stars Neil Patrick Harris as a
child genius serving as a medical resident at a major hospital. It
is produced by Bochco, who also created ``Hooperman.''
   ABC also is pulling the plug on ``Men,'' ``A Fine Romance,''
``Coach,'' ``HeartBeat,'' ``A Man Called Hawk'' and, as previously
announced, ``Moonlighting.''
   The new schedule was the work of Robert Iger, who took over for
Brandon Stoddard as head of ABC Entertainment in March. The network
is second to NBC in the viewer ratings and ahead of CBS.
   ABC will add three new series to its Sunday schedule. The new
programs are ``Life Goes On'' (7 p.m.-8 p.m.), a drama about a
working-class family whose members include a child with mental
retardation. The show stars Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone. It is
followed by ``Free Spirit'' (8 p.m.-8:30 p.m.), a comedy featuring
a divorced father of three whose housekeeper (Corrine Bohrer) turns
out to be a witch.
   ABC's other new Sunday program is ``Homeroom'' (8:30 p.m.-9
p.m.), focusing on a teacher (Darryl Harper) in an inner-city
elementary school.
   While the network's Monday schedule will remain the same, ABC
will add one new show on Tuesday. ``From this Moment On'' (9:30
p.m.-10 p.m.) features Mason as Jackie Fisher, a former pajama
manufacturer who is now assisting young people at a local community
skills center. Lynn Redgrave co-stars.
   In addition to ``The Kid,'' the Pony Express show starring
Anthony Zerbe and Josh Brolin, ABC's new Thursday lineup will
include ``Prime Time'' (10 p.m.- 11 p.m.). The series will pair
Donaldson with CBS veteran Sawyer in what ABC calls ``a provocative
look at the news of the week.'' It is scheduled to make its debut
Aug. 3.
   On Fridays, ABC will add ``Family Matters'' (8:30 p.m.-9 p.m.),
a spinoff from the network's ``Perfect Strangers.'' ``Family
Matters'' features Harriet Winslow (Jo Marie Payton-France), the
talkative elevator operator from ``Perfect Strangers,'' trying to
manage a diverse group of children and relatives.
   Saturday's new program is ``Living Dolls'' (8:30 p.m.-9 p.m.), a
comedy is about four teen-age models learning that there's more to
life than just pretty faces _ or so ABC promises.

   The famed portrait of Mao Tse-tung in Tiananmen
Square was splattered with paint today as hundreds of thousands of
students, intellectuals and workers marched near the painting,
demanding Premier Li Peng step down.
   Despite exhaustion and some thinning of their ranks, student
protesters decided today to press on with their 10-day occupation
of the square until the government falls.
   The vandalism of Mao's gigantic portrait with red, black and
blue paint by two young men was akin to blasphemy and an isolated
incident in a remarkably peaceful popular rebellion that has
galvanized much of the country.
   A Chinese journalist who saw the attack said the two, wearing
the white headbands of student protesters, were seized by students.
   Student leaders said later that the vandals' whereabouts were
unknown and insisted the two were not students.
   Mao was Communist China's founder and ruled the country for 27
years until his death in 1976. His uniform and the blue sky
background were splattered and dots marred his chin and smeared
between his eyes.
   Workers later covered the painting with a tarp.
   The pro-democracy student movement, launched last month with
marches and class boycotts demanding press freedom and an end to
official corruption, has won such widespread popular support as to
tame martial law, which Premier Li declared in Beijing on Saturday.
   Today's march in the square was at least the third such huge
outpouring of support for the students in a week. Marchers called
for the resignation of Li, senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
President Yang Shangkun.
   Intellectuals from the Chinese Academy of Sciences led the
protest, accusing Li of staging a military coup in his struggle
with Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. Li apparently acted on
orders of the 84-year-old Deng.
   ``People unite and break the militaristic coup,'' read one
poster. ``Bury the cult of the individual. End old people's
politics,'' read another.
   A bus designed by the Central Academy of Fine Arts broadcast for
a free press. A painting on the bus showed red lips crisscrossed by
two rifles. ``We will not be silenced,'' read one slogan.
   Heavy showers ended most of the protest suddenly. Students
wandered about the square with sheets of plastic over their heads.
Others held wet flags.
   Several hundred men wearing blue raincoats bicycled to the
square through the rain, chanting ``Li Peng, step down.''
   The rest of the capital was calm, with subways reopened and many
bus lines running, after a tense weekend in which hundreds of
thousands of people spontaneously set up roadblocks to protect the
students from troops.
   Many military and Communist Party leaders have opposed using
troops to crack down on the demonstrators.
   Student leaders met today and decided, despite the exodus of
thousands of demonstrators who are returning to their schools, to
continue their occupation of the square that is China's symbolic
center of power.
   It was not known how the vandalism of the Mao painting, one of
Communist China's most important symbols, would affect the protest.
   ``I voted that we should go back because many of the Beijing
students are already leaving,'' said Gua Haifeng, a student leader
from Beijing University. ``But the student union insists on
struggling until the end. They want to see the government fall.''
   More than half of the protesters on the square hail from outside
Beijing.
   ``We just couldn't leave,'' said a student from Lanzhou, a
western city about 750 miles from Beijing. ``Tiananmen Square is
the center of our student movement. If it died, the movement in
Lanzhou and all around China would die, too.''
   Protesters said Li and Yang had were trying to take over the
government by replacing ministers and using troops to occupy
important media outlets.
   A source at the People's Daily earlier had said that troops had
occupied that newspaper along with the official Xinhua News Agency,
and the central television and radio stations.
   But the allegations about replaced ministers could not be
confirmed nor could a rumor that Li had taken the responsibility
for propaganda out of the hands of Politburo member Hu Qili.
   Rumor and innuendo filled Beijing. Intellectuals, most of whom
sympathize with Zhao, a relatively liberal reformer, have been as
much to blame as the supporters of Li and Yang, both conservatives.
   Earlier reports said Zhao had offered to resign his post as
chief of the Communist Party in meetings during the second week of
May. Now, the same sources are saying Zhao prepared his resignation
papers but reneged at the last minute when he saw Li becoming
increasingly weak.
   Indeed, Li's inability to carry out the martial law crackdown
has hurt his position. On Monday, senior military officers and
legislators criticized the crackdown.
   Seven high-ranking officers, including former Defense Minister
Zhang Aiping, wrote an open letter to the People's Daily, saying
that ``to keep the situation from worsening, the army cannot enter
the city.''
   Chinese sources said members of the National People's Congress
began collecting signatures to open a special session to consider
the legality of martial law.
   Central Radio reported that several soldiers were seriously
injured in a brief clash Monday night with local residents in
southwest Beijing. It said some had been hospitalized. Several
local residents were also hurt.

<HEAD>Ligachev Says Politburo Honor Insulted by Bribery Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev
has told Communist Party leaders their honor as well as his own had
been hurt by a prominent prosecutor's accusations of corruption,
Tass reported today.
   Ligachev accused prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov of ``provocation and
malicious invention'' for saying on national television on May 12
that Ligachev's name had come up in a bribery case.
   ``Slanderous accusations of this kind affect not only my own
honor and dignity but also the honor and prestige of the party
Politburo,'' Ligachev told a meeting of the party's policy-making
Central Committee on Monday, Tass said.
   Ivanov also said his investigations had touched on two former
Politburo members, Mikhail Solomentsev and Grigory Romanov. Both
retired after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   The Central Committee was meeting to discuss Thursday's
inaugural session of the new Congress of People's Deputies, which
will elect the president from among its ranks as wekk as a smaller,
more active Supreme Soviet legislature.
   The 251-member committee endorsed Gorbachev for re-election as
president. Ligachev and Ivanov were elected to the new congress.
   Ivanov also has said he would do his best to see that the
conservative Ligachev, a potential Gorbachev opponent, would not be
elected to the Supreme Soviet, which will hold much of the
congress' legislative power.
   Ligachev said Ivanov was trying to discredit the party
leadership and further his own political career.
   He called on the Politburo to investigate media abuses connected
with leaks from prosecutors.
   Some publications have given investigators ``broad opportunities
for defaming people, accusing them well before trial of crimes,
thus deluding millions of people,'' he told the Central Committee.
   Ivanov said at a mass meeting held in Moscow on Sunday that the
party apparatus must give up its hold on power. He has not
disclosed further details of the bribery case.
   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, are themselves being
investigated on alleged abuses of power connected with their
high-level corruption cases.
   A separate investigation by the Supreme Court has determined
that in 1983 Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in Estonia who
later died in prison. The Court has asked the national prosecutor's
office to consider dismissing Gdlyan as a result.
   Gdlyan also is a member of the new congress.
   He and Ivanov won fame for an Uzbekistan bribery case that sent
Yuri Churbanov, son-in-law of late leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, to
prison for 12 years.

<HEAD>Amtrak Inaugurates Service To Atlantic City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak has restored train service
ferrying gamblers to the casinos from New York, Philadelphia and
Washington.
   The first Atlantic City Express carried 350 politicians and
other guests to the seaside resort Monday. It was the first
Atlantic City train since 1982.
   The trains make four round-trips a day from Philadelphia. A
fifth train originates in Washington and passes through
Philadelphia. Another route carries passengers once a day to and
from New York.
   Amtrak expects to attract 1.4 million riders a year and collect
$30 million in revenue. The project to restore the Atlantic City
line cost $101 million.
   The six-car, diesel-powered inaugural train was about 20 minutes
late getting to Philadelphia because of signal problems in
Baltimore, said Ira Silverman, Amtrak director of route marketing.
   ``It happens once out of a thousand times,'' he said, ``but of
course on an inaugural run, the gremlins come out.''
   The 67-mile trip from Philadelphia takes about 80 minutes and
costs $25 round trip.
   Atlantic City's beaches and casinos last year drew more than 33
million visitors.

<HEAD>Owners Say Girl Used Fake ID to Get Into Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-age girl whom Rob Lowe is accused of
seducing and filming in a pornographic videotape looked like an
adult and met the actor after getting into a nightclub with false
ID, an owner of the club says.
   Meanwhile, District Attorney Lewis Slaton said he will interview
Lowe before deciding whether to file criminal charges against the
star of such movies as ``About Last Night'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire.''
   Lowe, 24, is under investigation on possible charges of sexual
exploitation of a minor, centering on a segment of the tape in
which a lawsuit contends he directs the 16-year-old girl in a sex
scene with a 22-year-old woman.
   The actor frequented the Rio club last summer during the
Democratic National Convention, co-owner Mable Roubique said Monday.
   ``Rob Lowe was in our nightclub, along with hundreds of other
people,'' she said. ``The two girls were in the club, and he did
meet them here. They were customers in the club.''
   Ms. Roubique said the club screens patrons for proof they are
21, the legal drinking age, but the girl used ``very
legal-looking'' false identification.
   She said employees saw Lowe leave the club with the woman and
the girl on the Sunday night before the convention began.
   The 16-year-old's mother filed a lawsuit May 12 against Lowe,
seeking unspecified damages for the alleged seduction of her
daughter.
   The lawsuit remained under temporary seal Monday.
   Lowe was at the Cannes Film Festival in France when the lawsuit
was filed and has not commented on the allegations. Tim Wood,
Lowe's manager in Los Angeles, has not returned telephone calls
seeking comment.

<HEAD>Authorities Step Up Airport Security, Warn of Possible Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have issued a warning
about possible attacks on airliners and have ordered airports in
the country to tighten security, officials said today.
   The warning came less than a week after a Frankfurt court
convicted Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, of murder
and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner and
sentenced him to life imprisonment.
   Officials said after Wednesday's verdict that Hamadi's sentence
raised the danger of attacks by terrorists on West German targets.
   The latest warning did not specify the reasons for the alert. It
came shortly before the start of the busy summer tourist season
that further strains the nation's already crowded major airports.
   The warning was disclosed in a statement released by the
Bavarian Transport Ministry. It said the warning came from the
federal Interior Ministry and was sent to all West German regional
authorities and airports in the country.
   ``The danger of attacks against air traffic has risen
recently,'' the Bavarian statement said, summarizing the
information it had received from federal security officials.
   The statement did not say if authorities had specific
information about an impending attack.
   Bernd Lenze, spokesman for the Bavarian Transport Ministry,
declined to discuss the reasons that led to tighter airport
security.
   Lenze also refused to give details about the security measures
authorities were taking.
   But the statement said airport security staff were told to
conduct more elaborate inspections of luggage and passengers will
have to count on longer check-in times.
   After the verdict in Hamadi's trial, the West German Foreign
Ministry warned its diplomats to be on the alert for possible
retaliation.
   Newspaper reports also said authorities were on the lookout for
possible terrorist action at home following Hamadi's sentencing.
   The Frankfurt court ruled that Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah,
or Party of God. The radical Shiite Moslem group is backed by Iran
and is believed to be holding Western hostages in Beirut.
   The court said Hamadi had been in contact with Hezbollah
terrorists operating in Europe before his arrest at Frankfurt
airport in January 1987. Hamadi was convicted of the hijacking and
slaying of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   Two West German relief workers are still missing in Lebanon
after reportedly being kidnapped the day before Hamadi's sentencing.
   A terrorist bombing is believed responsible for the Dec. 7 crash
of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 270 people. The flight originated in Frankfurt and changed
planes in London.

<HEAD>House Members Raked in $5.9 Million in Honoraria</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts in 3rd graf that 20 lawmakers given filing extensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The honoraria system that narrowly avoided
extinction earlier this year cranked out nearly $5.9 million in
1988 for House members who wrote articles and gave speeches to
special-interest groups.
   The honoraria figures, compiled by the public interest group
Common Cause, came from the annual House financial disclosure
statements that were released Monday.
   The final honoraria figures for the year could surpass the 1987
total of $6.7 million once financial disclosure forms are received
from an additional 20 lawmakers who were granted extensions of up
to 30 days in which to file their reports. The reports not yet
available included that of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the 1987 honoraria leader with $245,000.
   The annual disclosure forms filed by all 535 members of Congress
provide a look at members' wealth and outside income. Each form
lists a member's money received, assets and liabilities. The Senate
reports were released last Friday.
   Rank-and-file House members were allowed to keep $26,850 in
honoraria in 1988 _ leaders slightly more. The amount over the
limit, more than $1 million, was donated to charity while nearly
$4.8 million was kept for personal use.
   Most lawmakers also supplemented their $89,500 salaries with
investments, while others made money in more unorthodox ways.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Northern Cheyenne
Indian, earned $5,000 last year for his jewelry designs.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former National Basketball
Association player, received deferred income totaling $45,000 from
the Washington Bullets and Atlanta Hawks.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, facing House ethics committee charges
of 69 rules violations, reported income between $188,183 and
$203,579 and assets ranging from $31,005-$100,000. These figures do
not include holdings in a blind trust established by Wright in
1987. Those assets and the income they produced were not available
Monday.
   The speaker earned $30,000 in honoraria, a figure eclipsed by 45
other House members who filed on Monday.
   Wright paid off debts totaling between $105,000 and $220,000,
including money he owed to his former investment partnership,
Mallightco, and a bank.
   The special counsel to the ethics committee said Wright
satisfied these notes with money he made from his share of an oil
and gas investment that is still under investigation by the panel.
   Not everything was revealed by House members.
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., noted that the ethics committee
waived the reporting of wedding gifts in a letter dated Dec. 16,
1988. Spence, a widower, got married last July 3 in a hospital room
while recovering from a double lug transplant.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who said his
assets are no more than $45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988
from his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   A complaint is pending before the House ethics committee in
connection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote the
book.
   The honoraria system was in jeopardy early this year, when House
leaders were ready to abolish it and institute other reforms in
return for a 51 percent pay raise. The effort collapsed when a
furious public let lawmakers know they opposed the increase.
   The fees of $2,000 a speech are controversial because
invitations usually come from special-interest groups courting
lawmakers, and because often the events are held at resorts where
members and their spouses can enjoy free vacations.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, earned the most honoraria of those who filed,
$114,376. Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus, was second with $110,788. House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., was third with $90,100.
   The disclosure statements showed members like to travel.
Gingrich's expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches to
various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois listed some of
the side benefits of taking part in charity golf tournaments: $966
worth of golf clothing and paraphernalia from the Bob Hope Desert
Classic, the Kemper Open, the Jerry Ford Invitational and others.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual income
from ``The Love Boat,'' the long-running television series in which
he played Gopher.
   Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported $11,212 in residuals for his
appearances on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Although some members do provide specific figures, the forms do
not require such precise data. Generally, wealth can be listed
according to broad ranges.
   For example, properties worth $52,000 and $98,000 could both be
listed in the $50,001-to-$100,000 range. An asset worth millions
could be listed simply as more than $250,000 unless a member chose
to spell it out.

<HEAD>Blind Man Beaten By Police Files Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind man beaten by police officers who
thought his folding white cane was a martial arts weapon has filed
a $200,000 claim against the city.
   Harry Bruno, city risk manager, said the city probably will
reject the claim filed Monday by David St. John.
   ``I couldn't see the city agreeing to pay those amounts,'' he
said.
   St. John, 37, seeks half of the money for himself and the rest
for an organization that helps the blind. ``A lot of blind people
are upset over what happened,'' he said. ``I'm hoping that
something good can come out of this.''
   Under the law, St. John can sue if the city rejects the claim.
   St. John was beaten with a baton on May 11 after he resisted
demands from officers to surrender his cane. He said the officers
did not identify themselves and he thought he was being mugged. He
was not seriously hurt.
   Eric Ristrim, a training officer with the department for five
years, and Marie Yin, a trainee with less than a year's experience,
said they thought the cane was a set of illegal nunchakus, two
stout rods connected by a chain.
   Also on Monday, about 20 officers, including Ristrim, got a
40-minute lesson on dealing with the blind.
   ``It brought to light that we need more sensitivity training
toward problems that the blind have,'' training Officer Steve Corey
said.
   Mary Willows, an educational consultant for the National
Federation of the Blind of California, helped conduct the course.
The police request took her by surprise, she said.
   ``But I could tell by talking to them that they were really
upset,'' she said. ``They're just sick about it.''

<HEAD>Factory Orders for Durable Goods Up 2.9 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods shot up 2.9 percent in April, the best showing in four
months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last at least three years, rose to a seasonally
adjusted $129.1 billion last month after climbing 1 percent in
March and declining during the first two months of the year.
   The report reflected renewed demand in all major industry
categories after broad weakness earlier this year. The biggest
increase came in orders for electrical machinery, up 9.4 percent to
$20 billion.
   Last month's 2.9 percent increase was the biggest since a 7.4
percent jump recorded last December.
   Orders reached a high of $132.1 billion in December, but have
yet to return to that level after the downturns in January and
February.
   Analysts had cited the first-quarter weakness in orders for
durable goods as evidence that growth has begun to slow as the
economy extends into the seventh year of a record peacetime
expansion.
   The declines in orders in January and February represented the
first back-to-back drops in three years, and the March increase was
attributed solely to a big surge in aircraft orders that masked
broader weakness.
   A variety of other government reports on the economy's
performance so far this year also have indicated that growth is
slowing in response to a yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve
Board to restrain inflation by dampening demand.
   April's increase in orders for durable goods was an even
stronger 4.7 percent when orders in the volatile defense category
are excluded. It was the first increase in non-defense orders since
a 6.2 percent rise last December.
   Defense orders dropped 16.3 percent in April after surging 28.5
percent in March and 19.7 percent in February.
   Transportation orders, also subject to wide swings depending on
when big contracts are signed, rose 0.6 percent in April, with most
of the increase reflecting higher demand for autos and parts.
Demand for aircraft and parts continued to remain high.
   Excluding transportation, all other orders were up 3.9 percent,
the first increase since a 2.2 percent rise last December. It was
the biggest jump in non-transportation orders since a 4.8 percent
jump in April 1987.
   In other industries, orders for primary metals such as steel
rose 5.6 percent and orders for non-electrical machinery were up
1.4 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, watched as a
sign of business investment plans, orders were up 5.5 percent in
April after rising 2.6 percent in March. It was the best showing
since a 10.1 percent increase in December.
   Shipments of durable goods also rose last month, increasing 2.3
percent to a seasonally adjusted $123.1 billion. Shipments had
declined during the previous three months.

<HEAD>Medicaid Thief Begins Serving Prison Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who fled to Arizona before his sentencing
has begun serving a 7- to 21-year prison term for the biggest
Medicaid fraud in history, thanks to a tipster who turned him in
after seeing the case on a TV show.
   Sheldon Weinberg, convicted of stealing $16 million, was
imprisoned Monday after five months as a fugitive.
   Officials received hundreds of leads on his whereabouts after
his case was featured on NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.'' One call led
FBI agents to Scottsdale, Ariz., where Weinberg and his wife were
living under assumed names.
   Weinberg, 69, was returned to New York on Friday and brought to
court Monday. He was deeply tanned and made no statement during the
proceeding before Justice Ruth Moskowitz, who had sentenced him in
absentia.
   ``I do not consider this a white-collar crime,'' Moskowitz said.
``It is a crime of violence to all the people of New York City. It
is a crime of violence to the Medicaid recipients who should be
receiving the best medical care.''
   Weinberg and his two sons were convicted Nov. 30 of defrauding
Medicaid by submitting phony reimbursement claims from the health
clinic they operated.
   Deputy state Attorney General Edward J. Kuriansky said Weinberg
used the money to finance an $18,000-a-month New York apartment, a
$5 million lakefront mansion in Boca Raton, Fla., yachts and a
fleet of custom cars.

   Karen Ulane, a decorated Vietnam combat
pilot who was fired by Eastern Airlines after a sex-change
operation in 1980, was killed in the crash of a World War
II-vintage charter plane. She was 48.
   Ms. Ulane, known until her surgery as Kenneth Ulane, was at the
controls when the twin-propeller DC-3 owned by an air taxi and
cargo service crashed and burned in a field near here Monday. Two
others aboard were killed.
   Ms. Ulane, who lived in Aurora, had a sex-change operation and
hormone treatments in 1980 after 12 years with Eastern. The airline
fired her, citing possible safety hazards in stressful situations.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Grady ordered reinstatement and
$158,590 in back pay and other expenses in 1983, saying the 1964
federal anti-discrimination law protects transsexuals.
   An appeals court disagreed and reversed the decision, and the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1985 let the appellate ruling stand.
   Ms. Ulane eventually received a settlement from Eastern that was
``substantially more'' than the amount ordered by Grady, said her
attorney, Dean Dickie.
   Ms. Ulane flew combat missions in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968,
winning numerous medals and honors.
   Survivors include her mother and a son from a marriage while she
was Kenneth Ulane.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Richard von Weizsaecker was
re-elected today to a second term as head of state in the first
uncontested presidential vote in the nation's history.
   A special assembly of legislators and appointed electors that is
convened every five years re-elected the 69-year-old Christian
Democrat with 881 votes of the 1,022 cast, or 86.2 percent.
   Each of the five political parties represented in the federal
parliament was entitled to nominate a candidate. That none did was
largely a reflection of the respect Weizsaecker has won.
   He was endorsed by all but the far-left Greens Party.
   Weizsaecker, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
Christian Democratic Union, has transformed the largely ceremonial
post of president into an influential position of elder statesman.
   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth opened the federal
convention in Bonn's sprawling Beethoven Hall with words of praise
for Weizsaecker, the sixth man to serve as West German president
since the nation was founded on May 24, 1949.
   Today was the eve of West Germany's 40th birthday celebration.
   Ms. Suessmuth said the mandate of the federal presidency was to
shape ``a common democracy that binds the confrontational powers in
the government and opposition.''
   ``These are serious responsibilities and I wish for us the
strength to bear them successfully,'' Weizsaecker said in a short
acceptance speech.
   Among the delegates sent by West Germany's 11 states were former
chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, actors, artists and
elected officials.
   Weizsaecker won worldwide praise for his effort to bring fellow
Germans to terms with the holocaust in a 1985 address marking the
40th anniversary of the German capitulation in World War II.
   Weizseacker also has called for a fair assessment of the
accomplishments of a nation built on the ruins of Nazi Germany.

<TEXT>
   A camp operator and a client have been
billed $2.78 million for the cost of fighting a fire that spread to
Yellowstone National Park last summer.
   Investigators concluded the fire was started Aug. 15 by sparks
from a stove in the outfitting camp of Vernon Smith. A client, Todd
Wilkof of Canton, Ohio, told investigators he had used the stove in
his tent that morning.
   The blaze began in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and burned
52,600 acres in the Gallatin National Forest and 29,300 acres in
Yellowstone.
   The firefighting bill could total $4.5 million once all costs
are tallied, Gallatin National Forest spokesman Jim Sanders said
Monday.
   Sanders said the Forest Service does not plan to ask that any
criminal charges be filed. He said the bills were mailed to Smith
and Wilkof last week.
   After the fire, Smith's temporary outfitter and guide permit was
suspended.
   Smith has denied responsibility for the fire.

<HEAD>Former Thrift Executive Agrees To Plead Guilty in Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former savings and loan executive has agreed to
plead guilty to federal charges he took part in a scheme to donate
thrift funds to House Speaker Jim Wright and other politicians,
court records show.
   Federal law forbids corporate contributions to politicians.
   Pat L. Malone, former executive vice president of Vernon
Savings, admitted setting up a system that used thrift funds to
reimburse Vernon employees for making $55,000 in political
contributions in 1986, according to a criminal information filed in
federal court.
   The documents show Malone agreed to plead guilty to bank fraud
charges.
   Court records show donations included unspecified contributions
to Wright and $2,000 to 1986 Texas Tribute, a political committee
set up to seek donations for the Texas Democrat.
   Court records show other contributions included $2,000 to Sen.
Jake Garn, R-Utah; $1,000 to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; $3,000
to the gubernatorial campaign of former Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas,
and unspecified contributions to Rep. Bill Lowrey, D-Calif., and
former Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Federal regulators closed Vernon in 1987. It reopened as
Montfort Savings Association, then was sold in December and renamed
First Gibraltar Federal Savings Bank.
   There was no answer today at a Dallas telephone listing in the
name of a Pat Malone.
   The criminal information accused Malone of soliciting political
contributions from Vernon officers and having them file false
expense vouchers to reimburse themselves for the donations.
   A criminal information is filed in place of an indictment to
show charges to which a defendant has agreed to plead guilty.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French doctors working with American and Soviet
colleagues in Soviet Georgia confirmed today that some
demonstrators who died in a clash with police last month were
killed by toxic gases.
   On the basis of 16 autopsy results, doctors identified
Chloropicrine as responsible for some deaths, according to Medecins
sans Frontiers, a Paris-based medical humanitarian group.
   Chloropicrine was approved in the Soviet Union as a tear gas
until 1981, when it was reclassified as a ``suffocant'' or
asphyxiating gas for combat use, said Dr. Marc Gastellu Etchegorry
of the group.
   No details were immediately available and Etchegorry said
further questions would be addressed by the four-member team upon
their return to Paris on Wednesday.
   Violent clashes between police and Georgian nationalists in
Tbilisi, the republic's capital, left 19 people dead. Another
person was shot to death by police enforcing a curfew.
   Moscow officials admitted soldiers used a toxic gas to disperse
demonstrators but said they used a chemical agent similar to but
stronger than tear gas.
   In a statement, the French doctors said several hundred people
were admitted to hospitals more than a week later believing they
suffered secondary effects from the toxic gases. But the
international team concluded they suffered, instead, from panic
caused by psychological trauma.
   The French doctors worked with American colleagues from
Physicians for Human Rights, with Georgian doctors and with
representatives from the Georgian Health Ministry, according to the
statement.
   The investigators, invited by the local government and Soviet
human rights activist, Andrei Sakharov, examined and questioned
about 100 hospitalized patients, the statement said.

   A developer wants to turn the Sears Tower into
the world's second-tallest building.
   Miglin-Beitler Developments Inc. announced plans Monday for a
slender, 125-story skyscraper resembling a rocket emerging from the
Loop. The 1,914-foot structure would eclipse by 400 feet the Sears
Tower, the tallest building in the world.
   The developer did not indicate how much the concrete and
steel-reinforced skyscraper would cost.
   Plans for the building have been submitted for approval to the
Chicago Plan Commission.
   Planning Commissioner David Mosena said his first impression is
``it is a handsome building, but I can't take an official position
until we get a chance to study it.''
   Construction could begin by December and could be completed by
mid-1992, the developer said.
   The building, being designed by architect Cesar Pelli, of New
Haven, Conn., would contain 1.2 million square feet of office
space, only about one-third the rentable space of the Sears Tower.

   Police headquarters said about 300 radicals were arrested but
most would be released later.
   Troops conducted spot checks on many streets, questioning and
searching people and taking away suspects. Police patrols roamed
subway stations in the city center to stop students from gathering.
   Radical students staged peaceful campus protests earlier today
at 16 colleges in Seoul on the second day of a week of
anti-American protests. Students marched or held rallies, but there
were no reports of fighting.
   Students at Sungkyunkwang University tried to push through lines
of riot police, but were held back. Students from the school staged
a protest march dressed as skeletons and microbes to symbolize U.S.
nuclear and chemical weapons.
   ``Drive out the Yankees'' and ``Down with the dictatorship,''
protesters chanted.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a strong statement today criticizing
radical students for burning U.S. flags at campus protests on
Monday. Ministry spokesman Chang Hoon said such acts must stop.
   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' he said.
   Student groups called for a week of protests in Seoul and other
cities to demand the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders claim
the United States helps prop up authoritarian rule in South Korea.
   Other radical demands include an end to U.S. trade pressure to
open South Korean markets to American imports. The radicals also
want the United States to apologize for the bloody suppression of a
1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
   The uprising in Kwangju was put down by South Korean troops with
the deaths of at least 192 people, but radical groups claim the
United States masterminded the operation.
   Dissidents and radical students are calling for the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo's government. But the radicals lack
significant public support due to their violent tactics and extreme
views.
   The dissidents contend the United States props up the Roh
government to enforce its control over South Korea. Radical
students contend U.S. troops are blocking reunification with
communist North Korea.
   South Korean and U.S. officials say American forces are needed
to ensure the south's defense against North Korea. U.S. troops have
been based in the south since north invaded in 1950.

   A crowd set fire to a home in
a black Natal province township, burning to death a man and woman
and seriously injuring two other people, police said today.
   The arson attack occurred Monday in Imbali, near
Pietermaritzburg, the center of black political violence that has
killed at least 2,000 people since 1986.
   Most of the attacks are taken in revenge for previous killings
and injuries by supporters of the two largest black political
organizations: the banned United Democratic Front, and Inkatha, a
Zulu organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Leaders of the two groups had discussed holding a peace
conference last weekend, but could not agree on a location.

complications. He was 52.
   Mobley died early Monday at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he
was admitted April 18, said Peter Schectman, duty officer at the
Manhattan hospital.
   Mobley, a graduate of Georgetown University, joined the Decatur
(Ill.) Herald, now the Herald and Review, in 1965 and became its
urban affairs reporter two years later.
   In 1969, he was appointed to the editorial staff of the
Lindsay-Schaub newspaper group and covered the 1970 Illinois
Constitutional Convention for the group.
   After working as public information officer for the Illinois
Arts Council, he joined The Associated Press in Chicago in 1972. He
transferred to the AP General Desk in New York in 1978, leaving in
1984 to pursue free-lance assignments, concentrating on cultural
and legal issues.
   He is survived by his mother, Sarah McFarland of Oak Park, Ill.;
two sons, David of New York and Gregory of Springfield, Ill.; two
brothers and three sisters.
   The family asked that donations be made in Mobley's name to

<HEAD>Chinese Resume Satellite Transmissions For Foreign TV Networks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American and other foreign television networks
scrambled for satellite time today after Chinese authorities lifted
a martial law ban on transmissions.
   Major American networks, Japanese television and two Hong Kong
stations rushed to get their videotape out after China Central
Television announced that satellite services had been resumed.
   ``It was a zoo. There was only one path out,'' said John
Sheahan, CBS bureau chief in Beijing.
   The Chinese cut off transmissions and the military dismantled
satellite earth stations after the government declared martial law
in Beijing on Saturday to put down growing student-led unrest.
   Today one earth station was restored and the Chinese state-run
station began providing transmission facilities once more, Sheahan
said. All videotape was transmitted through London, with the
various networks taking turns sending in five- and 10-minute blocks.
   ``It was like going through a subway turnstile,'' Sheahan said.
``There was an enormous amount of goodwill among competitors.''
   Martial law regulations banned nearly all reporting activities
by foreign reporters in Beijing.
   Despite the ban, however, there has been little government
interference in foreign coverage of the more than month-old
student-led demonstrations for greater democracy.

   A severe earthquake struck the Macquarie
Islands near New Zealand early today, the U.S. Geological Survey
reported.
   The quake was measured at 8.2 on the Richter Scale and occurred
at 6:55 a.m. EDT, officials said.
   It was the strongest temblor this year anywhere in the world and
was centered about 850 miles southwest of Christchurch, according
to the survey. It was the strongest since one measuring 8.1 on
October 20, 1986, in the Kermadec Islands in ths Pacific.
   The survey said it had no immediate reports of injuries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the strength of a quake, with
each increase of one whole number indicating 10 times more energy
released.
   A quake of 8 or more on the scale is considered a ``great''
earthquake capable of tremendous damage. By comparison, the San
Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been estimated at 8.3.

   Boston's teachers would get a 7 percent raise
three years in a row and more power in their classrooms but would
be held more responsible for their students' performance under
terms of a tentative contract.
   School Superintendent Laval S. Wilson and teachers union
President Edward Doherty announced the pact Monday and called it a
``landmark agreement on education reform.''
   But city officials warned that because of a state budget crisis,
the city might not be able to afford the raises for the union's
6,000 members.
   ``I do not see, at this time, how a contract of this magnitude
can be funded, given the fiscal uncertainties facing the
commonwealth,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn said.
   The contract must be ratified by the School Committee and then
is expected to be approved by the union in June.
   Teachers would have more of a say in choosing staff and would
have a role in setting curriculum and budget priorities through
school councils. In return, teachers would be subjected to more
detailed reviews of their performance.
   Union and school officials say the pact is modeled on teachers'
contracts in Dade County, Fla., and Rochester, N.Y.

   A Palestinian appeal to the Arab summit in
Morocco urges Arab leaders to reject Israel's peace plan and
demands that the United States support a free Palestinian state, a
pro-PLO newspaper said today.
   In Tunisia, where the Arab leaders are meeting, the Palestine
Liberation Organization issued an ``official version'' of the
latest uprising leaflet, omitting an earlier call for retaliatory
slayings of Israelis.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot
and wounded five Palestinian youths during stone-throwing protests
today, Arab news reports said. A general strike continued in the
territories.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker's call for Israel to stop building Jewish settlements
on occupied land and essentially ignored Baker's appeal to give up
the idea of a ``greater Israel'' including the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``I don't know how it is possible to speak at all of a greater
Israel. Israel is a very small country. ... It sounds really ironic
to speak of a `greater Israel,''' he said on Israel radio.
   Shamir, in London meeting British officials, also said: ``I do
not see any connection between settlements and the issue of the
peace process.''
   Palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to Baker's
comments, which came Monday in a speech in Washington, but noted he
still said the United States does not favor a Palestinian state.
   ``I believe Baker's statement is positive ... but it is not the
change that the Palestinian is asking for,'' said newspaper editor
Ziad Abu Ziad.
   The Arab League convenes today and the appeal to be presented to
participants was published by the East Jerusalem-based Al Fajr, a
daily allied with the mainstream Fatah branch of the PLO.
   It urged Arab nations to form a ``higher committee'' to support
Palestinian peace proposals, which call for Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied lands and an international peace conference.
   It also sought ``support for Palestinian opposition in rejecting
the Israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation.''
   Shamir's peace plan calls for Palestinians in the territories to
elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on an interim period
of self-rule.
   Palestinians object because the proposal does not guarantee
independence or an end to military rule.
   Arab leaders also were asked to call on the United States for
``clear recognition of Palestinian rights to self-determination,''
meaning an independent state.
   Meanwhile, a Palestinian man from the West Bank town of Dura was
killed Monday when his car was stoned in southern Israel.
   The death brought to 497 the number of Arabs killed since the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule began 17 months ago.
Twenty-two Israelis also have been killed.
   WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, published the official text
of leaflet No. 40, which supports killing Palestinians who
collaborate with Israel, but drops an earlier appeal to ``kill a
settler or a soldier for every martyr of our sons.''
   PLO spokesman Abdel Abdul-Rahman said such a call could have
been included in a first draft.
   Also today, an army spokesman confirmed soldiers had plowed
through Arab land to build a road just inside the border with the
Gaza Strip ``for security reasons.''
   An international development worker in Gaza said the road was
about 8{ miles long and 20 yards wide. The development worker, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said small farms that contained
orange and olive trees and wheat and chickpea fields had been
destroyed to build the road.

   Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini underwent surgery today to stop internal bleeding
in his digestive system, Tehran radio reported.
   The radio broadcast a statement from Khomeini's office saying
the 89-year-old Iranian leader was in satisfactory condition
following the operation and that progress reports about his health
would follow.
   There have been persistent reports that Khomeini has been in
poor health. He has been reported to be in frail condition since
suffering a heart attack in 1986.
   The statement from his office said:
   ``We inform the public that with the grace of God, and the
attention of the hidden Imam, the operation on Imam Khomeini, which
was undertaken Tuesday morning to stop bleeding in his digestive
system, was successfully completed, and praise the Lord, his
condition is completely satisfactory.''
   In Paris, Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the
European Shiite community, called The Associated Press to say he
had information that Khomeini had ``lost a great deal of blood''
and was in ``precarious'' condition.
   He would not say who his sources were or provide details.
   Khomeini was last shown speaking on television, also monitored
in Nicosia, during an audience with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in February.
   He seems fragile and slow moving in his frequent appearances on
television, attending prayer audiences at the Jamaran mosque near
his north Tehran home.
   He lifts himself out of his chair after the meetings, but does
not speak.
   There have been scores of stories since the reported heart
attack that he was dead or dying, with unconfirmed reports saying
he has cancer of the prostate.
   Aside from the audiences, Khomeini does not circulate in public
outside his home.
   Factions within the Iranian government have been vying for
control of post-Khomeini Iran, with the competition deepening in
March when he deposed his designated successor, Ayatollah Ali
Montazeri.
   Last week Khomeini's son, Ahmad, published a long diatribe
against Montazeri, 64, for questioning his father's policies.
   Ahmad, 43, has long been a close aide of his father and his
attack on Montazeri underlined his increasingly high political
profile.
   Khomeini appointed a 20-man committee last month to review the
succession question and recomment changes to the 1979 constitution
to correct what he called ``flaws and imperfections.''
   So far, the committee, composed of senior political, legal and
religious figures, has concentrated on the shape of the future
government.
   Tehran newspapers said the committee is likely to give more
power to the presidency, possibly by scrapping the premiership, to
eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed the
decision-making process during 10 years of revolutionary rule.
   The signs were that in the absence of any single figure with the
patriarch's political and religious authority, Iran will likely be
governed in the post-Khomeini era by a collective leadership.
   Khomeini has managed to confound those who say he has been
weakened physically and politically.
   Khomeini in February ordered Moslems to seek out and kill the
Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy for his
treatment of Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   He later accused Iranians of lacking revolutionary zeal and used
the campaign against the book as a platform to back radical leaders
and criticize liberals questioning the goals of the revolution.

   Authorities have jailed 237 ethnic
Albanians without charge in the volatile province of Kosovo, a
regional official said today.
   Those detained ``are people who acted in the interests of
Albanian nationalism and separatism and who in Kosovo exposed their
hostile positions,'' said Jusuf Karakusi, the province's interior
minister, the state Tanjug news agency said.
   Kosovo was the scene in February and March of mass
demonstrations and violent clashes between ethnic Albanians and
Yugoslav security forces. The battles killed at least 25 people,
including two policemen.
   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 85 percent of Kosovo's
population of 1.8 million, were protesting constitutional changes
that limited the wide autonomy the province had previously enjoyed.
The new rules gave Serbia, of which the region is an administrative
part, a greater say Kosovo's affairs.
   The imposition of a state of emergency was followed by a
crackdown in which more than 800 people were arrested on charges
stemming from the unrest.
   An additional ``237 have been detained under isolation
measures,'' which are permitted under emergency law, said Karakusi.
   Among those jailed without charges or trial are prominent ethnic
Albanian politicians, intellectuals and other community leaders who
opposed the constitutional amendments, press reports said.
   Among them is Azem Vllasi, the former local Communist party
chief and a leading opponent of Serbian strongman Slobodan
Milosevic.
   The detentions without trial ``represent a flagrant violation
not only of (the prisoners') civil rights but also of universal
human rights,'' said a commentary in the latest issue of Danas,
Yugoslavia's leading newsmagazine.
   ``The legal status of the detainees is undefined and unclear
--they are not supposed to be in jail but have spent months behind
bars,'' Danas said.

   One million people defied martial law for a fifth
straight straight day today and streamed into the streets to demand
the resignation of Premier Li Peng.
   The demonstration, led by students, teachers, government
employees and intellectuals, was the largest show of public wrath
toward Li since he imposed martial law on Saturday to quell a
student-led campaign for democratic reforms.
   ``Li Peng step down,'' the crowds chanted as they marched past
Tiananmen Square where tens of thousands of students have
maintained a 10-day vigil for a freer and less corrupt society.
   ``People unite and break the militaristic coup,'' read one
poster. ``Bury the cult of the individual. End old people's
politics,'' said one in reference to senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
another target of the marchers.
   Hundreds of thousands also turned out in Shanghai, China's
second-largest city. They also turned out in Hong Kong and Macao,
colonies which revert to Chinese control in the late 1990s.
   Authorities today lifted a martial law ban on foreign network
coverage of the Beijing protests and satellite feeds resumed.
   The march came amid increasing speculation that the beleaguered
Li would be forced from office for refusing to hold talks with the
students and resorting instead to military force to end their
movement. Rumor and innuendo filled Beijing about battles for
control between liberal and conservative wings of the ruling
Communist Party.
   Hong Kong commercial radio reported that the Politburo, the
Communist Party's top decision-making body, decided today to strip
Li, a 60-year-old former electrical engineer, of both his
government and party posts.
   It said Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, whose position was
jeopardized when he advocated compromise with the students and
opposed Li's hardline stance, will resume his duties.
   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
   One indication that Li might be in trouble was the first
official acknowledgement that the premier was the primary object of
demonstrators' anger.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 1 million people took to
the streets and ``the overwhelming majority of the slogans of the
parade were directed against the chief leader of the State
Council,'' namely Li.
   It said other slogans were ``withdraw the troops and lift
martial law'' and ``safeguard the constitution and guarantee human
rights.'' Leading intellectuals from China's most famous
think-tank, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, led the protest. They
accused Li of staging a military coup in his struggle against Zhao.
   Tens of thousands of students and workers also marched through
the streets of Shanghai today to demand that Li step down,
according to Jason Hurtado, a professor at the city's Fudan
university. Throughout the day, about 200,000 city residents milled
around expectantly.
   Overnight, student leaders printed and distributed thousands of
posters and pamphlets calling for workers to support students and
people gathered around to read the inscriptions.
   In Macao today, 120,000 people poured into the narrow streets in
the Portugese colony's largest march to support the pro-democratic
movements in Beijing. They urged Premier Li Peng to step down and
criticized Beijing's press censorship in a march that paralyzed
traffic for two hours.
   In Hong Kong, protests continued for a fourth straight day. In
all, about 10,000 students marched through the city and 2,000
boycotted classes.
   Workers used a large crane to replace a portrait of
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung on the gate of the Forbidden City
across from Tiananmen Square. Earlier today, two men splattered
paint on the famed portrait of the founder of Communist China.
   A witness said the two men, wearing the white headbands of
student protesters, were jumped on by students and taken to
Tiananmen Square. Student leaders later insisted the men were not
students.
   Thousands stopped to watch the 90-minute operation of lifting
the new portrait into place. They cheered and clapped when the work
was completed.
   As in the previous three nights under martial law, a constant
stream of supporters walked, bicycled and motorcycled around the
square, occupied by tens of thousands of students.
   Most of the troops that moved into city outskirts Friday night
had withdrawn to points further away from the city, and residents
had removed many of the barricades they had set up to block a troop
advance into the city.
   The students decided earlier in the day to continue their
occupation of the square even though thousands of demonstrators had
returned to their schools. More than half of the protesters on the
square hail from outside Beijing.
   ``I voted that we should go back because many of the Beijing
students are alrady leaving,'' said Gua Haifeng, a student leader
from Beijing University. ``But the student union insists on
struggling until the end. They want to see the government fall.''
   ``We just couldn't leave,'' said a student from Lanzhou, a
western city about 750 miles from Beijing. ``Tiananmen Square is
the center of our student movement. If it died, the movement in
Lanzhou and all around China would die, too.''

   Ethnic Turks were reported killed and
injured when security forces in Bulgaria opened fire during weekend
protests, emigres and diplomats said today.
   They said the confrontations were the most violent outbursts
since a campaign in the early 1980s by Bulgaria's communist
authorities to get ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names,
restrict their Moslem religious rites and to bar the Turkish
language in public.
   A diplomat reached in Sofia said he has heard reports of
fatalities but did not know how many casualties there were when
4,000 to 5,000 protesters clashed with troops in Razgrad, 160 miles
east of Sofia. About 200 people were arrested, he said.
   The area in northeastern Bulgaria is home to many of the 900,000
ethnic Turks in the Balkan country.
   Tanks, helicopters and a heavy security force presence were
deployed around Razgrad and Shumen, where demonstrations also took
place, and communications to Razgrad were cut, the diplomat said.
The area is home to many of the 900,000 ethnic Turks in the Balkan
state.
   Emigre sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said troops
opened fire on thousands of people who walked from nearby villages
to protest in northeastern Kaolinovo on Saturday, demanding more
rights for ethnic Turks.
   Troops and police let the protesters into the town, but later
opened fire on the crowd, the source said.
   Another emigre said thousands of ethnic Turks also took to the
streets near the ethnic Turkish cities of Kurdzhali and Dzebel, in
southern Bulgaria.
   A spokeswoman of the Committee of the Rights of Man, a
government-approved group in Bulgaria, told The Associated Press by
telephone from Sofia that she could not confirm the reported
protests or killings.
   There is a long history of conflict between the Turks and
Bulgarians, who were under Turkish rule for 500 years before 1863.

   Jury selection began under tight
security today for the bank robbery trial of two men, one of whom
is also accused of murdering a member of the gang to keep him from
testifying.
   The trial in federal court is the culmination of a case in which
another witness died of unknown causes and some suspects have been
accused of plotting to break out of jail, kill other witnesses and
flee to the Cayman Islands.
   Because of the alleged threats, courtroom halls were lined with
a metal detector, an X-ray machine and a handful of federal agents.
   John P. McCoy, 43, of Slater's Branch, Ky., and Doyle David
Moore, 27, of Lovely, Ky., are accused of conspiracy to commit bank
robbery and intimidating witnesses.
   McCoy is also charged with shooting to death Russell M. Davis of
Martin County, Ky., who was part of the robbery gang.
   The prosecutor said it was a chore coming up with an opening
statement.
   ``These people are just too zany,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ben Bryant. ``They've been watching too much television.''
   Authorities say McCoy masterminded the 1987 robbery of $286,000
from the Matewan National Bank in Kermit, 40 miles from Huntington,
and was joined by Moore, Davis and Harold D. ``Boonie'' Runyon, 39,
of Forest Hills, Ky.
   Davis met with Secret Service agents in Jacksonville, Fla.,
shortly after the robbery and agreed to become a witness. Days
later, authorities say, Runyon and McCoy took him to the top of a
Kentucky mountain and shot him in the head.
   ``He was a threat to us,'' Runyon said Friday in pleading guilty
to the slahing and conspiracy to commit robbery. ``There was no
reasoning with him. We took him to a hill and shot him.''
   Earlier this month, Timothy Lynn Sammons, 30, of Beauty, Ky.,
who reportedly was to be called as a witness in the trial, was
found dead in his car. Sammons, a friend of Davis, appeared before
the grand jury that indicted the alleged bank robbers.
   Martin County Coroner Jay Hinkle said Monday the cause of death
still has not been determined but said foul play is not suspected.
   And McCoy, Runyon and four others _ including McCoy's son _ were
charged May 6 in an alleged plot to break McCoy, Runyon and another
man out of jail, kill five witnesses and help the prisoners flee to
the Cayman Islands.

<HEAD>Soviet Citizenship Restored to Theater Director Yuri Lyubimov</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has restored the citizenship of
avant-garde director Yuri Lyubimov, founder of the Taganka Theater
who moved abroad in 1984 after being fired and ousted from the
Communist Party, Tass said Tuesday.
   Lyubimov, 71, returned briefly to the Soviet Union a year ago at
the invitation of the government, which said it was acting in the
spirit of reforms by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He came back
to stage another production in January.
   The official news agency said Lyubimov was stripped of his
citizenship ``at the height of the stagnation period'' _ the
current leadership's reference to the era of the late Soviet leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   ``But in the years of perestroika, which has dramatically
changed things in every field of life in Soviet society, including
art, it became possible for Lyubimov to begin working with the
Taganka troupe again,'' Tass said.
   According to Tass, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet restored
Lyubimov's citizenship at the director's request.
   Since leaving the country in 1984, Lyubimov has been living and
working mostly in Europe, but spent some time in the United States,
staging Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment'' in 1987.
   He is working in Moscow on a play about village life, titled
``Alive,'' a play banned 20 years ago, Tass said.

   Thieves stole $60,000 from the paymaster's
office of the Norwegian troops serving with the United Nations
peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, an officer said Tuesday.
   The robbery took place Sunday night at the headquarters of the
620-member Norwegian battalion in the southern village of Ibl
Al-Saqi, said the Norwegian officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He refused to elaborate, except to say an investigation is under

   The 5,800 United Nations troops, drawn from nine nations, have
been deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978. They occupy a six- to
10-mile strip that separates Israel's self-proclaimed buffer zone
from the predominantly Shiite sector of south Lebanon.

   Reformers in the new Soviet parliament scrambled
Tuesday to prevent the Communist Party from orchestrating the
opening session and cutting them out of positions of power.
   With the Congress of People's Deputies set to convene on
Thursday, progressives are gathering to share their ideas for
solving the Soviet Union's many crises. They also are gloating over
what they hope is the impending fall of the bureaucrats responsible.
   ``A year ago, they had nothing working against them, and now
they're holding on tooth and nail,'' said Ulo Vooglaid, a deputy
from Estonia.
   Members of cooperatives want to repeal a decree that kicked them
out of profitable businesses, Armenians want a solution to
festering ethnic problems, and Baltic leaders want economic
independence.
   A small group of Moscow-based reformers has written an alternate
agenda _ but progressives from around the country have not yet
coalesced enough to plan tactics to substitute their priorities for
those of the Communist Party.
   ``If we discuss things at the congress like we are discussing
them today, we won't accomplish anything,'' one unidentified
parliamentarian told the Moscow Deputies Club on Tuesday.
   Most speakers offered wish lists of problems to be tackled and
oppressive laws to be repealed.
   Meanwhile, the more-organized Communist Party, armed with
copying machines that long were outlawed in the Soviet Union, is
ready to ram through its own program. It has set its own agenda for
a short-lived congress, and devised its own slate for election to
the smaller working parliament where the real power will lie, said
historian Yuri Afanasiev, a deputy from Moscow.
   The 2,250-member Congress is the Soviet Union's first
representative parliament in more than 70 years to be chosen in
largely multicandidate elections. But it is supposed to meet just
once a year to elect a 542-member Supreme Soviet that will serve as
the virtually full-time legislature.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee held a closed
session Monday to discuss the upcoming congress, and within hours,
its officials were trying to win deputies' support for the party's
slate for the Supreme Soviet.
   Russian federation president and Politburo member Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov presented a Monday night meeting of deputies from the
Russian republic with a list of 147 party-approved representatives
to be named from Russia, said Sergei Stankevich, a leader of the
Moscow Deputies Club.
   ``Many deputies on the list never even knew they were
selected,'' Stankevich said. ``They were just appointed again'' by
the party leadership without any input from the public or their
elected representatives, he said.
   Stankevich said he could agree with some people on the list,
such as human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, but many were the
same old bureaucrats and the Russian deputies managed to avoid
taking a vote on the party slate.
   But Afanasiev said such timid responses won't be sufficient.
   Deputies at that meeting ``looked like rabbits facing a
python,'' he said. ``We should not plead. We should demand.''
   The progressives' idealism seems to be working against any
serious backroom politicking in the remaining hours before the
opening of the congress.
   ``We are working out a list'' of progressive deputies to suggest
for the Supreme Soviet, Stankevich allowed. ``But in principle, it
should be done at the congress.''
   The Moscow club, which attracted reformers from Kiev, the
Baltics and Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea, decided its first battle
must be preventing the party from scheduling the election of the
president and Supreme Soviet to be first on the agenda.
   Progressives want the congress at the very least to pass
resolutions on key points of economic and political reform before
turning power over to the Supreme Soviet.
   Sakharov goes further, calling for the congress to replace the
Supreme Soviet as the legislative body.
   ``If someone stands up with a list, and we vote for it, we have
failed,'' Afanasiev said.
   Maverick communist Boris Yeltsin read the Moscow reformers'
agenda to the party plenum on Monday but it was ignored, several
deputies said.
   The Communist Party continued its organizing efforts Tuesday
with a meeting in the Grand Kremlin Palace of deputies who are also
party members. It was open to any deputy but closed to the public
and journalists.
   Another closed meeting was scheduled for Wednesday to finalize
the agenda for the congress.
   Around the country, hopes are rising the congress will prove the
salvation of the nation, taking action on issues from the crippled
economy to control of the KGB.
   ``The people expect very much _ unfortunately,'' said Yuri
Shcherbak, a Kiev deputy known for his writings on the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant disaster. ``The people expect us to be able to
solve everything immediately.''
   Another deputy, who identified himself as a pilot from
Astrakhan, warned that ``if the congress is not democratic, the
tension will increase in the country. If we fail, it will be even
worse.''

   As rumors about resignations and troop movements
fly throughout Beijing, Chinese are searching for a rare commodity:
reliable information.
   Rumors have been rife since the students began their occupation
of Tiananmen Square on May 13, calling for democratic reforms,
press freedom and an end to corruption.
   There were early reports that Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang
had resigned, offered his resignation or had been fired. Others
said Premier Li Peng, the hard-line head of government who has
refused to give in to student demands, was forced to step down
because of the unpopularity of martial law which he imposed
Saturday. Still other reports said senior leader Deng Xiaoping had
resigned.
   In keeping with the tightly controlled nature of the communist
government, none has been officially denied, and few can be
confirmed.
   The Tiananmen protesters rely on a network of what the Chinese
call ``xiaodao xiaoxi,'' or ``information via small paths'' _ the
grapevine.
   ``I heard from someone'' is an oft-repeated refrain concerning
locations of tanks, armored vehicles and personnel trucks. One
rumor that has been confirmed by separate Chinese sources is that
up to 70,000 troops have moved into buildings surrounding the
square, ready to swoop in on protesters.
   Activists are sent to the countryside to inform students there
of developments at the heart of the movement. Others converge on
Beijing bringing news of protests, as well as money raised to
support the protests.
   Many reports brought to the square by word of mouth are blared
over an improvised system of loudspeakers the students call the
``broadcast station.''
   In the first week of the protests, little news of the students'
activities was conveyed by the state-controlled press. But the
Science and Technology News printed some of the anti-government
slogans on April 23, and on May 9, emboldened journalists
petitioned the government for press freedoms.
   By the time of street protests involving more than 1 million
singing and chanting marchers May 16, papers were splashed with
photos of demonstrators, letters supporting them and even pictures
of journalists linking arms in the name of democracy. Viewers saw
basically unbiased TV reports as well.
   The People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper,
backed down from a shrill April 26 editorial calling the student
movement ``a planned conspiracy,'' and covered the students with
unusual candor.
   But with martial law came toned-down press reports, less
coverage on TV, and statements and letters urging the students to
leave the square.
   On Monday, the People's Daily sent mixed signals. It carried a
stern commentary saying a few people were manipulating the
students' movement and that all soldiers supported the army's role
under martial law, something that sources within the People's
Liberation Army say is not true.
   But there also was a photograph of crowds cheering a retreating
army truck with a smiling officer saluting them back, and a report
from Budapest on how Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth condemned the
use of military force to quell domestic uprisings.
   The newspaper apparently was trying to convey that the army was
there to do a job, but that it was the friend of the masses.
   News reports Tuesday noted that while nearly a million people
took part in marches around the square, life in the capital had
``returned to normal.''
   One of the main sources of information for Chinese has been the
Voice of America and the BBC.
   ``We always listen to VOA,'' said a student on the square from
Changsha in Hunan province, the hometown of Mao Tse-tung. ``It's
pretty objective and they tell us a lot more than television.''
   VOA estimates its listening audience for its Chinese-language
broadcasts is in the tens of millions.
   But Chinese authorities began jamming VOA broadcasts Monday, and
students on Tiananmen Square asked foreigners why the broadcasts
had stopped.
   There has also been a surge in the number of telephone calls to
China from the United States. AT&amp;T, the only U.S. telephone company
that handles calls to China, reported more than 30,000 calls on
Friday, the day before martial law was declared, about three times
the normal number.

   Lawyers began questioning 70 potential jurors
today for the perjury trial of former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall on
charges of lying to a grand jury about a loan deal.
   Defense attorneys asked the judge to strike one of the first
people interviewed after he admitted having ``subliminal'' feelings
against Swindall.
   But the juror later said he would be able to follow the doctrine
that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty, and U.S. District
Judge Richard Freeman allowed him to remain. ``You can't get a
perfect jury,'' Freeman said.
   The judge has said he wants to see if an impartial jury can be
seated before ruling on Swindall's request to move the trial out of
town because of publicity.
   On Monday, Freeman said Swindall's attorneys want the court to
exclude from evidence secretly recorded talks among Swindall,
money-launderer Charles LeChasney and an undercover agent. Freeman
did not immediately rule on the request.
   The former two-term Republican congressman was indicted Oct. 17
on 10 counts of perjury. Each charge carries 10 months to five
years in prison.
   The 38-year-old conservative evangelical is accused of lying
under oath to a federal grand jury in 1988 about his dealings with
LeChasney and with Mike Mullaney, a federal agent posing as a money
broker, possibly for drug dealers.
   Swindall lost his seat representing Atlanta's eastern suburbs to
Democrat Ben Jones in November's election.
   Prosecution briefs unsealed earlier showed the government
building a claim that Swindall plotted to lie publicly about a
shady loan deal, then did lie about it.
   In one brief unsealed in the court, prosecutors argued that
public statements Swindall made after his allegedly false grand
jury testimony are relevant to the case because they point to ``a
continuation of Swindall's attempts to limit his own potential
criminal exposure.''
   Swindall's attorneys want the tapes thrown out, on the grounds
that they have no bearing on whether he perjured himself earlier.
   In one conversation that prosecutors want to enter as evidence,
Mullaney, posing as a broker funneling Swindall money through
LeChasney as middleman, asked Swindall what he would say if anyone
started asking questions.
   ``What's wrong if I say I sold the note to someone Charles
LeChasney introduced me to and I don't know what his name is and I
really didn't care.'' the congressman replied.
   ``There's no question in this transaction that I am basically
using Charles as my buffer,'' Swindall said in another conversation
related in the prosecution document.

   U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range
nuclear weapons will resume on June 19, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III announced today.
   The talks were suspended last November with about 90 percent of
the work completed on a new treaty sharply cutting back
ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines.
   The negotiations tentatively had been set to resume in February,
but President Bush ordered a delay for a reassessment of U.S. arms
control policy and strategic weaponry.
   The review was recently concluded, and Baker on a trip to Moscow
two weeks ago reached an agreement with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for a resumption of the negotiations. The precise date in
June was left open until now.
   The Soviets had been eager to resume but waited for completion
of the review.
   Baker has said the U.S. position in the Geneva talks would be to
pick up where the Reagan administration left off as it sought a
cutback of 30 percent to 50 percent. But Baker said the
administration also reserved the option to make some changes. He
did not say what differences might emerge at the bargaining table.
   Among the unsettled issues are whether to try to restrict mobile
land-based missiles and how to verify reductions in such elusive
arms as sea-launched and air-launched cruise missiles.
   Max M. Kampelman, who was chief arms-control negotiator in the
Reagan administration, has said a treaty could be completed within
a few months. That is not clear in light of possible new U.S.
bargaining positions.
   The Soviets also were determined to restrict the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, program that seeks to construct a
defense against ballistic missiles.
   The strategic weapons are the most potent in the world.
   The two superpowers in 1987 concluded a treaty to eliminate
another class of nuclear arms _ intermediate-range missiles that
can travel from 300 to 3,000 miles. The pact also established a
system of verification that involves Soviet monitors going to U.S.
installations and American inspectors operating on Soviet territory.
   A third category of nuclear arms _ so-called battlefield or
tactical missiles _ has not been subject to negotiations.
   The West German government, with support from several North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, have urged the United States
to negotiate reductions or even total elimination of the
ground-based missiles with Moscow. But the U.S. position is that
the missiles should be improved and are essential to the defense of
Western Europe.
   Short-range nuclear weapons have a range of under 300 miles.

   Syrians shelled the Christian coast again
Tuesday and Lebanese appeared to have little hope that Arab leaders
meeting in Morocco could end an artillery war that has killed
hundreds of civilians.
   Police said at least three dozen shells fired from Syrian
positions in and near Moslem west Beirut hit the coast around
Byblos, an ancient port 20 miles north of the capital.
   No casualties or serious damage were reported from the shelling,
intended to prevent ships from delivering arms and food to the 1
million Christians besieged in their 310-square-mile enclave north
and east of Beirut.
   Syrian forces have continued bombarding the coast north of the
city despite a cease-fire called May 11 by the Arab League, which
began a summit Tuesday in Casablanca.
   Christian military units, as well as the Syrians and Druse
militiamen allied with them, were reported to be resupplying
artillery and rocket batteries in preparation for a renewal of
major fighting.
   ``No one's making a secret of it,'' a police spokesman said.
   A Christian official said: ``The atmosphere is one of
preparation for a major outbreak of fighting.''
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League and has become the main power broker
in the chaos of a 14-year-old civil war.
   The latest fighting began March 8, two days after Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian army units blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem
militias. Druse militiamen led by Walid Jumblatt responded with
artillery fire and Syrian gunners soon joined them.
   A mediation committee from the Arab League has been trying to
stop the fighting, which police say has killed at least 359 people
and wounded nearly 1,400, almost all of them civilians.
   Syria pledged to observe the truce on land but said its forces
would continue shelling the Christian coast to prevent resupply by
sea.
   In recent days, Syrian gunboats operating from Tripoli in
northern Lebanon have turned back at least one ship _ a freighter
bound for the Christian enclave with a cargo of food.
   Christians say they have been able to land three shiploads of
ammunition and food by using small boats to ferry the supplies
ashore at night from cargo vessels anchored several miles out.
   Iraq has supplied arms to the Christians since a cease-fire Aug.
20 in its 8-year-old war with Iran. Iraq and Syria, which supported
Iran in the war, are enemies of long standing.
   On Monday and Tuesday, the Syrians were seen moving more than 60
truckloads of ammunition from the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon to
artillery and rocket positions in west Beirut.
   Soldiers unloaded howitzer shells, rockets and mortar rounds
from dozens of trucks along beaches near the airport, where most of
Syria's heavy weapons are deployed.
   Aoun and his allies of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian
militia, also were trucking ammunition to artillery emplacements. A
Christian source said food, drinking water and fuel were being
stockpiled.
   In west Beirut and other Syrian-controlled areas, civilians were
buying up canned food, bottled water and fuel in expectations of
having to spend days in underground bunkers. Shops and banks
sandbagged entrances and windows.
   Lebanon's seat at the summit is vacant because other Arab
nations do not recognize either of the rival governments set up
when President Amin Gemayel's term ended in September and
Parliament could not agree on a successor.
   Gemayel, also a Christian, named Aoun to lead the government but
Moslems rejected the army commander and swore allegiance to Salim
Hoss, the premier under Gemayel.
   Soon after that the army also split into Christian and Moslem
commands, with Aoun leading the 20,000 Christians and Maj. Gen.
Sami Khatib in charge of the 22,000 Moslems.
   Under an unwritten agreement since independence from France in
1943, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni Moslem
and the parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.

   Drugs addicts at the Dade County Stockade got the
point today _ 10 points to be exact _ as part of a treatment
program using acupuncture.
   The new program will treat 1,500 inmates at a cost of about
$600,000 a year, said Circuit Judge Herbert Klein, the county's
anti-drug coordinator.
   ``I don't feel there's any other way I could be helped. This is
the last way,'' said Terry Henderson, 20. He described the
insertion of 10 two-inch needles in his ears as feeling ``like a
mosquito bite.''
   Henderson is serving a one-year sentence for cocaine sale and
possession. He said he smoked crack daily before his arrest.
   The program is aimed at helping addicts relax and reducing their
craving for drugs. But some doctors say there haven't been enough
scientific studies to determine if acupuncture actually eases
withdrawal symptoms.
   Acupuncturist Bill Berlin, who has been pushing for the program
for four years, said he has an 80 percent success rate in private
practice. But he said the jail program would be more difficult.
   ``Part of the recovery is rebuilding their lives as well as
eliminating the need for drugs,'' he said. ``Counseling is the
other half of the drug treatment.''
   Developed more than 2,500 years ago by the Chinese, acupuncture
is a technique to relieve pain and stress by inserting needles into
specific points on the body that are believed to affect organs and
bodily functions.
   Klein endorsed the program, which originated at a New York City
hospital, after finding at least three-quarters of the defendants
entering the Miami courts are on drugs.
   In the acupuncture program that started Monday, 224 inmates will
undergo daily ``needling,'' as Klein called it, and intensive
therapy for four weeks.
   For the next 12 weeks, prisoners will receiveless-frequent
acupuncture treatments while attending educational and vocational
programs and joining work details.
   In the final 30 days of treatment, inmates will be moved to a
detention center, assigned to kitchen duty and continue drug abuse
treatment.

   Communist Party maverick Boris N. Yeltsin was
relieved of his government job Tuesday at his request following his
landslide election to the new Soviet parliament, Tass reported.
   Yeltsin, 58, was named first deputy chairman of the State
Construction Committee after being fired as Moscow party boss in
November 1987. He lost the important party post after lashing out
at the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Yeltsin had vowed to quit his government job if he were elected
to the new Soviet parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. He
ran on an anti-establishment ticket challenging the powers of party
and state bureaucrats, and Moscow voters gave him almost 90 percent
of the vote in elections held in March.
   The congress holds its first session Thursday. Yeltsin was
discharged from his State Construction Committee job by the
Presidium, the nation's top executive body, on Tuesday, the
official news agency said.

   A massive undersea earthquake was
recorded today north of Australia's Macquarie Island near New
Zealand, officials said.
   Kevin McCue, senior research scientist at the Australian
Seismological Centre, said the quake occurred at 6:54 a.m. EDT and
measured about 7.2 on the Richter scale.
   The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake measured 8.2 on
the Richter Scale and said it was the strongest temblor this year
anywhere in the world. It was the strongest since one measuring 8.1
on October 20, 1986, in the Kermadec Islands in the Pacific, the
survey said.
   McCue said a stretch of seabed apparently was ruptured in a
large movement at the junction of the Australian and Pacific
plates, about 850 miles east of Christchurch, New Zealand,
according to the Australian Associated Press.
   Alison Clifton, Australia's Macquarie Island station leader,
said by telephone that a ``fairly severe'' quake rattled buildings
at the base but did no damage, the Australian news agency reported.
   ``It was pretty noisy,'' she said. ``It was certainly sizeable.''
   In Nepal, an earth tremor measuring 5 on the Richter scale
rocked Manebhanjyang, 175 miles east of Katmandu, at 4:25 p.m. EDT
Monday, according to the department of mines and geology.
   It said there were no reports of casualties or property damage.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5
can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0
can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska hit
8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

<TEXT>
   The provincial court refused today to
register the pro-Solidarity Independent Students Association,
causing howls of surprised anger and chants of ``Down with
Communism!'' from a packed courtroom.
   Warsaw Provincial Judge Danuta Widawska was unable to explain
the decision in the tumult that followed it.
   Provincial court chairman, Edward Sadkowski, later said the
decision stemmed from the student group's claim of the right to
strike. Polish law does not specifically grant students that right,
he said.
   Students said they may boycott June 4 parliamentary elections
because of the decision. Some accused the court of trying to
confuse and divide the opposition before the elections.
   Before the decision, a lawyer for the student association, known
by its Polish initials NZS, argued that registering the group would
fulfill the promises that communist authorities made during talks
with the Solidarity-led opposition.
   Lawyer Piotr Andrzejewski noted authorities objected to the
association's statute permitting strikes. But he told the court
such strikes have a long tradition in Poland and are not forbidden.
   About 200 students angered by the rejection marched for about a
half mile from the court chanting, ``Down With Communism!'' and
``We will make a second China!'' referring to huge student
demonstrations in Beijing.
   Scuffles broke out with police when they reached a main square,
and several protesters were arrested.
   Piotr Czerwiec, a student leader, said the association would
appeal the court's decision to the Supreme Court this week, but it
appeared unlikely a decision could be made before the June voting.
   Students have played an active role in helping Solidarity
candidates in elections bringing the first democratic voting in
Poland since World War II. Registration of the students'
assocation, like the legalization of the independent workers union
Solidarity and the farmers union Rural Solidarity, was a condition
for the opposition agreeing to participate in the elections.
   All three organizations were banned when martial law was imposed
in Poland in December 1981. The other two were legalized during the
talks earlier this year with communist authorities on enacting
reforms.
   Solidarity is waging a spirited campaign for candidates to a new
100-member Senate, the first fully democratic legislative chamber
in the East bloc. The opposition also is contesting 161 seats in
the existing 460-member parliament. The rest are reserved for the
ruling Communist Party and its allies.
   Some student leaders blamed older Solidarity leaders for not
fighting more for their association.
   ``Solidarity ... did not press hard enough,'' said Andrzej
Jesionowski, a member of the student association's National
Commission.
   Earlier, about 300 students packed the courtroom with a handful
of older Solidarity advisers. The rejection came as a shock.
   ``Down with Communism!'' someone shouted as soon as Mrs.
Widawska announced the rejection. Then the whole room erupted in
the angry chants and stamping feet.
   ``Do you want to hear the justification?'' the judge said
through her microphone.
   ``No!'' students shouted back, and Mrs. Widawska and two
assistant judges hurriedly left the bench.

<HEAD>Swedish Researchers Claim to Repeat Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish physicists said today they
produced a burst of neutron radiation in a room-temperature
experiment, repeating the work of two chemists who claimed to have
achieved cold fusion in a jar.
   The scientists at the Manne Siegbahn Institute for Physics said
their method was similar to the experiment that chemists Stanley
Pons and Martin Fleischmann said they conducted at the University
of Utah.
   In March, the two claimed to have produced sustained fusion in a
jar at much colder temperatures than previously thought possible.
Repeated attempts by other scientists to duplicate the
Fleischmann-Pons experiments have failed.
   Birger Emmoth, Magnus Jandel, Irena Gudowska and Waclaw Gudowski
said in a press release they ran an electrical current between
platinum and palladium electrodes immersed in heavy water
containing deuterium, a variety of hydrogen.
   ``The results indicate fusion reactions can occur at low
temperatures in the electrode material palladium. This gives
certain support to Fleischmann and Pons ideas,'' the release said.
   The results were reported in a paper to be published by the
scientific journal Physica Scripta. It did not say when their
findings might appear in the journal.
   In their tests, the scientists obtained increasing neutron
radiation reaching a level up to 10 times greater than natural
background radiation and lasting up to four hours.
   The group said the experiment is difficult to repeat because
many factors can affect the process. In some case their tests
produced no surplus neutrons.
   Birger Emmoth told Stockholm daily, Svenska Dagbladet, the tests
were easier to repeat using new palladium plates of sufficient
size, rather than already used plates and small ones.
   Electrodes used by the group were three millimetres thick and
weighed 40 grams, Svenska Dagbladet said.
   ``Also the character of a time limited `burst' of course are in
line with (Pons and Fleischmanns) results, even though theirs were
longer, almost 24 hours,'' he said.
   Their experiments, in cooperation with the Royal Institute of
Technology and Arrhenius Laboratory in Stockholm, began in early
April.

<HEAD>Baker Says Missile Dispute Unresolved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today that a U.S.-West German dispute over short-range missiles in
Europe remains unresolved and ``there is still a gap to bridge.''
   Baker's comments, at a briefing for reporters on next week's
40th anniversary summit meeting of NATO, indicated that the Bush
adminstration and the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl had yet
to find a common ground, despite a succesions of proposals and
counter-proposals that have crossed the Atlantic.
   The dispute, over whether to negotiate with the Soviet Union on
cutting the nuclear arsenals of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Warsaw Pact in Europe, has split the Western
alliance.
   West Germany generally has supported such talks. The United
States has voiced opposition to them so long as the East maintains
a superiority in conventional weapons.
   President Bush had voiced optimism as recently as Sunday.
   Baker said today: ``We're very hopeful that it will be resolved
before the summit. And we remain hopeful. I can't tell you that we
know that it will be.''
   Last Friday, the U.S. side gave West German Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg a compromise offer that officials in Bonn
privately said opened the door to U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the
missiles eventually.
   On Monday, Kohl sent to Washington his response to that
counterproposal. U.S. officials did not detail what was contained
in the latest West German offer but said it did not move the
process any further along to a compromise.
   Baker told reporters the ``stumbling block'' was how to draft a
compromise plan that would take into account the new mood in
Western Europe for greater disarmament while preserving an
``adequate deterrence.''
   ``Negotiations would be a mistake, I still feel strongly,''
Baker said of proposals for East-West talks at this time on
reducing NATO's short-range nuclear weapons.
   In addition to opposing talks on reducing the weapons, the
United Staes would like to upgrade and extend the range of the
American-made Lance missiles now stationed in Western Europe, most
of them in West Germany.
   Asked if the United States and West Germany was any closer to
resolved their differences on the issue, Baker said: ``It is not
resolved. There is still a gap to bridge. And we'll continue to
work to try to bridge that gap.''
   Asked whether the dispute would have a lasting harmful effect on
NATO, he said: ``The alliance has survived many greater threats to
its existence than this.''
   ``You've got to have the unity of the alliance and then you must
have arms control policies to support that, and you must have
adequate deterrence. We have a wide range of common interests in
the alliance ... We are going to be dealing with all of these, not
just (short-range missiles).''
   Baker called recent Soviet arms-reduction proposals and
statements ``mostly a PR (public relations) ploy.''

<HEAD>Soviet Manned Space Program Costs $2.38 Billion Since 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union spent $2.38 billion on its manned
space program since it launched the Mir space station in 1986, and
it has returned only $600,000 in commercial fees, the head of its
space agency said Tuesday.
   Alexander Dunayev, director of the Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, noted, however, that the true profits of space research
cannot be measured by monetary gains.
   He told a news conference that it was the medical and space
research that made the manned space program valuable, not the hard
currency brought about by the sale of stamps canceled in space or
the experiments paid for by third parties.
   Mir, the showcase project of the Soviet space program that was
intended to be permanently manned, was put in mothballs in April
because of its expense.
   Dunayev said the expense of the Soviet program compared
favorably with expenditures with Western countries, including the
United States and Japan.
   ``These expenditures are economically sound, but the question is
whether we should continue on the same scale,'' Dunayev said,
adding that the fate of the entire space program would be in the
hands of the new Congress of People's Deputies, which begins
meeting Thursday.
   ``We (space officials) understand it is of the highest priority
to science, and the world scientific community knows this,'' he
said.
   However, Dunayev said all delegates to the congress might not
grasp the significance of manned space research and the agency
would make every effort to educate them. ``When they understand,
they will be able to take the decision to increase or decrease
spending,'' he said.
   Cosmonaut Alexander Volkov, who along with Sergei Krikalev and
Valery Polyakov returned to Earth on April 27 after putting Mir
into automatic flight for four months, complained that Soviet firms
refuse to use or pay for information gathered during manned flights.
   ``We send information to regions, but many times they do not use
it. I regret that what we do, we sometimes do in vain,'' he said.
   ``I have this impression that space and Earth are working
separately from one another,'' he said. ``Cosmonauts are sending
the information, but there is no response from Earth.''
   He said that if used properly, the information could be used in
agriculture and mining to reap financial benefits for the state.
   Officials said in April that the overall space effort _ both
manned and unmanned programs _ makes money. In 1988, Dunayev said,
$2.1 billion was spent while economic benefits from the various
segments of the program, including communications and research, was
$3.2 billion.

   City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin entered the
mayor's race today, saying New Yorkers want a change after 12 years
under Ed Koch.
   The 53-year-old Democrat, who has held the elective
comptroller's post nearly 16 years, said he has the honesty,
toughness, compassion and experience to run the city.
   He said he senses ``a tremendous feeling among the people of New
York. They want a change.''
   Goldin said he would start a Department of Children, expand the
student dropout program, use more pension funds for housing and
``take the handcuffs off the cops.''
   Also running on the Democratic side besides Koch is Manhattan
Borough President David Dinkins. Among the Republicans, former U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani faces cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder.
   Prior to his announcement of candidacy today, Goldin today
declared the city ``can be livable.''
   ``One of the reasons I'm running for mayor ... is that I have
the experience and knowledge ... to make it work and to make it
function,'' he said.

   Jim Wright's defense opened before a national
television audience today with his lawyer urging the House ethics
committee to ``stand in the way of the lynch mob'' seeking the
House speaker's resignation.
   ``According to the press, Jim Wright's through. He's got to
resign his speakership. Maybe even his seat in Congress,'' said
Stephen Susman, attorney for the Texas Democrat.
   ``Why worry about due process for a dead man?'' he asked
rhetorically. ``Why should this committee stand in the way of a
lynch mob or a conviction based upon guilt by association?''
   Because ``if a member of Congress cannot get a fair trial, ...
no American can,'' he said.
   The arguments were made in a trial-like setting, with Susman and
his team at a ``defense'' table and the ethics committee
investigators poised behind an identical table across the room. A
central lectern allowed the lawyers to speak while standing before
the committee, which sat behind a raised, wood-paneled dais.
   Wright's wife Betty arrived during Susman's arguments and took a
seat in the front row of the audience. One of the speaker's
daughter's also attended, but Wright himself did not.
   Susman was asking the ethics committee today to dismiss key
charges against Wright based on different interpretations of the
House rules. Supporters hope for a narrow legal victory that the
speaker could parlay into political salvation.
   However, Richard Phelan, the outside counsel who investigated
Wright for the committee, argued that the panel should not look
narrowly at the legal arguments. The House code of conduct was
designed to be comprehensive, he said.
   ``This case and this discussion is not about loopholes in tax
codes,'' Phelan said. ``It's not about carefully crafting
legislation to permit persons to evade, or to circumvent or to look
askance.''
   Wright's lawyers contend he is being judged by a new, harsher
standard that goes far beyond the letter of House rules. In advance
of today's hearing, they gave themselves no better than an even
chance of winning dismissal of at least some of the 69 counts
against him.
   But with Wright's political support eroding under the weight of
serious ethics charges, even the speaker's supporters emphasize the
importance of persuading the ethics committee to drop at least one
of the two main charges.
   In the month since the panel formally made its charges against
the speaker, his support has eroded. Members of his own party have
begun holding meetings to discuss his case and its possible harmful
effect on their own political situations.
   The stakes in today's arguments were heightened by the ethics
committee's decision to allow television coverage of the hearing.
Rarely does the panel allow such open coverage, but Wright said he
welcomed the chance to have his side of the story presented.
   The C-SPAN cable network planned full coverage of the
proceedings.
   Susman, a tough, 48-year-old litigator from Houston brought in
this month to bolster the legal team, opened the proceeding for
Wright.
   Susman has a folksy manner that belies shrewdness. He
spearheaded the legal fight of Texas' Hunt brothers after they lost
big in a bid to corner the silver market, and he won a $400 million
case against price-fixing of cardboard boxes.
   Phelan, a skilled lawyer from Chicago who has conducted the
Wright investigation since last July, was the author of the tough
report that led to the charges.
   The ethics committee, made up of six Democrats and six
Republicans, was not expected to rule on the motion until later
this week.
   Wright's case for dismissal of the most serious charges rested
on two contentions:
   _That House rules categorically exempt book royalties from
limits on outside earned income.
   The ethics panel says Wright sold bulk quantities of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to groups he had spoken to instead
of accepting speaking fees, converting what would have been
improper income into something he could accept. Wright's lawyers
call that a tortured reading of the rules and contend book
royalties are unlimited, regardless of the circumstances in which
they are collected.
   _That lawmakers can accept benefits from longtime friends, so
long as they are not lobbyists or have other clearly defined direct
interests in bills before Congress.
   The committee contends that Wright's Fort Worth business
partner, George Mallick, had a direct interest in legislation
because of his extensive financial holdings, making the car,
condominium, and salary he paid Betty Wright improper gifts. The
speaker contends Mallick had no ``direct interest'' in legislation
as envisioned by the rules.
   If the committee were to agree with Wright's arguments, the case
against him would be reduced to a few relatively minor violations
of reporting requirements.
   The committee also is investigating but has not brought any
charges related to an oil and gas well investment that Wright and
Mallick made last year. The speaker earned $170,000 from that
transaction even though the well turned out to be a commercial
failure.

   Mankind's growth is accelerating again as the
world adds the equivalent of another Mexico every year, the
Population Reference Bureau reported Tuesday.
   The private research group said that the world's population
growth, after having slowed in the 1970s, is speeding up once more.
As of mid-1989, the world will contain about 5.24 billion people,
nearly a quarter-billion more than in 1987.
   Demographers Carl Haub and Mary Kent report that the expansion
from 5 billion to 6 billion could be attained in a record time _
within less than a decade _ if growth continues at current rates.
   The world is adding about 90 million people per year, slightly
more than the current Mexican population estimated at 87 million.
   The report is in line with one issued a week ago by Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the United Nations Population Fund. That
report agreed with the Reference Bureau estimate, and the U.N.
official called for increased access to family planning, education
and employment for women around the globe.
   Kent and Haub's comments accompanied the annual World Population
Data Sheet, a poster-size summary of world population trends
compiled annually by the private group.
   ``Even to reach a stable world population size of 10 billion,
double the current total, birth rates will have to begin a steady
descent soon,'' they said.
   There have been declines in the growth rate in some developing
countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, but there is
little evidence of change in many others, they reported.
   ``Unless we see declines in high fertility rates in many African
and Asian countries during the 1990s, the prospect for world
population to level out at less than 10 billion seems very dim,''
they said.
   ``As far as ultimate world population size is concerned, the
1990s will truly be a decade of decision,'' they added.
   At current rates, the world's population will rise to 6.3
billion by the year 2000 and to 8.3 billion by 2020, the group
estimated, adding that the planet's population will double in 39
years.
   The summary notes a sharp difference between developed and
developing nations.
   It reports developed nations currently contain 1.2 billion
people and will take 122 years to double their population. The
developing nations, however, already contain 4 billion and can be
expected to double in 32 years.
   China remains the most populated country on Earth with 1.1
billion people and an estimated doubling time of 49 years.
   Second is India with 835 million and it has a faster growth
rate. Expected doubling time there is 32 years.
   Far behind those two population giants, the Soviet Union is
third with 289 million people and a doubling time of 70 years.
   The United States is fourth in population at 248 million and
this country will likely take 98 years to double that number.
   Fifth is Indonesia, with 184.6 million people and a doubling
time of 35 years.
   Other nations with more than 100 million residents, and their
anticipated doubling times, are Brazil, 147 million, 34 years;
Japan, 123 million, 141 years; Nigeria, 115 million, 24 years;
Bangladesh, 115 million, 25 years; Pakistan, 110 million, 24 years.

<HEAD>OAS Delegation Arrives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A delegation from the Organization of
American States arrived here today to investigate charges that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega scrapped the results of national elections
to prevent an opposition victory.
   ``We will organize our work and seek meetings with government
and political figures so we can return to Washington to present a
report filling the mandate of the OAS,'' OAS Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares said in a statement after arriving at the airport.
   The organization last week condemned Noriega, the nation's
military chief and de factor ruler, and called for a transfer of
power.
   Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador said the mission
would ``tell all Panamanian sectors that there is concern in Latin
America about Panama's crisis.''
   The delegation is being welcomed by Panama's opposition, which
wants the organization to recognize its victory in May 7
presidential elections. International observers say the opposition
won the elections by a 3-1 margin. Noriega nullified the vote after
it was apparent his candidates were losing.
   Panama's government has warned the mission should not be turned

   About 120,000 people poured into Macao's narrow
streets Tuesday in the Portuguese colony's largest march to support
the pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   Students, workers, teachers, civil servants, businessmen and
native Portuguese joined the march, which paralyzed the colony's
traffic for two hours.
   The marchers handed an open letter to the Macao branch of the
Xinhua News Agency, China's unofficial representative in the
colony, which is to revert to Chinese rule in 1999.
   They urged Chinese Premier Li Peng to step down, protested
Beijing's press restrictions and vowed support for the students.
   Marches continued for the fourth consecutive day in Hong Kong,
while about 100 singers recorded a song in support of the students.
   About 8,000 technical institute students marched on Hong Kong
Island while 2,000 students from the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong
boycotted class and marched in downtown areas of the Kowloon
peninsula across the harbor.
   The British colony of Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese rule in
1997.

   Commuters crowded into buses and cars and onto the
sidewalks Tuesday during London's fourth illegal subway strike in
seven weeks.
   About 95 percent of London Underground's trains were canceled
after most of the system's 3,800 train crew workers stayed off
their jobs to publicize pay demands, a spokesman said.
   Buses and most British Rail trains were running.
   David Morris, a spokesman for London Regional Transport which
operates the London Underground, said only 30 of its 476 trains
were operating at the peak of Tuesday's morning rush hour.
   He said he could not predict how many workers would show up for
evening shifts on the 126-year-old system used by 3 million people
daily.
   Roads into and around the city were ``very, very congested,''
said Graham Lisle of the Automobile Association. ``Maybe because it
wasn't as widespread a strike as before, people thought the traffic
wouldn't be as bad.''
   Train drivers and guards are opposing changes that eventually
call for drivers to operate trains alone, and drivers are also
demanding extra pay to do so. The subway strikes began April 5.

   Two brothers died today in a house fire
apparently set by firebombs tossed at officers during a seven-hour
standoff, police said.
   The men inside the house fired at least two shots at officers,
said Lt. Al Jezior, police spokesman. Police did not return fire,
but SWAT officers shot tear gas into the house in an attempt to
drive the men out, he said.
   Officers were called Monday night by neighbors who said they had
been threatened by someone with a weapon. Police spoke with one
brother through a bullhorn but were unable to contact the other,
Jezoir said.
   Police told radio station WGAR one of the brothers may have been
holding the other hostage.
   Jezoir said the blaze began after at least four firebombs were
thrown toward officers. The Fire Department had been standing by
because one of the men had threatened to set the house on fire, the
spokesman said.
   After the flames subsided, police found the men dead, apparently
of smoke inhalation, police said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is meeting with a Chinese
leader to discuss the turmoil in Beijing, intent on maintaining a
moderate U.S. tone despite the Chinese decision to jam Voice of
America broadcasts for the first time in 11 years.
   The Chinese move apparently is an attempt to deprive
pro-democracy demonstrators of one of their main sources of
information.
   Hours after the jamming began, Wan Li, head of the Chinese
People's Congress, told Secretary of State James A. Baker that the
Beijing government places high priority on a return to normalcy
after five weeks of turmoil.
   Today, however, the Chinese lifted a martial law ban on
satellite transmissions of outgoing U.S. and other foreign news
videotape.
   Chinese authorities had cut off transmissions and the military
dismantled satellite earth stations after the government declared
martial law in Beijing on Saturday to put down growing student-led
unrest.
   Baker told reporters after the State Department meeting that Wan
said China ``would like to continue the process of opening up and
reaching out to both their own citizens and to the people around
the world'' but that goal depends on a restoration of stability.
   Baker said he also urged that there be no resort to violence on
either side in the conflict in China and added that he appreciated
the restraint that the government had shown thus far.
   Wan also met with Vice President Dan Quayle on Monday and was
due to meet Bush this afternoon.
   The jamming was the first by China of VOA transmissions since
before diplomatic relations with the United States were restored in
1979.
   VOA Director Richard W. Carlson said jamming was detected Monday
morning on three of five frequencies used for Mandarin language
broadcasts beamed to China.
   The demonstrators had been relying heavily on VOA broadcasts to
keep informed during the five weeks of pro-democracy protests.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said he was unfamiliar with
the VOA story, but he added, ``We are disturbed with any
interference with news media or communication.''
   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the White House was upset about the jamming but was
unlikely to raise a public complaint because of the delicacy of the
situation in Beijing.
   Bush has said he endorses the demonstrators' general goal of
more democracy, but he has been careful not to criticize the
Chinese leadership, which has been courted by a succession of U.S.
administrations.
   The VOA said the jamming was similar to past Chinese action
against Taiwanese broadcasts.
   Also Monday, Bush came under pressure from a coalition of
conservative organizations and from Americans for Democratic
Action, a liberal group, to take a firmer stand in support of the
demonstrators.
   But former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger praised the
administration's moderate approach and said a more meddlesome
policy could backfire.
   ``I don't think that any outsider can actually influence these
things now,'' Kissinger said. ``In China, one always has to be very
careful that the inherent nationalism and the sense of uniqueness
of the Chinese people doesn't turn against foreigners, who are then
accused of being imperialists.''

<TEXT>
   A coalition of civil rights, religious,
women's and other activist groups opened a campaign Tuesday
designed to pressure President Bush to sign a minimum wage increase
he has promised to veto.
   ``We believe that a veto of this desperately needed legislation
would be a tragic step backward for millions of America's working
people and their families,'' said Coretta Scott King, co-chairwoman
of the Citizens Committee for a Just Minimum Wage.
   ``By the stroke of a pen, he could replace despair with hope in
the lives of millions of our people,'' said co-chairman Arthur
Flemming, who was secretary of health, education and welfare in the
Eisenhower administration.
   The group, including representatives of dozens of labor,
religious, women's, community and political organizations, said the
first salvo in its effort would be a 30-second radio ad chastising
Bush for promising to veto the minimum-wage bill at a time he is
advocating tax breaks for the wealthy.
   ``Something's wrong here,'' a narrator says in the ad. ``America
should be a place where hard work pays off _ for everyone.
President Bush, don't deny working Americans a chance to help
themselves.''
   The rhetoric in the ad and by speakers at a news conference
announcing the effort was sharp, but the radio campaign itself is
modest. The coalition said it would spend $30,000 to air the spot
on 37 radio stations in 13 states and the District of Columbia this
week.
   Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation raising the
hourly minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991
while allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum wage
for up to two months. The Democratic leadership plans to send the
bill to the White House after the Senate returns from a week-long
recess. Bush has vowed to veto it; he had offered to support an
increase to $4.25 an hour provided all new employees could be paid
a subminimum for six months.
   Bush appears to have the strength to sustain a veto, meaning the
impasse could result in a ninth year passing without an increase in
the minimum wage, which rose to $3.35 an hour in 1981.
   ``For eight long years, full time minimum-wage earners have
waited for their country to reaffirm that their work would be
rewarded with a livable wage,'' Rabbi David Saperstein of the
Religious Action Center for Judaism Reform said. ``President Bush
would have them wait in vain.''
   Members of the group said they were organizing a letter-writing,
telegram and telephone campaign designed to pressure Bush and
lawmakers whose support would be needed to override a veto.
   The event was one of several planned by supporters of the
measure in the coming weeks, including mock signing ceremony likely
to be held by Democratic congressional leaders after the recess.
But Bush and other administration officials have said the president
will not be swayed in his first domestic-policy showdown with
Congress.

   Student activists Tuesday turned over to police
three young men whose zeal for the democracy movement led them to
vandalize the famed portrait of Mao Tse-tung that looks out over
Tiananmen Square.
   The three were hustled off by students occupying Tiananmen
Square soon after they threw black and red paint on the nearly
30-foot-high portrait of communist China's founding father.
   The official Xinhua News Agency later identified them as a
middle school teacher, a newspaper arts editor and a factory
worker, all from southern Hunan province, Mao's birthplace. All
were in their 20s.
   Xinhua said they arrived in Beijing on May 19 to participate in
the student movement for democratic reforms.
   Splotches of paint were scattered on Mao's neck, collar and one
eyebrow, and one long line of paint dripped down the side of his
mouth and nose.
   Workers later covered the portrait with green canvas, and
Tuesday evening a large crane appeared to hoist a new portrait into
place over the gate to the Forbidden City.
   Thousands of spectators, many who had come to the square to see
or support the student demonstrators, stopped to watch. The crowds
cheered and clapped when the job was completed. The old Mao was
driven off in a flatbed truck.
   Mao is regarded by most Chinese as a flawed figure who caused
great suffering with his purges of intellectuals, the economic
disaster of the Great Leap Forward and the catastrophic 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   However, he is still revered by Chinese as the father of the
nation.
   Some demonstrators in recent weeks have carried portraits of Mao
to show they preferred the high principles of a revolutionary such
as Mao to the corruption and self-interest they believe is
characteristic of many of today's leaders.

<TEXT>
   Less than half the federal senior-level
managers and executives responding to a survey said they were sure
they would go to work for the government again if they could
retrace their careers.
   And 71 percent said they felt their agency was experiencing a
``brain drain'' _ the departure of bright people for better
opportunities. They pointed to federal pay and benefits that have
failed to keep pace with non-government work, to better jobs
outside government and to a negative public image of federal
employees.
   Those who said they would not work for the government if they
were starting out again cited those same factors, plus the quality
of their leaders and the degree of bureaucractic control over their
jobs.
   The survey, made public Tuesday, was conducted by the alumni
association of the Federal Executive Institute, which offers a
four-week training course for senior people in government.
   Questionnaires mailed to 2,231 members last October drew
responses from 1,937 _ 80 percent of them still with the government.
   Forty-six percent of those who responded said they would choose
government work again while 24 percent would not and 28 percent
were unsure. The remaining 2 percent did not answer that question.
   Consistent with that result, 48 percent said they would not
encourage young people to have a federal career while only 41
percent would encourage them.
   Those who said they would chose government jobs if they had to
do it over again cited the challenging nature of the work, their
commitment to public service, personal satisfaction, the chance of
professional growth or advancement, the ability to have an
influence on public affairs, the pay and benefits, the degree of
management authority they exercise and job security.
   Even though less than half said they would do it again, far more
_ 69 percent _ expressed satisfaction with their jobs. Only 15
percent expressed disatisfaction.
   Fifty-four percent said they think the quality of newly employed
government people is lower than it was 10 years ago.

   Some of the vegetation in the contaminated zone
around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is growing to giant size,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   ``Some plants are exhibiting giantism,'' according to the
newspaper Lenin's Banner, including ``giant green pines'' near
woods that were left withered after the Ukranian plant's explosion
and fire in 1986 that spewed radiation into the air.
   Some tree branches and leaves are abnormally formed, and stamens
tend to split, the newspaper said.
   Tree buds have turned into leaves in seasons when they should
lie dormant, it said.
   The article denied rumors that rodents are proliferating within
a 18-mile radius around the stricken plant or that nothing has been
left alive in the area.
   ``Although there have been some genetic deviations noted in
rodents in the zone, no noticable changes in their condition or
behavior has appeared,'' the newspaper said.
   But it said the area's population of elk and wild boar seems to
have dropped.
   The Chernobyl disaster, the worst accident known to have
occurred at a nuclear power plant, left at least 31 people dead and
forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people.

   Soviet search ships have photographed the hulk of
a nuclear-powered submarine that sank off Norway last month and
found no increase in radiation in the area, Tass said Tuesday.
   The Komsomolets, laden with nuclear-tipped torpedoes, sank April
7 after a fire broke out on board. Forty-two Soviet seamen died in
the accident.
   The Soviet research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which
arrived May 16 in the waters where the sub sank, visually detected
the wreck with the help of deep-sea exploration vehicles it carries
and photographed it, the official news agency said.
   The research vessel also carried out surveys that showed that
``radiation levels at different depths and in ground samples does
not exceed background level and does not differ from the level
characteristic of remote areas of the world ocean,'' Tass said.
   The studies, including analyses of sediment samples, found no
``violations of the environmental situation'' caused by the sinking
of the sub, Tass said.
   The Soviets have said they have not yet decided whether to raise
it.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Tuesday warmly
praised a tax credit that encourages development of housing for
low-income Americans but said it opposes renewal of the law because
of budget problems.
   The housing credit ``can be an effective tool to achieve our
common objectives of providing decent, safe and affordable housing
for low-income families and to build bridges toward home
ownership,'' Housing Secretary Jack Kemp told the House Ways and
Means revenue subcommittee.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``the president's budget does not favor
the extension of the low-income tax credit at this time.''
   John G. Wilkins, acting assistant secretary of the treasury,
said that ``although the administration supports the objectives of
the low-income housing credit, we must carefully weigh competing
needs and existing programs in light of the budget deficit.
   ``The administration's budget includes substantial direct
expenditures for low-income housing,'' Wilkins said.
   The credit, which provides a subsidy for construction or
rehabilitation of housing rented to low-income families, is due to
expire at year-end. A state or local agency is permitted to
allocate credit authority of $1.25 per resident; the credit is
expected to cost about $325 million this year.
   Kemp noted that demand for the credit continues to grow;
preliminary figures for all states except Alaska indicate 68
percent of the allocation was used in 1988 and about 93 percent use
is forecast this year. Figures from state officials show the credit
was used last year to benefit more than 85,000 low-income housing
units.
   Bills to improve targeting of the credit have been introduced in
both houses of Congress, and Kemp said those proposals ``appear to
have made a major step toward resolving the shortcomings of the
current tax-credit program.''
   ``I pledge my cooperation in working with Congress toward the
enactment of a bill which efficiently directs the benefits of the
programs to those who are most in need of assistance and which
promotes the goal of increased housing opportunity,'' Kemp said.

   Donald E. Lukens admitted having sex with
an underage girl in November, a prosecutor charged today as the
congressman's trial opened.
   Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini said in opening arguments that
the 58-year-old Republican at first denied the accusations but
later admitted he had sexual contact with a 16-year-old at his
Columbus apartment.
   Ms. Mangini told the jury that the teen-ager went to Lukens'
apartment at the invitation of another girl and that Lukens not
only paid their cab fare but also gave them money after having sex
with the 16-year-old.
   Defense attorney Thomas Tyack said the congressman does not deny
that two girls came to his home on the night of Nov. 6, but the
lawyer cautioned that what happened inside the apartment is ``a
matter of dispute.''
   Lukens, who is divorced, is charged with contributing to the
delinquency or unruliness of a minor.
   He has denied the allegation, contending the girl's mother tried
to extort money from him. If convicted, he could receive up to six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   The congressman sat quietly and showed no emotion during opening
statements.
   Lukens was indicted after a secretly videotaped meeting with the
girl's mother. The tape, made by a TV station, showed him
apparently offering the woman a government job after she asked why
he was ``messing around'' with her daughter. Lukens also said he
did not realize the girl was underage.
   Following opening statements today, the girl's mother, Anna
Coffman, testified that she contacted the congressman in November
after she overheard her daughter and the other girl discussing
their visit with Lukens.
   Mrs. Coffman said she told Lukens her daughter was 16, and that
he asked to meet with her at a fast-food restaurant.
   ``I wanted to get him exposed for what he had did,'' Mrs.
Coffman said. She said she felt she would get no help from the
police and contacted TV station WSYX, agreeing to wear a concealed
microphone and be videotaped.
   Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove on Monday took under
advisement two motions by Ms. Mangini, who asked that only limited
testimony be allowed from the girl regarding two other cases in
which she is a witness. Ms. Mangini also asked that the girl's
juvenile record not be introduced as evidence.
   Tyack opposed both motions, saying the evidence would be needed
to determine the girl's credibility.
   The Columbus Dispatch reported today that Franklin County
sheriff's records indicate the girl was apprehended in 1986 in a
getaway car used in a robbery, and that she told detectives she had
supplied a gun to the robber.

   A woman was trapped for 48 hours in a

balcony, the Swedish news agency TT reported Tuesday.
   The chair's cloth tore and the chair folded as the 80-year-old
woman sat down, leaving her with her head between her knees, the
news agency said.
   The incident occured Saturday in Malmo in southern Sweden. On
Monday, a caretaker saw her sitting in a peculiar fashion on a
balcony across the street, according to the report.
   He alerted the police who forced the woman's apartment door open
and let her out of the chair. The woman, who was not identified,
was hospitalized in a state of shock, TT said.

<HEAD>Scholars Say Steps Would Help Black Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of prominent black scholars called
Tuesday for smaller, more personal schools, significant parental
involvement and other steps they said would help black children
achieve greater academic success.
   ``We believe it is the school's responsibility to overcome
social barriers that limit academic progress,'' said Sara Lawrence
Lightfoot, a Harvard University education professor and member of
the Committee on Policy for Racial Justice.
   ``What we demand is this: that the schools shift their focus
from the supposed deficiencies of the black child and the alleged
inadequacies of black family life to the elimination of the
barriers that stand in the way of academic success,'' Lightfoot
said.
   She spoke at a news conference to release the committee's
publication, ``Visions of a Better Way: A Black Appraisal of Public
Schooling.''
   Such a shift is essential if the United States is to have the
highly trained and educated work force it needs in the near future,
the publication said.
   ``All of our fates, all of our skins are wrapped up in better
education for black students,'' Lightfoot said. Unlike in earlier
times, she said, ``people have to stay in school to become
functioning members of the work force.''
   The publication cites barriers to black academic achievement,
among them deep-rooted social and economic inequities, mistaken
notions and stereotypes about lower-income people, misuse of
standardized testing and rigid tracking systems.
   Lightfoot, the lead author, said the most important way to
improve education for black children is to make schools more human
and personal. She said schools should be smaller or large schools
should be divided into schools-within-schools to combat the
invisibility that minority students often feel.
   Parents must be at the heart of the effort, she said, playing
significant roles in decisions ranging from curriculum to
disciplinary techniques.
   Lightfoot said the committee does not recommend abolishing
standardized testing or tracking systems that often put black
children on vocational rather than academic paths at very early
ages.
   But she said tests should never be used as the sole measure of a
student's achievements or intelligence and children should be
re-evaluated frequently so that they aren't permanently consigned
to ``a single box or category or track.''
   ``The whole system needs to be made much more subtle, much more
flexible, much more discerning,'' she said.
   The essay calls on the black community to make improving the
public schools its principal objective in the next decade. It says
the black middle class and black institutions such as churches and
fraternal organizations have a special responsibility to set
expectations and support academic development among black youth.
   Roger Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va., said black institutions are trying to meet the new
needs confronting them. ``We're trying to encourage more
institutions to adapt more rapidly,'' he said.
   But Wilkins added that ``we are not at all saying that our
community alone can combat the street culture. ... We are not here
to let the larger community off the hook'' when it comes to dealing
with drugs, crime, job opportunities, medical care and other needs.
   The committee recommends expanded funding for Head Start and
Chapter 1, the federal government's major programs for at-risk and
disadvantaged students. It also suggests closer ties between
schools and social services, recruitment of more black teachers and
an expanded curriculum that recognizes the realities of black
children's lives.

   A burglary suspect eluded police for months
then was released two days after his capture under a federal court
order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding.
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said police Lt. James Dickerson. ``We
spend money and time looking for people and then they're right back
out.''
   Frank Washington, 32, of Pittsburgh, had been sought by city
police since January in a series of burglaries.
   Detectives arrested him May 15 after tracking him to a bar, and
he was released from Allegheny County Jail two days later. Because
of overcrowding, Washington did not have to post his $20,000 bond.
   Police Cmdr. Ronald Freeman complained that the court order on
jail population, issued by U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill,
allows criminals to return to the streets.
   ``I certainly believe Judge Cohill has contributed greatly to
our crime statistics,'' Freeman said.
   The judge consistently refuses to comment on the issue.
   Warden Charles Kozakiewicz said he had no choice but to free
Washington under the judge's order _ he was among the prisoners
with the lowest bonds and was not accused of any of 14 serious
crimes that warrant keeping inmates in jail despite their bonds.
   ``It's distasteful to me and certainly not to my liking to
release anybody from jail,'' he said.

   Eric Lillie's parachute opened perfectly
after he jumped off a construction crane on an 18-story office
building early Tuesday but his landing was rough _ two police
officers were waiting for him.
   ``The officers were just passing by when they saw this guy jump
off the building,'' said Sgt. Jeff Hanson. ``The only question was
whether he was wearing a parachute.''
   The officers cited the 23-year-old Santa Monica man for
trespassing, then went back to the station to go over the books to
see if Lillie broke any other laws.
   ``It looks like trespassing is it,'' said Hanson. ``We found
something about parachuting and hang gliding and that in the city,
but it's only for city parks. Not office buildings.''

   Stung by sharp criticism from fellow
scientists, chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann shun
friend and foe alike these days to concentrate on a new round of
cold-fusion experiments.
   The pair have ignored an invitation to defend their work at a
conference sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory that
opened today in Santa Fe, N.M.
   They also turned down a meeting with the state panel that will
allocate a $5 million appropriation for fusion research at the
University of Utah.
   Pons and Fleischmann hope that two papers they are preparing for
submission to scientific journals will flesh out the sketchy data
they have provided so far, said James Brophy, the university's vice
president for research.
   ``They feel their time is more valuably spent in the lab getting
some of the details people have criticized them for not having,''
said Brophy, who planned to attend the sessions in Santa Fe.
   Pons and Fleischmann sent physicists around the world scurrying
to their laboratories when they announced in a March 23 news
conference they had sustained fusion in a bottle by running an
electrical current between platinum and palladium electrodes
immersed in ``heavy'' water containing deuterium, a variety of
hydrogen.
   But at subsequent scientific gatherings, Pons and Fleischmann
were accused of shoddy research and criticized for not publishing
enough information to enable others to duplicate their results.
   Scores of scientists have attempted to reproduce their
experiment, but few researchers have matched their results.
   The Workshop on Cold Fusion Phenomena, sponsored by Los Alamos
National Laboratory, could begin to clarify the many conflicting
claims and counterclaims still pouring out of university, national
and private laboratories.
   In abstracts of papers scheduled to be presented this week,
researchers largely dismissed the sensational claims of Pons and
Fleischmann, who works with Pons but is affiliated with the
University of Southampton, England.
   However, many of the presenters, from Los Alamos to New Jersey,
suggest enough low-level fusion is occurring to justify more
research into the territory.
   Today, Texas A&amp;M University physicists John Appleby and Kevin
Wolf offered qualified support for the chemists' claims at the
Santa Fe conference.
   Appleby said he found evidence of ``anomalous heat.'' Wolf said
separate tests turned up evidence that a small number of neutrons
and larger amounts of tritium had been released in experiments
similar to Pons and Fleischmann's.
   Wolf said the number of neutrons produced was up to seven times
the number expected in nature. ``Convincing?'' he asked
rhetorically. ``You be the judge.''
   About 500 physicists, chemists and other scientists from around
the world were expected at the conference.
   In Stockholm, Swedish physicists said today they produced a
burst of neutron radiation in an experiment similar to the those
conducted by the Utah chemists.
   ``The results indicate fusion reactions can occur at low
temperatures in the electrode material palladium. This gives
certain support to Fleischmann and Pons ideas,'' said scientists at
the Manne Siegbahn Institute for Physics.
   In an interview this week, Pons said his research was ``going
fantastic.'' Of the critics, he said, ``People are going to have to
eat a lot of crow, I'd say.''
   Originally, Pons and Fleischmann cited patent concerns for their
refusal to share specifics of their research. But six pending
patents now protect the basic experiment, and lack of time is the
only thing preventing the chemists from producing more detailed
accounts, Brophy said.
   Brophy said the new papers will include far more information
than the first Pons-Fleischmann article, published by the Journal
of Electroanalytical Chemistry, including details on heat
measurements.
   He said the pair now believe their experiment produces 100 times
more energy in the form of heat than it burns. Originally they
claimed a four-to-one ratio.
   The chemists contend that laboratories such as Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Yale and others have failed to reproduce
their results because they have not set up the experiments properly.
   If that is true, they should provide more information, said
Steven Koonin, a California Institute of Technology physicist.
   ``I'm not a patent lawyer, but I don't see why they are holding
back. The fact that they are makes me very suspicious,'' said
Koonin. ``If they're worried about patenting and processes, I would
think that's all locked up. If there's something there, they'll get
the credit.''

   Cozette Griffin and her husband had just
finished dinner when an unexpected visitor crashed through the
front door, tore though the house and left through a kitchen window.
   ``I heard ungodly crashes. The next thing I heard was my husband
say `Run,''' she said. ``I left for the nearest exit ... the
basement steps.
   ``About six feet ahead of me was undeniably a great big black
bear. It was so totally unreal.''
   Authorities estimated the bear weighed 200 to 275 pounds. Wild
bears are more common to the north than in the Portage area of
south-central Wisconsin.
   ``It will be indelibly etched in my memory,'' Mrs. Griffin said
Monday.
   Mrs. Griffin, 62, said she and her husband, LaVerne, 60, had
finished eating Sunday evening when they heard the noise at the
front door.
   She said she fled across the street to Divine Savior Hospital.
Her husband found refuge in the bathroom while the bear made its
visit that lasted only about 10 to 15 seconds.
   The bear apparently wasn't searching for food.
   ``Everything I left on the counter was there when it was all
over. Apparently a shrimp salad didn't tempt him in the least
bit,'' she said.
   Police Officer Tom Moore said the department had received a call
of a bear in the Griffins' neighborhood. He said he and a colleague
chased the bear from the Griffin home to the bottomland of the
nearby Wisconsin River, the last place he saw the animal.

   Rather than peek under graduation gowns
to enforce a dress code, the school board voted to let Chariho
Regional High School seniors wear what they want to commencement.
   The dress code, which would have required shirts with collars
and would have banned sneakers, blue jeans and shorts, was voted
down Monday night despite arguments that everyday clothing was not
appropriate for graduation.
   ``Are you going to look up everyone's cap and gown?'' committee
member Arthur Bernasconi asked. ``I'm not.''
   Betsy Conway said some students at last year's ceremony wore
T-shirts, jeans, tank tops or sandals, which she thought
inappropriate.
   ``Why should graduation be the same as a day on the beach
playing volleyball?'' Conway asked.
   Seniors who spoke at the meeting said their class had rejected
the dress code proposal by a 149-45 vote. They also said audience
members were more disruptive at last year's ceremonies than the
seniors.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and other foreign television networks
competed for satellite time Tuesday after Chinese authorities
lifted a martial law ban on transmitting.
   The major U.S. networks, Japanese TV stations and two Hong Kong
stations rushed to transmit their videotape after China Central
Television announced that satellite services had been resumed.
   ``It was a zoo. There was only one path out,'' said John
Sheahan, CBS bureau chief in Beijing.
   CCTV was ordered not to allow further television transmissions
and the military dismantled satellite earth stations after the
government declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday to put down
growing student-led unrest.
   After martial law was declared, Chinese authorities shut down
the satellite transmissions of CBS and Cable News Networks, which
had been broadcasting live from Beijing during the Sino-Soviet
summit but continued their reports after the high-level meeting was
over to show the student demonstrations. The Chinese authorities
said the networks had permission only to broadcast live while
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in China.
   Despite arguments from CBS and CNN, the government pulled the
plug on the networks. The satellite shutdown forced CBS, CNN and
the other U.S. networks to carry their videotape to other
countries, where it was transmitted back to the United States.
   On Tuesday, however, Sheahan said he was told that one earth
station was restored and CCTV received a call from military
authorities at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT) informing the state-run station
that it could decide on its own whether to provide transmitting
facilities.
   Thirty minutes later, CBS was notified the satellite service was
restored.
   All videotape had to be transmitted by way of London, with the
various networks taking turns sending in five- and 10-minute blocks.
   ``It was like going through a subway turnstile,'' Sheahan said.
``There was an enormous amount of good will among competitors.''
   CCTV's decision to resume satellite transmissions came amid
martial law regulations that banned nearly all reporting activities
by foreign reporters in Beijing.
   Despite the ban, there has been little government interference
in foreign coverage of the demonstrations.

<HEAD>Surge Undercuts Recession Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods surged
2.9 percent in April, the biggest advance since December, the
government said Tuesday in a report that further eased fears of a
recession this year.
   The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods
expected to last three years or more rose to a seasonally adjusted
$129.1 billion last month after a 1 percent increase in March.
   Those gains followed declines in January and February that had
raised concerns economic growth might be in danger of slowing so
much that the country could topple into a recession brought on by a
credit squeeze engineered by the Federal Reserve Board.
   But analysts said the back-to-back gains of the last two months
were a good indication that demand in the manufacturing sector will
be enough to keep the economy expanding this year, although at a
slower pace than 1988.
   David Wyss, an analyst with Data Resources Inc., said that while
he still believed economic growth was slowing, the
bigger-than-expected increase in orders in April showed the economy
is ``not softening quite as fast as a lot of people thought.''
   Priscilla Trumble, an economist for the WEFA Group of Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., said she believed the central bank was successfully
engineering a ``soft landing,'' in which economic growth slows
enough to dampen inflation but not enough to cause a slump.
   The April durable goods report, she said, ``does, in fact, make
me feel a little more comfortable that ... the bottom is not going
to fall out this year.''
   The report, added Robert Dederick, chief economist at the
Northern Trust Co., in Chicago, says that ``the manufacturing
sector is in no way showing a systemic weakness.''
   The Commerce Department said the April increase, the largest
since a 7.4 percent rise in December, was spread across all major
industrial categories.
   Excluding the volatile defense category, the April advance was
an even stronger 4.7 percent. The hike in non-defense orders was
the first since a 6.2 increase last December.
   Defense orders, which had jumped 28.5 percent in March and 19.7
percent in February, declined 16.3 percent last month.
   Manufacturing sectors sharing the overall increase last month
were electrical machinery, led by communications equipment, up 9.4
percent to $20.0 billion; primary metals, such as steel, up 5.6
percent to $12.5 billion, and nonelectrical machinery, up 1.4
percent to $22.6 percent.
   Higher demand for cars and car parts boosted transportation
orders 0.6 percent to $37.3 billion in April. Demand for aircraft
and aircraft parts continued to remain high.
   Non-transportation orders rose 3.9 percent, the first increase
since a 2.2 percent hike last December and the broadest jump in
this area since a 4.8 percent leap in April 1987.
   Non-defense capital goods, watched as a sign of business
investment plans, also posted a 5.5 percent hike in April, up from
2.6 percent in March. It was the best showing since a 10.2 percent
increase in December.
   The Commerce Department said durable goods shipments last month
rose 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $123.1 billion following
three monthly declines. Shipments had reached their high of $124.2
billion in December.

   In her final interview before she died of
cancer, comedian Gilda Radner praised her husband, Gene Wilder, as
a man who cared about ``who I am, rather than if I have hair.''
   Wilder ``always treated me normally. If he was mad at me, he was
mad at me. I don't think I could have stood it if anybody had
treated me as fragile or as though I had a limited time on earth,''
Radner said.
   The interview, published in the June issue of Glamour magazine,
was conducted March 31. Rachel McAllister, Radner's publicist,
confirmed that it was the comedian's last interview.
   Radner, a star in the early ``Saturday Night Live'' comedy show,
died Saturday of ovarian cancer at age 42; a book about her
illness, ``It's Always Something,'' will soon be published.
   She said she told Wilder, ``You have handled this about the best
that anyone could. After I finish this every woman in the world
will be after you. The trouble is, they're all gonna have some
major illness.''
   She said Wilder always made her feel loved.
   ``I'm lucky I'm with a man who isn't superficial,'' she said.
``I think he was really put to the test. But he loves and cares
about what's inside me _ who I am, rather than if I have hair.
   ``He's never broken down and cried,'' she said. ``He's always
had this total confidence that I would be well. I've never seen any
fear in his eyes. And I would be the first one to pick up on it.
Now he says back in the early days that he did feel fear. You know
what? He may just be a great actor!''

<TEXT>
   A nuclear-powered attack submarine on a
routine patrol in the Pacific Ocean had to surface unexpectedly
last week and cut short its mission after experiencing a mechanical
problem with its propulsion system, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The USS Helena, a so-called Los Angeles-class attack submarine,
is now on the surface and heading back to its home port of Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, using an auxiliary propulsion system, said Peter
Williams, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   No one aboard the vessel was injured and the sub's nuclear
reactor was not involved in any way, he added.
   The Helena surfaced on May 17 ``as a precaution'' when it was
about 500 nautical miles west of the island of Midway, and has been
moving slowly toward Pearl Harbor ever since with another Navy ship
serving as escort, Williams said.
   Initial reports indicate the sub experienced a problem with the
reduction gear in its main propulsion system. The spokesman
declined to estimate when the Helena would arrive in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   Former arms control negotiator Paul Warnke
urged the Bush administration Tuesday to take advantage of Soviet
proposals and to ease pressure on NATO to agree to modernize
short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany.
   ``The best reaction we could have would be one of restraint,''
said Warnke, who was chief arms negotiator under President Carter.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has announced a cut of
500,000 in the Soviet armed forces, including withdrawal of 50,000
troops and 5,000 tanks from Central Europe, and has offered to
reduce the Warsaw Pact forces to levels below those of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   President Bush has been cool to Gorbachev's proposals, and has
asked NATO leaders to approve at a meeting next week a plan to
modernize the Lance missile system in Europe. The plan envisions a
tripling of the Lance range to more than 200 miles, and expanding
the number of launchers from 88 to 997.
   West Germany has been pushing for talks on reducing short-range
nuclear forces in Europe, but Bush has balked, citing Soviet
superiority.
   The Soviet Union has 1,400 short-range nuclear missiles in
Europe, and according to NATO figures, has 6,260 nuclear artillery
systems compared with 2,700 for the Atlantic Alliance.
   Warnke said Gorbachev's proposals opened the way toward ``a very
significant military stand-down in Europe.''
   ``It would be very difficult for us at this point to make a
matching response that involved very significant reductions in
American troops. The net result of that would be to paralyze
NATO,'' Warnke told a news conference.
   ``One sensible response would be to say in response to Mr.
Gorbachev, OK, if you are willing to eliminate the offensive
invasion threat, we do not have to decide to deploy new short-range
nuclear missiles, the sole function of which would be to respond to
that invasion.''
   Warnke also denied administration assertions that the Soviets
have modernized their short-range nuclear missile force, noting
that the newest such system, the SS-23, was required to be
destroyed under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed
in 1987. Most Soviet short-range missiles are SCUDs, which were
deployed 25 years ago, he said.
   Warnke, at his news conference, presented a report by the
British American Security Information Council, which largely
reflected his views on disarmament.

<TEXT>
   A growing number of companies intend to
require their employees to pay a greater share of their health care
costs in response to soaring medical expenses, the chairman of the
National Association of Manufacturers said Tuesday.
   Richard E. Heckert, in releasing a survey of the association's
members on health insurance issues, said increased cost-sharing is
``a positive development'' because it encourages workers to become
more educated health-care consumers.
   The survey of 2,029 manufacturers earlier this year found that
the cost of providing health insurance represented an average 37
percent of the companies' net profits.
   ``They're looking for some way to cut their expenses,'' Heckert
said.
   The cost of health care for U.S. businesses has tripled over the
last eight years and rose an average 30 percent last year for the
companies surveyed, he said.
   The survey found 84 percent of the manufacturers surveyed
opposed any attempt to require companies to provide benefits to
workers, as a bill introduced in the Senate by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., would do.
   Requiring coverage by employers would further escalate medical
costs and ``it doesn't make sense to raise costs further in a
system that needs major repair,'' Heckert said.
   Among the manufacturers surveyed, 99.3 percent offer group
health care benefits to employees and nearly all of them extend
coverage to the families of their workers.
   Nearly 56 percent of those surveyed pay the entire cost of
premiums for coverage and most of the rest share the cost with
employees. For dependent coverage, nearly 32 percent pay the entire
cost of coverage premiums, while about 54 percent share the cost
with the worker and nearly 15 percent require the worker to pay all
of the cost of such coverage.
   The manufacturers did not propose radical changes in the current
health-care system, but suggested ways to reduce costs, including
reform of the medical liability system to limit damage awards and
elimination of costly administrative burdens on employers offering
health insurance to workers.

   A high school principal encouraged a student
to recite the Lord's Prayer as part of his commencement speech
after a federal judge rejected a minister's request to lead the
prayer, the student says.
   Iowa Civil Liberties Union officials criticized West Monona High
School Principal Gary Niichel for his action.
   ``It shows a complete lack of respect for our court system,''
said Mark Lambert, a legislative lobbyist for the ICLU.
   Senior class President Alan Langenfeld recited the prayer Sunday
to about 1,000 people. Langenfeld said he first consulted with his
father and Niichel.
   ``I had a little prompting from my father and Mr. Niichel,'' he
said.
   ``I need to make a distinction here,'' Langenfeld added. ``Mr.
Niichel has a son in our graduating class and any advice he gave he
gave as the father of a graduating senior, not as a principal.''
   Niichel acknowledged Monday that he knew of Langenfeld's plans
minutes before the commencement. He declined to comment further
``because of my position as an administrator.''
   U.S. District Judge Donald E. O'Brien last week rejected a
request by the Rev. Duane Lundberg to lead a prayer at the
graduation, citing constitutional restrictions on religious
practices at public facilities.
   Lambert said the ICLU had not decided whether to pursue legal
action in the case. A secretary in O'Brien's office said the judge
was out of town and unavailable for comment Tuesday.
   School Superintendent Donald Southwick said no action will be
taken against Langenfeld and said he was unsure whether the
district will take steps to prevent similar incidents.
   Langenfeld said he polled classmates before the ceremony, and no
one objected to the prayer.
   ``The whole class was kind of jittery,'' he said. ``They were
joking around that the feds were going to come get us and we'd have
our diplomas to read while we were sitting in jail.''

   One million people in Beijing and tens of
thousands in other cities marched Tuesday to demand that Premier Li
Peng resign, and there were signs he might be losing a power
struggle with liberal factions of the leadership.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in the first official illumination
on the backstage struggle since Li declared martial law in parts of
the capital Saturday, said Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang remained in office.
   Zhao, who heads a more liberal faction, favored meeting with
university students who occupied Tiananmen Square May 13 to demand
a dialogue on democratic reforms. He reportedly offered to resign
shortly before Li ordered troops in to quell the protest.
   Qian's comment to European Community ambassadors, reported by
diplomatic sources, was the first official word on Zhao's status.
   In other indications Li may be losing his power struggle with
Zhao's faction, a military officer was quoted as saying troops
ordered into Beijing have been told to withdraw. He did not say how
far.
   The official Xinhua News Agency also reported public demands for
Li's ouster for the first time in its report on Tuesday's march in
Beijing. ``The overwhelming majority of the slogans of the parade
were directed against the chief leader of the State Council,''
Xinhua said, referring to Li but not by name. The State Council is
China's cabinet.
   Hong Kong commercial radio reported the party Politburo decided
to strip Li of both his government and party posts and that Zhao
would resume his duties. The report could not be confirmed and was
one of many contradictory reports on China's murky political
situation.
   However, Li's failure to enforce martial law four days after
declaring it in a harsh speech broadcast nationwide seemed to
indicate he lacked adequate support within the government and party.
   Also uncertain is the status of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84,
believed to be behind the crackdown.
   ``Dear students, your final goal is not far away,'' a student
announcer said over a loudspeaker to the 30,000 students still
occupying Tiananmen Square.
   The protesters originally sought a dialogue with the government
on press and other reforms, but since martial law have demanded
Li's resignation.
   Out-of-town students continued to flock to Beijing to join the
protest even though many of the original Beijing strikers left the
square in exhaustion after a weeklong hunger strike.
   Beijing residents continued to defy martial law regulations
against marching, making speeches, distributing pamphlets and other
political activities.
   Students, teachers, government workers and intellectuals led the
biggest march since martial law was declared, chanting: ``Li Peng,
step down!'' and ``Withdraw the troops, lift martial law!''
   Xinhua put the number of marchers at 1 million and reported the
chants against Li in sharp contrast to other official reports of
the past few days that have insisted order is being maintained in
Beijing and life is returning to normal.
   Some aspects of Beijing life did become more normal Tuesday,
with about half of the city's bus routes resuming service for the
first time since Saturday. The subways also reopened and many
people went to work, although traffic broke down again during the
afternoon march.
   About 100,000 people also marched Tuesday in the southern city
of Canton, and tens of thousands of students and workers marched in
the east-coast city of Shanghai, with about 200,000 people watching.
   Shanghai students plastered posters calling for a strike all
over the city, but despite support from the workers for the
students' cause, there was no indication that much heed was paid to
the strike idea.
   During the march in Beijing, three men in their 20s hurled black
and red paint at the 30-foot-high portrait of revolutionary leader
Mao Tse-tung that hangs in the square.
   Students hustled the three away and later turned them over to
police. The government removed the stained portrait with a crane
and hung a similar one.
   Other embarrassments have been less easily eliminated. The party
newspaper, the People's Daily, said soldiers were ``greatly
humiliated'' when their convoys were surrounded by residents since
Saturday to keep them from entering the city.
   The paper quoted an unidentified colonel as saying that
superiors had ordered the troops to withdraw. Many have pulled off
the streets into military and compounds in recent days, and it was
not clear if the colonel meant they would withdraw further, back to
their home bases.
   Beijing TV news said one soldier was killed when his military
vechicle was hit by another, and he fell off. It was the first
confirmed death under martial law.
   Several soldiers, students and residents were hurt Monday night
when the two sides pelted each other with stones and bricks at a
miliary convoy in southwestern Beijing that was immobilized by the
civilians for three days.

<HEAD>Prison Guards' Lawsuit Charges Overcrowding Is Hazardous</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten prison guards have filed a class-action
lawsuit against the state, charging prison overcrowding is so
severe that guards are in danger.
   ``Inmates are not the only people affected by conditions that
judges sometimes call cruel and inhuman punishment,'' said Thomas
J. Brophy, a spokesman for American Federation of State County and
Municipal Employees Council 93, the union representing 3,000 state
prison guards.
   Numerous lawsuits have been filed by inmates seeking to reduce
prison overcrowding, but Brophy and others said Tuesday they
believe this is the first legal action by guards.
   As of May 17, there were 7,145 inmates jammed into state prisons
designed to hold 3,824, Department of Correction spokesman Deodato
Arruda said.
   The lawsuit, filed May 12 in Suffolk Superior Court, charges
that inmates in the Concord prison are shoehorned into the paint
shop, day rooms, telephone rooms, hospital ward and hallways.
   The crowding has made some areas impossible to secure and led to
an increase in inmate violence and attacks against guards, the
lawsuit alleges.
   The 10 correctional officers, all of whom are union officials,
charge the conditions violate their contract as well as state laws
mandating a safe workplace. They want the court to bar the state
from locking up more prisoners than the jails were built to hold.
   ``Most often, officers' injuries are suffered when they are
breaking up inmate-on-inmate violence,'' Brophy said. Neither
Brophy nor Arruda could provide statistics on assaults against
guards, but Brophy said they had increased.
   State attorneys met Tuesday to decide how to respond to the
lawsuit, Arruda said.
   Massschusetts has embarked on a jail-building program, with 225
new prison beds to be completed at Concord by October and 1,185
statewide by 1990, he said.
   Although several inmate lawsuits are pending on the crowding
issue, the state is not under court order to reduce prison
overcrowding. Two county jails are under such orders, and a
court-appointed master has been granting early releases to convicts
at the Dedham jail.

   Washington Cathedral, 82 years in the building
and one of the glories of the capital's skyline, moved a step
nearer to completion Tuesday as the last load of limestone was
delivered for the second largest cathedral in the United States.
   ``I thought once I wasn't going to be able to see it finished,''
said Otto Epps, the project's head laborer and a veteran of 37
years of working on the cathedral.
   ``This is a great day,'' said the Rt. Rev. John T. Walker,
Episcopal bishop of Washington, who said a prayer of thanksgiving
at a rain-dampened ceremony on the steps of the cathedral.
   ``It's been a labor of love,'' said Peter Cleland, master mason,
who has worked on the project since 1953. By chance, the final
delivery from the Bybee Stone Co. of Bloomington, Ind., came on
Cleland's 68th birthday, which will be his last on the job.
   Cleland's father, William, supervised the cathedral project
before his son. Now two grandsons, Billy and Ray, work there too.
   Construction of the cathedral began in 1907. The first section,
Bethlehem Chapel, was completed in 1912; the central tower was
finished in 1964, and the nave was ready for the nation's
bicentennial in 1976.
   Known to tourists as National Cathedral but properly named
Washington Cathedral, the church is operated by the Protestant
Episcopal Cathedral Foundation.
   That organization was created by Congress in 1893 and began
planning began for construction of the ``great church for national
purposes'' that Pierre L'Enfant had envisioned a century earlier as
part of his plan for the capital city.
   Washington Cathedral is the final resting place of Woodrow
Wilson, Adm. George Dewey and Helen Keller. It was the setting for
the funeral of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1969 and for a national
memorial service after Harry S. Truman died in 1972. The Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. preached his last Sunday sermon at the
cathedral, three days before he was murdered.
   Each year, some 350,000 people visit the cathedral, second in
size only to New York's unfinished Episcopal Cathedral of St. John
the Divine among American cathedrals and the world's sixth largest.
   The final, ceremonial stone is to be set in place Sept. 29, 1990
_ 83 years to the day from the laying of the foundation stone. Even
then, though, work will go on.
   ``We've got to clean up our front yard,'' said Dick Feller,
canon clerk of the works or head of construction for the cathedral.
   Standing in a muddy work area outside the Gothic, 14th century
catheral, Feller said there will still be five years of scaffolding
to remove, plus cleaning five years of mortar droppings from the
stone.
   Besides, ``there is still some art work to be done, still a few
stained-glass windows and some carving,'' he said. But, with all
the stones from Tuesday's last shipment scheduled to be in place
later this year, Feller added, ``This finishes all the stonework.''
   The stones from the Indiana company, which has supplied the
cathedral for about 10 years, weight from 150 to 450 pounds. All
the limestone has come from Indiana; the first delivery was in 1910.
   A cloudburst hit Washington a few minutes before the ceremony
began but had let up by the time the cheering crowd watched a giant
crane lift the first stone off a truck.
   After the ceremony, at a cake-and-coffee birthday party for
Cleland in a construction shack, Anthony J. Segreti, president of
Segreti Tepper Architects, the Washington firm overseeing the job,
said:
   ``There's quite a difference working on this project and on a
specification office building downtown. This type of construction
you don't see in this day and age.''
   Indeed not.
   ``Apart from using a modern crane to get it up there, this
cathedral is really built in the mediaeval style, stone on stone,''
said the Rev. Leonard Freeman, communications director at the
cathedral.
   `A modern building, you put up a steel frame and put things
around it, but that's not the way this was built. This was built
physically in the same manner that they were built in the Middle
Ages.''
   Is 83 years a long time to build a cathedral? No, said Freeman,
it's ``about middle range. ...
   ``A shorty might take 50 or 60 years. Some of them go 150 years
or more without having been finished.''

<HEAD>New American Director Takes Top Award at Cannes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lower case ``sex, lies and videotape'' is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Steven Soderbergh's first feature
film, ``sex, lies and videotape,'' won the Golden Palm award
Tuesday night at the 42nd Cannes film festival.
   One of the movie's four stars, James Spader, took the best actor
award, while Meryl Streep was selected best actress for her
performance in ``A Cry in the Dark,'' directed by Fred Schepisi.
   ``Well, I guess it's all downhill from here,'' said Soderbergh,
26, as he accepted the festival's top prize. ``I don't know what to
say. I was in great company here.''
   The Jury's Special Prize went to two films: French director
Bertrand Blier's ``Trop Belle Pour Toi'' (``Too Beautiful for
You'') and Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore's ``Nuovo Cinema
Paradiso'' (``Paradise Cinema'').
   West German director Wim Wenders, president of the jury,
presented the award to Soderbergh, of Baton Rouge, La. Wenders said
the film brought the jury both joy and ``confidence in the future
of the cinema.''
   Emir Kusturica of Yugoslavia received the best director award
for his movie ``Dom Za Vesanje'' (``Time of the Gypsies'').
   American Jim Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train,'' three sketches
unified by a train, took the prize for best artistic contribution.
   The Jury Prize went to ``Jesus de Montreal'' (``Jesus of
Montreal'') by Canadian director Denys Arcand. The film had been
among those rumored for the Golden Palm.
   Shot on a $1.2 million budget, ``sex, lies and videotape'' tells
the story of a seemingly happily married, prosperous couple whose
lives are disrupted when a troubled friend returns to town,
triggering revelations of sexual and personal betrayal.
   Spader, named best actor, portrays the returning friend who
precipitates the disaster, which ultimately leads to
self-knowledge. Impotent, he videotapes interviews with women about
their sex lies as a substitute for real intimacy.
   Blier's ``Trop Belle Pour Toi,'' starring Gerard Depardieu,
tells the story of a garage owner who betrays his beautiful wife
following a sudden, unexplained attraction to his less attractive
temporary secretary. ``Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'' was one of two
Italian entries focusing on the cinema and its demise. Ettore
Scola's ``Splendor'' was not honored with a prize.
   The 13-day festival also made a special bow to Gregory Peck,
whose film ``Old Gringo,'' also starring Jane Fonda, officially
closed the festival.
   Both he and Ms. Fonda received standing ovations from the black
tie crowd at the Palais des Festivals.

<HEAD>Israeli Leader Rejects U.S. Peace Calls as `Useless'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel dimissed
as ``useless'' Tuesday a key Middle East policy speech by U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and said he will pursue an
independent Israeli peace plan.
   Shamir also told a news conference that Britain and the United
States accept in principle Israel's plan for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But a British Foreign Office official denied this, saying there
were ``clear differences'' during talks earlier Tuesday between
Shamir and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe. Shamir met Monday
with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Concluding his three-day visit to Britain, the Israeli leader
flatly rejected almost all of Baker's speech delivered Monday in
Washington. Shamir insisted his government will not negotiate with
the Palestine Liberation Organization or trade land for peace.
   ``I think it was useless,'' he said of Baker's call for Israel
to forswear the occupied territories, stop Jewish settlements there
and hold ``serious political dialogue'' with the Palestinians.
   ``I don't think that all these issues on which we differ have
anything to do with our proposed peace initiative,'' he said.
   The Israeli proposal calls for Palestinians in the occupied land
to elect representatives to negotiate temporary self-rule with
Israel, with talks to be held later on the final status of the
territories Israel seized after the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Shamir said Mrs. Thatcher ``accepted in principle our peace
initiative,'' adding, ``I think our peace initiative was accepted
in principle by the U.S. government.''
   However, British officials echoed Baker's non-committal
description of the plan as a useful step forward. Asked if Mrs.
Thatcher's government accepted the Israeli proposal, a Foreign
Office official, speaking anonymously, said, ``There are clear
differences.''
   Britain, like most West European countries, supports an
international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Israeli Radio reported Howe pressed Shamir to endorse the idea
of yielding territory for peace, but the Israeli said he and his
entire coalition government reject this.
   Shamir acknowledged at the news conference that Howe raised the
issue, but said it should not be discussed now because the Israeli
initiative means ``all issues'' can be raised during the final
negotiations.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel
called Baker's call for land concessions ``explosive.''
   ``We can't say no (to Baker), because if we say no, we won't
have a (Palestinian) negotiating partner,'' said Liel. ``We can't
say yes because if we say yes, we won't have a government.''
   Shamir's current diplomatic offensive follows Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat's stated renunciation
of terrorism and acceptance of Israel's right to exist.
   ``They say they have renounced terrorism _ it is not true,''
said Shamir. ``By sitting down with the PLO ... we would legitimize
their demand for a Palestinian state and we don't want to give them
this gift.''
   In Washington, meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yithak Rabin
concentrated on winning support for Shamir's plans.
   He told the pro-Israeli American Israel Public Affairs Committee
that Palestinians would derive substantial benefits from the
self-government contemplated by Israel, running all government
functions except foreign affairs, defense, and meeting the
requirements of Israelis in the territories.
   Rabin said it would be a mistake to focus on major components of
a final solution now because the gap between Israel and the Arabs
is too wide.
   ``To tackle it now would lead nowhere,'' he said. The goal
should be ``to create hope of co-existence.''

<HEAD>Veteran Arrested At Mental Hospital In New Hampshire Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who told police and two
newspapers that he killed a man who tried to prevent him from
committing suicide was ordered jailed Tuesday pending his return to
New Hampshire to face murder charges.
   ``I wish it had been me instead of him,'' said Richard Papineau,
who has been in and out of mental hospitals since torching a
Buddhist shrine in the Berkshire Hills six years ago while on a
weekend pass from a Veterans Administration hospital.
   He and two other men said they set the fire to draw attention to
a lack of treatment programs for Vietnam veterans.
   Papineau was arrested late Monday at Northampton State Hospital,
a psychiatric facility where he had been held for observation to
determine if he could stand trial on charges of assaulting his wife
and girlfriend.
   Papineau pleaded innocent Tuesday in Northampton District Court
to a warrant charging him with being a fugitive from justice in New
Hampshire.
   Cynthia White, an assistant New Hampshire attorney general, said
Tuesday that authorities have obtained a warrant charging him with
the murder of a man whose body was found Monday in woods off a
highway in Winchester, N.H.
   Papineau, 40, reportedly told the Union-News in Springfield and
The Recorder in Greenfield during interviews at the hospital that
he shot and killed the man. He identified the victim as a patient
at the VA Hospital in Northampton and alleged the killing occurred
after the two men drove to New Hampshire on April 24, the papers
said.
   ``When I went out there, I was going to take myself out,'' he
said. ``I still wish it had been me instead of him, just like I
wish it had been me instead of the guys in Vietnam. I've been
living with them for 22 years. Now there is one more name on that
list and I will live with them until I check out.''
   In Vietnam, Papineau received the Bronze Star for carrying a
wounded fellow Marine to safety, despite being wounded in the face
and head when his unit was trapped on a hill in the Ah Shau Valley
on June 4, 1967. Within 12 hours, 85 percent of his company was
killed or wounded and Papineau was found 18 days after the battle
wandering aimlessly through the countryside, his lawyer said in a
1984 court session.
   Papineau, who said he also told his story to police here, said
he had been distraught over a restraining order that kept him away
from the Greenfield apartment shared by his girlfriend and his
former wife.
   He said he stopped his car, walked into the woods and pointed a
.38-caliber revolver at his own head.
   ``I had the barrel in my face. I was sitting on a rock,''
Papineau said. His alleged victim, he said, ``came up behind me and
said, `I'm not going to let you do this,' and grabbed me. I kind of
freaked. The gun went off and he went down.''
   ``The next thing I knew, the gun was empty and I was just
standing there,'' Papineau said.
   He described the victim, whom he said he had known a few days,
as ``just like me, a loner.''
   His troubles here began New Year's Eve 1983 when Papineau said
that he and two other VA Hospital patients torched the small
Buddhist temple in Hawley. Veterans from across the country later
helped the small Tibetan congregation rebuild the temple.
   All three men were placed on probation and ordered to continue
treatment, but Papineau entered and left hospitals in several New
England states until a judge threatened to jail him. King said he
had recently returned to western Massachusetts, said Michael King,
director of the Veterans Outreach Center in Greenfield.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher will
ask the State Department to renegotiate a driftnet fishing
agreement with Japan which has been widely criticized by U.S.
fishing groups, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
spokesman said today.
   ``The secretary had indicated that he is not satisfied with the
draft agreement and will ask the Department of State to go back and
renegotiate an agreement that will satisfy us,'' said the
spokesman, Brian Gorman.
   Japan, along with South Korea and Taiwan, faces possible trade
sanctions on fishery products exported to the United States if
driftnet agreements have not been signed by June 29.
   Mosbacher has the authority to decide whether the agreements
satisfy the monitoring and enforcement provisions of the Driftnet
Act passed by Congress in 1987.
   Lawmakers from Alaska, Washington state and Oregon have called
the tentative treaty inadequate and asked that it be renegotiated.
Representatives of the Northwest fishing industry and
environmentalists also have been highly critical of the pact.
   Critics contend the draft treaty does not provide for enough
observers on Japanese vessels or enough patrols in the legal
driftnet zone to check on compliance.
   An estimated 700 to 1,000 fishing vessels frt Ord, Calif., and the
5th
Infantry Division at Fort Polk, La.
   The Bush administration ordered additional troops to Panama and
began withdrawing military dependents after Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, Panama's strongman leader, staged and then declared void a
presidential election when it became clear his candidate had lost.
   Some of the opposition candidates were subsequently attacked
during political rallies.
   According to the defense sources, the U.S. Southern Command,
which is headquartered in Panama, has occasionally run
``show-the-flag convoys'' in the past.
   ``But these are not just routine convoys,'' one official said
Tuesday. ``We're stepping up our posture and more have been
scheduled.''

<HEAD>West Must Stop Bid to Reduce Navies in Arms Talks: Jane's Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The West must head off any attempt by the Soviets
to reduce naval forces during superpower arms talks, the editor of
``Jane's Fighting Ships'' said Tuesday.
   Capt. Richard Sharpe wrote in the introduction to the respected
military guide that the West's whole defensive strategy rests on
its naval strength.
   Sharpe also said that as the risk of superpower confrontation
recedes, regional instabilitse, threatening the
economic interests of industrialized nations and breeding
ies could increainternational terrorism.
   He said the health of the U.S. Navy in the next few years
depends on its ability to attract and keep qualified recruits.
   He also said India's goal of becoming a dominant regional
maritime power ``is beginning to cause concern around the whole
oceanic rim.''
   Sharpe said there is ``no doubt'' a key Soviet objective is to
reduce Western naval strength. Because of its traditional
reluctance to throw anything away, the Soviet navy has thousands of
tons of ancient ships and submarines that it could unilaterally
scrap with little impact on overall effectiveness, he said.
   ``It is devoutly to be hoped that the West will not once again
be wrong-footed in the propaganda battle and that listment rates running
at the lowest level in five years.
   Much of the problem, he said, is because of the disparity
between military and civilian pay rates.
   Sharpe said most regional naval growth in the last year has been
in the Indian Ocean and in the China Seas, which has 12 of the
world's 15 maritime disputes.
   Indian naval strength has continued to grow, and Sharpe said
there is little doubt that India intends to be the dominant
regional maritime force from the Suez to Malacca.
   ``However benign the stated intentions ... with its gigantic and
growing population, its close ties to the Soviet Union, its nuclear
research activity, its building up of bases ... and its attention
to build new strike attack aircraft carriers and modern submarines,
India is beginning to appear to nations on the oceanic rim as a
potentially belligerent state.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hears Challenge to Assault Weapon Import Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday urged a federal appeals
court to uphold the Bush administration's ban on imported assault
rifles in a case that could affect 640,000 of the weapons in the
first quarter of this year alone.
   ``We do not want the American public to suffer the
consequences,'' said Mark Stern of the Justice Department's civil
division. ``It's for their safety.''
   But a lawyer for an Alabama gun shop owner argued that the
government had already issued permits and should release 1,250
semiautomatic rifles that were impounded at the Birmingham, Ala.,
airport by the U.S. Customs Service.
   The three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
based in Atlanta, sat in Miami for an expedited hearing on whether
to release the rifles to Don Wood, owner of Gun South Inc. in
Trussville, Ala. The judges took the case under advisement after
the one-hour session.
   On April 26, U.S. District Judge William Acker Jr. had ruled
that Wood was entitled to delivery of Steyr AUG-SA Austrian-made
rifles, which sell for $900 to $1,000 each.
   But the government appealed the decision, and Stern argued
Monday that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms needs more
time to re-examine the permits it gave Gun South and other arms
importers.
   The court's decision could affect the fate of about 640,000
similar weapons already held up this year by the presidential ban
instituted after a man with an assault rifle killed five children
at a school in Stockton, Calif.
   Wood's attorney, James C. Barton, dismissed the confiscation of
his client's rifles as hysteria against a weapon already approved
by ATF as a sports rifle.
   Stern ``has used the term `assault weapon' 95 times in the face
of testimony of his own experts,'' Barton said. ``This is a libel
on my client's product, and we now have Congress using the same
term in the Assault Weapon Control Act of 1989.''
   Barton said the confiscation threatened his client's livelihood
and Gun South's 700 employees. The company has a total of 4,700
imported semiautomatic rifles on order.

<HEAD>Huge Quake Shakes Seabed Off New Zealand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge earthquake ruptured a stretch
of seabed Tuesday about 125 miles north of Macquarie Island, midway
between Australia and Antarctica, officials reported.
   Kevin McCue, senior research scientist at the Australian
Seismological Center, said the quake occurred at 6:54 a.m. EDT and
measured about 7.2 on the Richter scale. The U.S. Geological Survey
put the reading at 8.2.
   Alison Clifton, chief of the Australian National Antarctic
Research Expeditions research station on Macquarie, said by
telephone a ``fairly severe'' quake had struck and ``it was pretty
noisy.''
   ``It was certainly sizable,'' Ms. Clifton said, and rattled
buildings but caused no damage. She said the Macquarie Island base
often had felt earthquakes, but nothing as strong.
   McCue said the quake was the biggest in that part of the
undersea Macquarie Ridge since the 1920s and indicated a large
movement at the junction of the Australian and Pacific plates.
   He said a stretch of seabed from 30 to 60 miles long and up to
two miles deep apparently had ruptured, with one geological plate
sliding over another on the same ridge that includes New Zealand.
McCue said the quake was too far away to be felt in New Zealand or
Australia.
   Undersea earthquakes sometimes result in tidal waves, but McCue
and Ms. Clifton said there was no evidence one had occurred.
   Macquarie Island, about 850 miles southwest of Christchurch, New
Zealand, is uninhabited except for the research station. It is
about 21 miles long and 2 miles wide and is a breeding ground for
penguins, albatrosses and fur seals.
   According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the temblor was the
strongest anywhere in the world this year. The last comparable
quake was one 8.1 on October 20, 1986, in the Kermadec Islands in
the Pacific, the agency said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, means
the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5 can cause
slight damage in populated areas and one of 6 can cause severe
damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska of 8.5 killed 114
people.

<HEAD>Study Says Adjustment of Employment Test Scores Needed for Minorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scores of minorities on a test used to
screen job applicants must be adjusted to assure that blacks and
Hispanics are given equal consideration with whites, experts on a
National Research Council committee said Tuesday.
   Adjustments that boost the scores of minorities on the General
Aptitude Test Battery, a widely used employment screening exam, are
necessary to make sure that blacks and Hispanics are not
``disproportionately excluded'' from job referrals, a council
committee said.
   ``With no score adjustments, very low fractions of
minority-group members will be referred for employment,'' it said.
This could result in what the committee called ``a severe adverse
impact on the employment opportunities of those demographic
groups.''
   The study was conducted by the council at the request of the
Department of Labor. One element of the study was to analyze a plan
to use the General Aptitude Test Battery to screen applicants for
all of the 12,000 job categories in the U.S. economy.
   The test, now used to screen job applicants for several hundred
thousand jobs annually, was first developed in the 1940s by the
U.S. Employment Service, a division of the Department of Labor. In
recent times, the USES has encouraged state employment offices to
use the test to select applicants who are referred to employers to
fill job vacancies.
   As part of the test program, the NRC committee said the Labor
Department adopted a system to adjust upward the scores of minority
applicants. This policy has been challenged by the Department of
Justice. Labor officials asked the council to examine the policy
from a technical perspective.
   The committee concluded that score adjustments are necessary to
assure equal job opportunities for minorities.
   ``In the absence of score adjustments, minority applicants who
could preform successfully on the job will be screened out of the
referral group in greater proportions than are equivalent
majority-group applicants,'' the study said.
   The committee said the GATB examinations were only of ``modest''
use in predicting how well a specific applicant would perform a
specific job. The study also called ``unfounded'' a Labor
Department claim that universally applying the GATB would save
employers $80 billion annually through an increase in job
productivity.
   GATB examinations have at least two flaws, the council committee
said. The study said that there are limited forms of the test,
which means that advance copies could become available to
applicants, thus giving them an unfair advantage.
   The second flaw is what the committee called ``speededness.''
The study said that a test that must be completed within a short
period of time can give distorted scores if applicants are coached
to randomly select answers in the final minute of the allowed time.
   GATB examinations test verbal, numerical, perceptual and
psychomotor skills, but the committee said that no test is
available to give a precise prediction of how well a person will
perform on a job.
   The National Research Council is the principal operating agency
of the National Academy of Sciences, a private organization
chartered by Congress.

<HEAD>West German President Re-Elected to Second Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Richard von Weizsaecker,
West Germany's eloquent and respected elder statesman, was
re-elected to a second, five-year term Tuesday.
   A special assembly of legislators and appointed electors that
convenes once every five years re-elected the 69-year-old Christian
Democrat with 881 votes of the 1,022 cast, or 86.2 percent.
Weizsaecker was unopposed.
   During his first term, Weizsaecker transformed the largely
ceremonial office into an influential post.
   Weizsaecker won praise for his effort to bring fellow Germans to
terms with the Holocaust in a 1985 address marking the 40th
anniversary of the German capitulation in World War II.
   But Weizsaecker also called for a fair assessment of the
accomplishments of a nation built on the ruins of Nazi Germany.
   The president planned another major address Wednesday to mark
the 40th anniversary of West Germany's statehood.
   ``These are serious responsibilities and I wish for us the
strength to bear them successfully,'' Weizsaecker said in an
acceptance speech.
   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth opened the convention in
Bonn's sprawling Beethoven Hall with words of praise for
Weizsaecker, the sixth man to serve as West German president since
the nation was founded on May 24, 1949.
   Each of the five political parties represented in the federal
parliament may nominate a candidate for the presidency. But for the
first time in the nation's history, the vote was uncontested,
reflecting the respect Weizsaecker has won across the political
spectrum.
   Weizsaecker drew the endorsement of all but the left-leaning
Greens Party, which nonetheless decided not to run their own
candidate.
   In a recent nationwide poll, Weizsaecker drew an approval rating
of more than 85 percent and the Institute for Opinion Research
determined that he is the public figure most often chosen as an
appropriate example for young West Germans.

<TEXT>
   President Najib on Tuesday called for
a cease-fire in Afghanistan's 11-year-old civil war and a council
to draft a new constitution and oversee elections.
   In an emotional speech to parliament, Najib urged lawmakers to
promote peace by contacting guerrilla commanders in their provinces
during a two-month recess.
   ``Make any contact with the opposition you want,'' Najib said.
``You can choose your own forum. Give me one new proposal, give me
any new proposal to solve this problem, and we will listen.''
   Najib said he wanted a peace conference with Moslem guerrillas
fighting the communist government, which took power in a 1978 coup.
   The conference would set up a council to oversee a cease-fire
and draft a new constitution, he said. It would then oversee
general elections and the formation of a new government, he said.
   Najib has said he would step down to end the war, which has
claimed more than 1.3 million lives and sent 5 million of the 15
million pre-war population fleeing to neighboring countries.
   Najib's latest peace overtures were directed toward the
guerrilla field commanders operating inside Afghanistan.
   On Sunday, the president urged commanders to break with their
exiled leaders in Pakistan and Iran. In return, he said, they would
receive full military rank within the Afghan army, would be allowed
to keep their weapons and would have full autonomy in the regions
they control.
   Najib named commanders he hoped would accept his offer,
including Akmed Shah Masood, Ismail Khan and Abdul Haq, who are
known for their struggle against the government and Soviet troops.
The last of the Red Army soldiers left Kabul on Feb. 15, ending a
nine-year intervention.
   But the latest offer was rejected flatly and quickly, Najib said.
   ``The commanders have reacted negatively to positive proposals
and I think they have made a major historical error,'' he said.
``You could have united the country but now you are dividing it.''
   Najib blamed the guerrilla leaders based in Peshawar, Pakistan,
for hindering efforts toward a negotiated settlement.
   ``What do they know about bloodshed inside this country?'' he
said. ``We want to stop the flames of war, but they want to
continue war. They are saying take weapons, take rockets and
destroy our cities.''
   Diplomats in Kabul said they doubted commanders would accept a
cease-fire before the end of the summer, when most of the fighting
occurs. Commanders seem content to see if an outright military
victory is possible, they said.
   Iran-based guerrilla leaders said they had rejected an
invitation to visit Moscow for peace talks, according to the
official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   The offer from Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister of
the Soviet Union, ``was refused immediately,'' said Ali Jan Zahedi,
spokesman for the guerrilla coalition.
   In Pakistan, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees said an
increasing number of refugees were returning to their war-ravaged
homes in southern Afghanistan. In early May, the flow of refugees
rose from about 15 families a week to more than 100 daily, the
commission said.
   Sources said the return appeared influenced by lighter fighting
in the south, weariness of camp life and the desire to plant spring
crops.

   Orange County collected 4,000 ideas for
improving traffic and now plans to bury the top 100.
   The winning entries _ ranging from hydrofoil commutes and
freeway shoulder map racks to collision avoidance radar _ will be
buried in a time capsule as part of the county's centennial
celebration.
   The top 100 ideas were unveiled during a county Transportation
Commission meeting Monday.
   Included among the suggestions were these winners:
   High-speed cameras to record license plates of motorists who run
red lights, double-deck freeways, hydrofoil commuting along the
Pacific, smaller cars and a monorail system along freeway medians.
   The winning suggestions were bound in a slick, 16-page booklet
and will be buried in the centennial time capsule.
   Ideas aren't cheap. It cost the commission $41,000 to advertise,
buy postage, print brochures and hire consultants to sift through
the ideas.
   Next year, the panel plans to spend $50,000 for a consultant to
try and work some of the ideas into reality.

   A fuzzy, 75-gram baby screech owl
has received the appropriate moniker of ``High Tide'' after heavy
rains flooded him from his nest in the hollow of a tall water oak
tree.
   High Tide, believed to be less than a dozen days old, was found
Saturday on the grounds of a Christmas Tree Farm in a communitie in his
arms said
Tuesday he would do it again to end his family's anguish.
   ``Absolutely, there's no doubt in my mind,'' Rudy Linares, 23,
of suburban Cicero, Ill., said on the CBS-TV This Morning program.
``Today, tomorrow, I'd do the same thing again.
   ``I didn't want him there to begin with,'' he said of his
15-month-old son, Samuel, who died April 26. ``There was no other
alternative. I couldn't see my family be torn apart any more.''
   A grand jury refused to indict Linares after he disconnected
Samuel's respirator and held a gun to keep away employees of
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   The Cook County state's attorney's office charged Linares with
murder, but opted against pursuing the charge following the grand
jury's action. The county's medical examiner ruled the death an
accident.
   Samuel was in a coma for nine months after choking on a balloon.
   Last week, Linares pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons
charge and was released on condition that he receive a
psychological evaluation and get counseling if recommended by
authorities.
   During the nine months Samuel was in a coma, it became
increasingly difficult to visit him, Linares said in Tuesday's
interview.
   ``Tubes out of his nose, his mouth, tubes out of his throat; it
was just getting harder and harder to see him that way,'' Linares
said. He said it was ``just tearing apart the whole family.''
   His wife, Tamara, who also appeared on the television program,
which originated in New York, said the family's mail since the
incident has all been supportive, and included prayers.

<HEAD>Justice Ministry Says Tear Gas Used Properly in Territories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government denied on Tuesday that soldiers
were misusing tear gas in putting down Palestinian riots in the
occupied territories and rejected allegations that deaths resulted
from exposure to the gas.
   The denial came despite repeated charges by Palestinians,
supported by international human rights groups, that soldiers have
violated army regulations by firing tear gas into confined spaces
such as homes, clinics and mosques.
   The Israeli Justice Ministry report on the gas was in response
to a June 1988 study by Amnesty International, the London-based
human rights group.
   ``After a thorough investigation of the subject, I can state
with full confidence that Amnesty International's allegations
concerning deliberate misuse of tear gas by the Israeli Defense
Forces are completely unfounded,'' said a letter to the group
signed by Israeli Attorney General Joseph Harish.
   The report described tear gas as ``an essential tool in the
preservation of public order'' and said there was no medical
evidence to support charges that the gas can cause death.
   Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, contend
excessive exposure to tear gas can be fatal to babies, the elderly
and people with chronic respiratory diseases.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees aid programs
for Palestinian refugees, says that in the first 17 months of the
uprising, more than 5,080 Palestinians were treated for tear gas
inhalation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty-four deaths were
attributed to the gas, the figures show.
   Officials at the Information Center for Human Rights, set up by
liberal Israelis to monitor activities in the occupied lands, say
they have reports of ``70 to 73 people who died short periods after
exposure to tear gas.''
   But a center official, who asked not to be identified, said ``it
is medically difficult to pinpoint exposure to tear gas as a direct
cause of death.''
   Doctors in the occupied territories have blamed tear gas for
scores of miscarriages, especially when women are exposed during
the first trimester of pregnancy.
   ``It has been reported that tear gas containers have been
deliberately thrown or fired by Israeli soldiers into people's
homes, health clincis, schools and mosques, even though they are
meant only to be used outdoors,'' the Amnesty International study
said. ``The gas has sometimes been used at night as a punitive
measure.''
   The group said it had received the names of 18 babies, all under
six months, and 17 adults, all over 50, who were reported to have
died after tear gas exposure. It cited seven specific cases in its
report on the Israeli army's tear gas use.
   It noted that the handbook of the manufacturer of the CS gas
generally used in Israel, Federal Laboratories Inc. of Saltsburg,
Pa., warns that tear gas incorrectly used can cause serious injury
and even death.
   The Justice Ministry's report acknowledged ``no method of riot
control is completely without risk.''
   As a result, it said, the army ``has sought to restrict the use
of even this non-lethal substance to instances where failure to use
it might result in more fatalities or injuries due to the continued
street violence.''
   The report said Israeli doctors were unable to confirm that tear
gas was a factor in six cases of Palestinian deaths raised by
Amnesty because families had removed the bodies from hospitals
before autopsy. Many Moslems reject autopsy on religious grounds.
   The report said those with lung or heart diseases could develop
``life-threatening clinical symptoms'' when exposed to tear gas,
but that deaths could not be linked to the gas without autopsies.
   In the seventh case, Amnesty's own report quoted an Israeli
autopsy as attributing the death to a heart attack. In this case,
the Justice Ministry did not deal with the Amnesty allegation that
tear gas may have been a contributing factor.
   The report also cited a study made by Israel's National
Institute of Legal Medicine as saying ``there are no confirmed
reports of human deaths caused by CS tear gas in the medical
literature.''

Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major advances in manufacturing technology are
needed if the U.S. computer industry is to maintain its lead in the
face of stiffening competition from around the world, computer
executives and university specialists said Tuesday.
   ``We have the most creative engineers. We have the finest
computer science. Our problem is a single problem _ we can't
manufacture worth a damn,'' said . Gordon Bell, vice president of
research and development at Ardent Computer Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.
   Gordon E. Moore, board chairman of Intel Corp., this country's
leading manufacturer of computer microprocessors, said he hopes
U.S. companies will respond to a recent call by the Semiconductor
Industry Association to re-enter the world market for computer
memory chips.
   Japan now controls 90 percent of the market for dynamic
random-access memory chips, known as DRAMs.
   Moore said such an effort to resuscitate U.S. production of
DRAMS probably would have to be a joint undertaking. ``I'm hopeful
we can find 10 companies ... who are each willing to put up $50
million to $70 million in capital,'' he said.
   Bell and Moore were among speakers at a colloquium sponsored by
the National Research Council, the principal operating agency of
the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering.
   Robert W. Lucky, executive director of the communications
sciences research division at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, noted that in
1988 U.S. companies controlled 57 percent of the $120 billion world
computer market, while the Japanese had a 41 percent share.
   However, the United States had a very small share in the
manufacturing of many computer components, including 1 percent of
DRAMs and 3 percent of liquid crystal displays.
   Patrick A. Toole, senior vice president and general manager of
technology products for IBM Corp., said there was a need for ``much
improved manufacturing prowess'' in the U.S. computer industry.
   Building on the example of Sematech, an American consortium for
research and development of semiconductors, ``together we must find
ways to charter new consortia, particularly in manufacturing,''
Toole said.
   Charles H. Ferguson, a research associate with the Center for
Technology, Policy and Industrial Development at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said that ``to a very great degree the
United States arena functions as a kind of public service
organization for the rest of the world computer industry.''
   ``United States firms do a lot of the innovation but do not
capture the market when the transition is made to mass
production,'' he said.
   Ferguson called for steps by the federal government including
making the research and development tax credit permanent and other
tax law changes to help reduce the cost of capital for U.S.
companies.
   Also, he said there was a need for ``an increase in the level of
technical and strategic cooperation'' among American computer firms
as well as the development of a nationwide fiber optic network for
computer communications.
   ``To do these things effectively is going to require a
fundamental break with the way the U.S. government does things and
the way the private sector does things,'' Ferguson said.

   New York has begun to look like ``Calcutta on
the Hudson,'' the city's chief financial officer for the last 16
years said Tuesday in formally launching his campaign for mayor.
   Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin said he has the experience to
``make New York livable again.''
   He said he would develop programs to combat housing shortages,
drugs and high school dropout rates; establish a Department for
Children; rebuild bridges and streets; and ``take the handcuffs off
the cops.''
   Goldin, 53, will run in the Democratic primary against incumbent
Edward I. Koch, who is in his 12th year as mayor, Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins, and former Charter Review Commission
Chairman Richard Ravitch. Among the Republicans, former U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani faces cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder.
   Goldin said he would devote more funds to rehabilitate vacant
apartment buildings the city has seized for back taxes so that more
of the homeless could be put into permanent housing.
   ``This is a sensible program for a city that's beginning to look
like Calcutta on the Hudson,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rain Improves Plains' Soil Moisture, Slows Field Work in Corn Belt</HEAD>

   Rain has improved soil moisture conditions in
the central and southern Great Plains and has slowed field work in
the eastern Corn Belt and the Delta region, a government report
said Tuesday.
   Despite the rainfall in parts of the plains, the outlook for
winter wheat in much of the region continues to be poor. Harvest is
under way in several states, including Texas and Oklahoma.
   Nationally, corn planting was 84 percent complete by the end of
the May 15-21 survey week, lagging the normal pace by only two
percentage points, said the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
However, in the wetter areas of the eastern Corn Belt, planting of
the new crop lagged far behind.
   ``Planting was complete in Texas and nearly complete in Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska,'' the report said.
   But in Ohio, where 85 percent of the corn acreage is usually
planted by now, only 24 percent was seeded, the report said. In
Pennsylvania, 19 percent of the corn was planted by May 21,
compared with 62 percent usually.
   The facility, which is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, said the 1989 soybean crop was about 39 percent
planted, only two percentage points behind the normal pace.
However, plantings lagged sharply in some areas, including Ohio,
where only 6 percent of the estimated soybean acreage had been
planted, compared with a normal 56 percent.
   Cotton plantings, at 60 percent, were reported nine points
behind the usual rate for this time of the season. Although
planting was complete in California, it lagged in the Delta and
Southeast.
   A related report by the USDA's 1989 drought task force headed by
Undersecretary Richard Crowder said that ``timely rains in the Corn
Belt are promoting rapid germination and establishment of this
year's crop.''
   But the report added that the impact of recent rain in winter
wheat areas will depend, in part, on weather conditions in the
coming days.
   ``If another (weather) front brings more rain as predicted,
moderate improvement in crop conditions could occur,'' the task
force said.
   The National Weather Service calls for ``moderate to heavy rain
in the Great Plains and Corn Belt in the next 5 to 10 days,'' it
added. ``The outlook through mid-June still calls for cool, wet
weather in the South and East, and warm, dry weather from the
eastern Dakotas into the central Corn Belt.''
   A new 30- and 90-day weather outlook is scheduled to be issued
by the Weather Service next week.

   A wealthy young attorney was stabbed to
death with a kitchen knife in his Long Island townhouse, apparently
just after he told his wife on the phone that he heard someone at
the door.
   A woman who had blood on her hands and shoes was charged in the
murder, police said Tuesday, after they found her in nearby bushes.
Police were investigating the claim of Elizabeth Menard, 23, of the
New York City borough of Queens that she had an accomplice in a
bungled burglary.
   The attorney, Glen Warshaw, was able to telephone for help, but
was pronounced dead Monday evening at South Nassau Hospital in
Oceanside.
   Warshaw reportedly had been speaking by telephone to his wife,
Linda, a schoolbook editor who was on a business trip in
Connecticut. While they were on the phone, he told his wife he
thought he heard someone at the door, according to Diane Saunders,
a legal assistant in his office in Hempstead. It is unclear whether
he hung up or kept his wife on the line when he went to check the
noise.
   Police said Warshaw probably surprised a would-be burglar or
burglars in his den on the first floor of his luxury two-story
townhouse, a few hundred yards from the Long Island oceanfront,
about 15 miles from Manhattan.
   He was stabbed several times, said Nassau County Detective Sgt.
Dennis Barry. The knife was found in the den.

   A woman who lost track of time while
living 130 days alone in a sealed cave with no human contact
climbed out today, waved to a crowd of about 60 people and said
``Wow, man!''
   Stefania Follini poked her head out of the entrance to the cave
and put sunglasses on over her regular glasses to reduce the glare
of the bright midday sun. The temperature was 97 degrees, a big
difference from the cave's constant 74 degrees.
   The 27-year-old Italian interior decorator volunteered for the
isolation experiment, which began Jan. 13 in an effort to learn how
people may be affected by the long solitude of inerplanetary travel.
   She apparently learned some English during her isolation and
told the crowd: ``I feel great.''
   Miss Follini, who had taken English primers into the cave with
her to study the language, nodded when asked if she would do it
again and said ``Sure.''
   Researchers spoke with Miss Follini on Monday to announce the
end of the experiment, first through messages typed on computers
and then by intercome.
   ``Are you really serious?'' she replied through the computer
linking her to a house trailer above the cave.
   Miss Follini, 27, will be poked with needles and tagged with
electrodes in coming weeks while scientists try to figure out what
happened to her body and mind during the four months, 10 days she
spent 30 feet underground.
   In the absence of night, day or timepieces, Miss Follini's
menstrual cycle stopped and her sleep-wake cycle changed radically.
She tended to stay up 20 to 25 hours at a time, sleeping about 10
hours.
   Researchers believe her muscle tone and the level of calcium in
her bones decreased, that her immune system is depressed and that
she is able to concentrate more deeply.
   Miss Follini kept up strength and flexibility during her
mole-like existence by doing calisthenics and judo, and maintained
her mental poise by reading and decorating her 10-square-foot
plastic-enclosed living area.
   Without the sun and other people, time passed quickly for Miss
Follini. She believed that two months had passed instead of four,
and was shocked when experiment coordinator Maurizio Montalbini
notified her by computer that the experiment was almost over.
   Montalbini assured her he was serious, then wrote: ``We will not
ask you for any more data.'' She had been asked to perform physical
and mental tests periodically.
   Then, while journalists watched her on a television monitor,
Miss Follini heard a human voice other than her own. It was from
the man upstairs.
   ``Stefania, I am your God, talking to you,'' Montalbini said
over an intercom.
   She looked at a camera, laughed, and said: ``I didn't think you
would find me down here.''
   Miss Follini spoke briefly with the other Italian researchers,
then remarked that when she heard Montalbini's voice for the first
time, ``the feeling she had was like when the alarm clock goes off
on Monday morning,'' interpreter Rita Fraschini said.
   After a brief respite, life as a guinea pig will resume for Miss
Follini.
   On Memorial Day, she has a date with University of Texas Medical
School researchers in Houston for electro-encephalogram brain scans
and performance tests, said Dr. Jon DeFrance, an assistant
professor at the medical school.
   DeFrance's team will attach electrodes to her head while she
performs computerized tests of mental acuity and concentration.
They did similar tests while Miss Follini was in the cave, but in
Houston researchers will be able to watch how specific parts of her
brain function while she's solving problems. Researchers will
perform the same tests again in six months.
   Other scientists will draw blood and inspect her in other ways
to monitor her immune system, bones, muscles and coordination.
   ``I hope with this research to find a way to prepare people
going in space or submarines,'' Montalbini said.

<HEAD>House Bill Inspired by 21-Month Jailing of Mother in Custody Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Virginia congressman, objecting that a
Washington woman has been jailed 21 months in a child custody case,
pressed a House committee Tuesday to limit civil contempt-of-court
jailings in the District of Columbia.
   Rep. Frank Wolf's bill is designed to apply retroactively to the
case of Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon who was jailed when she
refused to produce her daughter Hilary to go on unsupervised visits
with her ex-husband, oral surgeon Eric Foretich. Authorities have
been unable to find the girl.
   D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon held Morgan in civil
contempt of court, and has said she will remain in jail until she
relents.
   Morgan, who had been granted custody of the six-year-old girl,
alleged that Foretich, the girl's father, had sexually abused the
child on previous unsupervised weekend visits. Foretich has denied
that.
   Wolf's bill, affecting only the District of Columbia, where the
federal government retains substantial control, would change civil
contempt charges to criminal contempt after 18 months. That would
guarantee Morgan or others the filing of formal charges and a
criminal jury trial.
   ``What you actually have is civil contempt that is treated more
harshly than criminal contempt,'' Wolf said. ``I think a jury trial
is a right, and it would make a tremendous difference.''
   Wolf, a Republican who represents a district just across the
Potomac River from Washington, criticized the current standoff and
said, ``I believe that a child who is denied the care of either
parent is not being well served.''
   However, Foretich, who attended the hearing but did not testify,
blasted the bill.
   ``Not one witness has expressed one scintilla of concern for
Hilary,'' he said. ``There are absolutely no guarantees that my
daughter will be returned if her mother is freed.''
   Foretich, who has suggested that an independent panel of experts
evaluate Hilary, her mother and himself, said he would abide by any
custody decision that a group of judges, social workers and
psychiatrists might propose.
   ``If they conclude that it is in the best interests of my
daughter for one of us to bow out, I would,'' Foretich said. ``I
want what is best for her.''
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee's District of Columbia Subcommittee, said he may schedule
additional hearings on the bill before scheduling a vote on it.
   The city council has no authority over the city's court system.
However, council member James Nathanson told the House panel that
he opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings.
   ``If you put a cap on the court's authority, some people will
decide they're willing to pay that price,'' Nathanson said. ``I
think that a court would be rendered less effective.''
   Instead, Nathanson suggested establishing a three-judge panel to
review all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months. Under
Nathanson's plan, the group, which would include the judge who
initially jailed the person, would have to vote unanimously in
favor of further incarceration in order to keep the person in
prison.

   The government deployed 10,000 riot
police and arrested 300 people Tuesday to block a rally by radical
students demanding the expulsion of U.S. troops from South Korea.
   Riot police stood guard along main streets and ringed the U.S.
Embassy and government buildings. Students who tried to attend the
rally at city hall were arrested.
   There were no reports of clashes.
   Police headquarters said about 300 radical students were
arrested, although most would be released.
   Student groups called for a week of protests in Seoul and other
cities to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders say the
United States props up authoritarian rule in South Korea.
   Troops conducted spot checks on many streets, questioning and
searching people and taking away suspects. Police patrols roamed
subway stations in the city center to stop students from gathering.
   Earlier Tuesday, radical students staged peaceful protests at 16
colleges in the capital in a second day of anti-American protests.
Students marched or held rallies, but there were no reports of
fighting.
   Students at Sungkyunkwang University tried to push through riot
police. They wore costumes to symbolize U.S. nuclear and chemical
weapons.
   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' and ``Down with the dictatorship!''
protesters chanted.
   The Foreign Ministry Tuesday criticized radical students for
burning U.S. flags during campus protests a day earlier.
   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' said ministry
spokesman Chang Hoon.
   Besides withdrawal of U.S. troops, students were calling for the
United States to apologize for its part in the bloody suppression
of a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
   The uprising in Kwangju was put down by South Korean troops and
at least 192 people died. Radical groups claim the United States
masterminded the operation.
   Dissidents want the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's
government, but they lack significant public support because of
their violent tactics and extreme views.
   South Korean and U.S. officials say American forces are needed
to ensure Seoul's defense against North Korea.

   A man convicted of killing his two sons
in a 1,300-degree foundry ladle was sentenced Tuesday to two life
sentences without chance of parole.
   Bartley James Dobben, 28, was given the mandatory sentence by
Muskegon County Circuit Judge James Graves Jr. a week after a jury
found him guilty but mentally ill on two counts of first-degree
murder.
   Dobben admitted killing 15-month-old Peter David and 2-year-old
Bartley Joel on Thanksgiving Day 1987 in a furnace at the
Cannon-Muskegon Corp. foundry where he worked. His attorneys
contended Dobben was insane at the time.
   Dobben, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic two years before
the slayings, is guaranteed treatment for his mental illness while
incarcerated.
   Dobben was to be taken Wednesday from the Muskegon County Jail
to the State Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson, where he will
be psychologically evaluated for a decision on where to imprison
him, authorities said.
   Dobben's defense attorneys have said they will appeal the
verdict.

<HEAD>House Committee Agrees to `Fast Track' For Drought Relief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the House Agriculture Committee
agreed Tuesday to push through a broad package of federal
assistance this week for farmers suffering crop losses from
continuing drought.
   The full committee, under an agreement worked out by Democrats
and Republicans, will act on the legislation Thursday. The
drought-relief package will be brought before the House at an
undetermined date after lawmakers return from a Memorial Day recess.
   ``I think the chances that a bill will be passed and signed into
law by the president ... have dramatically improved,'' Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., said after the meeting of committee leaders,
including the panel chairman, Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas.
   The assistance package will mirror relief programs enacted by
Congress last year to aid producers in the Midwest and northern
Great Plains.
   In general, federal payments would be made to farmers who suffer
losses of more than 35 percent of their crops.
   The relief would be available for all crops _ not just specific
hard-hit ones like wheat _ because of damage from drought, freezing
temperatures, hail and excessive moisture, said Scott Swenson, a
spokesman for Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the
Agriculture subcomittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains.
   Lawmakers are considering another drought package this year
because the Agriculture Department has said the 1989 winter wheat
crop doesn't qualify for any of the $3.9 billion in assistance
approved in 1988.
   Last week, a bipartisan group of senators introduced
drought-relief legislation that would extend last year's assistance
programs to the winter wheat crop.
   Roberts said that House committee leaders decided to go with a
``generic bill'' as a way of broadening support as well as ensuring
that adequate aid is available to spring-planted crops if the
drought worsens or spreads to other regions.
   Last year's dry weather has persisted in some areas, with winter
wheat states like Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas particularly hard hit.
   The Agriculture Department estimated this month that
drought-related damage will cut this year's expected crop of winter
wheat to 1.43 billion bushels, the lowest since 1978.

<HEAD>Project To Encourage Transfers to Four-Year Colleges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Council on Education and the Ford
Foundation on Tuesday announced an 18-month project to encourage
community and junior college students to transfer to four-year
institutions.
   A major thrust of the project is to boost the number of minority
and low-income students moving to four-year colleges and
universities, the sponsors said. Nearly half the nation's 2 million
minority college students attend two-year institutions.
   There are about 1,250 two-year community and junior colleges in
the country, said project director Judith Eaton, president of the
Community College of Philadelphia.
   She said the transfer rate to four-year colleges is estimated at
between 6 percent and 20 percent, though surveys have found that 70
percent or more of students at the two-year institutions say when
asked that they want to go on to earn a bachelor's degree.
   The first part of the $1.2 million project, due to start in
September, will pair 25 two-year institutions with four-year
colleges and universities. The partner schools will collaborate on
projects such as redesigning courses to make credits transferable,
developing faculty exchange programs and creating pilot programs
for two-year students with potential to transfer.
   ``Often what passes for collaboration is simply a paper
agreement,'' said Alison Bernstein of the Ford Foundation.
``Students are always in danger of losing time and losing credit,
and taxpayers are in danger of losing money, because two- and
four-year colleges haven't come to an agreement.''
   Eaton and Bernstein said at a news conference that community
colleges grew on a wave of interest in career education in the
1970s. When enrollment leveled off in the 1980s, they said,
questions arose as to their effectiveness, particularly with regard
to minority and low-income students.
   ``We became so obsessed with access issues that we lost sight of
retention and graduation issues,'' said Robert Atwell, president of
the ACE, an umbrella group for 1,700 educational institutions and
associations. The Ford Foundation is a private philanthropic group
that sponsors reasearch.
   Other phases of the ACE-Ford project, scheduled to follow the
partnership experiments, involve finding ways to encourage
transfers through federal policy and holding regional meetings to
discuss how different types of colleges and universities can
encourage transfers of minority and low-income students.

   Wan Li, the head of the Chinese People's
Congress, cut short his American visit after meeting with President
Bush on Tuesday, and U.S. officials said they expected him to
return to Beijing to press for the ouster of hard-line Premier Li
Peng.
   One senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said the administration expects Wan to call a meeting of the
People's Congress shortly after his return. The body, which acts as
China's legislature, is sometimes considered a rubber-stamp
organization, but it does have the authority to impose or revoke
martial law, the official said.
   He said Wan was expected to urge the People's Conress to reject
the use of military force against pro-democracy demonstrators, who
have continued their protest after a government declaration of
martial law, and to press the body to formally oust Li.
   Bush, in his meeting with Wan, repeated his call for
non-violence and asked Wan to end the jamming of Voice of America,
according to a White House statement.
   Demonstrators in Beijing had been relying heavily on VOA
broadcasts to keep informed during the five weeks of pro-democracy
protests. The jamming, which began Monday, was the first by China
of VOA transmissions since before diplomatic relations with the
United States were restored in 1979.
   The White House statement quoted Bush as telling Wan that ``We
are strongly committed to democracy around the world. It is the
underpinning of our being as a nation. I urge non-violence and
restraint in your present situation. I urge that Voice of America
not be jammed, and that reporters be given open access.''
   If extensive force were used to break up the demonstrations,
said the U.S. official who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
that could put U.S.-Chinese relations in question and endanger the
broad-based economic ties that have been built up over the past
years of good relations, the official said.
   He pointed to the fact that the United States has had no
official contact with Chinese authorities _ in China _ for nearly
two days as evidence of continued high-level turmoil, adding that
the Chinese appear to have shut down all contact with foreign
governments.
   Wan had been expected to remain in the United States several
more days, but State Department officials were informed he was
returning late Tuesday.
   The Chinese Embassy said that Wan's visit, ``for health reasons,
will end earlier than scheduled,'' and that he, his wife and
delegation were returning home. Visits to Florida and New York had
been on their original schedule.
   The embassy announcement, which did not elaborate on the health
problem, said the two countries had ``conducted a broad exchange of
views on international issues and Sino-U.S. bilateral relations in
a sincere and friendly atmosphere.''
   If Premier Li is removed, that could open the way for Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang to assume his duties, the U.S. official
said.
   Zhao won some favor by meeting with the student hunger strikers
last week and opposing Li's hard-line stance.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who earlier in the day
lauded China for ``going in the right direction'' with its economic
liberalization, joined Bush and his National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft for the hour-long session with Wan in the Oval Office.
   The senior U.S. official who offered the latest analysis said it
is likely Wan could organize a delegation of the People's Congress
to meet with representatives of the students in order to meet their
demand for a dialogue with the authorities.
   The White House meeting with Wan occurred as the turmoil
continued in China, where one million people defied martial law for
a fifth straight day and filled the streets to demand Li's
resignation.
   The demonstration was the strongest public display of wrath yet
toward Li, who imposed martial law on Saturday as the student-led
effort for democratic reforms continued.
   Chinese leaders, in particular senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
appear to believe that any use of military force to put down the
demonstrations would have to be so extensive that it would be
nearly impossible to carry out, the official said.
   For their part, the students appear to have thwarted a
widespread military crackdown by fomenting demonstrations in other
cities besides Beijing, thereby weakening the military threat by
forcing a dispersal of troop strength, the official said.
   On the other hand, China's renewal of television satellite
transmissions is a sign that the power struggle continues and that
Li may be losing ground, the official said.

<HEAD>De Mita Emerges as Choice To Succeed Himself as Italy's Premier</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ciriaco De Mita emerged Tuesday as the Christian
Democrats' choice to succeed himself as premier after his forced
resignation last week.
   But it was not certain De Mita could form a Cabinet, and
politicians warned it may take weeks before a new government is
formed.
   The 13-month-old De Mita coalition government that resigned
Friday was the 48th government in Italy since World War II.
   The Christian Democrats' leadership in the Chamber of Deputies
and the Senate expressed their support of De Mita as President
Francesco Cossiga held a second day of consultations.
   De Mita resigned after repeated attacks by the Socialists, who
belonged to his five-party coalition but constantly jockeyed for
power. The other partners were the small Republican, Social
Democrat and Liberal parties.
   De Mita is serving in a caretaker role and will be in that
capacity during the three-day visit of President Bush beginning
Friday.
   Cossiga must find someone who can gather enough support to form
a coalition. No party has a majority in Italy.
   Arnaldo Forlani, secretary of the Christian Democrats, met with
Cossiga and later told reporters the party ``confirmed its
solidarity with the premier (De Mita) and with the government.''
   Forlani's party has dominated all Cabinets since the end of
World War II in 1945.
   Forlani cautioned against turning to early elections to resolve
the crisis. Elections are not scheduled until 1992 but could be
moved up if needed to break a stalemate.
   Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, De Mita's main rival, also met
with Cossiga and gave assurances the Socialists were ``absolutely
open to dialogue and collaboration.''

   Small pieces of glass have been found in eight
packages of American-made Nerds candy, a brand popular with
millions of British children, the importers said Tuesday.
   Importers Anglo, Bellamy and Wilkinson said no one had been
injured but urged customers, who buy a million packets of Nerds a
week, to be ``on their guard.''
   The glass was found in eight packages of the tiny fruit-flavored
sweets bought in the Liverpool area and in north Wales.
   ``At present there is insufficient evidence to show how the
glass came to be in the packets,'' the importers said.
   ``In an attempt to identify sources of glass in each case, the
company has been conducting thorough checks from manufacturing to
retail outlets,'' it said.
   The contamination was discovered when 8-year-old Stephen Lloyd
of Liverpool found glass in his Nerds after eating half a packet.
   Police involved in the investigation are looking for a possible
link with a baby food scare last month when glass was found in
products in jars and cans in several areas.

   Scores of soldiers, leftist
rebels and civilians were killed in a guerrilla offensive called in
solidarity with Panama, reports from both sides said Tuesday.
   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said guerrillas
inflicted 137 casualties on 30 government positions Monday in an
offensive called ``Together with Panama in Its Fight for the Canal
and Its Sovereignty.''
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front has issued
made statements supporting Panama and has portrayed Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the de facto ruler, as a victim of ``Yankee
imperialism.''
   According to the army press office, soldiers killed 32 rebels
and wounded 28 during confrontations Monday in three of El
Salvador's 14 provinces. It mentioned six soldiers killed and seven
wounded.
   No breakdown of dead and wounded was given in the rebel radio
broadcast, and it said nothing of guerrilla casualties. Each side
tends to inflate the other's losses.
   Eight Salvadoran civilians were killed Monday when their van
either struck a mine or was ambushed in La Libertad province 45
miles northwest of San Salvador, Judge Hugo Castaneda told
reporters in the area. He said seven were wounded, some of them
seriously.
   Col. Galileo Torres, an army spokesman, blamed the rebels. The
army press office said guerrillas detonated a land mine as the van
passed, then sprayed the vehicle with machine-gun fire.
   Heriberto Mejia, 32, who lives nearby, told The Associated Press
he arrived at the scene moments later and wounded passengers told
him of an explosion but did not mention gunfire.
   Guerrillas ambushed an army vehicle near where the van was
attacked, killing four soldiers, the army said.
   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed since the civil war began nine years ago.
   Guerrillas have promised said they will ``make the country
ungovernable'' with more attacks immediately before the
inauguration June 1 of President-elect Alfredo Cristiani.
   Cristiani represents the right-wing Republican Nationalist
Alliance and will succeed Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian
Democrat and staunch ally of the United States.

   The army rounded up Palestinian activists in
raids on five villages in the West Bank before dawn Tuesday,
according to Palestinian and Israeli news reports.
   In London, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dismissed as
``useless'' U.S. calls on Israel to withdraw from the occupied
lands.
   A pro-PLO newspaper in Jerusalem published a Palestinian appeal
to be presented at the Arab summit in Morocco urging Arab leaders
to reject Israel's peace plan and demand that the United States
support creation of a Palestinian state.
   In the occupied West Bank, the army clamped curfews on five West
Bank villages, ordered all men between the ages of 15 and 40 out of
their homes and made a number of arrests, the reports said.
   Among those detained were five Palestinians from Al Mughayir,
near Ramallah, who were suspected of killing a fellow villager
accused of collaborating with the Israeli authorities, according to
the reports.
   In Kufr Sur near Tulkarem, residents reported they were ordered
to paint over anti-Israeli slogans and remove Palestinian flags.
They said tax agents accompanied the troops to collect back levies.
   The national Itim news agency quoted West Bank commander Maj.
Gen. Amram Mitzna as saying the army was using such raids to
apprehend Palestinian activists in the West Bank and ``manifest
control of the area.''
   Last week, the army arrested more than 250 Moselem
fundamentalist Palestinian activists in th Gaza Strip.
   Also Tuesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded eleven
Palestinians during stone-throwing protests, Arab hospital
officials said. One victim was a 70-year-old woman from a village
near Nablus who was hit in the chest with a plastic bullet, the
doctors said.
   The army confirmed the shooting in Nablus and said soldiers
wounded two other Palestians in separate incidents. An army
spokesman said they were investigating the other reports.
   The Civil Administration in the West Bank destroyed seven
illegally built houses in villages near Hebron, and the army
declared a curfew on the town of Jenin to prevent rioting after the
death of a former mayor by an apparent heart attack, Israel radio
said.
   Throughout the occupied lands, Palestinans staged a general
strike Tuesday declared by the PLO underground leaders to mark the
Arab summit. The strike was only partially observed in the Gaza
Strip, Israel radio reported.
   The appeal to participants of the Arab League, which convened
Tuesday, was published in the east pro-PLO Jerusalem daily Al Fajr,
which described the document as the appeal from the ``state of
Palestine.''
   The appeal urged Arab nations to support Palestinian peace
proposals, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
lands and an international peace conference to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   It also sought ``support for Palestinian opposition in rejecting
the Israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation''
and ask the United States for ``clear recognition of Palestinian
rights to self-determination.''
   Shamir rejected a call by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III for Israel to stop building Jewish settlements on occupied
territory and reportedly said his government's peace plan ruled out
giving up territory for peace.
   ``The government's peace plan, which obligates everyone, rejects
the formula,'' Israel radio quoted Shamir as telling British
officials in London. In his peace plan, Shamir had previously left
open the issue of territorial compromise.
   Shamir was asked about Baker's call for Israel to give up the
idea of annexing the occupied lands, and he replied, ``I think it
was useless.''
   Shamir insisted the details of his peace plan should not be
discussed until they can be negotiated with Palestinians.
   The plan calls for electing Palestinians in the occupied lands
to negotiate with Israel on a temporary self-rule plan, with talks
to be held later on the final status of the territories.
   Palestinians object because the proposal does not guarantee them
independence or an end to military rule.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel called Baker's call for
land concessions ``explosive'' and said it threatened the coalition
government of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning
Labor Party. Unlike Likud, Labor favors returning some territory
for peace.
   ``We can't say no (to Baker), because if we say no, we won't
have a (Palestinian) negotiating partner,'' said Liel. ``We can't
say yes because if we say yes, we won't have a government.''
   Several right-wing politicians accused Baker of trying to
dictate Israeli policies. But Haim Ramon, parliamentary leader of
the Labor Party, praised the speech as good for U.S.-Israeli
relations.
   ``The prime minister and (Foreign Minister Moshe) Arens are
trying to sell some illusions to Israel that the U.S. is supporting
the Likud extreme policy and I think it's good that citizens will
be aware of the real U.S. policy,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to Baker's
comments, but noted he still said the United States does not favor
creation of a Palestinian state.
   ``It's a slap in the face of Shamir's plan,'' said Hathem Abu
Ghazale, a PLO supporter in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   ``I believe Baker's statement is positive ... but it is not the
change the Palestinians are asking for,'' said Ziad Abu Ziad,
editor of a pro-PLO weekly newspaper.

   Black members of Congress who met with
President Bush on Tuesday said he has agreed to consult them on
contentious issues and they also said they hope to participate in
shaping administration policy.
   While they disagreed with Bush's views on various domestic and
foreign policy issues, they said they are withholding judgment on
his administration until he more fully develops his policies.
   ``We saw this as an important beginning,'' said Rep. Ron
Dellums, D-Calif., after the White House meeting of the
Congressional Black Caucus with Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   But some members expressed serious doubts about Bush's
commitment to many issues they raised during their hour-long
meeting.
   ``We're dealing with a thousand lights without any batteries,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in reference to Bush's often
stated urging for all sectors of society to help make life better
since the government can't afford to do it all.
   Rangel, chairman of the House select committeee on narcotics,
said he has refrained from early criticism of Bush.
   ``I've been very restrained because anything is better than the
last eight years'' under President Reagan, he said. ``But how long
can you wait?'' Rangel said Bush lacks a specific strategy for
helping poor persons fight crime and drug abuse, but that he ``was
willing to work with us to develop one.''
   ``I don't think there was any question about the president's
sincerity. But where does all this go?'' he asked.
   During the meeting, Bush brought up budgetary constraints in
talking about domestic issues, the participants said.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said Bush has proposed a ``do nothing''
budget. ``Right now they haven't put forth an agenda,'' he said.
But he added that he is willing to give Bush more time.
   Participants said that in regard to crime, Bush appeared open to
expanding his policy from a heavy focus on law enforcement and
punishment to include other factors such as education, housing and
health care.
   But on South Africa, the caucus members said he held out no hope
he would come around to their view that more sanctions are needed
to pressure the white minority government to negotiate with
representatives of the black majority.
   Dellums said Bush agreed to meet with the group again and to
have Cabinet members meet with them to discuss other issues.
   By contrast, during the Reagan administration, Black Caucus
members went to the White House at the beginning of 1981 and were
never invited back, Dellums said.
   Despite the differences, some caucus members shied away from
criticism of Bush.
   ``We recognize the president is evolving his policies,'' said
Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas.
   ``We want to be significant players in that policy,'' Dellums
said.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said that while ``it's totally
unclear where we're going,'' at least the administration is willing
to set up a mechanism to hear ideas from legislators who disagree
with the Republican administration.
   Caucus members think Bush is not looking at what they say are
the root causes of drug abuse and crime _ unemployment, poverty,
lack of housing, and poor education.
   ``We were concerned about his priorities there,'' Leland said.
   Dellums said Bush indicated ``he was prepared to expand his
analysis to include an appreciation for the fact that there are
other systemic problems that have to be dealt with and that the
issue of drugs is not going to be eradicated simply by law
enforcement.''
   But Conyers called Bush's anti-crime plan ``strictly draconian
and supply-side oriented.''

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini underwent
surgery Tuesday to stop intestinal bleeding, and his son said the
89-year-old revolutionary patriarch was in ``very good condition.''
   ``There is nothing for the people to worry about. The operation
was successfully completed this morning and the doctors are
satisfied and happy with the results,'' Ahmad Khomeini said on
Tehran radio.
   Tehran television showed the five-man medical team that
performed the surgery and quoted one of the doctors as saying
Khomeini was in excellent condition.
   In Paris, however, an exiled Shiite Moslem leader told The
Associated Press he understood Khomeini had ``lost a great deal of
blood'' and was in ``precarious'' condition. Ayatollah Mehdi
Rouhani would not reveal his sources or provide details.
   Tehran television showed Khomeini leaning on a stick and walking
slowly into hospital accompanied by his son.
   It also showed Khomeini in a shawl, rubbing a string of worry
beads and connected to an intravenous tube, reclining on a hospital
bed. It was not clear when the footage was taken.
   In a later broadcast showing the medical team, the chief surgeon
Dr. Hassan Arefi said that for his age Khomeini was in ``excellent
condition'' and had been taking his usual two or three 25-minute
walks every day until Monday.
   Cardiologist Iraj Fazel said the intestinal problem was detected
several days ago and he added:
   ``There was no time pressure. Naturally, we did have some
concerns ... during the operation ... but none of these
materialized.''
   President Ali Khamenei urged Iran's 50 million people to ``pray
to Allah in thanks'' for the successful surgery, Tehran radio
reported.
   Ahmad Khomeini, 43, said his father's condition was ``very good
... and in the future will get even better.''
   ``We decided not to hide anything from the people,'' he said.
``Some blood had been detected in the imam's digestive tract. The
doctors and surgeons consulted among themselves and concluded the
best course would be to operate. This was discussed with the Imam
and he agreed that the doctors should do whatever they thought
best.''
   News of the illness, which had not been reported, once again
raised the question of who will govern Iran after the imam whose
fundamentalist revolution overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a
decade ago.
   On March 28, Khomeini dumped his designated successor, Ayatollah
Hussein-Ali Montazeri, for criticizing his policies and appointed a
20-man constitutional committee to decide who will preside after
his death.
   Iran has been in political turmoil since a truce Aug. 20 in the
8-year-old war with Iraq, with factions jostling for supremacy in
the succession.
   Khomeini's office issued a brief statement announcing the
surgery and few details were provided by Tehran radio or the
official Islamic Republic News Agency, both monitored in Nicosia.
   His office said in part: ``The operation on Imam Khomeini, which
was undertaken Tuesday morning to stop bleeding in his digestive
system, was successfully completed, and praise the Lord, his
condition is completely satisfactory.''
   Reports that Khomeini was ailing have circulated frequently
since he suffered a heart attack three years ago.
   An unconfirmed report late last year said he had prostate
cancer. He rarely emerges from his heavily guarded home Jamaran, a
northern Tehran suburb.
   The last time Tehran TV showed Khomeini speaking was in taped
excerpts of a February meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze, the first audience he had granted to a foreign
dignitary.
   Television frequently shows Khomeini in the mosque adjacent to
his residence, sitting on a platform about 6 feet above the crowd.
He appears frail, moves slowly and does not speak.
   Ahmad is constantly at Khomeini's side. The son controls access
to his father and has assumed a greater political role in recent
months, causing speculation about his ambitions.
   Last week, Iranian newspapers published a long letter from Ahmad
Khomeini to Montazeri harshly criticizing him for questioning the
imam's decisions.
   The constitutional committee's deliberations on changing the
1979 charter has occurred in an atmosphere of wrangling between the
so-called radicals and pragmatists of the Tehran hierarchy.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, parliament speaker and pragmatist leader,
wants to eliminate the post of prime minister and give the
presidency wider powers in order to end a competition for power
that often paralyzes the government.
   Presidential elections are scheduled for August, when incumbent
Ali Khamenei's second four-year term expires. Rafsanjani, also
acting military commander-in-chief, is the only announced candidate.
   Without a single figure invested with the imam's combination of
spiritual and political authority, indications are that Iran will
have a collective leadership after he dies. Khomeini has kept any
group from gaining overall power by repeatedly changing sides.
   Political infighting was muted during the war with Iraq, but
burst into the open after the cease-fire.
   Khomeini called his decision to accept the truce ``more deadly
to me than poison.''
   Rafsanjani tried to improve relations with the West, get
reconstruction aid and open up the economy. Radicals led by Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi and Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
want Iran to remain aloof.
   Khomeini came down on the radical side in February and started a
new confrontation with the West by ordering his followers to kill
Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British novelist he said blasphemed
Islam in the novel ``The Satanic Verses.''

<HEAD>Kosovo Minister Reports 237 Ethnic Albanians Held</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interior minister of Kosovo
province said Tuesday that authorities have detained 237 ethnic
Albanians without charge there and are keeping them in isolation.
   Minister Jusuf Karakusi said those held ``are people who acted
in the interests of Albanian nationalism and separatism and who ..
. exposed their hostile positions,'' according to the state Tanjug
news agency.
   Mass demonstrations took place in Kosovo in February and March,
and clashes between ethnic Albanian rioters and Yugoslav security
forces killed at least 25 people, including two policemen.
   Ethnic Albanians make up about 85 percent of Kosovo's population
of 1.8 million. They were protesting constitutional changes which
limited the wide autonomy enjoyed by the province and gave the
republic of Serbia a greater say in running Kosovo's affairs.
   Yugoslavia is composed of six republics and two autonomous
provinces.
   A state of emergency was imposed in Kosovo, followed by a
crackdown in which more than 800 people were arrested on charges
rising from the disturbances.
   Karakuski said an additional ``237 have been detained under
isolation measures.''
   Press reports said that among those jailed without charge are
prominent ethnic Albanian politicians, intellectuals and other
community leaders who opposed the constitutional amendments.
   About 100 people from the central Yugoslav village of Mosevac
meanwhile fasted for a fourth day outside the federal parliament in
Belgrade on Tuesday to protest alleged harassment by police in
their home region.
   Another 100 villagers from Mosevac, 180 miles west of Belgrade,
were to join the protest, hunger strikers told The Associated Press.
   Behind the demonstration is a feud dating to 1986 between the
local official youth organization and Communist leaders in the
village. The young people accuse the leaders of corruption and
political nepotism.
   The protest started last Saturday over the arrest of Hasan
Delic, a local youth activist, on May 13. Delic has fasted in jail
for eight days, press reports said.
   Local officials and police were alleged to have misappropriated
funds collected for a village community hall.

<HEAD>French Doctors Say Toxic Gas Killed People in Soviet Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French humanitarian organization said Tuesday its
doctors concluded through investigations in the Soviet republic of
Georgia that toxic gases killed some demonstrators who died in a
clash there with police last month.
   Medecins sans Frontiers (Doctors without Borders) said in a
statement that Chloropicrine was identified as one of the gases
responsible on the basis of autopsy results in 16 cases.
   The statement said the four-member French team worked with
American colleagues from the group Physicians for Human Rights,
with Georgian doctors and with representatives from the Georgian
Health Ministry. It said the team would address further questions
upon returning to Paris on Wednesday.
   The organization's Dr. Marc Gastellu Etchegorry said
Chloropicrine had been approved in the Soviet Union for use as a
tear gas until 1981, when it was reclassified as a ``suffocant'' or
asphyxiating gas for combat use.
   Nineteen people died in clashes between police and Georgian
nationalists on April 9 in Tbilisi, the republic's capital. Police
shot and killed a 20th person later as a curfew violator.
   The foreign medical investigators were invited by the Georgian
government and by Andrei Sakharov, prominent Soviet dissident,
human rights campaigner, nuclear physicist and Nobel Peace laureate.
   The doctors examined and questioned about 100 hospitalized
patients.
   They said hundreds of people were admitted to hospitals
beginning on April 17, more than a week after the clash, believing
they suffered secondary effects from the toxic gases.
   The statement said the doctors concluded these people were
suffering from a panic syndrome caused by psychological trauma, and
not from chemical effects from gases.
   The French doctors' group says it understands Chloropicrine is
made in the United States as well as the Soviet Union. The doctors
assume, but do not know for a fact, that the gas is part of
military stockpile rather than used as tear gas in riot control.
   The army general in command of Soviet forces in Georgia, Gen.
Igor Rodionov, denied on April 30 that his troops used toxic gas
but said Interior Ministry units had tear gas. He did not say that
they used it.

<HEAD>Judge Sets August Trial Date For Bakker, Dortch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL leaders Jim Bakker and Richard
Dortch will go on trial Aug. 28 on charges they diverted more than
$4 million in PTL money, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter did not rule on a motion to
move the trial away from Charlotte or on Dortch's request that he
be tried separately.
   Bakker and Dortch, who was Bakker's top aide, are charged with
mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and
diverting more than $4 million for their own use.
   If convicted on all counts, each man faces up to 120 years in
prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   Neither Bakker nor Dortch attended the 10-minute hearing.
   Bakker resigned as PTL head in March 1987 amidst a sex and money
scandal triggered by reports of a sexual liaison with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   The PTL ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization three
months later. PTL owes creditors more than $130 million, according
to bankruptcy records.
   Attorneys in the case said they expect the trial to last five or
six weeks.
   PTL's theme park, Heritage USA, other property and the
ministry's television network were bought by Toronto businessman
Stephen Mernick for $65 million.
   On Monday, Potter set a July 5 trial date for brothers James and
David Taggart on charges of conspiracy and tax evasion in the
alleged misuse of $1.1 million in PTL ministry money.
   David Taggart is a former personal aide to Bakker, and James
Taggart is a former interior decorator for the ministry. Both men
have pleaded innocent to charges of income tax evasion and
conspiracy.
   If convicted on all counts, the Taggarts could each be sentenced
to up to 30 years in prison and be fined $1.35 million.

   A man with a long history of assaults on
children has been charged with raping and sexually mutilating a
7-year-old boy, a tragedy officials and relatives say they were
stymied from preventing.
   ``He's my brother and I love him, but God, he's driven the whole
family nuts for 20 years,'' John Shriner said after older brother
Earl Kenneth Shriner's arraignment Monday.
   Police said an assailant lured the boy into the woods and
repeatedly and violently raped him, choked him, stabbed him in the
back and cut off his penis.
   Shriner, 39, pleaded innocent in Pierce County Superior Court to
attempted murder, rape and assault in the attack on the boy, who
was found Saturday wandering in shock in a South Tacoma woods,
naked, bloody, and with a noose wrapped around his neck. He was in
satisfactory condition at a hospital Tuesday.
   Bail for Shriner was set at $1 million pending a trial July 17.
   About 50 people crowded into the courtroom and about a dozen
placard-waving demonstrators protested outside the County-City
Building against the crime. The boy's doctor, Dr. John Coombs,
called it ``the most outrageous thing I've ever seen.''
   State Sen. Phil Talmadge of Seattle, ranking Democrat on the
Senate Law and Justice Committee, said he will write the state
Department of Corrections and Department of Social and Health
Services asking why Shriner was free.
   ``I want to see their explanation,'' Talmadge said Tuesday.
``This guy by all accounts had no business being out on the
street.''
   Spokesmen for Corrections and for the state's Indeterminate
Sentence Review Board said they kept Shriner locked up as long as
they could.
   ``I totally understand the frustration,'' said Dennis Marsh, the
board's executive secretary. ``I guess from our perspective, the
parole board's perspective, there was nothing we could do.
   ``I guess the next guestion is, who needs to do what and when?''
   Shriner's criminal history dates to 1965, when he was declared a
``defective delinquent'' after choking a 7-year-old girl. The
now-outdated term was used to designate delinquents considered to
have mental or emotional reasons for committing violent acts.
   In 1966, he was sent to a school for people with developmental
disabilities after he led authorities to the body of Lorretta Marie
Sturtz, a 15-year-old classmate at a school for the mentally
retarded. She had been strangled and left tied to a tree.
Considered too dangerous by school officials, Shriner was committed
to Western State Hospital from 1968 to 1973.
   In 1976, he was acquitted in two separate assault cases, but
pleaded guilty in May 1977 to assaulting two 16-year-old female
hitchhikers. The judge ordered him committed to the sexual
psychopath program at Eastern State Hospital, but officials there
refused to accept him. He spent his entire 10-year sentence at the
Shelton Correctional Center.
   In the final months of his prison term, Shriner was found with
lists of things he would need to maim or kill youngsters, said
Kathryn S. Bail, Indeterminate Sentence Review Board chairwoman.
   ``We did everything legally possible to keep him in custody,''
Ms. Bail said.
   At a hearing to commit Shriner to a state hospital, he was freed
by a judge, said Frank Mendizabal, Department of Social and Health
Services spokesman.
   In November 1987, Shriner pleaded guilty to assault in the
stabbing of a 16-year-old boy. He served 66 days of a 90-day
sentence. In October 1988, Shriner pleaded guilty to attempted
unlawful imprisonment in an attack on a 10-year-old boy who was
tied to a post and beaten. He was sentenced to 67 days in jail.
   The sentences were not longer because both cases involved the
relatively minor charge of simple assault, authorities said.
   Reports on Shriner up to 1977 described Shriner as mentally
retarded, but in 1987 psychiatrists and psychologists at a state
hospital concluded he had a learning disability and other
disorders, including pedophilia and an anti-social personality.
   Shriner had been living with his mother before his arrest
Sunday. She said Monday that she loved her son, but if he was
guilty, ``he should be put somewhere where he's safe and where
people are safe from him.''
   Tacoma police Sgt. Stan Mowre said police had warned residents
in Shriner's neighborhood, but couldn't specifically tell them
about Shriner and his record.
   ``He had served every day of his sentence,'' Mowre said. ``You
can't go out and stigmatize someone and take out a billboard on
them.''

<HEAD>Middlebury College Claims Stake in Frisbee Creation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note Frisbee toys but Frisbie Pie Co.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth students
have long held they were the first to pick up a pie tin made by the
Frisbie Pie Co. and toss it back and forth. But Middlebury College
insisted Tuesday they were all wrong.
   ``It happened all over America. But it started here,'' said
Middlebury President Olin Robison.
   Middlebury says its students started the pie tin toss 50 years
ago, and on Tuesday the school unveiled a bronze statue of a dog
catching a modern-day version.
   The 300-pound statue, by artist Patrick Villiers Farrow of
Rutland, was placed in a quadrangle where students play with
Frisbee flying discs now.
   Middlebury officials contend that a group of Delta Upsilon
fraternity brothers happened upon the game while taking a road trip
to a fraternity convention in Nebraska.
   Short on money, the frat brothers feasted on a 1939 favorite,
Frisbie fruit pies. While waiting for a flat tire to be repaired,
two DU brothers began tossing the leftover tin back and forth to
amuse themselves, the story goes.
   They shared the game with the entire campus when they returned,
according to an article in a spring 1976 issue of the Middlesbury
College Newsletter.
   ```That fall in Middlebury (1939) the air was filled with flying
pans, every size and shape,''' Robison said Tuesday, quoting the
story. ```Grade point averages dropped, football attendance
suffered and all stores were out of pie pans.'''
   Among those attending Tuesday's ceremony was Margaret Cole,
stepmother of one of the fraternity members. She has no doubt the
Middlebury students were the first.
   ``The people from Yale _ they just caught on,'' said Cole, who
remembers the sudden disappearance of tin pie plates from stores
after the fad took off. She switched to Pyrex dishes for her pies
because ``they were too heavy. They didn't fly well.''
   Also on hand was Paul Eriksson, one of the fraternity brothers
who went on the 1939 road trip. Eriksson, a book publisher, said he
can't quite remember the exact circumstances of that first pie tin
toss.
   And he doesn't remember much about the convention because the DU
brothers only sent one member to all the meetings. During their
stay in Nebraska, Erikson said, ``we probably threw Frisbies.''
   After World War II, the travels of the flying pie tins become
easier to document, according to Dan Roddick of the Wham-O
Manufacturing Co. in San Gabriel, Calif., which makes the modern
Frisbee flying disc.
   In 1948, West Coast inventor Walter Fred Morrison made plastic
versions of the old pie tin and marketed them as flying saucers. In
1957, Wham-O Manufacturing Co. began selling them under a
registered trademark.
   While marketing the new product, Wham-O discovered the
popularity of flying pie plates and liked the name. But company
officials didn't realize the origin of the name, and misspelled it,
he said.
   ``As to the documentation on who cast the first one without a
blueberry pie in it, that's a bit of a challenge,'' Roddick said.
   Roddick said the controversy has been fierce at times. He
recalled a series of letters between graduates of Yale and
Princeton in Yale's alumni magazine in which students presented
documentation on where, when and how the first flying disc was
thrown.
   Roddick said there is documentation indicating children in
colonial times played with flying wooden discs that were called
``sailors.''
   ``I think what you have here is a pretty spontaneous response to
a natural opportunity,'' Roddick said.
   Now, 27 countries belong to the World Flying Disc Federation and
the National Association of Sporting Goods Manufacturers lists 57
companies that market flying saucers, Roddick said.
   Eriksson seemed unfazed by the ruckus.
   ``Who would of thought that a silly little thing like throwing a
pie tin would turn into a national pastime,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Wants Driftnet Treaty Renegotiated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher
believes a tentative driftnet fishing agreement with Japan is
inadequate and will ask the State Department to negotiate a new
one, a Commerce Department spokesman said Tuesday.
   Northwest lawmakers, fishing groups and environmentalists, who
have been critical of the pact, praised Mosbacher's decision and
urged U.S. officials to adopt a ``tougher stance'' in future talks.
   Japanese officials previously told the State Department the
agreement was only a take-it-or-leave-it basis and said they would
be unwilling to reopen negotiations.
   Japan, along with South Korea and Taiwan, faces possible trade
sanctions on fishery products exported to the United States if
driftnet agreements are not signed by June 29.
   An estimated 700 to 1,000 fishing vessels from Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan use driftnets in the north Pacific, ostensibly to
catch squid.
   The monofilament, small-mesh nets, which can stretch more than
30 miles long, hang in the water and snare virtually any mammal,
bird or fish which comes in contact. The nets can cover more than
30,000 miles of ocean in a day.
   Mosbacher believes the treaty calls for too few observers on
Japanese driftnet vessels and not enough patrol vessels in the
legal driftnet zone in the north Pacific to ensure compliance, said
Ranjit de Silva, a Commerce Department spokesman.
   De Silva also said Mosbacher is concerned over the Japanese
rejection of a proposal to place transponders on their vessels so
their locations could be tracked by satellite.
   ``The secretary is not satisfied with it (the agreement) and
wants the State Department to renegotiate, focusing on these
points,'' said de Silva.
   Mosbacher has the authority to decide whether the agreements
satisfy the monitoring and enforcement provisions of the Driftnet
Act passed by Congress in 1987.
   U.S. fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionally
catching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid, and they say
salmon runs in Alaska, Washington and Oregon have dropped sharply
as a result.
   Environmentalists charge driftnets are responsible for the
deaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine
life each year.
   The tentative treaty with Japan would allow 32 observers to be
placed aboard the estimated 460 Japanese vessels using driftnets
and would increase from four to five the number of Japanese patrol
boats in the vast area where squid fishing is allowed.
   The Japanese also indicated they were unilaterally expanding the
legal driftnet fish zone 120 miles north.
   ``This is the outcome we've been working for,'' Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, said of Mosbacher's decision.
   Murkowski said he wants Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
appoint a ``tough, special negotiator who will make sure the U.S.
point of view is represented strongly and effectively.''
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said Baker should reopen talks at
the ``highest level'' and a new treaty should increase the number
of observers and patrol boats and require transponders on Japanese
vessels.
   Dem Cowles, a spokesman for the United Fishermen of Alaska, said
the tentative agreement was the ``absolute wrong message to send to
the Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese fishermen who are acting
like pirates out there.''
   Cowles' group represents 18,000 fishermen from Alaska,
Washington state, Oregon and California.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes For FSX Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted
22-12 on Tuesday to moderate Senate-passed legislation which
includes conditions on the transfer U.S. aerospace technology to
Japan for the co-production of the FSX jet fighter.
   But Republican members said the legislation remains ``veto
bait'' because President Bush opposes any restrictions on his
ability to negotiate the agreement with the Japanese government.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., ranking Republican on the
panel, said he has been told by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III that any restrictions on the FSX deal ``will be vetoed.''
   William Clark, assistant secretary of state-designate for East
Asian affairs, said the administration believes that any changes
``would require us as good-faith negotiators to reapproach the
Japanese.''
   The House panel refined legislation drafted by Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., after that body narrowly defeated, 52-47, a
resolution to disapprove the co-development deal.
   The Byrd legislation, imposing restrictions on the president in
hammering out future co-production arrangements, was adopted by the
Senate 72-27.
   The House panel adopted a substitute drafted by Rep, Stephen J.
Solarz, D-N.Y. which makes two major changes in Byrd's proposal.
   The Byrd amendment would impose a flat prohibition on the
transfer of critical U.S. engine technology to Japan during
co-production.
   Solarz changed that to an expression of congressional sentiment
that such technology should not be transferred and giving the House
and Senate a chance at vetoing the arrangement if a transfer was
approved.
   The Byrd legislation also flatly bars Japan from selling or
transferring the FSX or its technology to a third country.
   The Solarz version sets up a mechanism for Congress to
disapprove such a sale if the president were to approve it, but
does not ban it outright.
   The Solarz-drafted legislation retained provisions requiring a
General Accounting Office study of the effects of the FSX
arrangement on the American aircraft and aerospace industry as well
as a provision calling on the president to seek at least a 40
percent share of the benefits of the deal for U.S. industry.
   ``This sense of the Congress statement is motherhood and apple
pie,'' Solarz said of the latter provision. It does not require
renegotiation. If the president does not get 40 percent, so be it.
But now he can say to the Japanese, Congress wants us to get no
less than 40 percent.''
   If the House were to pass the legislation as approved by the
committee, differences with the Senate-passed provision would be
ironed out by a Senate-House conference.
   The agreement calls for U.S.-based General Dynamics and
Mitsubuishi Heavy Industries of Japan to jointly develop and build
the FSX, which would be an advanced version of General Dynamics'
F-16, for use in the Japanese air force starting late in the next
decade.

<HEAD>Rebels Blame Government for Relief Train Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels on Tuesday blamed the government
for a raid by armed men on a train carrying relief supplies to
southern Sudan, where starvation threatens thousands of people.
   A government statement Monday said the gunmen stole the
``personal belongings'' of three Western relief officials aboard
the train but did not touch the supplies.
   Also Tuesday, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, arrived in Khartoum to discuss efforts to end the
6-year-old civil war.
   Information Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh met with Cohen and said
the U.S. diplomat promised American assistance to the peace efforts
and called the government's actions to gain a truce ``positive.''
   Cohen is to spend three days in Sudan and then go to Ethiopia to
meet with representatives of the rebels' Sudan People's Liberation
Army.
   Lam Akol, an SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, Kenya, claimed that
government-equipped militias stopped and boarded the relief train
carrying 1,500 tons of foodstuffs, and he said the attack ``was
sanctioned by Khartoum.''
   The government statement said about 100 armed men boarded the
train Sunday nine miles north of Malwal, saying they were looking
for foreigners. It said that after robbing the three relief
officials the gunmen ordered the train crew to continue the trip to
the government-controlled town of Aweil.
   The train left Muglad in southwestern Sudan Saturday for Aweil,
180 miles farther south, with stops en route in the towns of Malwal
and Maput.
   It has 48 freight cars, and Malwal, Maput and Aweil are each to
receive the load from 16 cars.
   Maput is held by the rebels, but Akol denied reports that they
also control Malwal.
   He said the train was attacked to terrorize the people in Malwal
``so they would flee and we will have nothing to capture.''
   Akol said the rebels ``accepted that two thirds (of the food) go
to government-held areas because the movement of the train depended
on that agreement.''
   SPLA leader John Garang announced early in May a unilateral
cease-fire for one month to assist the U.N.-backed relief program
that is trying to stockpile enough food in the south to save about
100,000 people from starving.
   Many of the people facing starvation live in villages isolated
by the civil war.
   Sudan has been torn for decades by conflicts between southern
Sudan, populated mainly by Christians and animists, and the
predominantly Moslem north that controls the federal government in
Khartoum.
   The SPLA began fighting in 1983, demanding more economic
development and greater automony for the southern provinces.

   Students shouted ``Down with communism!''
when a provincial court refused Tuesday to register their
pro-Solidarity association, and they declared a sit-in strike at
Warsaw University.
   Some students threatened to boycott Poland's first democratic
elections since World War II. They accused the court of trying to
divide the opposition before the June 4 parliamentary elections.
   Communist authorities also banned a scheduled
Solidarity-produced election show from state TV Tuesday night,
saying it violated ``limits which may not be crossed.'' The TV
announcement was made at 10:35 p.m., the time the program was to go
on the air on Poland's second channel. A television announcer
instead read an official communique explaining why the Solidarity
show was blocked.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said earlier the
student association ruling was ``legally unjustified, politically
damaging'' and violated the agreement on reforms reached last month
between the government and the opposition.
   ``Students, we were and still are in solidarity with you,'' said
a statement from the independent union movement's Warsaw regional
chapter. It backed student strikes and asked Solidarity factory
committees ``to extend immediate help.''
   Judge Danuta Widawska of Warsaw Provincial Court told about 300
students and a handful of older Solidarity activists packing the
courtroom that the registration request was rejected.
   Students shouted ``No!'' and angrily chanted and stamped their
feet when she offered to explain it, and she hurriedly left the
courtroom.
   Sympathizers and students later marched through the city and
scuffled with police. Students said 15 demonstrators were arrested.
   Leaders of the student association at the 16,000-student Warsaw
University said they are taking over the campus and boycotting
classes to demand legalization. They hoisted a huge banner
announcing the action at the main campus gate.
   Edward Sadkowski, the Provincial Court chairman, said in a
telephone interview that the decision stemmed from the group's
claim of the right to strike.
   Student association lawyer Piotr Andrzejewski had argued that
student strikes have a long tradition in Poland and are not
expressly forbidden, so they should be considered legal.
   Student leader Piotr Czerwiec said the association would appeal
to the Supreme Court this week, but it was unlikely the decision
could be reversed before the elections.
   Andrzejewski told the court it was required to register the
association because of promises made by communist authorities at
``round-table'' talks on reform with the Solidarity-led opposition
that ended April 5.
   ``This, today, was a clear attack on the whole round table and
its decisions,'' he said. ``I see a threat directed above all
against the election campaign of Solidarity.
   ``Part of the students will turn back from the elections,'' he
said of students who have been helping Solidarity candidates
campaign. ``With the great mass of undecideds, and with the
communists tearing down our posters, there will not be anybody to
put them back up. ... It may all end very badly.''
   Solidarity is waging a spirited campaign for candidates to a new
100-member Senate and for 161 seats in the existing 460-member
parliament. The rest are reserved for the ruling Communist Party
and its allies.
   Registration of the students' assocation, like the legalization
of the independent workers union Solidarity and the farmers union
Rural Solidarity, was a condition for the opposition agreeing to
participate in the elections.
   All three organizations were banned after martial law was
imposed in Poland in December 1981. The other two were legalized
soon after the talks ended last month.
   Some student leaders blamed older Solidarity leaders for not
fighting more for their association.
   ``Solidarity ... did not press hard enough,'' said Andrzej
Jesionowski of the student association's National Commission.
   Solidarity was promised access to state TV and radio in the
round-table talks, and Tuesday's canceled broadcast was to have
been the third such Solidarity-produced TV show. The first
45-minute program was May 9.
   A management communique, put out by the state's PAP news agency,
said the program will be referred to an arbitration committee
composed of authorities and Solidarity activists ``for viewing and
mutual assessment.''
   It said the program's contents ``aim against the round-table
agreements,'' but gave no particulars.

<HEAD>Both Sides Exchange Accusations, Fly To Sacramento</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for striking teachers and the
school district flew separately to Sacramento on Tuesday for
meetings with state legislators as both sides blamed the other for
failing to end the walkout.
   ``It just has to come to an end soon ... I'm angry, I'm hurt,
and I'm disappointed,'' Carole Keen, president of the 10th District
PTA, said as the strike entered its 10th day in the nation's second
largest school district.
   The strike has cut deeply into attendance by the more than half
million students of the Los Angeles Unified School District, while
the majority of the United Teachers-Los Angeles members remained
out of school.
   The district canceled its 4-A division baseball championship
playoffs because of the walkout, affecting 16 senior high school
boys' teams. The head coaches of all the teams refused to break
their strike, the district said.
   There were contradictory statements from both sides on what was
last placed on the bargaining table for consideration Sunday night,
when talks collapsed.
   Teachers want a 22 percent pay raise over two years and have
indicated they would take a 26 percent pay hike over three years.
They earn between $23,440 and $43,319 a year, depending on
experience and level of education.
   Education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union
representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers went on
strike May 15. Most classes wind up June 23, but some schools
operate year-round.
   It is the district's first strike since a 23-day walkout in 1970.
   UTLA president Wayne Johnson and Superintendent Leonard Britton
met separately behind closed doors with the Los Angeles delegation
of the state legislature to discuss ways of securing the school
district's projected $48.5 million share of an anticipated two-year
state tax surplus of $2.5 billion.
   Johnson said board members were misinformed about the contract
offer teachers rejected, and blamed chief district negotiator Dick
Fisher for the confusion. He said at least four of the seven board
members should attend future negotiating sessions.
   On Monday, board member Jackie Goldberg, who has generally
supported the union, contradicted a statement by Johnson that the
board had not offered teachers anything new before the break-off in
talks. ``I think people have the right to know what really
happened,'' she said.
   She said the board offered a 24 percent raise over three years
with no conditions.
   Johnson called Fisher ``a major impediment toward a settlement.''
   ``This guy wants to keep a strike going and is doing it by
confusing the board and by confusing the issues,'' he added.
``You've got the whole process in absolute turmoil.''
   Johnson insisted, ``There was no money proposal even proposed
Sunday night ... I'll take a polygraph on it.''
   But Fisher said Tuesday the 24 percent offer, 8 percent each
year, was made as an ``informal, exploratory package'' through a
state mediator. The second-year raise was contingent on the
district receiving the state tax surplus funds. Otherwise, the
raise for the second year would be dropped to 5{ percent.
   ``That offer was immediately and angrily rejected by the UTLA
negotiators, and therefore no longer remains on the table,'' Fisher
said in a statement.
   School district spokeswoman Eva Hain said the idea of having at
least a majority of school board members present at negotiations
has been suggested before by Johnson. She said adding school board
members might slow the negotiations.
   Currently, each side has three negotiators. The school board is
represented by President Roberta Weintraub.

   The United States is not satisfied with a new
West German proposal for resolving a NATO dispute over short-range
missiles and ``there is still a gap to bridge,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Tuesday.
   Baker said he hoped the disagreement could be settled before
Monday's opening of a 16-member NATO summit in Brussels but said
there's no assurance that will happen.
   He said the ``stumbling block'' was how to draft a compromise
plan that would take into account the new mood in Western Europe
for greater disarmament while preserving an ``adequate deterrence.''
   ``The alliance has survived many greater threats to its
existence than this and we remain ... quite hopeful that we'll get
his resolved and that we'll get it resolved before the summit,''
Baker said. ``We may not get it resolved before the summit.''
   At a news conference at the White House, Baker also announced
June 19 as the date for resuming U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce
long-range nuclear weapons.
   The talks were suspended last November with about 90 percent of
the work completed on a treaty to curb strategic missiles, bombers
and nuclear submarines.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
said he was pleased with the return to negotiations but expressed
concerns about unresolved problems. He mentioned the debate over
Star Wars and the absence of a consensus in Congress and even the
Bush administration over modernization of land-based nuclear
missiles.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said Bush still is ``on trial'' with
conservatives and it will be difficult for him to make a deal on
START.
   The dispute in NATO was triggered by West German demands for
East-West negotiations to begin soon to reduce nuclear missiles
with a range of less than 300 miles.
   The United States and Britain opposed such talks on grounds the
West needs nuclear weapons in Europe to offset a big advantage in
ground forces, tanks and other conventional forces by the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact nations.
   Last week, the United States agreed to accept the principle of
eventual negotiations but only under stringent conditions.
   Baker said it would have to be made clear that ``if there were
ever to be negotiations in this area, we would not be talking about
in any event about a third zero'' _ arms control jargon for
complete elimination of the missiles.
   He said that nuclear deterrence has been the cornerstone of
NATO's ``flexible response'' strategy under which military threats
to the West would be countered by a range of options, from tanks
and combat troops to nuclear weapons.
   ``The flexible response strategy has kept the peace for 40
years,'' Baker said. ``We should be very, very reluctant to take
any steps that would be seen to be moving away from that.''
   For days, Bonn and Washington have been trading proposals and
counterproposals to produce a compromise. The latest offer from
Bonn was received Monday night.
   Baker said it did not go far enough.
   ``It is not resolved. There is still a gap to bridge. And we'll
continue to work to try to bridge that gap,'' he said.
   Trying to play down the discord, Baker said, ``I just don't
think that it will totally dominate the summit.'' On the other
hand, he said, ``It will be a very, very important issue.''
   A major dispute centers on the timing of any talks on
short-range weapons. While Bonn wants talks to begin soon, the
United States is insisting on a formula that would put off
negotiations for years, according to an administration official who
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   The official said the United States wants the negotiations to be
delayed pending an East-West agreement to reduce the levels of
conventional forces, where the West says the East has a large
advantage.
   Explaining why it would be years before talks could begin on
short-range nuclear missiles, the official said, ``It takes that
long to negotiate an agreement (on conventional forces) and
actually pull out troops and tanks.''

   Controversial claims of room-temperature
fusion were discounted or found only qualified support Tuesday
among scientists presenting the results of their own experiments at
an international workshop Tuesday.
   Physicists and chemists from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory rejected confirmation
of room-temperature nuclear fusion reported by the University of
Utah exactly two months ago.
   Utah electrochemist Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin
Fleischmann startled the scientific world with the announcement
they had achieved cold fusion in a simple experiment involving
electrodes of the metal palladium and water made with deuterium, a
heavy isotope of hydrogen.
   The conventional belief was that fusion as an energy source
would only be attained at high temperatures and by applying high
power.
   MIT chemist Richard Crooks told the estimated 500 participants
that, after conducting experiments similar to the Fleischmann-Pons
work, none of the telltale signs of fusion _ including excess heat,
the tritium isotope of hydrogen and neutron radiation _ were found.
   ``The evidence of fusion products is much too small to account
for fusion,'' said Crooks.
   Later, he told reporters that there is ``no evidence nuclear
processes are going on.''
   ``There's always room for something new and unanticipated. You
always keep your eye out for that,'' said Crooks.
   He also took a swipe at Pons' and Fleischmann's research
methods, saying they have had to back down on some of their
assertions.
   ``We're getting back into the realm of really good science and
out of the realm of quick and dirty experiments,'' he said.
   MIT plasma fusion researcher Stanley Luckhardt said he does not
believe anyone at the conference will turn up the definitive proof
of cold fusion.
   ``I think we would have heard it in the halls,'' he said.
   Luckhardt said the problem is that researchers have measured
heat in some experiments and a small amount of fusion byproducts in
others, but no one has managed to find both heat and particles.
   The closest thing to confirmation of the Pons-Fleischmann
findings came from Texas A&amp;M University chemist John Appleby, who
reported finding sizeable amounts of tritium in Texas A&amp;M
experiments.
   Appleby said at a news conference that ``tritium can be coming
only from fusion. That is the bottom line.''
   During a presentation opening the three-day workshop, Appleby
said his research turned up evidence of what he called ``anomalous
heat.''
   He described a series of experiments using different forms of
the metal palladium and different solutions, some including lithium
and sodium, which yielded varying results.
   In a solution of lithium and deuterium, he said, ``an anomalous
effect takes place.''
   A&amp;M scientist Kevin Wolf told the assembly that separate tests
turned up evidence that a small number of neutrons and larger
amounts of tritium had been released in Texas experiments similar
to those conducted by Pons and Fleischmann.
   Wolf said the number of neutrons produced was up to seven times
the number expected in nature.
   Appleby said that since little is known about the fusion
occurring within the structure of a metal, there may be reactions
taking place that are unknown.
   Appleby said he was disappointed but not surprised that the A&amp;M
experiments did not find the presence of helium 3, a product of the
fusion of two heavy hydrogen atoms.
   He said it would be given off at a very low level, not enough to
be detected.
   Appleby also said that if the amount of deuterium that has to
infiltrate the palladium electrodes is crucial, then scientists
using small palladium wires _ such as used by A&amp;M _ should expect
to see results more quickly than researchers using large bars or
rods of palladium.

   Bad weather forced the Air Force to
postpone the launch of an advanced navigational satellite for the
third time Tuesday.
   Winds above the launch pad were too strong and there was a
forecast that thunderstorms would move into the area, said an Air
Force statement.
   The effort was called off nearly two hours before the planned
7:43 p.m. EDT launch. Another attempt was set for Wednesday at 7:39
p.m.
   The launch of the Delta 2 rocket was scrubbed Saturday by
high-altitude winds and on Sunday by a thunderstorm.
   The rocket carries a $65 million Navstar satellite that will
enable U.S. and allied military units such as planes, ships,
submarines and tanks to determine their location within 50 feet
anywhere around the globe.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Oppose Spending on B-1B While B-2 Funding is Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers complained Tuesday about an Air
Force request to spend about $1.5 billion to fix the B-1B bomber's
defensive system while funds for the B-2 stealth bomber are being
cut.
   Lt. Gen. Ronald W. Yates, the Air Force's principal deputy
assistant secretary for acquisition, told a House panel that the
current fleet of 97 B-1B bombers has problems with its electronic
countermeasure system, or ECM, which includes its jamming
capability and its ability to identify and avoid threats.
   The service is asking for $1.454 billion to repair the
electronic system. That would push the Air Force past the $20.5
billion cap placed on spending for the program in 1981.
   The problems stem from the original contract the Air Force
signed with Eaton AIL, a Massachusetts company, for the B-1B
bomber. The service agreed on a development and production pact on
the same day, and since then has faced cost overruns and problems
with the electronic system.
   ``What you're telling us is the ECM is less good by 10 percent
than the original promise nine years later. That is the sum,'' said
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the House Armed Services Committee chairman
who also heads the subcommittee on procurement.
   ``Yes, that is the sum,'' responded Yates.
   The Air Force official said the service could not defend what
had happened nine years ago, but needs the additional money to
improve the bombers' ability to identify threats.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., taking Yates through basic questions
about the B-1B, asked how many B-1Bs existed and whether they were
``flyable, more or less.''
   ``More or less,'' responded Yates.
   The Air Force official than explained that the bombers have
deficiencies in the ``ability to detect and avoid threats, and
jamming capability is limited.''
   ``You misjudged the problems in the original specs,'' Skelton
said.
   ``We didn't misjudge. ... What we did was fail technically in
the ECM,'' Yates said.
   Aspin expressed concerns about spending money on the B-1B while
funds for the B-2 stealth bomber will be cut $884.6 million in the
fiscal 1990 budget.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, faced with a budget agreement
between the White House and Congress, was forced to slash $10
billion from the defense budget. The B-2 program was among the
programs that were scaled back.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said he was unsure how the problem would
be resolved, but added, ``I think we got programs in competition
here. If we fully fund the B-1, it may come back to haunt the B-2.''

   King Hassan II on Tuesday welcomed
Egypt back to the Arab League after 10 years of ostracism as he
opened a summit conference focusing on sharp divisions over Lebanon
and the Palestinians.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak urged greater solidarity among
the league's 22 member nations and said the Arab world hopes this
conference will mark a ``new dawn.''
   Hassan said he was happy to see the Egyptian leader ``here among
us, representing his people, the people of Arab Egypt who have
fought and struggled for a half-century ... in support of Arab
rights.''
   Twenty-one Arab leaders are attending the two-day summit,
including Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya, who had threatened to
boycott the meeting in protest over Egypt's readmission.
   Only Lebanon, ruled by rival Christian and Moslem governments,
was not represented for the first time since the Arab League was
formed in 1945.
   Hassan greeted his guests at the entrance to the palace as they
began arriving separately at 6 p.m. in bulletproof limousines. The
king did not embrace Gadhafi, as he had the other leaders.
   The leaders held a two-hour informal session and convened again
behind closed doors after speeches by Hassan and Mubarak.
Conference sources said the main topic was Lebanon.
   Mubarak, reading from a prepared text, called the gathering ``an
historical conference, convening in an atmosphere of brotherhood.''
He warned against ``wasting time and opportunities.''
   Inter-Arab difference, Mubarak said, are ``inevitable,'' but
``disagreement should not lead to quarrel.''
   He called for a wider Arab role in international efforts for
global peace and for closer cooperation with the 12-nation European
Economic Community.
   Mubarak said the crisis in Lebanon ``has truly become an immense
problem, exhausting us and exhausting our consciences.''
   ``We must all work for the one aim of overcoming this crisis
before the fire burns us all,'' he said.
   He said Arabs should start by backing a six-man Arab panel that
has been trying to defuse the crisis so it could ``arrange national
reconciliation, ensure the withdrawal of all foreign forces and
revive the constitutional bodies so they can carry out their
duties.''
   Lebanon's seat remained vacant after a preparatory meeting of
foreign ministers failed to agree on which leader should represent
the country, torn by 14 years of civil war.
   On the Palestinian question, Mubarak openly supported
anti-Israeli rioting that has raged in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip since December 1987.
   Egypt's membership in the Arab League was suspended after the
late President Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, making Egypt the only Arab nation to have made
peace with Israel.
   ``We support the Palestinian people in its resistance of
occupation and Israeli hegemony,'' he said.
   He said Egypt would back ``whatever road the Palestinians find
suitable to realize their aspirations.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and Syria had presented
rival documents to the preparatory meeting of ministers.
   The first dealt mainly with PLO chief Yasser Arafat's peace
moves and a demand that Arabs meet their pledge of more than $600
million to finance the 17-month-old uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Syria's paper spoke of combining Arab resources to achieve
``strategic parity'' with Israel, indicating it still opposes a
negotiated settlement.
   An Egyptian compromise was adopted but its contents have not
been revealed.
   Some delegates said they feared the summit would break down over
Lebanon.
   Iraq and Egypt have said they would seek a resolution demanding
withdrawal of all foreign forces from the country.
   That would includes 40,000 Syrian soldiers deployed under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the league and Israeli troopers who
occupy a ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   After four years of relative quiet, the Lebanese civil war
revived March 8 when artillery duels began between Christian army
units commanded by Aoun and an alliance of Syrian forces and Druse
militiamen. Hundreds of people have been killed and nearly 1,400
wounded, nearly all of them civilians.
   Seating one or both of Lebanon's rival leaders at the summit,
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and Moslem Premier Salim Hoss, would
have perpetuated the division and might have caused a walkout by
Syria or Iraq, which are enemies of long standing. Syrian supports
Hoss and Iraq is Aoun's only outpoken supporter in the Arab world.

   Police chasing a 9-year-old boy who started
his mother's car with a screwdriver Tuesday had to back off when
their sirens caused the child to speed up to 60 mph and faster.
   The five-mile chase from the boy's home in Baldwin to this south
central Louisiana town ended when a motorist saw what was happening
and used his car to stop the boy from entering a four-lane highway.
   The tiny driver, whose name was not released, tried to avoid the
blockade by shifting the the four-speed car into reverse. Instead
he backed into a pursuing police car.
   The boy was sent to a state juvenile center in Baton Rouge, said
Baldwin Police Chief Al Gros. He was charged with three counts of
unauthorized use of an automobile and other traffic offenses.
   The chase began when someone reported a car being driven in a
reckless manner, said Detective Sabria Hill.
   ``I knew it was a child in the car. You could just see the top
of his little head above the dashboard,'' she said.
   Hill said police couldn't get too close during the chase.
   ``Every time we put on the siren, he'd speed up, and if we got
to close, he'd speed up. He got up over 60 miles an hour several
times so we just backed off,'' she said.
   The boy started the car with a screwdriver, the detective said.
   Baldwin police said it was the third time the boy had taken the
car and that he had admitted to five burglaries in the past year.
   ``He knew how to shift that's for sure. He drove pretty well
too,'' Hill said. ``He seemed like a smart little fellow. I just
hope he doesn't move to Franklin.''

   The giant Gillete Co. was in a lather Tuesday,
charging in federal court that tiny competitor Wilkinson Sword Inc.
has falsely advertised its new razor blades.
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Gillette said
Wilkinson's new Ultra Glide razor doesn't really provide the
``smoothest, most comfortable shave known to man,'' as Wilkinson
claims.
   Gillette, which sued to stop Wilkinson's advertising campaign
and is seeking undetermined monetary damages, said consumer tests
showed men preferred its Atra Plus razors to others on the market.
   Norman R. Proulx, president of Atlanta-based Wilkinson,
dismissed Gillette's claims. He said that in blind consumer tests,
men perferred his company's product.
   ``We have ample proof for the claims we have made ... otherwise
we wouldn't have made them,'' he said.
   With annual sales of more than $1 billion and about 60 percent
of the market, Boston-based Gillette is the leader in the wet razor
market. Wilkinson claims about a 4 percent share.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms drenched parts of Virginia and southern New
Jersey on Tuesday, and showers in the Northwest changed to snow in
the mountains.
   A cold front pushing eastward across the Appalachian region
brought rain and widespread thunderstorms from the Ohio Valley to
the mid-Atlantic Coast states and the Gulf Coast.
   Atlantic City, N.J., had a third of an inch of rain in an hour.
Severe thunderstorms swept Virginia and southeastern North
Carolina, and a tornado was reported about 30 miles north of
Wilmington, N.C.
   Thunderstorms caused showers and some brief, heavy rain and
small hail from central Mississippi to central and southern Alabama
and the Florida Panhandle. Nearly an inch and a half of rain fell
in one hour in Montgomery, Ala.
   Thunderstorms dropped three-quarter inch hail on Bayfield, Wis.
   A cold front moved across Nevada, western Utah and the high
country northwest of the central Rockies, producing showers and a
few thunderstorms along the northern and central Pacific Coast and
snow in the Cascades in Oregon and Washington.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
over 2} inches at Maxwell Air Force Base near Montgomery and 1}
inches at Mansfield, Ohio.
   Record high temperatures for the date included 89 degrees in
Colorado Springs, Colo.; 94 in Pueblo, Colo., and a record-tying 95
in San Antonio.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., to 102 degrees in
Midland-Odessa, Texas. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 26
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The Wednesday forecast was for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley
to the lower Missouri Valley, rain showers across the Pacific
Northwest and showers and thundershowers scattered from New England
into the mid-Atlantic Coast region.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the 60s and 70s from the California coast to
Nevada, western Utah and the northern high Plains; in the 70s
across the northern Plains and northern Great Lakes into the upper
Ohio Valley, mid-Atlantic region and New England; 50s across the
Pacific Northwest; and 100 to 105 degrees from the southern Rockies
into the upper and middle Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

   A missile
designed to guide itself in and destroy enemy radar posts underwent
its second successful test, the Air Force announced Tuesday.
   The AGM-136A missile, code named Tacit Rainbow, flew May 17 at
this high desert test base, but the test wasn't previously
revealed. It was the second of 25 planned tests, the Air Force said.
   The missile was launched from a B-52 bomber and homed in on its
target, even though the radar it tracks was shut off once during
the flight, the Air Force said.
   The joint Navy-Air Force project is administered by the
Aeronautical Systems Division of the Air Force Systems Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. The missile is
built by Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles, which also makes the B-2
stealth bomber and other military hardware.
   The AGM-136A is similar to present anti-radar missiles, which
follow enemy radar waves to their source and destroy the
installation. However, the new missile is designed to ``loiter,''
or go into a holding pattern if the radar is turned off, thus
countering a defense that can be used against such missiles.

   A volunteer troglodyte who lost track of
time while living 130 days alone in a sealed cave without hearing
another human's voice returned to daylight Tuesday and exclaimed:
``Wow, man!''
   Stefania Follini had to put sunglasses over her regular glasses
when she poked her head out of the cave entrance under the bright
midday sun. The temperature was 97 degrees, a big difference from
the cave's constant 74 degrees.
   The temperature was in the mid-30s and it was before dawn when
the Italian volunteer for a scientific experiment entered Lost Cave
in the hills on the west side of Carlsbad on Jan. 13.
   Miss Follini apparently learned some English during her
isolation and told a crowd of welcomers: ``I feel great.'' She had
taken English primers into the cave with her to study the language.
   She nodded when asked if she would do it again and said ``Sure.''
   ``It was very beautiful to live down there,'' she said through
an interpreter at a news conference a few minutes later. ``But it
also feels nice to be up here and I feel all right.''
   She said the first thing she noticed was the smell of the desert
and the noise made by the 60 reporters and well-wishers.
   She said she will remember the silence in the cave and its
smell. ``It's an old smell, in a romantic way,'' she said.
   Miss Follini appeared calm and happy, and said she had not
dwelled on things she missed.
   Asked the first thing she wanted to do, she replied: ``I think
I'll have a long walk. I'll think about all the things I'd like to
do later.''
   The 27-year-old interior decorator from Ancona, Italy, was the
subject of an experiment designed to simulate the solitude of
interplanetary spaceflight and other forms of isolation.
   ``I hope with this research to find a way to prepare people
going in space or submarines,'' said Maurizio Montalbini, the
experiment coordinator for the Italian research team.
   In the absence of day and night or timepieces of any kind, Miss
Follini began staying awake 20 to 25 hours at a time and sleeping
about 10. Her menstrual cycle stopped. When she was notified Monday
the 130-day experiment was almost over, she reacted with disbelief
because she thought about 80 days had passed.
   Her only contact with the world above ground was a computer
linked to another computer in the researchers' house trailer 30
feet above her.
   She couldn't see or hear anyone, though researchers could
monitor her by means of three video cameras and microphones inside
the cave while she set a record for isolation for a woman.
   She spent the time reading, decorating her 10-foot-square
Plexiglas room inside the sealed cave with cardboard cutouts,
practicing calisthenics and judo moves, playing solitaire and
``chatting'' with researchers by typing messages on the computer.
   In the coming days, Miss Follini will be studied like a
laboratory rat. Scientists want to take blood samples, measure her
flexibility, muscle tone and physical condition, and measure her
ability to reason and concentrate.
   They believe her muscle tone and the level of calcium in her
bones decreased, that her immune system became depressed and that
her ability to concentrate improved.
   Miss Follini will spend Memorial Day in Houston with University
of Texas Medical School scientists who are sharing their
information with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   They will monitor her brain activity while she does computerized
problem-solving exercises.
   ``We're going to see if there are any attention problems
resulting from her isolation and determine which (neural) pathways
are working most efficiently,'' said Dr. Jon DeFrance, an assistant
professor at the medical school.
   Montalbini said Monday he thought Miss Folllini might surprise
researchers when they discover what kind of shape she is in. He
said she kept her strength and flexibility by exercising, and
maintained her mental poise by keeping busy.
   ``She is doing very well,'' Montalbini said. ``She is
psychologically well settled.''
   Montalbini spent 210 days in cave isolation two years ago.
   The researchers chose Lost Cave in southeastern New Mexico
because it maintains a constant climate of 74 degrees and 99
percent humidity and is relatively close to NASA's Johnson Space
Center and the medical school in Houston.
   The experiment, whose cost was estimated at $200,000 to
$250,000, was funded by the University of Ancona in Italy.

<TEXT>
   Panama's foreign minister said top
officials held a ``positive, amicable'' meeting Tuesday with a
Latin American mission to reconcile the military-controlled
government and the opposition.
   The delegation from the Organization of American States arrived
earlier to mixed reactions and took a conciliatory tone.
   ``We are going to try to facilitate dialogue among Panamanians.
This is a situation that only Panamanians can resolve,'' said
Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, one of four OAS
delegates.
   They are investigating charges that Panama's de facto ruler,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, nullified national elections to
prevent an opposition victory.
   In Washington, defense officials said the United States was
sending armed military convoys on trips across Panama to ``flex our
muscles'' and draw a line against Panamanian harassment.
   Two convoys of 10 or so vehicles carrying armed soldiers have
crossed without incident in either directions under escort by
Panamanian soldiers, as provided in the canal treaties, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Rafael Vargas Santos, ambassador to Haiti, said in
Port-au-Prince the government would destroy the Panama Canal in the
event of a U.S. invasion.
   ``We will not be taken by surprise because we are already
prepared,'' he said on Radio Haiti Inter. ``The first thing we will
do is blow up the canal.''
   Cordovez, OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares and foreign
ministers Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad and Mario Palencia of
Guatemala met with acting president Manuel Solis Palma and several
Cabinet members for two hours but issued no statement.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said he could not say
what was discussed but said the meeting was ``positive, amicable.
... I think it was a very cordial, wide-ranging and positive
climate.''
   The group will meet with other ``political figures'' over the
next 10 days, Baena Soares said. No plans for a meeting with
Noriega were mentioned.
   Opposition leaders, who want their May 7 presidential election
victory recognized, had welcomed the delegation and said the
Pan-American organization ``has understood the urgent need to act.''
   But the government proclaimed earlier it would not accept any
interference in Panama's internal affairs. Government-controlled
media accused the organization of prejudging the case.
   ``They'll come, they won't see _ and they'll leave,'' said a
headline in Matutino newspaper.
   The OAS last week denounced Noriega and called for a swift
transfer of power.
   Solis Palma's government issued a proclamation Monday night
saying parts of the organization's resolution violate its charter,
including the ``ill-willed'' mention of Noriega.
   The government proclamation, however, welcomed the mission and
said it hoped it would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a
conflict between Panama and the United States.'' It cited U.S.
sanctions against Panama as proof of malice.
   Tuesday newspapers accused the organization of being led by the
United States, but Cordovez described its resolution as ``a Latin
American effort based on principles that we all respect _ the
principle of non-intervention.''
   In his arrival statement, Cordovez said Latin Americans are
concerned about Panama and the mission is a ``gesture of good will,
a gesture of friendship and solidarity that should not be
misinterpreted.''
   The opposition has called for a demonstration at noon Wednesday
in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations that lasts until
June 5, when the Organization of American States mission is to file
its report.
   Noriega, who commands Panama's Defense Forces, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges in the United States in February 1988. He
denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S. plot to renege
on its commitment to hand over the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.

   A combination of chemotherapy and radiation
shows promise of helping doctors avoid mutilating surgery and
preserve the voices of victims of advanced neck cancer, researchers
said Tuesday.
   Until now, the standard therapy for people with advanced cancer
of the larynx has been to remove the voicebox. While this approach
frequently cures the disease, it destroys patients' ability to talk.
   About 11,000 new cases of cancer of the larynx are diagnosed
annually, and 4,000 to 5,000 of these people have advanced disease
that requires surgical removal of the larynx followed by radiation
therapy.
   In the new approach, doctors shrink the tumors first with
chemotherapy drugs. Then they destroy the remaining cancer with
radiation.
   ``They can talk normally, by and large,'' said Dr. Gregory Wolf
of the University of Michigan.
   Wolf described the experimental therapy, conducted with Dr. Waun
Hong of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   ``It's extremely unsatisfactory for most patients to lose their
voicebox,'' commented Dr. Richard Hoppe of Stanford University.
``It has been necessary in the past, because that's the only
possible way they could be cured. This will have a major impact,
because people have preservation of the voicebox.''
   In treatment so far, 332 patients have been randomly assigned to
have surgery or chemotherapy. About 65 percent of patients in both
groups are still free of cancer after two years of followup.
   The researchers said that when this form of cancer relapses, it
usually comes back within the first two years.
   In some cases, the chemotherapy could not reduce the cancer
enough for radiation to clear up what was left, and these people
required surgery. However, 68 percent of those treated with the new
approach have preserved their voiceboxes.
   ``The results are quite encouraging,'' said Wolf. ``We hope this
can be applied to other parts of the head where mutilating surgery
is performed.''
   In all, 30,000 to 40,000 new cases of cancer of the head and
neck are diagnosed in the United States each year, according to Dr.
Hardinder Garewal of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Tucson, Ariz.
   One common variety is cancer of the mouth, which, like the
others, often results from smoking and alcohol abuse.
   Recent studies have found that vitamin A can reverse
pre-cancerous white patches in the mouth known as oral leukoplakia.
However, this vitamin is too toxic to the liver to be used in high
enough doses to be a practical treatment.
   In other research presented at the meeting, Garewal reported
that a natural nutrient called beta carotene can clear up
leukoplakia. This substance, found in many vegetables, is converted
into vitamin A in the body.
   Garewal treated 25 people for three to six months. The white
spots went away in three-quarters of them, and they suffered no
serious side effects.
   They took daily 30 milligram capsules of beta carotene, which he
said is the equivalent of six carrots. He said that if the findings
hold up to further study, it may be possible to find ways of
treating the condition by changing people's diets.

   Lawyers for House Speaker Jim Wright and the
ethics committee clashed Tuesday over whether the panel had
stretched the rules when it charged the nation's highest elected
Democrat with 69 ethics violations.
   And Wright, who watched the proceedings on television, appeared
less than confident that he could survive as speaker regardless of
the outcome of Tuesday's hearing. ``That remains to be seen,'' he
said. ``If I can't be not just a respectable speaker, but an
effective speaker, then I wouldn't want to be speaker.''
   Wright's Houston lawyer, Stephen Susman, pleaded with the
committee to ``stand in the way of a lynch mob'' seeking to oust
Wright and asked that the panel reject what he termed the speaker's
persecution by the panel's special outside counsel, Richard J.
Phelan.
   ``To say Jim Wright should be condemned because he went close to
the line ... is not fair,'' Susman said in arguing that the panel
should dismiss the most serious charges against his client.
   But Phelan, a Chicago attorney, declared that Wright is resting
his case on ``legalisms,'' and he said ethics rules should be
interpreted broadly, not treated like tax laws where searching for
loopholes is an accepted practice.
   ``We are dealing with the confidence of the American public,''
Phelan said. ``Are we to look at the rules through the prism of the
most nearsighted, myopic person that we can?''
   The unusual trial-like proceeding was held in a House hearing
room before TV cameras, with Wright's counsel and the ethics
committee's team, led by Phelan, on opposite sides. Although Wright
watched on television, his wife, Betty, sat in the front row.
   A decision on the motion was expected as early as Wednesday.
   Leaving the Capitol after the day-long hearing, Wright said he
hoped the ruling would go his way, but added that if not he would
take his case before the nation at a disciplinary hearing.
   ``I'm not going to let people down. I'm not going to leave any
implication that I've done anything bad,'' he said. ``I certainly
abided by the rules as I understand them.''
   
   Asked whether he believed he could survive as speaker, he said,
   
   It was just the first open skirmish in the nearly year-long
ethics probe of Wright which has thrown his political survival into
doubt. The speaker is still likely to face a disciplinary hearing
before the ethics panel to determine whether charges against him
have been clearly and convincingly proven, and possible punishment
by the full House.
   Another member of Wright's legal team, William C. Oldaker, had
conceded in advance of Tuesday's hearing that motions to dismiss
charges are routinely denied, and that chances that the committee
would rule in Wright's favor when it meets Wednesday were less than
even. Wright's motion essentially asks the panel to reverse an
interpretation of the rules it made last month.
   But Susman, pleading for the panel to reconsider, read a passage
from Wright's book, which is the basis for some of the charges, and
asked each member of the committee to ``doubt a little of his own
infallibility.''
   Another member of Wright's eight-lawyer defense team, Rep.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said Wright ``needs a victory. That's
clear.''
   Whatever the legal outcome, some in the House were already
writing Wright's political obituary, saying he had been so tainted
by the charges that he could no longer serve effectively as the
Democrats' most visible national spokesman. A group of moderate
Wright supporters met last week and discussed ways for the speaker
to ease gracefully out of his leadership post.
   One fellow Democrat, Rep. Jim Slattery of Kansas, said in a
statement Tuesday, ``If the speaker is not exonerated by the ethics
panel and if the ethics committee concludes that Speaker Wright has
violated House rules, then I think he should resign.''
   Slattery, who is considering a race for the Kansas governor's
office, has come under attack from Republicans portraying him as a
close ally of Wright.
   Susman tried to minimize the charges against Wright, which
include accepting $145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth businessman
with a direct interest in legislation and evading House income
limits through bulk sales of Wright's book.
   ``To any fair person, that hardly sounds like much of a
scheme,'' he said at one point in a reference to sales of the book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   And Susman suggested that Wright is being pilloried in political
retribution for Democratic rejection of the nomination of John
Tower as secretary of defense, or for his handling of the
controversial congressional pay raise issue earlier this year.
   ``Why worry about due process for a dead man?'' the lawyer asked
rhetorically. ``Why should this committee stand in the way of a
lynch mob or a conviction based upon guilt by association?''
   Because, he said in answer to his own question to the six
Democrats and six Republicans on the panel, ``if a member of
Congress, indeed the most powerful member of Congress, cannot get a
fair trial, no American can.''
   Wright's case for dismissal rested on a contention that the
ethics committee, formally called the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, is holding him to a new and higher standard not
envisioned by the authors of the rules.
   Susman accused Phelan, who has led the panel's investigation of
Wright since last July, of picking out the speaker as a target,
``then searching the law books ... to pin some offense on him.''
   On Wright's book deals, in which he sold bulk quantities of the
slim volume to groups to which he had made speeches, Phelan argued
that the facts were clear. ``Look at what happened. Did he make a
speech or did he sell a book?'' he said.
   And on Wright's relationship with Fort Worth developer George
Mallick, who gave Betty Wright a salary and use of a car and
condominium valued at $145,000 over 10 years, Phelan suggested
Mallick wanted something in return from the powerful congressman
who was his friend.
   ``Does that stand the test of credibility?'' he asked. ``What is
the average American supposed to think?''

<TEXT>
   The mother of a teen-ager who claims she
had sex with U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens testified Tuesday that the
congressman offered her a government job after she told him her
daughter was 16.
   ``I didn't think he would stoop that low, but he did,'' Anna
Coffman said. ``I took it as a bribe.''
   Attorneys for Lukens disputed the charges in opening arguments
before the prosecution began its case against the 58-year-old
conservative Republican in county Domestic Relations Court.
   Lukens is charged with contributing to the unruliness or
delinquency of Rosie Coffman, now 17. She says she and
then-19-year-old Michelle Foster went to Lukens' Columbus apartment
in November to have sex with him, and the prosecution says money
was exchanged.
   Lukens contends the charges are part of an attempt by Mrs.
Coffman to extort money from him. If convicted of the misdemeanor,
Lukens faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a $1,000
fine.
   Mrs. Coffman testified that the relationship between Lukens and
her daughter began in 1985, when Rosie Coffman was 13.
   She said she called Lukens that year to discuss ``him
contributing to her delinquency by getting her intoxicated'' and
told him the girl was 13.
   Three years later, she said she again confronted him during a
meeting secretly videotaped by a television station at Mrs.
Coffman's initiative.
   ``I told him how old she was,'' Mrs. Coffman said, adding she
showed him pictures of the girl. ``It didn't bother him a bit
because apparently he's been doing that all along.''
   She said Lukens told her he thought her daughter was 18. The
younger Coffman turned 17 on Nov. 7, the day after the alleged
encounter.
   Mrs. Coffman said that after she learned of the relationship by
overhearing a conversation between her daughter and Ms. Foster, her
first reaction was ``to contact someone to let them know about it.
I knew if I would call the police, I would get the runaround.''
   She said she contacted Franklin County Children Services, then
called WSYX-TV, which arranged the videotaping. The 50-minute tape,
in which Lukens is barely audible, was shown to the jury Tuesday.
   Mrs. Coffman said she contacted the television station because
she was afraid of Lukens and ``I wanted to get him exposed for what
he did.''
   Defense attorney Thomas Tyack attacked a part of Mrs. Coffman's
testimony in which she said she called Lukens' Hamilton office
using a number on a business card he gave her daughter in 1985 that
identified him as a congressman.
   ``Can I ask you how you did that when Mr. Lukens didn't become a
member of Congress until 1987?'' he said.
   ``I didn't know what he was,'' Mrs. Coffman said. Lukens was in
Congress for two terms in the 1960s, then ran unsuccessfully for
governor and served in the state Legislature.
   Mrs. Coffman also admitted under Tyack's questioning that WSYX
paid for Mrs. Coffman and her daughter to stay at a Columbus hotel
earlier this year and that she was paid $1,500 by local television
show ``Evening Magazine'' for an interview.
   In opening arguments, Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini said
Lukens, when questioned by police, denied having sex with the girl
but later admitted to a private detective that he did have sex with
her.
   Tyack told jurors that Lukens admits the girl visited his
apartment on the night in question but that ``what happened inside
is a matter of dispute.''

   Prisoners rioted after refusing to

   Ivette del Valle, spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico Corrections
Department, said the two-hour riot at the Bayamon Regional Prison
began at 11:30 p.m. Monday in a wing reserved for 148 youths tried
and convicted as adults.
   She said the youths broke apart beds and toilets and used the
pieces to attack guards when told to return to their cells for a
midnight roll call. During the day the youths are allowed to lounge
in the aisles and courtyard.
   Ms. del Valle said said the guards finally forced the youths
back into their cells by 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   She said the 40 casualties suffered minor head and arm injuries,
and some were briefly hospitalized.
   ``Everything is under control and the inmates who received
medical attention are back in the penitentiary,'' Ms. del Valle
said.
   The youths earlier demanded an audience with a Corrections
Administration official to hear their complaints there were not
enough towels and bedsheets. Ms. del Valle said the agency was
considering their demands.
   In all, 1,072 prisoners are incarcerated at Bayamon, 15 miles
south of San Juan.

   He said the train was traveling from the major northern city of
Chiang Mai when 13 of its 15 cars went off the track at Phrae about
80 miles to the southeast.
   The official, who requested anonymity, disputed another
official's claim that the cars plunged into a ravine.
   He said the cause of the accident was not immediately known but
that the locomotive engineer did not appear to be at fault.
   Soldiers are assisting in the rescue operation, he said.

   France exploded a small nuclear
device on Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific on Wednesday in its
second such test this year, New Zealand scientists said.
   At two kilotons, the equivalent in explosive force of 2,000 tons
of TNT, it was one of the smallest underground explosions in recent
years, said Warwick Smith, director of the governmental Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research.
   The explosion was recorded at the New Zealand monitoring station
in Raratonga, Cook Islands, but was not identified immediately
because it was so small, Smith said. He said the explosion took
place at 6 a.m. (2 p.m. EDT Tuesday).
   The nuclear test was in line with the French program for the
last five years which has involved four explosions from April to
June and another four between October and December.
   The last nuclear test, on May 11, registered 15 kilotons. France
has conducted about 105 nuclear tests on Mururoa since taking its
program underground in 1975.
   France as a matter of policy does not comment on reports of
testing. Mururoa, in French Polynesia, is roughly midway between
Australia and Chile.

<HEAD>US, Northern Marianas Islands Representatives to Meet Wednesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Northern Marianas
Islands told Congress on Tuesday that the United States has ignored
the provision of its convenant with their government that calls for
periodic talks.
   Only six meetings have been held since the U.S. and the islands
in the South Pacific established a political union 13 years ago. A
seventh round of talks was scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   ``The lack of progress in six rounds of the talks sends us a
negative message,'' Benjamin Manglona, president of the Northern
Marianas Senate, told the House Interior subcommittee on insular
and international affairs. ``We begin to wonder if the United
States government really believes in the democratic institutions it
has given us.''
   ``The talks have been going on for some two and a half years
without producing much more than travel vouchers,'' said Proilan
Cruz Tenorio, resident representative to the U.S. from the
Marianas. ``It seems that the talks are more cosmetic than anything
else, that they are designed to give only the appearance of
progress and to provide a platform for political posturing.''
   Spain colonized the Northern Marianas Islands, located in the
Pacific Ocean about 1,200 miles east of the Philippines, in 1564
and ruled them for three centuries before selling them to Germany.
Japan occupied the islands in 1914 and held them under a League of
Nations Mandate through World War II.
   The United States' direct relationship with the Northern
Marianas began in the summer of 1944 when the U.S. armed forces
liberated them from Japan.
   The federal government reached a covenant with the islands 13
years ago that established a political union and laid out rules for
how the two governments would relate to each other. The
self-governed islands would still fall under the jurisdiction of
the U.S.
   The agreement included several provisions to compensate for the
lack of the commonwealth's participation in federal
decision-making, including one section setting up a structure for
talks about concerns of either government.
   At first the talks were hampered because of delays by the
president of the United States to appoint a representative. Later,
problems arose because of conflicts between the representatives.
   A spokesman for the Northern Marianas said they were not
satisfied with the U.S. representative, Becky Norton Dunlap of the
Interior Department.
   ``The first and most obvious problem with the talks at this
moment is that President Reagan's special representative is still
on the job, and it is not at all clear that she represents
President Bush,'' said Tenorio.
   Manglona criticized use of the Interior Department in the talks,
calling it ``neither productive nor proper.''
   ``There always will be the tendency for that special
representative to protect the institutional interests of the
department,'' said Manglona.
   He said the Northern Marianas should be dealing directly with
the State Department or the White House.
   Dunlop told the committee she believed her meetings with the
islands' representatives had been productive and had the support of
President Bush.
   She said the Interior Department helped get the Department of
Transportation to provide essential air service to Tinian and Rota
and the State Department to encourage non-governmental, third
country assistance.
   Issues to be discussed at this week's meeting include
self-government, citizenship, Micronesian War claims, trade
barriers, tuna fishing, banking, taxation, international relations
and regional cooperation, ocean rights and resources and tax-exempt
bonds.

<TEXT>
   A trainload of Red Army T-72
tanks pulled out of Czechoslovakia Tuesday after a modest ceremony
featuring a Soviet military brass band playing Russian folksongs
and mothers appealing for peace.
   A banner in Russian reading, ``Have a nice journey'' fluttered
in the breeze.
   No speeches were made.
   Soviet troops first came permanently to Czechoslovakia after
they led a Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968 to crush liberal
reforms known as the ``Prague Spring'' under former Communist Party
leader Alexander Dubcek.
   A woman resident, who refused to give her name, told reporters,
``We want peace, and if the guys up there want to fight it out
among themselves, let them. We don't need armies for that.''
   Other women who said they had sons about to do their compulsory
military service echoed her call for peace.
   The first stage of the present pullout was completed March 17,
when an airborne battalion left the Slovak city of Zvolen, 240
miles east of Prague.
   That departure went unpublicized in Czechoslovakia's state-run
media. Another battalion was withdrawn with slightly more fanfare
from the Moravian city of Olomouc near the Polish border 10 days
ago, but Czechoslovak authorities have not trumpeted the
withdrawals as much as Communist leaders in neighboring Hungary.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has announced plans to
withdraw 50,000 Soviet troops from East Europe by 1991.
   According to Soviet Lt. Gen. Yuri Shchepin, the Red Army chief
of staff, 264 vehicles and 887 soldiers have left Czechoslovakia to
date.
   On Tuesday, 23 tanks pulled out of the small village of Krupka,
near Bohosudov, about 60 miles from Prague.
   Altogether, 1,500 men, 192 tanks and 20 fighter planes are
scheduled to leave Czechoslovakia in 1989, Shchepin told reporters
at Bohosudov Tuesday.
   He said the tanks withdrawn Tuesday would be taken to the Black
Sea port of Novorossiysk, some to be scrapped and others used for
unspecified non-military purposes.
   ``You can see with your own eyes that we are not only talking
about wanting peace, but taking concrete steps,'' Shchepin said.
``We would welcome a similar initiative from NATO countries too.''

<HEAD>NTSB Says Airline to Blame for Fatal Accident</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 1 graf on penalties after 9th graf pvs, Board member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday that Aloha Airlines had itself to blame for last year's
accident over the Pacific Ocean in which an attendant was sucked to
her death after the plane's fuselage peeled open.
   The board voted 4-1 to assess as the accident's ``probable
cause'' the failure of Aloha's maintenance workers ``to detect the
presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage'' along the
skin of the 19-year-old Boeing 737.
   As contributing causes, the NTSB cited the Federal Aviation
Administration for improperly assessing the airline's inspection
program and for issuing inadequate orders to ensure the safety of
older airliners.
   Specifically, the NTSB said the FAA had erred by not ordering
that rivets along joints in the 737's outer skin be replaced much
earlier than they were.
   It was the April 28, 1988, accident that heightened concerns
about aging airlines. The Aloha plane had made more than 90,000
takeoffs and had been one of the first 12 built by Boeing.
   The board, issuing safety recommendations, urged the FAA to
closely watch airlines with unusually high numbers of heavily used,
older planes; modernize training requirements for airline
mechanics; step up inspections of Boeing 737s for additional
fatigue problems, and develop a program to monitor aircraft
corrosion.
   But the NTSB rejected a recommendation drawn up by its staff
that would have criticized the cockpit crew of Aloha Flight 243 for
landing the damaged plane in a way that added stress to what was
left of the Boeing 737.
   Board members said that proposed conclusion was unfair because
it ignored the heroic actions of pilots and flight attendants.
   Board member Joseph Nall dissented from the NTSB vote to assess
probable cause, saying he wanted to blame the aviation system
generally for not dealing sooner with the problem of aging
airliners.
   The NTSB has no authority to impose penalties and can only make
recommendations to government agencies, transportation companies
and others.
   Earlier in the day, NTSB investigator James Wildey told the
board that an examination of the plane's fuselage showed it had
either been repaired improperly by Aloha _ or not repaired at all.
   ``The piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue
cracks that were underneath the repair patches, between the repair
patches and on either side of the repair patches,'' Wildey, a
metallurgist, said.
   Airline President A. Maurice Myers later took exception to that
analysis, saying there is ``substantial evidence that those
multiple cracks were not detectable.''
   He said the accident represents a ``system failure'' on the part
of the manufacturer, the FAA and his airline.
   ``The system should have found the problems before it got to
this stage,'' he commented.
   Wildey also told the board that an unnamed passenger reported
noticing a crack in the fuselage near the door as she boarded the
plane. Wildey said airline inspectors had missed the crack.
   Investigators said that rivets had been installed in such a way
as to concentrate stress that led to tiny cracks in several areas
of the fuselages of the first 291 737s built by Boeing. An FAA
order to replace the rivets became final two weeks ago but airlines
still have several months to do the work.
   Newer 737s do not have the problem because a different method
was used to bind together sections of the fuselage skin,
investigators said.
   Board member Jim Burnett said there are indications the FAA had
not followed recommendations from the plane's manufacturer in
issuing maintenance directives to airlines.
   He noted that one Boeing service bulletin directed airlines to
replace rivets along the fuselage where the Aloha 737 split open.
But an FAA airworthiness directive was vague in its requirements,
he said.
   ``The real issue is that (the FAA) didn't follow through on
Boeing alert service bulletins,'' Burnett maintained.
   The airline has said it followed all required procedures for
inspecting and maintaining its planes.
   Chief NTSB investigator Barry Trotter said Aloha has improved
its maintenance program since the April 28, 1988, accident.
   Myers said the airline was ``in full compliance with FAA
requirements and industry standards at the time'' of the accident
and has since made many changes.
   Myers said Aloha has scrapped three of its 737s including the
one that ripped open, and purchased several new planes, giving its
fleet an average age of 10 years compared with 15 at the time of
the accident.

   The honoraria system that narrowly avoided
extinction earlier this year cranked out nearly $5.9 million in
1988 for House members who wrote articles and gave speeches to
special-interest groups.
   The honoraria figures, compiled by the public interest group
Common Cause, came from the annual House financial disclosure
statements that were released Monday.
   The final honoraria figures for the year could surpass the 1987
total of $6.7 million once financial disclosure forms are received
from an additional 20 lawmakers. The 20 reports not yet available
included that of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the 1987 honoraria leader with $245,000.
   The annual disclosure forms filed by all 535 members of Congress
provide a look at members' wealth and outside income. Each form
lists a member's money received, assets and liabilities. The Senate
reports were released last Friday.

   The Bush administration is gradually
prescribing a Middle East settlement that excludes Israeli control
over the occupied West Bank and Gaza, telling Israel to ``forswear
annexation.''
   In a speech Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III also
demanded an end to further settlement of Jews on the land taken by
Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967.
   The speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a
private research and lobbying group, followed statements by
President Bush last month ruling out Israeli sovereignty over the
territories.
   Baker mixed in demands that the Arabs accept Israel, end their
economic boycott of the Jewish state and repudiate the 1975 U.N.
General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.

   Women who took birth control pills while
teen-agers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of
breast cancer before they reach menopause, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Sweden, is one of several recent
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of
breast cancer
   While describing their findings as ``alarming,'' the researchers
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since
their introduction, and newer pills may not heighten the risk of
breast cancer.
   The research, directed by Dr. Hakan Olsson and colleagues from
University Hospital in Lund, was presented Monday at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

   Friction between light- and dark-skinned blacks
underlies an unusual federal lawsuit in which a black woman says
she lost her job because of her light complexion.
   Tracy Lynn Morrow said she sued to get her Internal Revenue
Service job back and to fight prejudice within her race.
   ``If there is this problem within our black society, then I
think we have to correct it,'' Ms. Morrow said Monday. ``That would
make us stronger, too. I feel it would help us as a race.''
   Earlier this month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss
the case, ruling Ms. Morrow could claim job discrimination if she
could prove her supervisor, also black, harassed and ultimately
fired her over skin tone.

   William Tolliver looks at life through a
different brush stroke.
   He can't explain how he does it, but art dealers and collectors
from around the nation grab his works, forcing him to turn down
offers to go on show in galleries because he can't paint fast
enough to keep up with the demand for his creations.
   ``I put a stroke there, two strokes here and let the strokes
dictate what I'm doing,'' Tolliver says. ``I might start out with a
cotton field and end up with a mother and child. It may be in
abstract or impressionism. In some instances, they paint
themselves. It's just a feeling.''
   The feeling is everything for Tolliver, who learned to paint
from a paint-by-numbers set when he was 14 and not busy carrying
water to fellow cotton pickers in the Mississippi Delta country.
   ``I could draw anything I could see by the time I was 9,'' he
said. ``It was like playing music by ear. But painting is
different. The man who invented that paint-by-number thing was
great. I learned the principles of blending colors, everything.''
   Tolliver, a high school dropout, then began reading every book
he could find on art and the masters. Most of his works feature
people _ mostly cotton pickers, or landscapes of shanties and lazy
streams.
   ``That's my background, and what I paint is the nostalgia I
feel. But I've only been doing this professionally for seven years.
As I grow and see new things, I'll paint from a new background,''
the artist said.
   The old background does just fine for Tolliver, who has painted
1,000 pieces, selling all but a few that are on display in his
studio in downtown Lafayette. He now commands a minimum of $1,000 a
painting.
   His works hang in the Zigler Museum in Jennings, La., a few feet
away from a Rembrandt and a Van Dyke, and in the New Orleans Museum
of Art. His work also has been displayed at African American Art's
``The Heartland'' in Los Angeles, and displayed in the rotunda of
the U.S. Senate Building in Washington. Hampton University in
Virginia has purchased several of his paintings.
   ``Now, some universities don't want my paintings because they
say I'm commercial because my work sells,'' Tolliver said. ``It
doesn't make sense to me. I don't know a painter anywhere who don't
want to sell his work.
   ``They say I paint what people like. That's funny. I paint what
I like from impressionism to modern art. Whatever I feel. I can't
help it because people like it.''
   The 37-year-old native of Vicksburg, Miss., lied about his age
when he was 14 and joined the Jobs Corps to learn carpentry. He
finally moved to Lafayette to take advantage of the brief oil boom.
   He never thought about painting for a living until 1983 when he
was laid off as a carpenter, one of the thousands of victims of the
oil patch crash in Louisiana.
   ``Painting was a hobby, nothing to make a living at,'' he said.
``But there was nothing else to do. A lady I had worked for
enrolled me in the Lafayette Art Association and paid my dues.''
   Tolliver then sent his wife to the association with two
paintings to display but she went to the wrong place instead. She
wound up at the University of Southwestern Louisiana Museum, which
gave her $150 for her husband's work.
   Frances Love, then the museum director, purchased the paintings,
told Tolliver about a local art gallery and the money began rolling
in.
   ``One of the paintings was absolutely beautiful,'' Love said.
``It looked like the rare kind of fine impressionistic landscape
that you might find in galleries in southern France.''

<HEAD>From Easy Earth Girls to a Gloomy Weegee</HEAD>

   Julien Temple might be a shrewd cinematic
jester who can make audiences laugh with the wacky ``Earth Girls
Are Easy,'' but he's also a solemn filmmaker who can weave dark
tales about a celebrated crime photographer.
   After the success of ``Earth Girls Are Easy,'' his newest
project is a gloomy study of Weegee, the New York crime
photographer of the 1930s and '40s.
   ``Weegee was a repulsive, fat, bug-eyed photo-rapist _ not
necessarily your Hollywood leading man. But the back side of the
character is vulnerable, lonely and extremely talented,'' the
filmmaker said.
   ``I really would like to do a dark and mysterious story now.''
   In ``Earth Girls Are Easy,'' Geena Davis, who won an Academy
Award as supporting actress for her role of a dog trainer in ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' stars as a San Fernando Valley manicurist
whose comatose suburban life is revived when a spaceship carrying
three furry space aliens splashes into her swimming pool. Husband
Jeff Goldblum, Damon Wayans and Jim Carrey co-star.
   The movie musical overflows with kitschy production numbers as
it honors the bizarre arrangement of life in Southern California,
including a celebration of hair tint in the ``'Cause I'm a Blond''
song-and-dance sequence.
   ``I was playing with a culture that is only really been seen
through the cliche of the total Valley girl,'' Temple said. ``But
it's actually a very powerful form of society. It's not a city in a
traditional sense. It's just strange things thrown down in the
mid-'50s, like instant cake mix.
   ``It's seeped through with pop culture. The obsession with
beauty and fingernails and tans and fast food. ... It is like its
own little planet. And I like making films about places as well as
people.''
   The British filmmaker looked at life in the Valley through the
eyes of the aliens themselves.
   ``It's as extraordinary as going up the Amazon,'' he said of
prowling around the local urban sprawl, ``and that is thrilling, as
well as sometimes depressing and sometimes revolting.''
   Colorful and kinetic, ``Earth Girls Are Easy'' is distinguished
by Temple's unusual visual style and attention to particulars. One
crowded seduction scene is littered with everything from a book
called ``How to Drive a Man Crazy'' to a jug of Wesson oil.
   ``I like the details _ just the little visual things that say
how people think and feel emotionally,'' he said.
   ``The beauty parlor _ the line of work Geena's character is in _
deals with crazy-colored nails. But her fiance is a kind of yuppie
_ silvers and blacks and whites. And these aliens are like three
technicolor dream men who come down and make her think about her
life.''
   He has combined vibrant visuals, music and narrative before,
directing music videos for the Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, Boy
George, Billy Idol and David Bowie. He has also made commercials
for a supermarket chain and Elizabeth Taylor's Passion for Men
perfume.
   ``Music videos are the freest form. You get your own cut,''
Temple said. ``I've never had a video changed on me by an artist.
And you don't have to go through the whole script development
process. It is a real laboratory of putting new ideas together.''
   Temple's video for Rogers' ``Planet Texas'' is an elaborate
account, filled with special effects, of otherworldly cowboys
transporting Rogers to a living sci-fi novel in the sky. Produced
for $600,000, it is among the most expensive videos ever.
   ``The process (Music Television) is very interesting _ that
(audiences) can understand imagery that fast,'' he said. ``The
challenge is to use it to create a new way of seeing.
   ``I agree there are certain basic story lines. But there are a
million ways to play around with those storylines and then there
are a million ways of differently shooting them. ... `Earth Girls'
is a fairly traditional love story. It's `Beauty and the Beast,'
with a little `Wizard of Oz' thrown in.''
   For now, Temple has had enough of tradition. ``Earth Girls,'' he
said, ``is not the ultimate kind of film that I would make. ...
It's a part of getting to a point where I can do something darker.
You can only make movies if you deliver an audience. And I'm aware
of that and I'm trying to position myself.''
   While realizing that Hollywood discourages experimentation,
Temple's profile of Weegee, whose real name was Arthur Fellig,
promises to be offbeat.
   ``I think there's a great charge in reaching an audience and
treating that audience with some respect, and giving them something
that really entertains but also plants certain ideas and questions
in there.
   ``I just wish cinema could be more responsive to real life.''

<HEAD>Jennings Missed China, But Will Take `World News' to Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's Peter Jennings was longing to be in China
last week like competitor Dan Rather of CBS, but he's looking ahead
now to taking ``World News Tonight'' to Europe next week, and
anchoring a prime-time news special on Thursday to set it all up.
   Jennings will report from Brussels and London from May 29 to
June 2 as President Bush meets with leaders of NATO allies. Unless
something unusual happens, though, the story in Western Europe
won't be as exciting as the one that CBS' Rather found himself in
the middle of last week.
   Rather and CNN's Bernard Shaw were the only U.S. network anchors
in Beijing. ABC and NBC had correspondents on the scene, but
Jennings and Tom Brokaw were in New York.
   ``Obviously, I mean, God, I mean, it would have been wonderful
to have been there,'' Jennings said in a telephone interview
Monday. ``... They'd-a had a hard time dragging me back.''
   CBS got calls of complaint after Rather and crew interrupted the
season finale of ``Dallas'' with live coverage of negotiations with
Chinese officials who had been sent to pull the plug on CBS'
satellite transmissions.
   ``Dallas'' fans aside, it was a public relations coup for CBS
News. And for news junkies, the live scenes from Beijing were
infinitely more fascinating than any cliffhanger on a night-time
soap.
   CBS News, however, had not known it would land such a big story,
and in fact had gambled that events in, say, Panama, would not
overshadow the real reason for the China trip, the four-day visit
to China by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev came and
went, Panama stayed put, and the student protests in Beijing became
THE story.
   But the recent movements toward democracy in both the Soviet
Union and in China have potentially profound implications for the
United States' relationship with NATO. On Thursday night, Jennings
will anchor a prime-time special on the subject, ``Beyond the Cold
War: The Risk and the Opportunity,'' that will include an interview
with Secretary of State James Baker III.
   ``I hate missing a big story, but we're about to go on to
witness the president attempting to deal with a tumult which has
far wider-ranging effects than what's been happening in China,''
said Jennings.
   ``We were sort of thinking this morning, how long could China go
on having internal revolution before it would have a profound
effect on the United States, and the answer is, a long time.''
   Jennings said he agreed with ABC's decision not to send him to
Beijing. But in retrospect. ...
   ``We know on a big event our audience expects us to go to
them,'' he said. ``This is in some respects why we felt badly last
week. I don't think we were as frustrated last week as we could
have been. Because sometimes you just luck out, and there's no way,
it's like _ I'll tell you a really clean beat was when Brokaw went
to Soviet Armenia. I thought that was a clear beat. ... That's
different from lucking into a story.
   ``I thought my boss (ABC News President Roone Arledge) was
perfectly legitimate in saying, listen, the Soviet-Chinese
rapprochement is not a major story for Americans. It's a major
story, but it certainly wasn't worth going over there for the
broadcast.
   ``But I didn't think that last week.''

   CAPITALISM AT WORK _ While the drama in Beijing was unfolding on
Friday _ student demonstrators tensely awaiting possible action by
government troops _ CNN and NBC bickered over CNN's contention that
NBC swiped 20 seconds of live satellite pictures during a morning
news update. CNN President Burt Reinhardt zipped off a telegram of
protest to NBC News President Michael Gartner. NBC said it was all
a misunderstanding. NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said NBC had
experienced a problem with its transmitter and thought it had
arranged to share the cable network's transmission during the live
update, anchored in New York by Deborah Norville. ``There seems to
be a professional courtesy in these things where we help each other
out. Anything beyond that was a misunderstanding,'' she said,
adding that if there was a misunderstanding, NBC would apologize. .

   When a nation's interest rates begin to fall, so
goes the theory, its economy becomes less attractive to foreigners,
who seek better returns elsewhere.
   So goes the theory _ and so goes the reality off in a different
direction. It's happening with the dollar right now, to the dismay
of some of the best minds in the monetary world. The dollar is
rising, and they don't know why.
   Making the situation all the odder is the likelihood that West
Germany and Japan might make their interest rates more attractive.
Wouldn't you think that prospect would draw money from the dollar
into the mark and the yen? It hasn't.
   The situation provokes the question: Why does reality so often
contradict the publicly stated expectations and forecasts of
``experts,'' and even, as in the case of the dollar, government
efforts at manipulation of markets?
   No. 1 on any list of explanations has to be the reminder that
there are few experts in financial, monetary and economic matters,
and nobody at all who can foretell the future, even when they have
their hands on the controls.
   Thousands of individuals and large institutions pose as
authorities on this vast unknown area and make a great living doing
so. But none of them offer any guarantees, which is unusually
foresightful of them.
   There are other reasons too.
   On policy matters, for example, government officials are not
always able to speak their minds lest they influence the future in
undesirable ways.
   For the monetary head of a large country to express fear that
the exchange value of a nation's currency might rise in the next
month could actually produce that rise by encouraging investors to
buy into that nation's currency.
   Domestically, for the Federal Reserve Board to say it planned to
loosen the money supply could cause an explosion of unwanted
economic activity. The Fed prefers instead to allow events to
unfold and then explain its role.
   On Wall Street, notions about where the stock market is headed
are often biased by self-interest. Brokers want to make sales,
because commissions on sales are their livelihood. Opinions, as a
consequence, may be akin to promotions.
   Little wonder that brokerage house ``buy'' signals are far more
common than ``sell'' signals. Of course, the latter generate
commissions as surely as the former, but ``buy'' signals alone
bring in brand-new customers.
   A customer who sells might never buy again and therefore never
produce another commission. A customer who buys, on the other hand,
produces a commission now and remains a prospect for another
commission when he sells.
   All these are ingredients in explaining why reality so often
differs from the forecasts and expectations. There is another
ingredient too, the abundance of self-styled aces, seers, geniuses
and experts who claim to see the future.
   Few of these people can see any farther ahead than you can, but
as they say, it's a way to make a living and there aren't any rules
against doing what they do. They are forecasters; forecasters must
forecast.
   There appears to be an insatiable demand for their views, right
or wrong, and most of the time they are wrong to a great degree and
right only rarely and to a limited degree.
   Nevertheless, they gain reputations as seers. They seek
publicity; they publicize their occasional victories and forget
their errors, and hope the public will too. Often it does.
   Because of this, one market letter writer remains in business
after having cost his customers a fortune by keeping them out of
the huge bull market of the 1980s. So does another, who once said
gold would rise to $4,000 an ounce.
   Why does reality so often go its own way in defiance of these
``geniuses?'' Why? Simply because reality has very little to do
with such folks, and above all, it doesn't take orders from them.

<TEXT>
   Helen G. O'Neill, once familiar to millions of
Americans as the U.S. Navy poster girl in World War I, is happy
that women have found their place in the military but says they
don't belong on seagoing vessels.
   O'Neill, who later became deputy director of Women Marines in
World War II, is either 88 or 89 (``at this point, it doesn't
matter'') and lives alone in a tree-shaded condominium village in
suburban McLean, Va., with memories of her days as a ``yeomanette''
or uniformed Navy clerk from 1917 through 1921.
   She was one of the first 12,500 women to serve in Navy uniforms,
recruited by Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels to free enlisted men
for combat duty in the approaching war against Germany.
   Wearing blue serge suits with ankle-length skirts, high-laced
boots and straw skimmers, the yeomanettes saw duty as typists,
bookkeepers, radio operators, switchboard operators, couriers,
translators, fingerprint experts, decoders, munitions factory
workers, recruiters and volunteer nurses during the influenza
epidemic of 1918.
   They were paid the same wages as sailors _ up to $60 a month for
a chief petty officer. But because the Navy provided no barracks or
mess halls for women, yeomanettes rented rooms, shared apartments
or lived with family friends and received a subsistence allowance
of $1.50 a day.
   When the call went out for yeomanettes, many newspapers
published bitterly critical letters from readers. ``Preposterous!''
wrote one irate retired colonel. ``First the women wanted to vote.
Then Alice Roosevelt started them smoking cigarettes! Now they're
talking about being soldiers. Next thing we know they'll be cutting
off their hair and wearing pants!''
   Like most yeomanettes, O'Neill came from a comfortably
middle-class home. She lived in East Boston across Webster Street
from Patrick Joseph Kennedy and his clan. Her childhood chum was
Margaret, sister of Joseph P. Kennedy and aunt of John F. Kennedy,
later to become president.
   O'Neill got a college business administration degree, took a
civil service exam and received a job offer from the Navy. Although
her father protested that she was too young at 19 to leave home,
she packed her bags for Washington for a clerical job at Navy
headquarters.
   Soon after she enlisted in the naval reserve, the red-haired
Boston Irish beauty was invited to pose for a portrait by painter
Howard Chandler Christy.
   With a few months, posters featuring O'Neill in uniform appeared
on streets and in windows of Navy recruiting offices around the
country with the slogan, ``I Want You for The Navy.''
   Christy produced another, perhaps more widely remembered poster
portraying a different young woman who posed saucily in a sailor's
hat and jumper with this inscription: ``Gee!! I wish I were a man.
I'd join the Navy.'' The woman who inspired that poster was former
yeomanette Bernice Tongate, now 92 and reportedly living in a
veterans' home in Retsill, Wash.
   
   O'Neill was flattered but not surprised to see herself as a Navy
poster girl. It was a thrilling, hectic period in her life, she
says, and ``anything happens in wartime.''
   In any event, few of her friends recognized her in Christy's
romanticized portrait, she said.
   After the war, she returned to a civilian Navy career that
included a stint as aide to the assistant Navy secretary. When
World War II broke out, O'Neill was second in line to take the oath
as a woman Marine, and she quickly rose through the ranks to become
deputy director of the women's corps. She retired in 1959 as a
lieutenant colonel.
   O'Neill is pleased that 54,000 women _ 10 percent of the Navy's
uniformed personnel _ are working successfully alongside male
officers and enlisted men.
   ``I think they've come a long way,'' she said, ``but I don't
approve of women going to sea. That's not fair to the men's wives.''
   Of the Navy's 54,000 women, about 5,000 are serving on
non-combatant ships such as oilers, destroyer and submarine
tenders, auxiliary vessels and diving and salvage ships.
   O'Neill will be listed in a computerized honor roll at the Women
in Military Service for America Memorial, which will be built at
the main entrance to Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate the
estimated 2 million American women who have served with the armed
forces since the Revolutionary War.
   The design of the $25 million memorial, which will be financed
through private donations, is to be chosen November during Veterans
Day weekend, and construction is to begin in November 1991.
   Because records of military women are largely unavailable, the
monument's sponsors are asking women veterans to call
1-800-222-2294 to provide information about themselves and their
friends for the computer register.
   O'Neill says she doesn't know how many yeomanette veterans are
still living. Only about 200 remained when their national
organization disbanded in 1986.
   For a long time, she lived here with her mother and sister, both
now dead. She has never married.
   ``I came close a couple of times but escaped,'' she said. ``No
regrets.''

<HEAD>Andy Warhol: Ghost of Pop Icon Everywhere These Days</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ghost of Andy Warhol is everywhere these
days.
   This month alone a retrospective of the artist's work ended a
record-breaking run at the Museum of Modern Art; his Interview
magazine has been put on the market; his ``Shot Red Marilyn''
fetched $4 million at Christie's; and his infamous, dishy diaries
were published.
   More than two years after Warhol died at age 58 following gall
bladder surgery, the pop icon continues to hog the limelight in the
contemporary art market. Even in death he has easily outlived his
own saw that, ``In the future, everybody will be world famous for
15 minutes.''
   In the book ``Andy Warhol: A Retrospective,'' art historian
Robert Rosenblum wrote that Warhol's ``own fame has far outlasted
the 15 minutes he allotted to everyone else.''
   As ARTnews magazine has said, it's ``Andy Inc.'' time.
   Last year, Sotheby's sold $25.3 million of items from the Warhol
estate, including cookie jars in the shape of pigs and puppies and
early 19th century Baltimore furniture. Warhol was on the cover of
Newsweek, ABC's ``20-20'' did a feature on him and Business Week
and Forbes wrote about the 10-day auction.
   Andy-mania, as some art critics call it, featured equal parts
Warhol the media superstar and Warhol the artist, the man credited
with wedding fine art to popular culture. After all, silk-screened
Brillo boxes and Campbell's soup cans weren't exactly considered
art before Warhol.
   So who was this Andy Warhol?
   ``If Andy Warhol is not the American Dream, then there is no
American Dream,'' art critic Edward W. Hayes said.
   Born Andrew Warhola in 1928 to an immigrant family in
Pittsburgh, he collected autographed photos of movie stars as a
youngster. After graduating in 1949 from the Carnegie Institute of
Technology, he changed his name to Andy Warhol and moved to New
York seeking fame, wealth and status.
   As the late writer Truman Capote once said, ``Andy Warhol wanted
to be anyone but Andy Warhol.''
   Infatuated with Capote after seeing the author's photo on a book
jacket, Warhol repeatedly wrote and called the writer, ceasing only
when Capote's mother asked him to stop, art historian Marjorie
Frankel Nathanson said.
   By his mid-20s, Warhol had become a successful commercial
artist, doing inventive window displays at Bergdorf Goodman and
Bonwit Teller, and works for Glamour, Vogue and Seventeen magazines.
   He began dabbling in art, making a 1956 ``shoe portrait'' of
Elvis Presley. In 1960, he painted canvases depicting comic-strip
characters such as Batman, Nancy and Dick Tracy.
   His Campbell's Soup Cans appeared in 1962, as did drawings of
corns on toes for Dr. Scholl, and his initial repetition pieces,
``Five Coke bottles,'' ``192 One-Dollar Bills'' and ``S&amp;H Green
Stamps.''
   Next came his famous Liz Taylor and Marilyn series (``Blue Liz
as Cleopatra'' and ``Turquoise Marilyn''), in which he accented
their lips and eyes in neon-bright colors. Paintings of Elvis, Troy
Donahue and Warren Beatty were other early efforts of celebrity
portraits.
   Sixteen panels of Jacqueline Kennedy in 1963 show her grieving
over her husband's assassination. A similar period of darkness that
year had Warhol doing works on race riots, the electric chair, auto
accidents and dismembered victims.
   His ``Thirteen Most Wanted Men,'' commissioned by the New York
State Pavillion for its building at the 1964 World's Fair, was so
politically charged sponsors asked him to paint it over.
   Kenneth Silver, an associate professor of fine arts at New York
University, told a Warhol symposium last month at the MoMA that
``Thirteen Most Wanted,'' with its male pinups of the most
sought-after criminals in the United States, showed the ``two
issues of Warhol's art: class and gender identification.''
   ``Obviously,'' Silver said, ``Warhol was determined to introduce
elements of his gay identity into his art.''
   After that, Warhol began five years of shooting voyeuristic
films of his Factory studio followers. Then he was shot and
seriously wounded in 1968 by Valerie Solanis, the sole member of
SCUM, the Society for Cutting Up Men.
   He recovered, and by 1970 had an exhibit at the Pasadena
(Calif.) Art Museum that toured Chicago, Canada and much of Europe.
What followed were the famous Mao portraits beginning in 1972 that
used dashes of synthetic polymer paint and silkscreen ink on canvas.
   Vivid lips and eyes popped up again in similar paintings of Liza
Minnelli in 1978 and of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.
   Factory follower Ultra Violet in her 1988 book, ``Famous for 15
Minutes: My Years With Andy Warhol,'' described him as a ``shy,
near blind, bald, gay albino from ethnic Pittsburgh.''
   But his art is another matter. MoMA curator Kynaston McShine,
who selected Warhol's 300-piece retrospective, put together a show
that is surprisingly moving. The Maos and Marilyns are likely to
endure as classics of our time.
   The exhibit, too, has a sense of humor, with Warhol poking fun
at his own penchant for publicity.
   His 1981 ``Myths'' had panels showing Superman, Santa Claus,
Howdy Doody, Mickey Mouse, Uncle Sam, Dracula, the Wicked Witch of
the East and ... Andy Warhol.
   Warhol once said, ``If you want to know all about Andy Warhol,
just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and
there I am. There's nothing behind it.''
   Wrong, critics say.
   Trevor Fairbrother, associate curator of contemporary arts at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, told a symposium last month that
Warhol was ``an artist of consequence. Andy Warhol had brains.''
   But could he paint? the audience pressed Walter Hopps, director
of the Menil Collection in Houston and moderator of the symposium.
   ``Yes, he could really paint,'' said Walter Hopps, director of
the Menil Collection in Houston, in an understatement.
   The show, sponsored by Kroll International, moves next month to
the Art Institute of Chicago, then to London, Cologne, West
Germany, Milan, Italy, and finishes next year in Paris.

<HEAD>Summit Participants To Meet For 7 Hours</HEAD>

   The leaders of the 16 NATO nations
gathering here Sunday will hold seven hours of summit talks spread
over two days. They will also have lunch with Baudouin, king of the
Belgians, and dine in the chateau where the Common Market was born
33 years ago.
   The last of the 16 heads of government to arrive, as is
protocol, will be the president of the United States. George Bush
and his wife, Barbara, were arriving about 6 p.m. (noon EDT) Sunday.
   The Bushes will be put up at the same government guest house,
Chateau Stuyvenberg, where Ronald Reagan stayed for last year's
NATO summit.
   The white-washed 1840 manor stands in a downtown park next to
Laeken Palace, home to the king and to Queen Fabiola. Three miles
away is NATO headquarters, where the summit's three ``working
sessions'' will be held.
   The headquarters, a sprawling, low-rise complex next to the
Brussels airport, was built quickly as a replacement for NATO's
Paris headquarters after France withdrew in 1966 from the
alliance's integrated military command structure.
   The summit itself is tentatively scheduled to begin at 9:45 a.m.
(3:45 a.m. EDT) Monday, in Room 16, a large conference hall where
the NATO defense and foreign ministers meet twice a year.
   Once opening speeches and the traditional ``class picture'' are
out of the way, the 16 leaders will move to a smaller, more
intimate chamber, Room 1, for the first summit session.
   Across one wall of Room 1 is written the NATO maxim, ``Animus in
Consulendo Liber,'' which translates into English as ``The Mind
Ranges Unrestrained in Counsel.'' It's an appropriate text for a
summit that must resolve the divisive issue of modernizing NATO's
short-range nuclear missiles.
   At midday Monday, the summit leaders will travel to the royal
palace for lunch with the king.
   The massive 18th century Laeken Palace is both the king's office
and his residence. It fronts on a wide, cobblestone street and
faces the Belgian parliament across Royal Park.
   Monday night, the summiteers will dine at Chateau Val Duchesse,
set in thick woods on the southeastern outskirts of the Belgian
capital.
   The complex has been the site of convents since 1262. The
chateau that stands there now was built in the late 18th century
and rebuilt in 1910.
   The small chateau is owned by the Belgian government, which uses
it for Cabinet meetings or international conferences.
   It was here, in part, that the discussions were held that led to
the formation of the European Economic Community, as the Common
Market is formally known, in 1956.
   The summit will end with a final communique about noon (6 a.m.
EDT) Tuesday.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose auction to the highest level in two weeks.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.6 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.32 percent, up
from 8.21 percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.33 percent, up
from 8.19 percent.
   The rates were the highest since May 8, when three-month bills
sold for 8.41 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.39 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.62 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,789.70, and 8.82 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,576.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.89
percent last week, down from 9.05 percent the previous week.

   On the 80th day of the Eastern Airlines strike,
picketing machinists, flight attendants and pilots at Logan
International Airport shared a picnic lunch brought by a fellow
striker.
   That kind of camaraderie, many Eastern employees say, has
boosted their spirits and determination as the bitter strike nears
the start of its fourth month.
   ``It's not easy but we're doing the best we can,'' Eastern ramp
service worker Bob Austin, 43, said Monday as he walked one of five
picket lines that operate daily at Logan.
   ``I'm not spending much. I haven't been to a store in two
months,'' Austin said. ``But I'm optimistic. I just hope the
airline will be sold in one piece.''
   Added 52-year-old pilot Ray Chumsae: ``I'm living on rainy day
money and so far there's been a lot of rainy days.''
   The local Machinists union has established a food and job bank
that many strikers have used to procure part-time work that allows
them to picket at least three times a week.
   ``We're still very solid and upbeat,'' said William Conley,
chief steward of the local Machinists. ``It helps to get all the
support. Our hope is to keep Eastern together.''
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors
since March 9, five days after the start of the paralyzing strike
by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York must approve a sale of
Eastern or any of its assets.
   ``This airline is not going to be sold in one piece, that's been
said over and over again,'' Eastern spokesman Steve Davis said.
``But for the strikers, it's a terrible situation. There's a
terrible human price being paid. We think it's awful.''
   About half of Eastern's 2,000 employees at Logan have joined the
walkout. On average, about 40 striking workers walk four-hour
shifts before being replaced by fresh pickets.
   The strikers exchange jokes as well as problems as they walk the
picket lines, which they have given nicknames.
   ``We talk about what's going on and all the things that crop up
because of this,'' said baggage handler Tom Hogan, 57. ``It's kind
of like a support group.''
   On Monday, strikers dined on pita bread sandwiches, potato chips
and soda on a blue-checked tablecloth spread on a grass island
adjacent to the Eastern terminal. They call the area ``Hollywood''
because it is the picket line of choice for television news camera
crews.
   ``There's a camaraderie about the whole issue,'' said B.J.
Phillips, 42, an Eastern flight attendant for 23 years who said she
was picketing at 6 a.m. on the strike's first day. ``People have
really pitched in for each other.''
   Phillips, who brought the picnic hamper, said some of the food
was donated by friends in her hometown of Carlisle.
   But despite the optimism, most of the strikers expressed anger
and frustration, much of toward Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air Corp., Eastern's parent company.
   ``Most of us here love our jobs but there's something terribly
wrong with the company,'' said 57-year-old pilot Bill Johansen, a
24-year Eastern veteran. People here have stuck together but
sometimes I'm amazed we've hung on.''

<HEAD>Shareholder Vote Set on Warner, Time Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. and Time Inc. have
set a June 23 date for shareholders to vote on a proposed $18
billion merger that would create the world's largest media and
entertainment company.
   The companies scheduled the votes Monday after Warner removed a
potential obstacle to the merger by settling a dispute with its
biggest shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc.
   Warner agreed to put its interest in Chris-Craft's broadcast
subsidiary up for sale and relinquish its right of first refusal to
buy Chris-Craft's sizeable holdings of Warner stock should
Chris-Craft decide to sell them.
   ``We are delighted that despite our earlier differences, the
relationship between WCI and Chris-Craft is ending on a
constructive and amicable basis and in the best interests of all
the shareholders of the concerned parties,'' the chairmen and chief
executives of both companies, Steven J. Ross of Warner and Herbert
J. Siegel of Chris-Craft, said in a statement.
   Despite the settlement, Chris-Craft has not indicated whether it
planned to sell its Warner stake or how it planned to vote on the
Time-Warner merger. Chris-Craft owns about 17.1 percent of Warner's
voting stock and would be the largest shareholder in a merged Time
Warner with about 11 percent.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Warner climbed $1 a
share to $51.37{, Time rose 75 cents a share to $125.50 and
Chris-Craft rose $1.12{ a share to $38.
   Time and Warner shareholders on record as of May 1 will be given
a chance to vote on the merger at separate June 23 meetings.
   Under terms of the merger, each share of Warner stock would be
traded for 0.465 shares of stock in the new company while Time
shares would be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
   Several local cable franchising authorities also must approve
the change in ownership of cable systems in their areas. Time owns
systems with about 4 million subscribers while Warner has about 1.5
million cable subscribers.
   Warner and Chris-Craft struck an alliance in 1984, buying stakes
of each other in what was seen as protection against hostile
takeovers.
   Warner bought a 42.5 percent interest in Chris-Craft's broadcast
subsidiary, BHC Inc., while Chris-Craft bought a stake in Warner.
As part of the agreement, Warner was forbidden from buying a
television station or agreeing to certain changes in its control.
   The relationship soon soured, and Warner gradually reduced
Chris-Craft's representation on the Warner board. With Monday's
settlement, Chris-Craft would no longer be represented on the
Warner board while Warner would give up its spots on the BHC board,
Warner spokesman Geoffrey Holmes said.
   Chris-Craft delayed Warner's recent acquisition of Lorimar
Telepictures Inc., forcing Lorimar to sell television stations
because of the pact with Warner. BHC owns or has interests in seven
television stations.
   In a move to head off potential delays, Warner filed suit
earlier this month against Chris-Craft in Delaware Chancery Court,
asking that Chris-Craft be required to resolve any objections to
the merger. That litigation was resolved under the settlement,
Warner and Chris-Craft said.
   Peter M. Fishbein, a Chris-Craft lawyer, said the settlement
``gives Chris-Craft everything it asked for under its contract''
and more.
   Under the settlement, Warner said it would offer to sell its
shares in BHC to third parties. Chris-Craft would have the right of
first refusal to purchase Warner's interest in BHC or require
Warner to spin off its interest in BHC to Time Warner shareholders
after the merger.
   Warner also is ending its right of first refusal on sale of the
Warner shares held by Chris-Craft as part of the agreement.
   Fishbein said Chris-Craft got more than its contract called for
when Warner agreed that the spinoff of its BHC stake would be
structured so as not to dilute Chris-Craft's own holdings in BHC.
Chris-Craft owns about 57.5 percent of BHC.

<HEAD>Banks, Exchange Houses Closed Again Amid Political Logjam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks and foreign exchange houses
are being closed as the two main political parties try to agree on
ways to stabilize a foundering economy and speed inauguration of a
new president.
   The bank holiday scheduled for today was the fifth and the
exchange holiday the seventh since Feb. 5, when the Central Bank
disclosed it no longer would sell U.S. dollars to prop up the
austral.
   It was the second straight day the financial institutions were
ordered closed.
   Argentina's national currency has plunged in value by 90 percent
in four months, falling to 180 per dollar last Friday.
   Devaluation is one aspect of an economic crisis that is forcing
President Raul Alfonsin to consider stepping down early in favor of
President-elect Carlos Menem.
   Inflation is projected at near 50 percent this month, interest
rates have topped 200 percent, wages are shrinking, unemployment
and public anger are rising, the national budget is in deficit,
Central Bank reserves are low and no payments are being made on the
foreign debt.
   The General Labor Confederation has demanded a 125 percent
increase in the monthly minimum wage, provinces are requesting
federal funds to meet overdue payrolls and banks would be hard
pressed to pay the $2 billion in bonds that fall due this week.
   Economy Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese blamed the crisis on
financial speculation, political uncertainty and the government's
lack of credibility.
   ``We can't hang on until Dec. 10 with a policy in which we can't
do anything,'' he said.
   Menem and the Peronist Party won national elections May 14.
Inauguration was scheduled for Dec. 10, the final day of Alfonsin's
six-year term, but he may take office within weeks.
   Alfonsin indicated last weekend he is willing to step down early
if he can without violating the constitution, and if an agreement
is made with Menem on economic policy during the transition.
   On Sunday, Pugliese said exchange controls that had been lifted
will be reimposed, as will export taxes of 30 percent on grain,
beef and farm products, and 15 percent on industrial goods.
   After meeting with Pugliese, Jorge Matzkin, an economic
counselor to Menem, said the national minimum wage would be
increased, as would utility rates. He did not specify amounts.
   All-day meetings Monday failed to achieve agreement on an
overall economic policy or a way to legally move up the transition.
   ``We're blocked. We are waiting for an answer,'' said Cesar
Jaroslavsky, leader of Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union in the
Chamber of Deputies.
   ``If we don't get an answer, we'll keep governing by
ourselves,'' said Federico Storani, a Radical national deputy.

<HEAD>AAA Says Gasoline Prices Up 17.4 Percent Since Easter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists can expect to pay 17 cents a gallon
more to fill up their tanks for the Memorial Day holiday than they
did just nine weeks earlier at Easter, the American Automobile
Association says.
   It's the steepest price increase between holidays in nine years,
AAA said Monday. The last bigger increase recorded by the auto club
was a 19.1-cent-a-gallon jump between Christmas 1979 and Easter
1980.
   The average price of gasoline has risen to $1.254 a gallon, 16
percent higher than at Easter, when an average gallon of gasoline
cost $1.08, AAA said. Last Memorial Day, gasoline averaged $1.088.
   At self-serve retail pumps across the nation, unleaded gasoline
averages $1.13 a gallon, regular is $1.115 and premium unleaded is
$1.268, AAA said.
   At full-service stations, unleaded averages $1.306, regular
$1.257 and premium $1.449 a gallon.
   Diesel fuel is $1.085 at self-serve pumps and $1.219 at
full-serve.
   New Jersey has the lowest statewide prices, averaging $1.124 a
gallon, while motorists traveling in Nevada will face the costliest
fuel, at an average of $1.374 a gallon.
   AAA's Fuel Gauge Report is based on a survey of nearly 5,400
stations along major U.S. travel routes.
   Despite the sharp gasoline increase, the auto club said it
expects 24 million motorists to take to the roads and highways over
the Memorial Day weekend for a trip of 100 miles or more.

   Declaring that business can be both
profitable and ethical, a group of industry leaders is launching an
institute to study and foster responsible corporate behavior.
   The Business Enterprise Trust is the brainchild of television
producer Norman Lear and is backed by executives including Warren
E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Washington
Post Co. Chairwoman Katharine Graham.
   The trust, with offices at the Claremont (Calif.) Graduate
School, will make annual awards for exemplary acts or policies by
business and sponsor research and hold seminars on business ethics.
   The effort is aimed at business students and the business
community, said trust president Kirk O. Hanson, who for 10 years
has headed the study of business ethics at Stanford University's
graduate business school.
   ``The skepticism which is growing in some business circles and
among some business students _ that it is impossible to be both
responsible and profitable _ is far off the mark,'' Hanson said.
   Examples of the kind of behavior that might be honored:
companies that operate ethically in countries with human rights
abuses, compete successfully with unethical rivals or that take
responsibility for environmental or social problems associated with
their businesses.
   The trust will seek suggestions from the public beginning in
September for the awards and will make the first award next year,
Hanson said. He expects to give five or six awards annually.
   Lear provided initial financing of $1 million for the first two
years and other donors are being sought.
   Directors of the trust, in addition to Buffett and Mrs. Graham,
are Peter F. Drucker, professor of social science at Claremont;
John F. Akers, chairman and CEO of IBM; Douglas Fraser, former
United Auto Workers president; Robert A. Burnett, chairman of
Meredith Corp; William T. Coleman Jr., senior partner of the
O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm.
   Karen N. Horn, chairman CEO of Cleveland's Bank One; James T.
Jynn, chairman and CEO of Aetna Life and Casualty; Sol M. Linowitz,
former chairman of Xerox Corp.; John D. Maguire, Claremont Graduate
School president; Robert C. Maynard, president of Oakland Tribune
Inc.; Robert B. Reich of the John F. Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University; Henry B. Schacht, chairman and CEO of
Cummins Engine Co.; and John A. Young, president and CEO of
Hewlett-Packard Co.

<HEAD>New York Times Co. Agrees to Buy McCall's Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times Co., which publishes Family
Circle magazine, has agreed in principle to acquire McCall's
magazine.
   Terms were not disclosed, but the sale agreement followed recent
published reports that the U.S. subsidiary of France's Hachette SA
had broken off an informal agreement to buy McCalls.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the boards of the
companies, regulatory approval and signing of a definitive
agreement.
   Both Family Circle and McCall's are part of a group known within
the publishing industry as the ``Seven Sisters'' women's service
magazines.
   The others in that group are Woman's Day from Hachette's
Diamandis Communications Inc.; Good Housekeeping and Redbook from
Hearst Corp.; and Better Homes &amp; Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal
from Meredith Corp.
   William T. Kerr, president of the magazine group at New York
Times Co., said Monday the addition of McCall's to its group would
enable advertisers to reach nearly one-third of adult women in the
United States with little duplication.
   McCall's, which is owned by a joint venture of Time Inc. and
media investor Dale W. Lang known as Working Woman-McCall's Group,
is a monthly magazine with a circulation of 5.1 million. Most of
its sales are by subscription.
   Family Circle is published 17 times a year and has a circulation
of 5.9 million.
   Together, Kerr said the magazines have an unduplicated audience
of 30.4 million women readers, including paid subscribers and
pass-along readers.
   According to published reports which could not be confirmed, The
Wall Street Journal reported people familiar with the talks said
McCall's had been expected to be sold to Diamandis for a price that
would have been announced at about $120 million. But it said
subscription liabilities may have reduced the price to as low as
$70 million, the report said.
   With the acquisition, New York Times Co. will publish 17 titles,
including Golf Digest, Tennis, Snow Country, Sailing World and
Decorating Remodeling.
   Working Woman-McCall's Group would be left with the monthly
magazines, Working Woman and Working Mother.

   The Pillsbury Co. says it may sell its Van de
Kamp's and Bumble Bee Seafoods businesses in another streamlining
effort since the company was bought in January by Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   Van de Kamp's, which produces frozen fish products, and Bumble
Bee, which makes canned seafoods, both are valuable brand names but
neither is ``sufficiently linked'' to core Pillsbury businesses,
Ian A. Martin, the company's chairman, said Monday.
   Pillsbury acquired Van de Kamp's in November 1984. It had sales
for the year ended May 31, 1988, of about $135 million. Bumble Bee,
acquired by Pillsbury last August, had sales of about $283 million
for the year ended Dec. 31, 1988.
   Since buying Pillsbury in January for $5.7 billion, London-based
Grand Met has fired 550 workers at Pillsbury headquarters in
Minneapolis and an equal number of non-restaurant workers
throughout the Burger King system.
   Other streamlining moves included the sale of five food
processing units in Latin America earlier this month.
   Grand Met also disposed of Pillsbury's Azteca Mexican Foods
business and its S&amp;A Restaurant Corp., which included the chains of
Steak &amp; Ale and Bennigan's.

   Telephone calls from the United States to China
have tripled in volume since the political crisis in Beijing
intensified a few weeks ago, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
says.
   AT&amp;T, the sole U.S. long-distance company with telephone links
to China, said Monday that 36,260 calls were attempted to China
last Friday, and 31,624 calls were attempted on Saturday. The
normal volume is about 10,000 calls.
   The tripled number of calls coincided with warnings by China's
government that it would use force if necessary to crush mass
demonstrations in the Chinese capital for political reform.
   AT&amp;T said calling volume on its network started increasing about
two weeks ago, when the demonstrations began to grow. The increase
also coincided with an influx of foreign journalists and
dignitaries accompanying Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on his
visit to China.
   The company said in a news release it was having no trouble
delivering the calls, ``although at peak times callers may reach a
recording advising them that all circuits are busy.''
   AT&amp;T said its 200 circuits to China are sufficient to meet
demand for most times of day, and the company can add capacity by
routing calls through Tokyo.
   China has 6 million telephones for a population of nearly 1.2
billion, or about one phone per 200 people. Few have phones in
their homes.
   AT&amp;T has offered service to China since 1971.

<HEAD>Group Led by Former Macmillan Boss Buys Macmillan's Direct Marketing
Group</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group led by the former chairman
of Macmillan Inc. has agreed to buy the publishing giant's direct
marketing business as well as magazine operations Macmillan once
owned for a total of $310 million.
   The purchases are the first by K-III Holdings Inc., which is
headed by former Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans and Macmillan's
former chief financial officer, Charles G. McCurdy.
   K-III Holdings was formed in February in association with the
investment banker Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., to acquire
acquiring and manage businesses in the publishing, information and
media fields.
   Evans had headed a Macmillan management group backed by Kohlberg
that last year lost a bitter takeover struggle for Macmillan,.
   Britain's Robert Maxwell won that fight and paid $2.5 billion
for Macmillan, which is based in New York. Evans left the company
after the takeover.
   On Monday, Maxwell Communication Corp. said it had agreed to
sell Macmillan's direct marketing group to K-III Holdings for $143
million.
   That business includes Macmillan Book Clubs and Gryphon
Editions, and mainly is involved in operating professional and
scientific book clubs.
   The direct marketing group had earnings from operations of $16
million on sales of $85 million last year, Maxwell said.
   K-III Holdings announced separately it also would acquire the
assets of Intertec Publishing Co. and Webb Publishing from a
privately-held group which bought them from Macmillan late last
year for an undisclosed price.
   Intertec and Webb publish magazines in the broadcasting,
engineering, telecommunication, horticultural and farming
industries as well as technical manuals.
   K-III Holdings did not say how much it paid for Intertec and
Webb, but gave an aggregate price for the two transactions of $310
million. Considering the price Maxwell gave for the direct
marketing group sale, the price for Intertec and Webb apparently
was about $167 million.
   Maxwell had agreed last last year to sell the book clubs along
with Intertec and Webb for $400 million to another group aligned
with Kohlberg Kravis. But that deal fell apart when it became
apparent it would not be completed in time to qualify for tax
breaks that expired at the end of 1988.
   Maxwell said its sale of the direct marketing group would be for
cash payable on completion of the deal, expected to occur June 30.
   It said the proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings.
   Maxwell already has announced about $1.4 billion of the $2
billion in asset sales it expects to make in the wake of its
Macmillan acquisition.
   Last week, Maxwell said Macmillan had agreed to sell its
Katherine Gibbs secretarial training programs and its technical
schools division for $31.5 million to Phillips Colleges, a
privately-held concern based in Gulfport, Miss.

   Share prices were lower at midday Tuesday, as a
small amount of shares were bought by institutions at bargain
prices.
   Dealers said shares were knocked back from the outset on
interest rate fears and concern over the direction of the pound but
rebounded on what dealers termed cheap buying. Stability in the
currency market helped some buyers regain their nerve, some traders
said.
   ``There's not a lot of business around,'' said one British
equities salesman. ``Whatever shares were bought this morning was
out of a necessity to round out positions rather than true
commitment to invest in the market.''
   At about 12:15 p.m. in London, the Financial Times-Stock

   Volume came to 245.5 million shares at midday, compared with
345.5 million shares at the same time Monday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said Tuesday its after-tax
profit rose 16 percent in its most recent fiscal year, with
disappointing results in continental Europe offset by strong gains
elsewhere and a slower rise in costs.
   The airline said after-tax profit for the year ended March 31,
the first to include a 12-month contribution from British
Caledonian Airways, came to 175 million pounds, or about $277
million, compared with 151 million pounds, or $239 million, in the
previous fiscal year.
   Earnings per share rose to 24.3 pence, 38 cents, from 21.0
pence, 33 cents.
   Pre-tax profit rose 18 percent to 268 million pounds ($423
million), from 228 million pounds ($360 million dollars).
   Sales rose 13 percent to 4.26 billion pounds ($6.7 billion),
from 3.76 billion pounds ($5.9 billion).
   British Caledonian, bought in late 1987 for $400 million,
contributed only to the final three months of the previous year's
earnings.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King described the results as
``first class,'' and said the company remains in the ``forefront of
the world's most profitable airlines.''
   Traffic figures for April, the first month of the new financial
year, were good, the company said, showing an increase of 10
percent from a year ago.
   Prospects for the summer months were encouraging, British
Airways said.
   British law does not require companies to issue results
quarterly.

<HEAD>Report: Airline To Order 150 Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is expected to announce orders
and options Wednesday for 150 commuter planes from a Swedish
manufacturer in a deal that could be worth as much as $1 billion, a
published report said today.
   The Dallas Times Herald reported in today's editions that the
orders would be placed with Saab-Scania.
   American has scheduled a news conference Wednesday at company
headquarters in Fort Worth to announce the ``acquisition of a
significant number of aircraft,'' said Ed Stewart, an airline
spokesman.
   The airline, the principal holding of AMR Corp., is expected to
announce an order for 50 Saab-Scania 340B turboprop commuter
aircraft, options for 50 more and 50 options for the larger
Saab-Scania 2000 model, said Paul Turk, an analyst for Avmark, a
Washington, D.C. consulting firm.
   Analysts, quoted by the newspaper, said the purchases are
expected to end a multibillion-dollar buying binge the airline
launched in the past year to position itself for growth in the
1990s.
   American's strategy is to have the flexibility to take
additional aircraft during periods of high demand or use them to
retire aging planes if the industry's growth slows, Robert
Crandall, company chairman and chief executive officer, said last
week.
   Analysts said the carrier has one of the industry's youngest
fleets with an average age of 9.4 years. That average is expected
to decrease to eight years by 1994, they said.
   The airline's officials said they are now entering a second
phase of faster growth to take advantage of a ``closing window of
opportunity'' as regulatory and capacity problems place limits on
future growth.

<TEXT>
   America West Airlines, awarded long-sought
landing slots at Washington National and New York's LaGuardia
airports, plans to begin one-stop service to those destinations
within 30 days.
   The Phoenix-based carrier on Monday was awarded enough slots by
the Federal Aviation Administration for two round trips daily to
LaGuardia and three to Washington National.
   The slots became available because they no longer are being used
by Eastern Airlines, which has been crippled by financial and labor
troubles.
   Landings and takeoffs at the two airports are limited by the
federal government because of safety and noise restrictions.
   Although the slots must be returned within seven days of the
government's asking, America West is optimistic that the government
will allocate some permanent slots from a pool of unused or
underused slots.
   America West has been seeking to buy Eastern's Northeast shuttle
in part to obtain landing rights at LaGuardia and Washington
National, but Monday's announcement will not affect the company's
offer, America West spokeswoman Daphne Decino said.
   ``We have been trying to get this community one-stop service
into those airports for a long time,'' said Peter Otradovec,
America West vice president of planning. ``We have every intention
of starting and operating the service as long as we can.''
   America West, which has hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, already
serves New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and
Baltimore-Washington Airport.

<HEAD>Industry Executives Call For Cable Television To Grow Up</HEAD>

   Cable television must provide more quality and not
just quantity in programming, key executives say.
   In the opening session of the National Cable Television
Association's annual meeting Monday, industry executives said the
rapid expansion of the cable market necessitates a clear focus for
future programming.
   ``Today we are clearly a major source of television in
America,'' said Bob Miron, NCTA vice chairman and president of
Newhouse Broadcasting Corp.
   James P. Mooney, NCTA's president and chief executive, cited
recent polls which indicate the public believes cable provides
superior programming in cultural, children's, sports and general
entertainment areas.
   ``For several years now, it has become more and more apparent
... that cable has drawn even with broadcasting as a primary
television medium,'' Mooney said. ``Moreover, cable is not just
more TV, it is different, it is diverse, it is special.''
   ``To the degree that there is a real diversity in television
programming which didn't exist 10 years ago, to the degree that
national audiences of children, women, minorities, arts lovers,
sports enthusiasts and people interested in public affairs now have
available all-day, intelligently conceived and well produced
programming to meet their needs _ it is cable that's made the
difference,'' Mooney said.
   Other executives like former NBC president Fred Silverman say
it's time cable TV develops a conscience and develop its potential.
   Silverman said the cable industry has had a proliferation of
tabloid TV shows like ``America's Most Wanted,''' and talk shows
like ``Geraldo.''
   ``I think it's horrible,'' said Silverman, who now heads his own
production firm. Silverman predicted the popularity of such shows
has peaked, and said backlash from the public will bring about
their demise by next year.
   Since the mid-70s, when cable began to expand beyond a
transmission service to include original programming, more than 55
percent of the nation's estimated 89 million television homes now
pay an average of $14.60 per month for basic service _ which
includes an average of 35 channels, the association says.
   During that time, over-the-air networks' share of the television
has declined as the public has turned to viewing alternatives
including cable and videotapes.
   About 77 million of the nation's homes have access to cable,
Goddard said, adding that studies indicate more than 25 percent of
the television watched in homes with cable is non-network
programming.

<HEAD>Procter and Gamble Agrees to Sell Cheboygan Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEBOYGAN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. says it will sell
its northern Michigan paper factory and drop production of the
tissue used in disposable diapers.
   Mosinee Paper Corp. of Wisconsin has agreed in principle to buy
the Cheboygan factory, Procter &amp; Gamble plant Manager Phil Baker
said Monday.
   The plant manufactures the tissue paper that wraps around the
absorbent stuffing of disposable diapers, and also makes liners for
underwear and incontinent briefs. About a third of the plant's
production is devoted to diaper tissue, Baker said.
   The Cheboygan plant employs 305 people. It employed as many as
700 people 10 years ago, when P&amp;G manufactured Pampers diapers
there.
   The company wanted to sell the plant and transfer the
manufacture of its liners and briefs to other P&amp;G plants, said
spokeswoman Sue Hale at corporate headquarters in Cincinnati.
   ``There are some savings in distribution, overhead and such
costs,'' she said of the planned sale. ``It was purely an economic
move.''
   The company will stop making the tissue for diapers altogether,
buying it on the open market instead. ``Basically we were able to
identify a supplier that we could obtain the tissue from at a
savings,'' Hale said.
   Baker said design changes over the years have reduced the amount
of tissue needed in each diaper, reducing demand and making it
cheaper to buy than make.
   Mosinee, which produces industrial tissue and towel products and
specialty papers, uses different raw materials and sells to a
different market, Baker said.
   The sale will be final in March 1990 but P&amp;G will continue
manufacturing there until the fall of 1990, Baker said. No sale
price was disclosed.
   The sale hinges on Mosinee reaching a labor agreement with the
United Paperworkers International union, which has a contract with
P&amp;G that expires this fall. No negotiations have begun.
   Before the sale is final, Mosinee also must receive state
permits to discharge treated water into the Cheboygan River.
   The paper mill opened in 1906 and has had a long succession of
owners, including the Simplicity Pattern Co. and the Charmin Paper
Co.

<HEAD>Circle K Looking for Buyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp.'s chairman says he may try to buy
out the convenience-store chain, but analysts say Karl Eller's
announcement may have been a ploy to encourage early bidding from
others.
   The Phoenix-based company announced Monday it was looking for
buyers, and Eller, chairman and chief operating officer, advised
Circle K's board of directors he may attempt a leveraged buyout.
   ``I'm sure there's some poker involved here,'' said Dennis
Telzrow, vice president of research at Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner
Inc., in Dallas.
   Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc., in
Baltimore, said Eller's announcement ``creates a sense of urgency
in the minds of any potential buyer of Circle K. If they want to
buy circle K, they'd better step up to the plate now.''
   Circle K's profits have fallen, and the company's long-term debt
is nearly $1 billion, caused by agressive expansion, the Arizona
Business Gazette reported Monday.
   Since Eller became chairman in 1983, the company has grown from
1,221 stores in 11 states to a total of 4,687 outlets in 33 states.
Only 450 of those were built by Circle K, the rest were purchased
in a series of acquisitions.
   The company bought several smaller convenience-store chains
between 1983 and 1986, then last year acquired 473 7-Eleven stores
from Dallas-based Southland Corp., incurring a $170 million debt.
   It also last year acquired 538 Charter Marketing Co. convenience
stores for $70 million in cash and a new issue of convertible
preferred stock.
   To finance the buys, the company negotiated a $500 million loan,
$250 million in long-term financing and $250 million in a revolving
credit line, with a group of banks.
   The company said in a statement Monday that it had received some
interest in possible acquisitions but no specific offers.
   Analysts disagreed on whether Circle K likely would be bought by
a major oil company. Of the 4,687 convenience stores the company
operates, 3,600 have gas pumps.
   Circle K's statement also said the company would continue to
study possible dispositions of selected assets and other ways of
gaining capital.
   A statement from the company said the loss comes from pressure
on gasoline and general merchandise margins during the first two
months of the year.
   Circle K operates 4,687 convenience stores in 33 states and more
than 1,000 licensed or joint venture operations in 11 foreign
countries.

<HEAD>Pan Am Pursues Financing for Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. continues to seek financing to
acquire Northwest Airlines' parent company, but has decided not to
sign an agreement that would give it access to NWA Inc.'s financial
records.
   The confidentiality agreement, which provides would-be suitors
with sensitive data in exchange for a pledge not to accumulate
stock or talk with labor, was too restrictive, Pan Am Chairman
Thomas G. Plaskett said Monday in a letter delivered to the NWA
board.
   A Pan Am spokesperson said Plaskett believes that, as a
competitor, his airline already has sufficient knowledge of
Northwest's operation and financial condition to make a judgment
about a possible offer. Industry experts estimate that it will take
approximately $3.5 billion to acquire Northwest.
   Pan Am remains free to meet with Northwest Airlines' unions _
whose cooperation is considered key to any successful bid _ and
retains the option to pursue a hostile tender, in which it would
offer to buy all outstanding shares of NWA's stock.
   Pan Am says it will continue to cooperate with NWA's bidding
procedure, which sets a May 30 deadline for offers to buy the
company.
   ``We fully intend to adhere to their timetable,'' Pan Am
spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   She also said Plaskett does not intend to meet with Northwest's
unions ``unless he has the approval and permission of Northwest.''
   Meanwhile, Plaskett embarked on a cross-country trip Monday
night to round up potential investors for Pan Am's bid to acquire
Northwest.
   Plaskett's attempt to acquire Northwest is considered a long
shot, but having the support of labor or an agreement that would
minimize merger disruptions would make it easier for Pan Am to
obtain financial commitments from lenders.
   At least one other potential bidder, a group led by Los Angeles
investor Al Checchi, has indicated a desire to speak to the
company's unions. Checchi's group, however, has signed the
confidentiality agreement that prohibits it from making such
contact.
   On Wall Street, Northwest's stock jumped $1.75 a share to
$103.87{ Monday amid a growing sense that bids for the company
would be in the $110 to $115 range. Pan Am's stock dropped 12{
cents to $4.37{.
   Pan Am executives and Prudential-Bache Securities, the company's
financial adviser, will be in the Twin Cities on Wednesday to try
to interest investment and money management firms in the interim
financing needed to swing a purchase.
   Mike Hamilton, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in
Minneapolis, attributed the rise in NWA stock to the distribution
of the offering circular for Pan Am's interim financing to the
investment community, and to ``some speculation that Pan Am may be
moving towards a hostile tender.''
   But Hamilton said that if Pan Am does decide to make a bid, its
chances are slim whether it is friendly or hostile. Analysts have
pointed out that while a combination of Pan Am and Northwest would
create a megacarrier with few overlapping routes, Pan Am's
financial troubles make it an unattractive suitor.
   Pan Am said last week that its principal backers, Prudential
Bache and the Airlie Group, are willing to invest at least $400
million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amerada Hess Corp. has agreed to buy most of
Transco Exploration Partners Ltd.'s offshore properties in the Gulf
of Mexico for $911 million in cash.
   The sale, announced on Monday, includes 41 gas fields and three
oil fields off Louisiana and Texas as well as shore-based support
facilities and a gas supply contract.
   Amerada Hess said the proved or probable reserves in the fields
are estimated at 518 billion cubic feet of natural gas and more
than 12 million barrels of oil. That is expected to increase the
company's total gas reserves by about 25 percent and oil holdings
by 6 percent.
   ``The acquisition ... provides the company with highly promising
exploration potential in areas close to existing production,''
Amerada Hess said in a statement.
   But Wall Street didn't share Amerada Hess' enthusiasm, with some
analysts saying the company paid a premium for the properties.
Amerada Hess closed down $1.37{ to $38.37{ a share in composite
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Transco Exploration Partners soared $3.75 to close at $9.50 on
the NYSE.

   The stock market opened sharply lower in
moderate trading today amid a wave of uncertainty in the currency
markets and after a stronger-than-expected rise in durable goods
orders.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.37 points to
2,490.65 after 30 minutes of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly 2
to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 672 issues down, 323 up
and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.3 million shares.
   Analysts said a combination of factors, including today's report
on durable goods orders and ongoing turmoil in the currency markets
weakened stock prices.
   The Commerce Department reported today that orders to factories
for ``big-ticket'' durable goods such as aircraft surged 2.9
percent in April, the strongest increase in four months. In March,
durable goods orders rose just 1 percent.
   ``The figure was above street expectations,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It
suggests the economy is picking up steam again. If it gets too
strong it raises inflationary fears again.''
   Rumors also circulated in the market that Japan might raise its
discount rate to strengthen the yen against the rising dollar and
that the U.S. Federal Reserve might ease credit to help deflate the
American currency.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.58 to 178.77.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
0.92 to 352.06.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average, surpassed the 2,500
level on Friday for the first time since Oct. 13, 1987, added 0.92

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 824 up, 691 down and 481 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 185.01 million shares, against 242.41

<HEAD>Thrifty Agrees to Acquire Snappy Car Rental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thrifty Rent-A-Car System Inc., which is in
an agreement to be acquired by Chrysler Corp., has agreed to buy
Ohio-based Snappy Car Rental Inc. for $40 million.
   Chrysler financed part of the Snappy acquisition announced
Monday, said Meloyde Blancett-Scott, spokeswoman for Thrifty.
   The automaker said last week it had agreed to acquire the
Tulsa-based Thrifty for $263 million.
   ``Snappy Car Rental has an excellent name and reputation in the
insurance replacement segment of the car rental industry and will
continue to operate separately under the Snappy brand name,'' said
Thrifty Chairman William E. Lobeck Jr.
   Snappy specializes in insurance replacement rentals and employs
about 1,600 people.
   Founded in 1973, Snappy has 20,000 cars operating from 250
locations. After reporting profits for five years, Snappy expects
to report a net loss of $134 million for its fiscal year ended
March 31.
   The loss was primarily because of its activity in the airport
segment of the daily car rental market, Ms. Blancett-Scott said.
The company is refocusing on the insurance replacement market.
   ``What that means is that if you wreck your car and your
insurance company agrees to a replacement while your car is being
repaired, it would come from Snappy,'' Ms. Blancett-Scott said.
   ``In the daily rental market, the customer typically wants a new
car and they want to be able to pick it up 24 hours a day,'' she
said.
   In the car replacement market, she said people generally accept
older cars, and the rates are 35 percent to 50 percent less than
the daily rate.
   Thrifty is the fifth largest car rental network in North America
in number of locations, with more than 650 locations in 23
countries and an average fleet size of more than 33,000 vehicles.
   No date has been set for completion of the Snappy acquisition,
Ms. Blancett-Scott said.

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Prices rose on speculation by traders that yesterday's selloff
was overdone, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The U.S. dollar's rally of the past few weeks sparked a selloff
of all commodities Monday, amid concerns overseas sales of grain
will be choked off by the dollar's rise in value.
   A weaker dollar this morning added some support corn and soybean
prices.
   Soybean futures went up after the Agriculture Department
released figures today showing the April soybean crush lagged
behind the pace set for the month a year ago.
   Rumors that China is interested in buying U.S. wheat sent wheat
futures higher.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.95\ a bushel; corn was a { cent
to 1\ cent lower with July at $2.65} a bushel; oats were a { cent
to } cent lower with July at $1.74\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
to 3 cents higher with July at $6.95{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .38 cent higher with June at 70.77
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with
May at 77.15 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with June at 49 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75
cent to 1.80 higher with May at 36.60 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower Monday.

   Schindler Group, one of the world's largest
elevator manufacturers, said Tuesday it will close its Toledo plant
by the end of the year.
   The Schindler Elevator Corp., a Schindler Group subsidiary,
employs 100 people in its factory and about 250 people in service
and other related jobs here, she said.
   Lynn Cullen, Schindler spokeswoman, said she doesn't know how
many of the 350 workers will lose their jobs, but said some will be
offered jobs at other plants.
   ``All of the (factory) employees are being considered for
transfers either to the service-based business in Toledo or to
Schindler operations elsewhere,'' she said.
   Schindler will keep some other Toledo operations here, though
some may be scaled back, she said.
   Schindler, based in Morristown, N.J., also said that as
previously planned, a plant in Randolph, N.J. would be closed at
the end of 1990.
   Schindler Elevator was founded here in 1867 as Haughton Elevator
Co. After several changes of ownership, it was bought by Schindler
in 1979.
   Schindler is based in Ebikon, Switzerland, and is Europe's
largest and the world's second largest manufacturer of elevators
and escalators, with approximately $1.5 billion in 1988 sales. The
company employs more than 27,000 people worldwide, including 7,000
in North America.

represent 2,400 production and maintenance workers at Nissan's only
U.S. plant.
   Two workers said they were told they could not see the ``Log
200'' records even though they showed a supervisor the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration regulations that said they had
that right.
   Thomas Grooms, Nissan's manager of employee relations, was
ordered to release the records after a union lawyer complained,
Nancy McNulty, spokeswoman for the state labor department, said
today.
   ``We instructed him that according to state law they are
required to provide availability to any employee, former employee
or to their representatives for examination and copying in a
reasonable manner at reasonable times,'' she said.
   Nissan has 30 days to respond to the order, Ms. McNulty said.
   Gail O. Neuman, Nissan vice president of human resources and
chief legal counsel, said earlier that Nissan would decide within a
month whether to release the records.
   The union said it has its reasons for examining the logs.
   ``We'd like to identify the areas where they're having the most
injuries so that when we win this election, we can go in there and
negotiate over that,'' said Jim Weaver, international UAW
representative and coordinator of the Nissan campaign.
   Nissan and the UAW differ sharply over worker safety. The union
says high assembly line speed causes carpal tunnel syndrome _
injuries to nerves and tendons in the hand and wrist _ along with
back and shoulder injuries.
   Ms. Neuman cited the latest National Safety Council figures,
which show an automotive industry average illness and injury rate
of 25.8 per 100 workers in 1987. Nissan's rate was 8.9 per 100
during that period.
   UAW spokesman Maxey Irwin said workers need to examine the Log
200 records to make sure Nissan is reporting all its injuries.
   ``They're ignoring these employees,'' Irwin said. ``They want to
feel that they can go to work and leave there without being
mutilated.''
   The UAW filed a qualifying petition Thursday asking the National
Labor Relations Board to conduct an election to determine if
Nissan's hourly workers want to be represented by the UAW.

<TEXT>
   Deere &amp; Co. said Tuesday its second-quarter
profit climbed 51 percent to its highest level for any quarter in
the company's 152-year history, citing signs of recovery in the
farm economy.
   The farm tractor and agricultural implement manufacturer said it
earned $130.5 million, or $1.74 a share, for the quarter ended
April 30, compared with $86.4 million, or $1.15 a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose 15 percent to $1.67 billion from
$1.45 billion.
   Deere's previous record for quarterly income was $108.4 million
in the second quarter of 1979.
   Deere spokesman Robert J. Combs said ``the farm economy
continues to show signs of recovery and we feel good about that.''
   ``We had higher production volumes worldwide and our sales
increased. We also had better price realization because there was
less price discounting going on,'' he said.
   For the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, Deere reported
earnings of $178.9 million, or $2.39 per share, up 16.2 percent
from earnings of $153.9 million, or $2.14 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 13 percent to $2.81 billion from $2.50
billion a year earlier.
   Deere leads the United States in farm tractor and agricultural
implement manufactufing and is a major competitor in the industrial
equipment market. It has major factories in Illinois, Iowa,
Tennessee, Wisconsin and New Jersey, and in seven countries outside
the United States. Smaller Deere facilities are in several other
states.

<HEAD>State Farm Accused Of Building Up Too Big A Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney contends in a lawsuit that State
Farm has built up too big a surplus in premium dollars and asks the
court to order the company to return $6.9 billion to its customers
nationwide.
   William Shernoff, a former president of the California Trial
Lawyers Association who frequently appears in court against
insurers, filed the lawsuit Monday in Superior Court.
   He contends that Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm holds nearly
$1 in surplus for every premium dollar, far in excess of what he
calls the industry standard of about $1 in surplus for every $2 in
premiums.
   ``State Farm ... is pursuing a bizarre policy of accumulating
more and more surplus by refusing to distribute reasonable
dividends and by plowing its extra premium and investment income
back into the surplus, thus compounding the problem,'' said
Shernoff.
   But State Farm had recently rebutted suggestions it was holding
too large a surplus in California, suggesting that distributing
surplus funds would only mean higher insurance prices later.
   ``That's about all we can say at this point,'' Jim Stahly, a
spokesman for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., said
Tuesday, adding that the company had not received the lawsuit.
``It's difficult to defend on a point-by-point basis until we see
something like that.''
   He said that as a mutual company, State Farm is owned by its
policyholders, so cannot go to stockholders to expand.
   He did say that the ``surplus'' label of the fund does not mean
``excess'' or ``unnecessary,'' but is held to protect policyholders.
   Insurance companies hold funds in surplus against the
eventuality of claims.

   The stock market was lower in afternoon trading
today, pressured by a number of factors, including uncertainty in
the currency markets and concern about the economy's growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.17 points to
2,481.85 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was down 14.30
points at noon EDT.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 3 to
2 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 867 issues down, 571 up and
503 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.76 million shares.
   Analysts said a combination of factors, including today's
government report on durable goods orders and concern about the
direction of the dollar helped weaken stock prices.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for
``big-ticket'' durable goods such as aircraft climbed 2.9 percent
in April, the strongest increase in four months. In March, durable
goods orders rose just 1 percent.
   Analysts said the figure exceeded the 1 percent rise expected by
the market and provided further evidence of strength in the U.S.
industrial sector despite some weakness in other areas.
   ``It suggests the economy is picking up steam again. If it gets
too strong it raises inflationary fears again,'' Hildegarde
Zagorski, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, backed off from Monday's levels
against the Japanese yen and West German mark amid speculation that
Japan might raise its discount rate and that the U.S. Federal
Reserve might ease credit to help deflate the American currency.
   ``The more important overriding factor in the equity market is
the dollar and how it's gotten out of hand,'' said Thomas Walsh,
head of equity trading for Nikko Securities International.
   Analysts said political turmoil in China, Panama and other
countries was also impacting the market.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<HEAD>Coleco Nearing Sale to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. officials declined comment
Tuesday on published reports that Hasbro, the world's biggest
toymaker, would buy most of Coleco Industries Inc. under a plan to
be presented in bankruptcy court.
   The Hartford Courant said Tuesday that sources close to
Avon-based Coleco's 10-month-old bankruptcy case told the newspaper
that details of the plan still were being negotiated.
   Barry Alperin, executive vice president of Hasbro Inc., declined
to comment on the report, saying the companies were forbidden from
discussing the case in public by an order last month from U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   A secretary for Coleco's chairman, Morton Handel, said he would
be away from his office all day. She declined to say where he could
be contacted.
   Representatives of Hasbro, Coleco and Coleco's creditors are
scheduled to appear Wednesday in bankruptcy court in New York to
discuss the plan.
   The deal expected to be announced Wednesday would strengthen
Hasbro's position in the toy business by adding such well-known
Coleco items as Cabbage Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games to its product lines.
   While many details are unknown, sources told The Courant that
the deal would provide that:
   _Much of Coleco would be sold to Hasbro, but it could not be
determined whether Pawtucket, R.I.-based company would buy all of
Coleco or just most of its assets. If Coleco is sold, it would end
57 years as an independent company.
   _Coleco's committee of unsecured creditors would drop its $71
million lawsuit against the company's largest creditors, New York
businessmen Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.
   _Perlmutter and Marden, in turn, would reduce their $80 million
claim against Coleco by an undetermined amount.
   The lawsuit contends that Perlmutter and Marden, who are secured
creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars through a
complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products.
   The deal would be a victory for Coleco's unsecured creditors,
because a reduced claim by Perlmutter and Marden means more money
would be available to repay them, the newspaper said. Coleco had
debts of $540.3 million when it filed for protection from its
creditors under the bankruptcy laws in July.
   Coleco grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies
during the past decade, propelled in large part by its Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls.
   But demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and Coleco
was not successful at introducing new products to make up for the
lost sales. The company sought Bankruptcy Court protection last
year.
   Coleco filed its first reorganization plan in late January,
detailing how it planned to repay creditors. But that proposal
immediately was rejected by the creditors' committee, which said it
provided inadequate payment and appeared to favor Perlmutter and
Marden's interests over the committee's.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering selling the company
outright to resolve its financial problems.
   A few weeks later, however, the company reversed itself and said
it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a
larger repayment to creditors, consisting of about 10 cents for
every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   Coleco had not yet filed that new plan with the Bankruptcy Court
when creditors announced April 19 that they had negotiated a deal
to sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday in subdued trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as
the market continues to be influenced by the weather and the steady
rise in the value of the dollar.
   Improving weather and slack demand for corn and soybeans are
affecting prices, said Rich Feltes, an analyst for Refco Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``As the value of the dollar rose, soybeans broke more,'' said
Feltes of today's action in the pits. ``Whether the connection with
the dollar is real or psychological, it is having an effect. But
the weather continues to have the most influence on prices.''
   The dollar's rally of the past few weeks sparked a selloff of
all commodities Monday, amid concerns overseas sales of grain will
be choked off by the dollar's rise in value.
   Prices rose in early trading on a belief that Monday's selloff
was a little bit overdone, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   A weaker dollar early Tuesday provided some support to corn and
soybean prices at the start of trading. But prices trailed off on
prospects of further rain in crop areas.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.95 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 4 cents lower with July at $2.64} a bushel; oats were a { cent
to 1{ cents lower with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 8
cents lower to 5} cents higher with July at $6.99 a bushel.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says US Will Continue Subsidizing Farm Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will continue to subsidize sales
of farm products under its export enhancement program so it can
keep up with the European Community, U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   The subsidies are paid on sales made under the export
enhancement program and ``they are the best way to deal with the
European Community subsidies,'' Yeutter told reporters after a
meeting with Agriculture Minister Don Mazankowski. The ministers
hold several meetings every year.
   Earlier this month, the United States announced the subsidized
sale of 300,000 tons of wheat to the Soviet Union. The sales could
eventually reach 1.5 million tons.
   Canadian officials suggested the sale violated at least the
spirit of an agreement by member countries of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT as the international trade referee is
usually called. The agreement covers principles for an
international agriculture trade code.
   The agreement called on members not to increase subsidized sales.
   Yeutter said the United States ``doesn't like export subsidies
more than anyone else. While we hope we'll be able to stop using
them, we don't have a lot of choice for now but to live with them.
Otherwise we would be handing all of the world trade to the
Europeans on a platter.''
   Canada has been campaigning against subsidized sales of farm
goods because it can't afford to match the subsidies and because
they tend to lower prices Canadian farmers can get for their
exports.
   Mazankowski said he also raised objections to a new
countervailing duty on Canadian pork shipments to the United States
and defended new Canadian import restrictions on ice cream and
yogurt.
   Mazankowski said he told Yeutter that the basis of the decision
to slap a duty on shipments of Canadian fresh, chilled and frozen
pork goes against GATT principles.
   Mazankowski said that if the duty isn't dropped, Canada will
take the case to GATT.

   Stock prices declined today amid uncertainty
about the dollar, interest rates and the economy's growth.
   The stock market opened lower after a stronger-than-expected
durable goods report for April that suggested the pace of economic
growth might not be slowing as predicted.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for
``big-ticket'' durable goods such as airplanes climbed 2.9 percent
in April, the strongest increase in four months. In March, durable
goods orders rose just 1 percent, a figure the market expected to
be repeated last month.
   Analysts said the report provided further evidence that the U.S.
industrial sector is strong despite some weakness in other areas.
   ``The figure was above street expectations,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It
suggests the economy is picking up steam again. If it gets too
strong it raises inflationary fears again.''
   Traders said the report raised concern that inflation also could
mean the Federal Reserve would not move to ease credit anytime soon.
   The recent strong rise in the dollar had led to speculation that
the Fed might lower interest rates to stem the currency's upward
momentum.
   A decline in the dollar could lead to lower stock prices because
it would dampen demand by foreign investors for dollar-denominated
assets.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board laid
the major blame today on Aloha Airlines' maintenance program for
failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old
Boeing 737 that split open over Hawaii slightly more than a year
ago.
   After a daylong meeting, the board concluded that Aloha's
management failed to supervise maintenance of its aging fleet
properly. The board also blamed the Federal Aviation Administration
for improperly assessing the airline's inspection program and
issuing inadequate orders for ensuring the safety of older
airliners.
   The board said Aloha's maintenance operations failed ``to detect
the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage'' on the
surface of the fuselage.
   The board criticized the FAA for failing to order replacement of
rivets along joints in the 737's outer skin much earlier than it
did.
   Board member Joseph Nall dissented from the five-member board's
decision, saying he wanted blame to be more widely spread for the
failure of the aviation system to deal earlier with the problem of
aging airliners.
   Earlier today, metallurgist James Wildey told the board that a
3-foot-by-4-foot piece of metal skin from the airplane showed it
had been repaired but still contained cracks that were missed by
airline mechanics before the April 28, 1988, accident.
   The accident has led to sweeping changes, including required
replacements of parts, in the maintenance of airliner fleets
worldwide.
   A stewardess was killed when she was sucked out through an
18-foot hole in the plane's fuselage, but the pilot managed to land
the airline safely at Kahului Airport on Maui with 94 other people
aboard. Sixty-one passengers and crew members were injured. The
plane had been flying at 24,000 feet en route from Hilo to Honolulu
when the section of fuselage ripped off.
   Wildey, a board staff member, said evidence showed that
inspection for possible cracks by airline mechanics, required on
all early 737s, was ``either not performed or performed
ineffectively.''
   ``The piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue
cracks that were underneath the repair patches, between the repair
patches and on either side of the repair patches,'' Wildey said.
   Chief investigator Barry Trotter described the harrowing
incident, saying ``the captain observed that the cockpit-cabin door
was gone, and there was blue sky where the ceiling had been.''
   He said the board staff drew up 24 recommendations arising from
the accident for airlines, Boeing and the FAA. The recommendations
were not disclosed immediately.
   The safety board staff examined the role of metal fatigue,
aircraft design, the airlines' maintenance program, crew
performance and FAA directives affecting the aircraft, which had
logged nearly 90,000 flights.
   The Aloha investigation, which was kept confidential up to
today's meeting, was based on inspection of the plane, interviews,
public hearings and other data.
   The accident focused worldwide attention on the issue of aging
airliners and led to several FAA orders for inspections and
modifications. The average age of in-service airliners exceeds 13
years, and jetliners are rarely retired as the demand for air
travel increases and orders for new jets have to be made years in
advance.
   A series of FAA directives stepping up inspections and ordering
some modifications of older aircraft followed the Aloha incident.
   The FAA cited the accident last week when it issued a
far-reaching series of airworthiness directives changing the way
all older Boeing-built airliners will be kept safe. The directives
give airlines four years to replace parts and make other
modifications on Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s that either reach 20
years of age or a set number of takeoffs for each model.
   Before the orders, which are set to become final by late summer,
were issued, airlines were required to make periodic inspections,
replacing parts only when they showed signs of excessive wear.
   Four months before the Aloha accident, an in-depth FAA
inspection found that Aloha did not have an adequate system for
complying with FAA directives and properly maintaining its planes.
   The FAA had warned airlines to check for corroding fasteners
that hold pieces of the fuselage together and had ordered close
inspection of the upper skin of the early 737s because routine
inspections had turned up cracks in some planes.
   Aloha had said it complied with FAA maintenance orders before
the incident and had found nothing unusual in inspection of the
plane that tore open.
   After the accident, investigators said they found minute cracks
where the 18-foot hole in the fuselage apparently started.

   California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association
has bought four branches of American Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Florida.
   The California institution, which already has 51 branches in
Florida, announced Tuesday it bought $74 million for the deposits
in five American Savings branches and the office buildings that
house four of the branches. The purchase price was not disclosed.
   The fifth branch building will be sold or leased separately by
American Savings.
   The staff will be kept on as the branches are switched to the
California Fededral name, said spokesman John Kaufman.
   California Federal, owned by CalFed Inc., the nation's

   American Savings, a subsidiary of Kinder-Care Inc. and Florida's
second-biggest thrift, said the branches didn't fit its stragegy of

   The raging dollar turned mixed Tuesday as
dealers cashed in profits from its recent strength and speculated
on what the United States and its trading partners might do next to
stabilize foreign exchange rates.
   Traders reported more dollar selling from the Federal Reserve
and central banks in Britain and Japan, but they said that once
again the market ignored the intervention.
   ``The market is sort of catching its breath here ... but there's
still very strong sentiment behind the dollar even though we're
seeing a pause right now,'' said William P. Sterling, an
international economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The slight retrenchment of the dollar against some key
currencies helped push up most interest rates in the credit markets
and weaken stock prices, analysts said.
   Gold prices were mixed in the United States, although overseas
they regained some of the steep losses that stemmed from Monday's
dollar rally. A troy ounce of gold fell $2.65 to a late bid price
of $361.85 a troy ounce, according to the Republic National Bank of
New York.
   The dollar started out strong in overnight trading, closing at
another recent high in Tokyo, but fell against most currencies in
Europe and was mixed in the United States from profit-taking and
amid speculation that Japan and the United States might be changing
their credit policies.
   Traders speculated that the Bank of Japan would soon raise its
discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to commercial
banks, and that the Fed might ease U.S. rates, both to stem the
dollar's rise.
   The market was also rife with rumors about a possible new
currency stabilization initiative by the United States and its six
major trading partners, known as the Group of Seven.
   The dollar rose sharply on Monday, smashing the 2-mark level for
the first time in 2{ years and hitting a 1{-year high vs. the yen,
due largely to perceived weakness among the G-7 in foreign-exchange
policies.
   ``The dollar cannot turn around until there are policy changes
on either side of the water,'' said Ronald H. Holzer, chief
currency dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. ``Until then
we'll be trading off the rumors.''
   But Fed governor Robert Heller said inflation remained ``a key
factor to be considered in monetary policy-making,'' and he gave no
gave indication the central bank was considering easing credit to
depress the dollar.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that durable goods shot up
2.9 percent in April, the best showing in four months and further
indication of the economy's strength.
   In London, the British pound dropped to $1.5675 from $1.5810
late Monday _ a 22-month low _ despite intervention from the Bank
of England. Sterling fetched $1.5645 in New York, up from $1.5755.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.50 Japanese yen to a closing 141.95 yen,
despite intervention by the Bank of Japan for the second
consecutive day. In Londin it traded at 141.60 yen and later in New
York at 142.30 yen, up from 142.05 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday,
included: 2.0110 West German marks, down from 2.01175; 1.7915 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7935; 1.19945 Canadian dollars, down from
1.20125; 6.8100 French francs, down from 6.8115; and 1,457.50
Italian lire, up from 1,456.50.
   Dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday: 2.0079 West
German marks, down from 2.0088; 1.7820 Swiss francs, down from
1.7922; 6.7865 French francs, down from 6.7990; 2.2570 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.2640; 1,451.50 Italian lire, down from
1,455.75; and 1.1975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1956.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $363.80 a troy ounce from $363.20 Monday.
   In London, gold jumped to a late bid price of $364.25 a troy
ounce, up from $360.75 Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $364.25 an
ounce from $359.80 Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold gained $2.76 to close at $363.97 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also gained. On New York's Comex silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.173 a troy ounce from $5.106
Monday. Silver rose sharply in London, to $5.26 an ounce from $5.14.

   Crude oil futures prices rose in brisk trading
Tuesday on speculation OPEC members may maintain their current
production levels and benchmark price.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the major grade of U.S. crude, settled at
$19.04 a 42-gallon barrel, up 43 cents. The June contract expired
Monday and finished at $20.93, with a gain of 33 cents from
Friday's close.
   Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later than July all
posted gains.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for delivery in June rose 0.52 of a cent to 47.50 cents
a gallon after falling 1.08 cents on Monday. The June contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 0.34 cent to 64.24 cents a gallon following
Monday's decline of 1.29 cents.
   Analysts said crude demand was sparked by new theories about the
possible outcome of next month's meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The latest speculation centered on the possibility the cartel
may decide against adjusting its output ceiling and altering its
$18-a-barrel benchmark price when members gather in Vienna on June
5.
   Previous reports have indicated various cartel members are
producing above their self-imposed output targets.
   Andrew Lebow, a broker with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said a comment by Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al
Sabah appeared aimed at playing down a report Monday which
suggested Kuwait might increase production unilaterally if the
cartel didn't agree to grant it a larger share of the overall
output quota.

   The stock market fell in moderate trading
Tuesday as the market took a breather amid concern about the
dollar's strength and the pace of economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 24.01 points to
finish the day at 2,478.01.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
938 issues down, 594 up and 469 unchanged.
   The stock market opened lower after a stronger-than-expected
durable goods report for April.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for
``big-ticket'' items such as aircraft and machinery climbed 2.9
percent in April, the strongest increase in four months. In March,
durable goods orders rose just 1 percent, a figure the market
expected to be repeated in April.
   The increase reflected renewed demand in all major industries
after broad-based weakness in the first quarter and despite some
slackening off in other sectors.
   ``No matter how you break it up it is a strong report,'' said
Thomas F. Carpenter, economist for ASB Capital Management. ``The
industrial sector has remained resilient to higher interest rates
... and from this point forward it is not at all clear that the
economy will weaken. In fact, it indicates the economy will firm.''
   Some analysts said, however, that the durable goods report was
an excuse for predictable profit-taking after a nine-week rally.
   ``The primary reason for the sell-off is we've come a long way
in nine weeks. The selling was not nasty; it did not get out of
hand,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, market analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc. ``It was more profit-taking and a buyers' strike.''
   Early in the day, when the U.S. currency softened slightly
against the Japanese yen and West German mark, investors worried
that a slide in the dollar could drive away foreign investors.
   But the dollar resumed its advance after midday and that helped
send prices lower.
   ``The dollar has been making people feel more comfortable,''
Goldman said. ``But now it has gotten a bit too strong. In a
vulnerable market that raises questions about what that's going to
do to the trade deficit.''
   Analysts said, however, that Tuesday's weakness reflected only a
brief pause and that the dominant trend in the stock market is
still upward.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 187.69 million
shares, up from 185.01 million in Monday's session. Except for a
few meek attempts to rally, trading activity remained moderate,
traders said.
   Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko Securities
International, said political turmoil in China and Panama also may
have impacted the market.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 226.57 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $26.585 billion, or 0.84
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.74 to 177.61.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Pan Am rose ] to 4}
amid reports that the airline, as well as other rivals, would make
a takeover offer for Northwest Airlines' parent, NWA Inc., later
this month. NWA gained 2[ to 106 and Warner Communications rose {
to 51~.
   IBM dropped ] to 109{, AT&amp;T fell 1[ to 34| and General Motors
lost 1{ to 40~.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.37 to 364.72, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 3.66 to 318.32.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market slid
1.63 to 440.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 350.96, down 2.02.

<HEAD>Gold and Silver Show Modest Price Gains</HEAD>

   The dollar showed just enough weakness early Tuesday to give a
boost to gold and silver futures prices on New York's Commodity
Exchange, but platinum prices retreated as demand for the metal
ebbs.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly lower,
livestock prices were higher and pork futures mixed, and energy
prices climbed.
   The dollar continues to exert its influence on precious metals,
but in a positive manner as gold and silver prices gained for the
first time in days.
   Gold settled 50 cents to $1.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in June at $364.30 a troy ounce; silver was 6.7 cents to 7
cents higher with May at $5.173 a troy ounce.
   ``Buying interest reflected a weaker dollar early in the day and
indications the administration may want to put a lid on the
dollar,'' said Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago. ``The dollar's comeback to be higher on the day
touched off some profit taking.''
   Platinum, particularly weak because of pressure from overseas
selling, was $8.30 to $9.10 lower with July at $489.20 a troy ounce.
   Platt said investors were disappointed the Japanese were not
doing aggressive buying of the metal, primarily used in the
manufacture of automobile pollution control devices.
   Copper prices were forced lower on the Comex on technical
trading, as prices broke through several price support levels,
triggering additional selling.
   News that Comex-approved copper warehouses increased their
stocks by 1,278 tons added to bearish sentiments on the market.
   Copper was 1.65 cents to 2.05 cents lower at $1.09 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in subdued trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market continues to be
influenced by the weather and the strong dollar.
   ``Whether the connection with the dollar is real or
psychological, it is having an effect,'' said Rich Feltes, an
analyst with Rifco Inc. in Chicago. ``But the weather continues to
have the most influence on prices.''
   The dollar's rally of the past few weeks sparked a selloff of
all commodities Monday, amid concerns overseas sales of grain will
be choked off by the dollar's rise in value.
   Wheat settled 3 cents lower to } cent higher with July at $3.95
a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with July at $2.65 a
bushel; oats were a { cent to } cent lower with July at $1.75 a
bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 6\ cents higher with
July at $6.99{ a bushel.
   Livestock prices were higher and pork futures were mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Livestock prices climbed because of the belief the market was
oversold, said Tom Morgan, an analyst for Sterling Research Corp.
in Arlington Heights.
   Pork futures received some support from Monday's Agriculture
Department monthly cold storage report that placed on-hand supplies
of frozen pork bellies at 145.3 million pounds. The total was below
trade expectations.
   Live cattle was .10 cent to .75 cent higher with June at 70.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to 43 cent higher with
May at 77.07 cents a pound; hogs were .40 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with June at 48.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.53 cent lower to .25 cent higher with May at 34.32 cents a pound.
   Energy futures were higher in moderate trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil prices advanced on reports Kuwait is in favor of an
$18-a-barrel benchmark for crude, and will not push for an increase
of its production quota, said Peter Beutel, an analyst for Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gasoline prices were higher as traders anticipate the upcoming
Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the driving season.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 11 cents to 43 cents
higher with July at $19.04 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to
.52 cent higher with June at 47.50 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.34 cent to .77 cent higher with June at 64.24 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Casino Company's Net Rose 18 Percent in Latest Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caesars World Inc. said Tuesday its profit
rose 18 percent in the latest quarter, largely because of gains at
company's Las Vegas casino-hotels.
   Caesars, which has casinos and hotels in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City and resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, said it earned
$17.4 million, or 70 cents a share, in the third quarter of its
1989 fiscal year. That was up from $14.7 million, or 60 cents a
share, in the third quarter of last year.
   Sales in the quarter ended April 30 were $221.8 million, up from
$195 million a year earlier.
   Caesars New Jersey Inc. reported third-quarter profit of $7.5
million, or 46 cents a share, up from $6.9 million, or 43 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales for the subsidiary were $80.3 million,
up from $77.9 million a year earlier.
   The biggest contributor to earnings was from Nevada operations,
which benefited from increased casino gambling and higher win
percentages for the house.
   For the first nine months of the company's 1989 year, profit
declined 16 percent to $50.5 million, or $2.05 a share, from $60
million, or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the first three
quarters were $666.4 million, up from $616.6 million a year earlier.
   Caesars earlier blamed the decline on expenses of a prize fight
_ the Sugar Ray Leonard-Donny Lalonde title match in November _ at
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Big Surge in Durable Goods Orders Knocks Bonds Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most bond prices weakened Tuesday, hurt by a
government report on surging orders for American products that
suggested the economy remains strong and inflation is still a
threat.
   Credit-market analysts said the drop in bond prices would have
been much more severe were it not for the strong dollar, which
attracts foreign capital to U.S. investments.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell about $2.50 per
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from price, rose to 8.61 percent from 8.59 percent late
Monday.
   The main reason behind lower bond prices was a Commerce
Department report that showed orders for large durable goods surged
2.9 percent in April, the biggest advance of the year.
   Despite earlier evidence of an economic slowdown, the report
resurrected some fear that the economy is growing powerfully,
creating inflationary pressures that erode the value of fixed
income securities such as bonds.
   ``That durable goods number shows the economy is still strong,''
said Carl Steen, a bond-market economist with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in New York. ``To the extent the economy remains
strong, inflation is still a problem.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell about 1-16 point, intermediate maturities fell
about \ point and long-term issues also fell about \ point, the
Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.80 to 1,154.17.
   Corporate bond prices were unchanged to slightly higher. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.59 to 314.60.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity remained virtually unchanged from Monday at 7.41 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.54 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points from the level at auction Monday to
8.26 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.76 percent as the
discount fell 3 basis points from the level at auction Monday to
8.29 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.77 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 8.14 percent.
   The rates on three- and six-month bills quoted late Monday were
for bills issued before Monday's auction. A basis point is
one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized
return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at
maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 911-16 percent, unchanged from late Monday.

   Planes and other equipment at Northwest
Airlines will be repainted in the next three years to incorporate a
new logo and color arrangement, the nation's fourth-largest carrier
said Tuesday.
   The airline will continue to paint the tails of its aircraft
red, but will add to the tails a logo of an encircled ``N'' with an
arrow pointing upward and to the left.
   The logo and color scheme, which includes bold use of red, gray,
blue and white, were unveiled at the company's hub and maintenance
base at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   The new image will be applied to employee uniforms, ticket
counters, ground equipment, and aircraft interiors and exteriors.
   Northwest Airlines Chairman Steven Rothmeier said the change is
designed to acknowlege the carrier's growth since it acquired rival
Republic Airlines in 1986.
   The chairman did not take questions about the takeover battle at
Northwest parent NWA Inc. Several groups have expressed interest in
buying the airline or investing in it, including friendly and
hostile suitors. The company is urging bidders to provide proposals
next Tuesday.
   ``We are now well-prepared for long-term growth, and it is an
appropriate time to symbolize our progress with a new look that
embodies the spirit of Northwest Airlines,'' Rothmeier said.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. announced plans
Monday to sell two companies that manage close to $3 billion of its
its domestic mutual fund assets.
   Drexel, the Wall Street investment firm rocked by securities
fraud charges, said it had reached agreements to sell Drexel
Management Corp., which manages $2.8 billion in assets, and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Management Corp. with its $181 million in assets.
   Terms of the deals were not disclosed.
   Drexel Management is being sold to a partnership of Eugene J.
Glaser, a Drexel senior vice president and marketing director, and
Martin E. Zweig, a leading money manager.
   Drexel Management is the investment advisor to Drexel Series
Trust, DBL Cash Fund Inc. and DBL Tax-Free Fund Inc.
   A group led by I.W. Burnham II, the firm's founder, has agreed
to buy the stock of Drexel Burnham Lambert Management, which
operates the Drexel Burnham Fund.
   Burnham, who will remain honorary chairman of Drexel Burnham
Group Inc., founded the fund in 1969 and has been its chairman
since 1975. The fund will take its original name, the Burnham Fund,
and is expected to be distributed through broker-dealers.
   Drexel recently sold a portion of its retail brokerage

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special Exxon Corp. legal committee has named
former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell to head an investigation
into the Alaska oil spill, according to a published report.
   Bell's task will be to try to determine responsibility for the
accident and recommend to Exxon's board whether lawsuits should be
filed against former or current Exxon officials.
   ``I'm going to interview everyone who knows anything about the
spill,'' Bell was quoted as saying in Tuesday's editions of the
Wall Street Journal.
   Bell's investigation is expected to begin in about three weeks
and include questioning of Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl about
the nation's worst oil spill.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24 and spilled 10.9
million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Exxon says it has spent nearly $100 million trying to clean up
the oil that has stained hundreds of miles of Alaska's southern
coastline and killed thousands of animals.
   The ship's former captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was indicted by a
grand jury Monday on three felony counts for his role in the spill.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and
a $150,000 fine.
   Exxon's board set up the three-member litigation committee of
outside directors after receiving letters from shareholders'
attorneys calling for such a probe.
   Rawl told the Journal in an interview that he expected to
cooperate with the Bell investigation.
   Bell, who served in the administration of former President Jimmy
Carter, in 1985 conducted a similar inquiry into a check-kiting
scandal at E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. Bell found that senior managers
weren't involved.
   Hutton eventually pleaded guilty to 2,000 counts of check-kiting
and agreed to pay $2.75 million in fines and legal fees.
