   Authorities said they
will cut off water and food to heavily armed rebellious convicts
and about 600 family members inside a besieged prison if no accord
is reached Wednesday.
   Negotiations with the inmates stalled Tuesday night as food for
the nearly 2,000 people in the prison complex grew scarce.
   ``We're at an impasse,'' the Rev. Antonio Lopez Martin, chaplain
of Guatemalan prisons and one of the negotiators, told journalists
upon leaving the prison after dark.
   The rebellion began on Easter Sunday, and prison spokesman
Conrado Monroy said Tuesday night that as many as 12 people may
have been killed. The inmates armed themselves with carbines taken
from the prison armory.
   Authorities had removed seven bodies from the grounds _ those of
four guards and three convicts _ by Tuesday. About 20 people were
wounded.
   Prisoners told negotiators three bodies remained on prison
grounds and inmates buried two others after the fighting, Monroy
said.
   About 20 inmates not among the rebels were shipped to another
jail Tuesday. They were seen leaving the prison, handcuffed by
twos, and placed on a bus.
   Another six visitors who had been inside the prison since the
Sunday afternoon uprising also made their way out Tuesday.
   Gonzalo Menendez de la Riva, special attorney general for human
rights, indicated the main stumbling block in talks between
government representatives and inmates was government unwillingness
or inability to assure prisoners pardons for acts since seizing the
Pavon prison farm, 14 miles east of Guatemala City.
   He said that the prisoners have the right to ask for pardons,
but the government is not in a position to award pardons.
   Rebels also have demanded reduced sentences, better food and
treatment and new prison management.
   Menendez gave the prison rebels a government promise not to beat
or kill the rebellious prisoners and to intercede on their behalf
with the Supreme Court, which can offer judicial pardons.
   Monroy said Tuesday night that if the rebels do not accept the
offer Wednesday, water and food will be cut off.
   He said much food was delivered Monday night, but it is almost
all gone because of the large number of people inside.
   President Vinicio Cerezo said the 1,000 or more soldiers and
police ringing the prison had orders to use force ``only if the
prisoners try to shoot their way out.''
   About 600 Easter visitors, including hundreds of women and
children, have remained inside since the takeover.
   Cerezo said Tuesday that drug traffickers may have sponsored the
rebellion by up to 100 inmates who took over the central buildings
of the 2{-square-mile prison farm.
   Authorities say the mutinous prisoners took over about 65
percent of the facility, including most important buildings. Lopez
said the rebel leader was a military man who wore a hood and gave
orders to the other mutineers.
   Pavon was designed for 800 inmates but now holds more than 1,350.
   ``They are desperate,'' the Rev. Jose Maria Varela said of the
rebels when he left the facility.
   He said inmates told him any negotiator who returned without an
acceptable government offer would be taken hostage.
   ``They are criminals who killed people and committed that same
violent crime during the uprising,'' he told reporters in the
capital.
   Cerezo said, ``There was probably a certain sum of money paid in
the effort to gain access to the weapons and try a massive escape
in which prisoners convicted of drug trafficking would take part,
but that was frustrated. No prison guard personnel were involved in
the plot.''
   He said traffickers involved in a shipment of cocaine seized in
Amatique Bay in 1987 were part of the rebellion.
   Authorities disagreed whether visitors still inside were
hostages or were there to support and protect the rebels.
   Lopez said he considered most of them ``virtual hostages.''
   ``Though some are there by choice, the rebellious prisoners know
they (the family members) are their protection,'' he said. ``They
know that once they are gone, the armed forces could try to retake
the facility.''
   Carlos Ramos Moncada, inspector general of prisons, told The
Associated Press he believed the visitors stayed of their own free
will.
   Esmirla Cheti, 19, walked out Tuesday with her nephew Edgar, 13.
She said they were visiting a friend when the uprising began, and
stayed voluntarily.
   ``But we were also afraid about what might happen if we tried to
leave,'' she told reporters. ``We were going to leave last night,
but they (the prisoners) told us to wait until morning.''

   A Palestinian sought by the United States
for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner was convicted Tuesday of
keeping makeshift knives in his jail cell and sentenced to eight
months in prison.
   Mohammed Rashid, 39, has been jailed in Piraeus since his arrest
last May. The U.S. request for his extradition is still awaiting a
decision by the Supreme Court.
   A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 people were injured when
a bomb exploded aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet over Hawaii. The plane
manged to land despite the hole in the fuselage.
   In its verdict Tuesday the three-member court of appeals gave
Rashid the option of paying a $620 fine instead of serving the
eight-month sentence.
   Greece's Supreme Court has twice delayed a decision on the U.S.
extradition petition.
   The sentence for illegal possession of weapons could further
delay any action on the extradition issue if Rashid chooses not to
pay the fine. He would have to serve the jail sentence before he
could be sent to the United States.
   Rashid's lawyer, Spyros Fitrakis, told the court his client
``will remain jailed regardless of this decision as he is still
waiting for the Supreme Court decision.''
   Rashid claims his real name is Mohammed Hamdan and that he is an
officer in the military branch of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The PLO has provided him with a translator and has
supported him since his arrest at the Athens airport.
   He told reporters during the trial: ``I am innocent and am not a
terrorist. It is the U.S. Congress that thinks I am and is putting
pressure on Greece to send me there.''
   The illegal weapons charge was filed against Rashid after knives
were found by prison guards during a search of cells on Feb. 17.
Rashid was acquitted at an earlier trial, but Piraeus District
Attorney Antonis Roussos took the case to the appeals court.
   ``We find him guilty of illegal weapons possession but grant him
a few mitigating circumstances,'' said Judge Antonis Papatheodorou
before announcing the sentence.
   The judge said the court found that Rashid ``held onto the
weapons because he honestly felt he feared for his life. He felt he
was under threat.''

<HEAD>Texas Air Board Meets, Possible Deals on Table</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with New York Times report on Ueberroth
offer, TWA board meeting, picks up 6th graf, `The union ...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. directors met Tuesday and were
expected to consider offers to buy strike-crippled Eastern
Airlines, sources said.
   Peter V. Ueberroth, whose term as baseball commissioner ends
Saturday, may offer $300 million to $500 million during the meeting
that ends Wednesday, said baseball and airline industry sources.
Takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn hoped union concessions would
persuade Eastern creditors to let him take control.
   Ueberroth's offer will be for $512 milllion, would be financed
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and would give Eastern's unions a 30
percent stake in the airline in exchange for wage concessions, The
New York Times reported Wednesday.
   Sources said substantive discussions in the regularly scheduled
meetings probably wouldn't get under way until Wednesday. Texas Air
spokesman Art Kent in Houston said the company wouldn't comment on
whether a meeting was being held.
   ``There are a lot of those rumors going around,'' Kent said.
   Indications of Ueberroth's interest came as Icahn, owner and
chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., resumed talks with Eastern's
unions about a possible takeover. Icahn hoped to win concessions,
said Brian Freeman, an investment banker with close ties to the
Machinists union.
   TWA's board of directors met later Tuesday, union sources said.
   The union struck March 4, and support from pilots has virtually
grounded the Miami-based airline. A federal judge in Miami
scheduled a hearing Thursday on Eastern's efforts to force its
rebellious pilots back to work.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Harold Jones, administering
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization in New York, said he was
interviewing about a dozen candidates for Eastern bankruptcy
examiner. He hoped to recommend a candidate to U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Judge Burton Lifland by early next week.
   The list of possible examiners for Eastern, which filed for
protection from creditors on March 9, includes former Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci and top securities fraud lawyer Leon
Silverman, sources close to the situation said.
   Jones declined to name the candidates under consideration. Any
proposed sale of Eastern would have to be approved by the
bankruptcy court, he said, and added that Ueberroth is ``an
interesting force to bring into the mixture.''
   Ueberroth was approached last fall by Eastern's unions to
consider taking over the airline. The unions have said they would
make concessions if Ueberroth took over, possibly in return for
part ownership.
   Eastern's demand for $125 million in concessions triggered the
strike.
   Silverman, who represented some claimants in Manville Corp.'s
Chapter 11 proceeding starting in August 1982, also is a lead
attorneys for imprisoned inside trader Ivan F. Boesky.
   Carlucci is vice chairman and managing director of The Carlyle
Group, an investment banking firm in Washington.
   Both men have declined to comment on the Eastern situation.
   In Miami, Eastern previewed its first post-strike pilot training
class. The six-week course began Monday with fewer students than
the airline projected.
   ``They had more or less hinted around that they were going to
have 50 pilots, but in reality only 35 people showed up,'' Air Line
Pilots Association spokesman Hank Weber said in Miami. ``That's a
drop in the bucket.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said there were only about 35
people, but that it was mainly because of difficulties in
relocating pilots to Miami.

<HEAD>Hearing Set in May on Case</HEAD>

   Employees in the Executive Office of the
President will have a hearing in a federal court in May on their
suit charging that mandatory random drug tests are unnecessary and
unconstitutional.
   A hearing had been scheduled in U.S. District Court here for
next month but, at the request of the government, it was postponed
until May 11 so that the Justice Department could review a ruling
by the Supreme Court last week.
   The White House has agreed not to start testing until 10 days
after the hearing, if it is not prevented to do so by the court.
   Jeffrey F. Liss, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represents the employees, said from Kansas City on Monday night
that the Supreme Court decision did not answer the questions
involved in the White House case.
   ``It is clear that the court has left for another day the
determination of the constitutionality of random testing,'' he said.
   The court allowed the government to test railroad workers after
accidents and applicants for U.S. Customs Service jobs involving
drug interdiction.
   In early January, 30 White House employees sued President Bush
to block the testing, one of more than 50 suits filed
government-wide to stop the urine sample, drug tests.
   Although former President Ronald Reagan issued an executive
office two-and-one-half years ago, tests have not yet to begin in
the White House complex.
   The White House plans to test 1,520 of 1,850 employees in the
agencies that make up the Executive Office of the President such as
the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council,
the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental
Quality and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
   Liss sald, ``These are extremely loyal people, loyal to the
president and loyal to government administration.
   ``They just think random drug testing is unconstitutional, not
justified, an invasion of their privacy and demeaning,'' Liss said.

   The Federal Reserve is likely to pause
momentarily in its credit-tightening efforts but the interest rate
relief will only be temporary, many economists believe.
   These analysts are forecasting that a variety of rates, from
banks' prime lending rate to home mortgage rates, will head higher
in the months ahead with the only debate being over whether the
central bank's anti-inflation campaign will wind up pushing the
country into a recession.
   Fed policy-makers were meeting today behind closed doors to
review monetary targets. The 12-member Federal Open Market
Committee, composed of members of the Fed board and regional Fed
bank presidents, meets eight times a year to set interest rate and
money growth policies.
   Today's session is an anniversary of sorts. It was at the March
meeting one year ago that the central bank decided to launch a
gradual effort to drive short-term interest rates higher in an
effort to keep the economy from overheating.
   Since then, short-term rates have risen by more than 3
percentage points, more than the increases that preceded six of the
past seven recessions, according to researchers at Merrill Lynch.
   While such statistics have trigg fears of a new recession,
the Fed is likely toshing rates higher because inflationary
pressurfar shown no signs of abating, economists say.
   Inflation ate wholesale level has been racing ahead at an
alarming annual rate of 12.6 percent in the first two months of
this year and consumer prices have been climbing at a 6.1 percent
annual rate, up sharply from the 4.4 percent e in consumer
prices turned in during the past    The Fed moved aggressively in February
to tighten credit
further, including hiking its discount rate, the in to make bank loans,
to 7 percent. An increase in the
discount te is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send
of itsintentions to fight inflation with higher intereany private economists
are not looking for an immediate move at
today's meeting to tighter credit further, in p Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials have
indicated in recent comments that they are prepared to take a
breather to review the effects of their earlier actions.ecent weakness
in retail sales, factory orders and housing
construction give some indication that the Fed's efforts are
slowing growth. But with inflationary pressures still 
many economists believe the Fed will be forced to squeeze credit
tighter, even as evidence of a slowing economy mounts.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubry G. Lanston &amp;ment securities dealer,
predicted that interest rates will
remarly stable from April through June but that the credit tightening in
early summer.
   Those moves will push fid-rate mortgages, now at 11.22
percent, up to 1l, Jones said, with other
rates, such as banks' prime lending rate rising as well.
   Paul Getman, an economist with the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm, forecast an even more rapid rise in interest
rates, saying he looked for the prime rate, rrently at 11.5
percent, to climb to 12 percent by late April.
   He said the Fed was also likely to boost itcount rate over
the next couple of months by one-half percentage point to 7.5
percent.
   President Bush hastedly said since taking office that the
Fed shoned about economic growth as well as inflation
and 70 of 174 Re the House fired off a letter to
Greenspan last week urging himest rates to avert a
recession.
   Among private economists, there is a split over whether the Fed
can achieve its goal of a``soft landing'' which would see
slow enough to cool down inflation but not topple the country into
a recession.
   David Wyss, chief financ for Data Resources Inc., a
Lexorecasting firm, said he believes that the Fed
will be able to fight inflation d keep the six-year economic
relive.
   ``We think the Fed's will work, but the risks of a
mistake are substantial,'' he said.
   However,, saying, ``Throughout history, the
soft landing hasn't worked. It just isn't possible to fine-conomy.''
   Jones said he was looking for a recession but notar, in part because
the Fed willighten aggressively until
summer because of political pressure e White House.
   ``One of theush administration is to put off
this recession as long as posse. That is why they are subtly
 not to tighten,'' Jones said.

   A private consultant who is a central
figure in the Pentagon contract fraud scandal is the 13th defendant
to plead guilty in the case before even the first trial is held.
   William A. Parkin, 65, admitted Monday in U.S. District Court
that he bribed a public official and conspired to defraud the
government. He was to have been one of five defendants next week in
the firing from a 33-month investigation that has
uncovered abuses in the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing
system.
   Parkred at the court despite his hospitalization a week
ago becauseping pills.
   Parkin faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and fines of up to
$750,000 at his sentencing, which is scheduled for June 3. He has
agreed to cooperate in the e with prosecutors preparing for
the trial next Monday in which he was to have been a defendant.
   Parkin admitted that he bribed a Navy official, Stuart E.
Berlin, by chaing money to him in exchange forformation and
favors that might help the consultant's clients omillion-dollar contracts.
   Appearing subdued and speaking in a soft voice, Parkin told
Judge Claude Hilton that the charges against him wer accurate ``as
far as it pertains to me.'' His sentencing date is June 3.
   Parkin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States
and wire fraud in addition to the charge of bribing a public
official. In exchange for his pleas, the government dropped other
charges against him.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said he was pleased wi
plea.
   On Friday, Berlin pleaded guilty, asd Teledyne Electronics of
Newbury Park, Calif.,mpany that had agreed to pay Parkin
$160,000 fog a contract.
   Teledyne Electronics, a division of Teledyne Industries,
actually turned oveabout $30,000 to Parkin between November 1985
and May 1988.
   Prosecutors said in court documents that Parkin and Teledyne

$2,000 a month between October 1986 and March 1987. If the company

depending on whether the company was a single source of the
contract, as well as $5,000 a month for a year.
   Berlin passed confidential information to Parkin, but Hazeltine
was never awarded the contract because of revelatio the

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Major Death Penalty Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Missouri lawyer urging the Supreme Court to
ban the death penalty for all juvenile killers said the issue is
clear: ``How young is too young to be executed?''
   After two hours of courtroom arguments Monday, the court's
likely answer is far from clear.
   The high court is to decide by July whether using the death
penalty for murderers who committed their crimes before reaching
age 18 represents the ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by
the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   The justices are studying two death penalty cases, one from
Missouri in which the killer was 16 and the other from Kentucky in
which the killer was 17.
   The high court effectively drew the allowable capital-punishment
line at age 16 last year. By a 5-3 vote, it threw out the death
penalty of an Oklahoma killer who committed his crime when 15.
   Four members of the court _ Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens _ said
then that the death penalty is unconstitutional for those younger
than 16.
   Three _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R.
White and Antonin Scalia _ said the Constitution does not set such
age limits.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who asked only two neutral
questions Monday, provided the majority with its fifth vote last
year but stopped short of calling for abolition of capital
punishment for killers under 16.
   She will provide a key vote in the Missouri and Kentucky cases.
So, too, will Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court in
February 1988, too late to participate in the Oklahoma case.
   Kennedy asked numerous questions Monday, some of which focused
on a jury's ability to take a defendant's youth into account even
if the death penalty is a possibility.
   Nancy McKerrow, arguing on behalf of Missouri death row inmate
Heath Wilkins, said, ``There is a consensus opinion in this
country against executing our young.''
   Frank Heft Jr., representing Kentuck row inmate Kevin
Stanford, contended that peop 18 are ``children who have
not evolved into adults'' and who ``have a tremendous capacity for
change.''
   Noting the lack of unanimity amoate legislatures, the chief
justice asked, ``Why should we set the bright line at 18?''
   Ms. McKerrow, a lawyer from Columbia, Mo., answered that 18 ``is
the age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation betweeood and
adulthood.''
   She no0 Missouri laws treat individuals under 18
differently from those over 18 _ including a law thas
juveniles from witnessing executions.
   But lawyers for Missouri and Kentucky urged the jutices to
leave any line-drawing to state legislatures.
   ``Wnational consensus?'' asked Missouri Assistant
Attorney General John Morris IIIe said Wilkins, the convicted Missouri
killer, c
condemned in 22 states despite his age, demonstrating ``an absence
of a national consensus'' regarding a minimum age for executions.
   Kentucky Attorney General Frederic Cowan said state legislatures
may choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matter
of mercy, but argued, ``The Constitution is an instrument of
justice, not an instrument of mercy.''
   The court's decision will affect only about 30 of the nearly
2,200 death row inmates nationwide, but anti-capital punishment
forces nevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue.
   The justices were told that of the 36 states with capital
punishment laws, only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who were
under 18 when they committed their crimes.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Turned away arguments in an Iowa case that allowing public
hospitals to keep chaplains on their payrolls violates the
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   _Agreed to use a Pennsylvania case to restudy how far states may
go in limiting a jury's discretion to choose life or death for
convicted murderers.
   _Let stand a $300,000 award won by Oregon's former chief medical
officer from the State Health Division's administrator who fired
him over an alleged ``slush fund.''
   _Refused to review a lawsuit by a Pennsylvania Supreme Court
justice against two newspapers that reported on what was to have
been a confidential state investigation on his fitness fooffice.
   _Agreed to decide in a North Dakota case whether states may
impose labeling and reporting requirements for liquor sold at U.S.
military bases within their borders.

<TEXT>
   Laboratory experiments by Agriculture
Department scientists are raising hopes that contamination of
chickens by food poisoning organisms can be reduced by adding a bit
of sugar to their drinking water.
   The encouraging tests involved ordinary lactose _ milk sugar _
and another sugar from a Mediterranean plant.
   Preliminary results showed that the number of salmonella
bacteria in infected chickens can be reduced by 99.9 percent in a
significant number of the birds, for a cost of pennies a day, said
USDA biochemist John R. DeLoach of the Agricultural Research
Service, College Station, Texas.
   DeLoach said in a report issued here Monday that lactose and
D-mannose were added to the drinking water of chicks dosed with 100
million Salmonella typhirmurium bacteria.
   When the 10-day-old chicks were compared with birds that had
received the bacteria but no sugars, only 53 percent of the birds
on lactose and only 26 percent of those on D-mannose had any
salmonella bacteria, he said.
   ``It's not only important how many birds had salmonella, but how
many salmonella bacteria those birds had,'' DeLoach said. ``The
birds treated with either mannose or lactose had 99.9 percent fewer
salmonella than the control birds in those experiments.''
   Other sugars were tested, too, including glucose, sucrose from
cane sugar, and maltose, or malt sugar. After 10 days, all of the
bacteria-dosed birds on sucrose and glucose were infected, as were
90 percent of those treated with maltose.
   ``Lactose worked just as well as mannose, and the cost of
lactose in drinking water might be no more than two cents per
bird,'' DeLoach said. ``Right now, if the poultry producer put his
birds on D-mannose for 10 days, it would cost him 50 cents a bird.''
   The exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is
unclear, but USDA and private estimates have ranged from 35 percent
to 60 percent nationally. Salmonella and other organisms can be
spread when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines
and their intestinal contents are spilled.
   DeLoach was part of a team studying salmonella at the agency's
veterinary toxicology research unit at College Station.
   D-mannose is produced naturally by the Fraxinus ornus plant
along the Mediterranean basin, the report said. The sugar _
seminose and carubinose _ is available commercially in the United
States. A sister compound, mannitol, has been used for years as a
stabilizer and preservative in pharmaceutical products.
   The report said D-mannose reduces the ability of salmonella
bacteria to settle in a chicken's intestines, forcing the organisms
to pass harmlessly out of the bird. Studies are still under way on
how lactose works.

   Thousands of volunteers are needed again this
year to help farmers comply with new federal conservation
requirements, according to Agriculture Department officials.
   A record 8,222 volunteers helped the department's Soil
Conservation Service in the 1988 fiscal year that ended last Sept.
30, almost a fourfold increase from 2,223 the previous year.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the agency, said Monday the unpaid
helpers will be recognized during National Volunteer Week, April
9-15.
   ``We're in the midst of one of the biggest conservation efforts
in history, and volunteers are playing a key role,'' he said.
   Scaling referred to provisions in the 1985 farm law requiring
farmers with highly erodible crop land to have a conservation plan
approved by the agency no later than Dec. 31, 1989, and to have it
implemented by Dec. 31, 1994.
   The volunteers, called the Earth Team by the agency, range from
college students to retired people. They're used for a variety of
jobs, including design and layout of conservation practices on
individual farms, educational activities, and computer and general
office assistance.
   Scaling said anyone interested in joining the program can call a
toll-free number, 1-800-THE SOIL to find out more information, or
they can contact local SCS offices, which are located in nearly all
counties.

   The Agriculture Department has set up a gene
and data bank for shrubs and other woody landscape plants at the
national aboretum here.
   Arboretum director H. Marc Cathey said Monday that plant
researchers and nurseries will use the bank to find and obtain
landscape specimens at other arboretums and nurseries around the
country _ as well as in the national arboretum.
   Cathey also said that collections of plants at the 444-acre
arboretum will be expanded as part of a new national woody
landscape plant repository. A computer bank will make it easier to
develop new and better specimens.
   The new repository is the first of its kind at the national
level, he said. The arboretum is operated by the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   Cathey said public interest in gardening has expanded rapidly
since 1978, including an increase of almost a third in the sales of
landscape plants. Those sales were estimated at more than $7
billion last year.

<TEXT>
   The Denver City Council voted Monday to loosen its
``living-in-sin'' zoning law so that unrelated people could legally
live together in family-zoned areas.
   The council voted 8-5 to initially approval to plans to change
two types of zoning: R-0, which bans boarders or unrelated people
from living in the same house and R-1, which allows a boarder with
a city permit.
   The changes would allow two unrelated people plus close
relatives, with some exceptions, to live together in areas zoned
R-0 and would permit one boarder, related or unrelated, without a
city permit.
   About 60 percent of the city 505,000 people live under R-1
zoning and 7 percent fall under R-0.
   The changes in the so-called ``living-in-sin'' law come up for
second and final action April 24.
   The amended laws would still forbid nieces, nephews, aunts,
uncles and in-laws from living together, said City Councilwoman
Cathy Donohue.
   ``Right now you have to carry your marriage certificate in your
pocket in Denver,'' Donohue said before the vote.
   ``There are some people who go around and deliberately turn
other people in,'' she said. ``There is even one real estate agent
who sells houses based on the current law, telling buyers that no
one can move in next to them that isn't married. This appeals
particularly to families.''
   The penalty for violating the city's ordinance is $999 a day. In
many cases, if a person is turned in to authorities and owns the
house, they have to sell the house, often at a losss, Donohue said.
   Donohue said families and one real estate agent are the main
opponents of change.
   Among those affected by the ordinance are three nuns, who are
being forced to move out of a four-bedroom home.
   ``They wanted all but one of us to move out,'' said one of the
nuns, who asked that her name not be used. ``To me, it's wasteful
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms.
It's very sinful.''
   The ban dates back to the 1960s when home owners in some of
Denver's most exclusive neighborhoods feared invasion by hippie
communes.
   So far, hundreds of people have violated the ordinance,
including the Mexican consul, students sharing expenses, and
unmarried couples.
   The law is being challenged in court.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called in his top lieutenants
on law and drug enforcement to explore what to do about
semiautomatic assault-style weapons, but the half-hour meeting
produced no decisions, the White House said.
   The meeting Monday in the Oval Office drew together Bush, drug
czar William Bennett, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and Stephen Higgins, director of
Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``They were bringing to the president their insights, their
collective review,'' said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen. ``The
subject of semiautomatic weapons came up, but no conclusions were
made. They don't feel their review has been completed.''
   Bush, who proudly notes in speeches his longtime membership in
the National Rifle Association, has been moving away from the NRA's
hard-line position that citizens have the right to keep and bear
virtually any kind of weapon.
   The apparent change of heart was prompted by widespread calls
from police organizations nationwide as well as from the public for
a ban on the weapons. The calls were prompted by scores of
drug-related shootings and the January slayings of five children at
a Stockton, Calif., school by a man armed with an AK-47.
   Brady two weeks ago suspended imports of hundreds of thousands
of the weapons, including semiautomatic versions of the AK-47 and
Uzi carbines, pending a review of their use to determine if they
meet the legal requirement that they are intended for such sporting
purposes as hunting and target shooting.
   The ATF has estimated the review may take three to four months.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the meeting
the first session ``of the principals since this review has begun''
and said that no decisions had been expected to emerge from it.
   An official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that
among the items discussed at the meeting was legislation sponsored
by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to require those wishing to own
semiautomatic rifles to undergo FBI checks, be fingerprinted, and
pay a $200 fee to the government.
   Also discussed were ways of strengthening the 2-week-old ban on
importation of semiautomatic firearms, the official said.
   Bush called last week for a compromise on the issue of private
ownership of the high load capacity, rapid-fire weapons because
``we're in a very different time now.''
   ``I believe we can find an accommodation between the legitimate
interest of sportsmen and the interests of police chiefs, whose men
put their lives on the line every day,'' Bush told a group of state
legislators.
   Semiautomatic rifles fire one shot each time the trigger is
pulled, unlike automatic rifles, which unleash a stream of bullets
with each trigger pull. In non-semiautomatic rifles, each round
must be chambered with a separate manual action.
   The suspension being imposed by ATF ultimately could affect
close to a half-million semiautomatic rifles.
   Initially, ATF suspended imports of more than 113,000 of the
res in five categories _ AKS-type firearms such as AK-47s, Uzi
carbines, FN-FAL- and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug
rifles. Those weapons had import ermits pending with ATF but had
not yet been apter, the ATF expanded the suspension to weapons for which
import permits had been approved but which had not yet come into
the country.
   The expanded suspension could affect as many as 400,000
additional weapons, ATF spokesman Dick Pedersen estimated.
   Dot Koester, an ATF spokeswoman, said a gun importer must apply
to the ATF for permission to import a certain number of weapons,
and the permits, once approved, are gd for six months, she said.
   ``Often what haens is that he will ask for approval in
bringin0,000, then he will bring in 1,000 or 5,000 or n
Ms. Koester said.
   ``A number of permits had been approved prior to the suspension
of the five groups of weapons'' two weeks ago, but the guns had not
yet gotten through Customs and into the U.S. marketplace, she said.
   Blocking the importation ose weapons which already had
approved import pwas always intended to be part of the
process,'' she said.
   Among the options facing the administration are ending the
suspension and allowing the weapons to begin floodig the country
again, or making the suspension permanent.
   In addition, officials could call on U.S. manufacturers
unaffected by the suspension to follow the lead of Colt Industries,
which announced a dfter the suspension was imposed two weeks
ago that it would temily halt sales of its AR-15 semiautomatic
rifle. The AR-15 is considered one of the most populasemiautomatic rifles
and it is the U.S.-made weapon most similar to
the foreign-made guns being kept out of the country.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission apologized for his conduct on an Apache reservation in
Arizona, but argued that his intentions in interviewing a
14-year-old girl there were practically heroic.
   Chairman William B. Allen, in letters released Monday by the
commission, compared himself to Lenny Skutnick, who in January 1982
dived into the icy Potomac River to save victims of an Air Florida
airliner crash in the capital.
   Allen, on orders from other commission members, wrote to Lalita
Altaha and her parents. ``I'm just an ordinary Skutnick, who dove
into the cold water when the time came,'' he said in both letters.
``I am happy I was able to do that much.''
   But the commission chairman also said he regretted the events of
Feb. 7 and apologized in another letter to the chairman of the
White Mountain Apache Nation.
   Allen and commission consultant Barry Goodfield, accompanied by
an NBC television crew, had taken the child into their car and
interviewed her after picking her up at a reservation school.
   The girl complained in the interview that she was ``an outcast''
on the reservation. She had been reared by a white family that
adopted her and took her off the reservation as a baby. A tribal
court nullified the adoption, and the girl recently was returned to
her natural parents.
   Her natural mother, Thurza Altaha, angrily brushed off Allen's
questions when he and Goodfield arrived at their home with the
girl. Mrs. Altaha called tribal police to complain that the men had
abducted the girl from her school bus.
   Tribal police got Gila County sheriff's deputies to arrest Allen
and Goodfield as they were returning to Phoenix. Deputies
confronted the civil rights official with drawn guns. Both men were
released without charges after being held for several hours.
   Allen said he went to Arizona to look into child custody matters
involving Indians. Goodfield, a psychologist who works with the
commission, also had been advising Normand and Nadine Desrocher in
their efforts to retain custody of Mrs. Altaha's daughter.
   Last week, the other seven members of the civil rights panel
demanded that Allen apologize for his actions on the reservation.
   Some commissioners also had called for his resignation, saying
he had embarrassed President Bush. Allen, in turn, suggested the
commission was an embarrassment to the president and suggested they
all resign. Four of the eight commission members are appointed by
the president and the other four by Congress; all serve staggered
six-year terms.
   Allen last week said he would not resign unless Bush personally
asked him to do so. White House spokesman Stephen Hart said Bush
had no intention of asking Allen to step down and would not have a
vacancy to fill on the commission until November.
   Bush can appoint a new chairman from among commission members
anytime he can get a majority of the commission to approve the
appointment.
   Allen, in his letter to tribal Chairman Reno Johnson, said he
had already expressed ``deep regret'' for events of Feb. 7 after
his ``false arrest.''
   ``I apologize to you again. And I would repeat it tomorrow and
the day after,'' Allen wrote, adding, ``I would insist, however,
that wherever I err I do so in the honest fulfillment of my
obligations to my country.''
   In an apology to the girl's parents, he said: ``I came as a
member of the Commission on Civil Rights, seeking information in a
matter which in my judgment is of grave importance to the safety of
the rights which you enjoy under the Constitution.
   ``I regret that my attempt to understand came at the cost of so
much publicity and confusion to you and your family.''
   On Friday, tribal attorney Claudeen Bates Arthur accused Allen
of having ``a racially discriminatory attitude about Indian
children'' and called for his resignation.
   She said Allen seemed to think it was all right ``to do this to
an Indian child on an Indian reservation, whereas you wouldn't find
such conduct acceptable in middle-class white society.''

   The Bush administration is cautiously
considering a proposal to seek discussions with the Soviet Union on
a new political arrangement for Eastern Europe, according to The
New York Times.
   Under the proposal, Moscow would loosen its hold on the region
in exchange for a pledge by the United States and its NATO allies
not to exploit the new environment in a way threatening to the
Soviet Union, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in an
interview published Tuesday.
   The idea, first broached by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, was being addressed as part of Baker's overall strategic
policy review, which is to be completed by the beginning of May,
the Times said.
   ``I think it is worthy of consideration because it is a novel
approach,'' Baker said during the interview at his State Department
office in Washington.
   ``I think it is important that any such idea, to the extent that
it is going to be pursued, be pursued carefully, so that you do not
send a signal that somehow we are getting together with the Soviet
Union and carving up Eastern Europe,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Encouraged by a loosening of the
military's hand and with help from neighboring Iran, Islamic
fundamentalists are gaining confidence and making political inroads
in Turkey.
   The Prosperity Party, a fundamentalist political organization,
won 10 percent of the vote in Sunday's nationwide local elections
and captured more mayorships than Premier Turgut Ozal's Motherland
Party.
   Prosperity, barred from running in local elections five years
ago, won 7.5 percent of the vote in the 1987 general elections.
   Fundamentalism is an extremely delicate issue in Turkey.
Although overwhelmingly Islamic, the country has maintained a
secular system decreed in the 1920s by Kemal Ataturk, founder of
the modern Turkish republic.
   While few see any danger of an Islamic revolution such as swept
Iran, concern has risen that religious extremists could disrupt
Turkey's plans of integrating with the West.
   Prosperity, for example, opposes Turkey's membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Turkey's bid to join the
European Economic Community. It says that with EEC membership ``we
would lose our Moslem identity in the sea of infidels.''
   Turkey's powerful generals, who have considered it their duty to
defend the Ataturk tradition, cracked down on the fundamentalists
after seizing power in a coup in 1980.
   A new constitution drawn up before they handed back power to
civilians in 1983 expressely bans Islamic law, or sharia, which the
fundamentalists had been demanding.
   But during their rule of three years, the military did nothing
to stop the mushrooming of religious schools and the proselytizing
by several fundamentalist sects. The generals apparently wanted
Islam as an antidote to leftist ideologies that had spawned a wave
of terrorism in the 1970s.
   The issue of fundamentalism took a critical turn during the
election campaign when the Constitutional Court forbade female
students from wearing traditional Moslem headcoverings on
university campuses.
   Hundreds of students and their supporters staged demonstrations
in Turkey's major cities. Some of the protesters wore black
head-to-toe chadors.
   Premier Ozal, who combines devotion to Islam with westward
yearnings, expressed sympathy with the students' demands.
   Amid rumors that the military was growing increasingly
impatient, Turkey's top general, Necip Torumtay, took the unusual
step of declaring the army's loyalty to Turkish democracy.
   Turkey has been angered by Iranian protests over the court ban
on headcoverings. It has warned Iran not to meddle in its internal
affairs.
   In retaliation, Iran has threatened to reduce its imports from
Turkey, according to a report Monday in the English-language
Turkish Daily News quoting unidentified Treasury officials. Turkey
has been hoping to get a share of reconstruction contracts in Iran
following that country's cease-fire with Iraq.
   Turkey also recently expressed displeasure over the spreading of
Iranian religious pamphlets by Iran's consul general in the city of
Erzurum, in Turkey's rural east near the Iranian border.
   In that area, the Prosperity Party won about 20 percent of the
vote in some cities.
   ``The headcovering issue is being used as a springboard to an
Islamic revolution. It won't remain there but will spring to other
issues as well,'' Ahmet Yucekok, a political science professor and
a leading authority on religion in Turkey, said in a recent
interview with Gunes newspaper.
   ``There is provocation from Iran, Iran is behind the
fundamentalists as a state with money and agents. But our social
structure is very different from Iran, it is not easy here,'' he
said, pointing to the far more pluralistic nature of Turkish
society.
   Islam has flourished under democracy more than during the 27
years of single party rule after the establishment of the republic
in 1923. Politicians apparently have seen the need to campaign for
the religious vote.
   In the past decade there has been a sharp increase in the
building of new mosques, in mosque attendance and in the number of
religious schools. The majority of Moslems in Turkey are Sunni, as
opposed to Shiites in Iran.
   Gencay Saylan, the author of a book on Islamic revival,
attributed the strong showing by the Prosperity Party both to the
furor over the headcovering controversy as well as general
discontent with Ozal's Motherland Party.
   ``Some of that vote usually goes to the large conservative
parties in general elections,'' he said. ``This election is a real
breakthrough for them (Prosperity),'' he said in a telephone
interview.

   A federal judge sentenced an evangelist who
admitted guilt in a child sex ring to 20 years, calling the man and
his two partners in the case ``bad to the core.''
   ``Everyone who ever heard you out there (on the revival circuit)
ought to kick you good,'' U.S. District Judge James Turk told
evangelist Mario ``Tony'' Leyva, 42.
   The remark prompted cheers from the courtroom audience, which
included some of the victims and their families.
   Turk sentenced Rias Edward Morris, 47, an organist for the Tony
Leyva Evangelistic Association of Columbus, Ga., to 15 years in
prison, and Freddie H. Herring, 50, of the Lighthouse Assembly in
Douglasville, Ga., to 12 years in prison. All three men were fined
$5,000.
   The three pleaded guilty last year to interstate transportation
of boys for prostitution. Morris and Leyva also pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to transport the boys.
   Leyva and Morris each received the maximum sentence; Herring's
sentence was three years short of the maximum. Leyva already is
serving a 2{-year sentence on state charges of sexually abusing two
boys in Salem.
   Turk told the defendants at sentencing that he saw no redeeming
qualities in any of them. ``All three of you, in the court's
opinion, are just bad to the core,'' the judge said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennie Montgomery said the men procured
the boys during their travels along the revival circuit, using
their influence over the boys' families.
   Since pleading guilty, the three have been at a federal prison
hospital for child sexual abusers in Butner, N.C., for evaluations.
Three psychologist from the hospital told the court that the
evangelists had been diagnosed as pedophiles and suffered from
other personality disorders.
   One of youths, who was 15 at the time of the molestations,
testified at the sentencing that he had been sexually abused by all
three men. The Roanoke County man, who is now 21, said he remains
haunted by the experience. He said he has nightmares, wakes up in a
cold sweat and has suffered family problems and from drug addiction.
   ``I try to forget, but I just can't,'' he said.
   William H. Gray, a Roanoke psychiatrist who has treated four of
the victims, testified that all showed signs of depression and some
had attempted suicide. He said the victims find it difficult to be
intimate and honest with others.
   Ms. Montgomery said Leyva had sexual relations with at least 30
boys, some as young as 8, over the last 20 years. The boys either
attended Leyva's services or were brought there by their mothers,
Ms. Montgomery said.
   Ms. Montgomery said 11 juveniles were victimized by Morris and
nine by Herring.
   All three defendants apologized for their actions. When asked by
Turk why he had committed the crimes, Herring was unable to answer.

   The bodies of 18 Marines
and a Navy corpsman killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea
were returned to the United States on Monday as a band played ``The
Marine Hymn.''
   A chaplain prayed and an honor guard made up of Navy and Marine
personnel and about 150 Air Force members watched as black-gloved
Marine pallbearers removed caskets from a C-141 cargo jet and
placed them in hearses.
   ``It was a very moving ceremony,'' said Maj. Gen. John P.
Monahan. ``It's been a tough week at Camp Pendleton.''
   Most of the Marines killed were from Camp Pendleton in Southern
California, according to a Marine spokesman, Gunnery Sgt. Stan
Pederson.
   The bodies were taken to a military mortuary in nearby Oakland,
where they were to be turned over to relatives.
   The 19 were killed March 20 when a CH-53D helicopter carrying 34
military personnel crashed in a rugged mountain area about 250
miles southeast of Seoul. It was the second fatal crash of a Marine
helicopter in South Korea in four days.
   Four Marines were killed earlier when a CH-46 helicopter crashed
in a rice paddy.
   Both helicopters were participating in ``Team Spirit,'' the
annual joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers.

   Twenty Jamaicans who apparently stowed away
on grain barges were discovered after a week, and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service said it wasn't sure if the refugees had
consumed any food or water.
   The tug American Eagle radioed the Coast Guard Sunday night to
report stowaways on two barges, which had delivered corn to Jamaica.
   ``It appears they had been there about seven days,'' said INS
spokesman Russ Bergeron.
   The 18 men and two teen-agers were taken to the New Orleans INS
office Monday for processing.
   INS District Director John B.Z. Caplinger said the men would be
arraigned on stowing away charges. The boys, who appeared to be
about 16 or 17 years old, will not be prosecuted, he said.
   Bergeron and Caplinger said they did not know if the stowaways
had eaten or had water since leaving Jamaica.
   ``I would imagine there must be some grain aboard the barges,''
said Caplinger.
   The refugees appeared weak when they were turned over to the
INS, officials said.

   Ms. Tutwiler, 38, served as Secretary of State James A. Baker's
spokeswoman when he was treasury secretary in the Reagan
administration and worked for George Bush when he made his
unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980.
   Ms. Tutwiler, who is considered one of Baker's closest advisers,
was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. She has a tough act
to follow in her job as assistant secretary of state for public
affairs.
   Her predecessor, Charles Redman, is a career foreign service
officer with experience in U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. Redman,
who has been nominated ambassador to Sweden, enjoyed close ties
with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and was adept at
handling the department's press corps.

   A little critter that's been dead for
300 million years is being given new life in the Illinois General
Assembly.
   Lawmakers this session are pondering a measure to designate the
prehistoric animal called the Tullimonstrom gregarium _ known
unofficially as the Tully monster _ as the state's official fossil.
   ``The thing that's significant about the Tully monster is that
it's indigenous to Illinois,'' said Rep. Larry Wennlund.
   ``If you look at the other state symbols _ the cardinal,
violets, even the monarch butterfly _ they can be found all over
the country,'' he said.
   The Tully monster is named for Lockport pipefitter Francis
Tully, who discovered its fossilized remains in 1958 among slag
heaps south of Braidwood, about 55 miles southwest of Chicago.
   Tully died two years ago, but his son, Dan, said it would be a
``tremendous honor'' to have his father's discovery recognized by
the state.
   The Tully monster grew to about 1long, had a tube-like body with
a spade-shaped tail and sported two tentacle-like sensors or eyes
and a snout that of an elephant.

   Evangelist Oral Roberts says his ministry
has been getting increasingly fewer donations over the last two
years and that he must have $11 million by May 6 or face financial
collapse.
   Creditors will ``start dismantling'' his ministry and Oral
Roberts University if he doesn't get the money, the 71-year-old
evangelist said Monday.
   ``If we can't make our payroll, I don't know what will happen to
this man or this ministry,'' Roberts said, his voice sometimes
quivering with emotion.
   ``People, this is serious. This is a life-and-death matter,'' he
added.
   The evangelist's plea came two years after he created a furor by
saying his life depended on raising $8 million to provide
scholarships for medical school students at his college.
   ``Two years have passed, and I have been silent,'' Roberts said
during taping for his weekly television program.
   Roberts attributed the decline in donations to scandals in other
ministries ``that have disquieted millions of people.''
   ``I have never been a part of those scandals,'' Roberts said.
   The reference was to Louisiana evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's
reported encounters with a prostitute and to evangelists Jim and
Tammy Bakker's alleged financial wrongdoing at the PTL Ministry in
South Carolina.

<HEAD>Spill Response Has Troubled History</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In July 1977, when the first barrels of North
Slope crude made the 800-mile journey down the trans-Alaska
pipeline to waiting oil tankers in Valdez, questions arose whether
oil companies could clean up a major spill.
   Four months later concern was heightened when about 500 gallons
of oil seeped from the tanker Glacier Bay into Port Valdez, and
state officials found the company's contingency and cleanup plans
in a ``deplorable state.''
   Lack of adequately trained crews and equipment were major
problems.
   ``If they couldn't effectively clean up something that small,
what are they going to do when there is a major spill?'' said Randy
Bayliss, the state Department of Environmental Conservation's
Valdez supervisor at the time.
   Now, state officials have the answer.
   The 987-foot Exxon Valdez ran aground Friday just after filling
its tanks at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. terminal. The
tanker's torn hull spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil
about 25 miles south of Valdez.
   Alyeska's plan for oil spills calls for cleanup equipment to get
to a spill within five hours, but it took the company several hours
longer, said Dennis Kelso, Alaska's environmental commissioner.
   A barge to haul cleanup equipment was down for repairs, making
the response too late to make much headway on the quickly spreading
oil.
   The state agency dashed off a strongly worded letter to those
overseeing the cleanup, calling the response ``inadequate and
slow'' and a failure of the contingency plan.
   Since pipeline operations began, there have been more than 400
oil spills in Port Valdez, the vast majority under a barrel in
volume.
   Two spills on the order of 1 million gallons occurred far
offshore in the Gulf of Alaska a few years ago. And in the summer
of 1987, the Glacier Bay again sprang a leak when it ran aground in
Cook Inlet, dumping about 125,000 gallons of oil just as salmon
were set to move through the area.
   In Valdez, the state, the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Coast Guard jointly inspect Alyeska's cleanup equipment and
capabilities. And they routinely conduct oil spill drills, dumping
hundreds of oranges into the water to simulate oil.
   As recently as five years ago, the DEC and EPA reported major
concerns over Alyeska's ability to respond to even a moderately
sized spill.
   A 1984 memo from Valdez DEC supervisor Dan Lawn to his superiors
blasted Alyeska for substantial cutbacks in personnel at the
terminal, including people to maintain and operate cleanup
equipment.
   ``The reliability of certain equipment is questioned, especially
in a major spill situation,'' he said.
   Lawn also chastised the state for a lack of environmental
officials to supervise the terminal.
   ``Unfortunately, this has been a signal to Alyeska that the
state is no longer interested'' in the pipeline.
   After a 1984 spill drill in Port Valdez, the EPA said equipment
used by Alyeska might not be suitable for oil spills in that area.
   A spill drill in 1985 showed Alyeska's inability to muster
trained personnel and some equipment didn't work properly,
according to a DEC report of the mock spill.

<TEXT>
   Share prices soared with this year's largest
one-day gain on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday, while the dollar
held firm against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
56.12 points Monday, rebounded 793.96 points or 2.52 percent to
finish at 32,306.36.
   The dollar closed at 132.90 yen, up 0.60 yen from Monday's
132.30-yen finish. The currency began trading at 133.00 yen and
fluctuated between 132.82 yen and 133.25 yen.
   The currency opened at its highest level since Oct. 7, when it
started at 133.62 yen. In New York overnight, the currency ended
trading at 132.70 yen, its highest level since it finished at
133.57 yen last Sept. 7.
   ``Japanese investors concertedly bought issues since today is
the first day of the new business year,'' said Nomura Securities'
dealer Manji Ueda.
   The widening Recruit stock-profiteering scandal has placed a
damper on the Nikkei's performance, but any further developments
are not likely to upset the market, Ueda said.
   On Monday, prosecutors filed bribery charges against the former
chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's
telecommunications giant, in the stock-trading scandal, which has
rocked the administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   They also charged Hiromasa Ezoe, former chairman of Recruit Co.,
the information conglomerate at the center of the scandal, and an
aide, Hiroshi Kobayashi, with bribing Shinto.
   Recruit Co. officials sold unlisted shares in a real estate
subsidiary to more than 150 prominent government officials,
politicians and business executives, who later reaped huge profits
when the stock price soared after the shares began over-the-counter
trading.
   In currency dealings, the dollar initially remained strong in
Tokyo following an overnight rise in New York, dealers said.
   But Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama's comment Tuesday
that current yen-dollar exchange rate must ``be looked at with
caution'' weakened the strong dollar-buying mood, said one dealer
with a commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   His remark indicated possible intervention by the Bank of Japan
to halt the dollar's further surge against the yen, but some market
players expect the central bank will wait until the dollar hits the
135-yen level, said another dealer.

<HEAD>Ethics Official Reportedly Concludes Mayor Violated Disclosure Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia's chief ethics
official has concluded that Mayor Marion Barry violated a financial
disclosure law by failing to report a real estate partnership, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Washington Post quoted sources as saying that Marianne
Coleman Niles, who directs the city's campaign finance office, has
determined that Barry should be fined for failing to report the
deal with developer Jeffrey Cohen.
   The paper said Ms. Niles has concluded that a promissory note
the mayor signed in 1985 when he purchased an interest in a
Nantucket, Mass., building amounts to an interest-free loan.
   Barry has recently been dogged by reports concerning the city's
skyrocketing murder rate and controversy in December after he
visited the district hotel room of a man, Charles Lewis, later
charged with selling cocaine in the Virgin Islands. Barry has
repeatedly denied using drugs or having any knowledge about any
possible involvement with drugs by Lewis.
   The Post said the mayor's legal counsel, Herbert O. Reid Sr.,
did not say whether Barry would agree to the sanctions and
emphasized that the mayor did not knowingly violate any law.
   District law requires top city officials to annually disclose
any liability of more than $1,000 that they owe to anyone other
than a family member or financial or credit institution.
   Barry could face a maximum penalty of $1,500 because he did not
report the deal on his 1986, 1987 or 1988 disclosure forms. Each
violation is punishable by a $500 fine.
   Barry's share in the building is held under the name of investor
Israel Kogan, a local obstetrician. Kogan and Barry hold an
unregistered partnership called KB Associates.
   Under the terms of the note, the mayor is required to pay
$49,000 over 10 years for a 10-percent interest in the building.
The building, valued at $1 million, is owned by Barry, Cohen and
seven others.
   When asked why his interest in the real estate deal was hidden,
Barry said, ``I was advised by my lawyers and (accountants) to
handle it that way.''

<HEAD>Ortega Urges U.S. Congress To Reconsider Contra Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega denounced the
U.S. government for deciding to give the Contra rebels more
non-lethal aid, saying it should instead support regional leaders'
plan to dismantle rebel forces.
   Later Monday, the Defense Ministry said rebels attacked a
military truck in the country's north. It reported two guerrillas
and one soldier killed in the Sunday attack in El Jicote Valley,
near the Honduran border.
   Ortega, speaking to 60 Harvard scholars from 37 countries,
accused the United States of ignoring a Central American peace plan
that commits regional leaders to draft a program by mid-May to
demobilize Contra forces.
   Speaking of the proposed U.S. aid package, the leftist
Sandinista leader said: ``What they're trying to do is maintain
intact a force in Honduran territory, which is like a cannon aimed
at Nicaragua.
   ``The president of Honduras himself has insisted he has not
agreed that the Contras remain for another 10 months or a year,''
he said.
   Ortega said the U.S. decision to continue funding the Contras
``reaffirms once again the policy that the strongest can act
without regard for the will of others.''
   The Nicaraguan rebels are based in Honduras, where the
government, though allied to Washington, has been increasingly
trying to remove them.
   The U.S. proposal, worked out between the Bush administration
and bipartisan congressional leaders and unveiled Friday in
Washington, would provide $4.5 million a month in non-military aid
to the Contras.
   The current $27.1 million in humanitarian aid runs out Friday.
   The new package proposes aid at least through November and could
continue through February, when Ortega has promised to hold general
elections.
   The U.S. government cut off military aid to the Contras early
last year.
   ``If the U.S. Congress were respectful of our (regional) accord,
it would approve aid for 90 days and gear it to the dismantling of
the Contras,'' Ortega told the gathering of Mason Fellowship
scholars, who were in Nicaragua on a one-day visit.
   Ortega moved up general elections in Nicaragua by 10 months as
part of the regional peace plan he and the presidents of El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica reached in El Salvador
on Feb. 14.
   The plan calls for dismantling the Contras in return for greater
democracy in Nicaragua.
   The presidents agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to
demobilize up to 11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle camps
near Nicaragua with about 12,000 relatives.
   They have been battling the government for eight years but most
fled to Honduras after the Contras and Sandinistas signed a
preliminary cease-fire agreement one year ago.
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica told a news conference in
San Jose on Monday that the proposed U.S. aid package could help
bring peace to the region. Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for
a peace plan that called for amnesties and an end to civil wars in
the region, a plan that eventually evolved into the accords signed
in February.

   Share prices today posted their largest single-day
gain this year on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the dollar edged
up against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 56.12 points
Monday, shot up 793.96 points or 2.52 percent, closing the day at
32,306.36. It was the index's fourth largest single-day gain since
World War II.
   ``After trading started with a strong buying mood in the
morning, the afternoon session followed the same trend and the
market just kept rising,'' said Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities.
   He said the market was active in part because today was the eve
of implementation of a new capital-gains tax on stock transactions.
   A new tax system will require that stock traders pay a 1 percent
capital-gains tax as well as a 0.3 percent transaction tax on stock
purchases. Previously, only a 0.55 percent transaction tax was
imposed.
   Trading on the market's first section was estimated at a heavy
1.2 billion shares. Construction, chemical and steel issues were
particularly strong, but share prices rose almost across the board.
   Manji Ueda of Nomura Securities said Japan's Recruit
stock-profiteering scandal had held down the Nikkei's performance,
but any further developments in the scandal were not likely to
upset the market.
   Prosecutors today filed bribery charges against former Vice
Labor Minister Takashi Kato in the scandal that has rocked the
government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita since last summer.
   On Monday, prosecutors also brought bribery charges against
Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp., Japan's telecommunications giant. They also charged Hiromasa
Ezoe, former chairman of Recruit Co., the information conglomerate
at the center of the scandal, and his aide, Hiroshi Kobayashi, with
having bribed Shinto.
   Recruit Co. officials sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a
real estate subsidiary to over 150 government officials,
politicians and business executives, who later reaped large profits
after the price soared in over-the-counter trading.
   In currency dealings, the dollar finished trading at 132.90 yen,
up 0.60 yen from Monday's 132.30-yen closing. The dollar opened
higher at 133.00 yen and ranged during the day between 132.82 and
133.25 yen.
   The currency remained strong in Tokyo following its overnight
rise in New York, dealers said.
   News reports said traders in New York sold the yen and bought
the dollar following a rumor that the stock scandal might lead to
the arrest of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, dealers said.
   ``But such a rumor, which I've heard many times already, cannot
be a dollar-buying incentive,'' said Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa
Bank. ``Even if Nakasone is arrested and Takeshita kicked out, it
would change nothing in the structure of the Japanese economy and
political system ruled by the Liberal Democratic Party,'' he said.
   A comment by Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama today
that the current yen-dollar exchange rate should ``be looked at
with caution'' weakened the strong dollar-buying mood when the rate
hit the 132.20-yen level, other dealers said.
   Murayama's remark suggested the possibility of intervention by
the Bank of Japan to halt the dollar's rise against the yen, but
Japanese market players expected the central bank would stay away
from the market unless the rate hits 135 yen, Yamasaki said.

   Peanut butter has proved its sticking power
on youngsters' palates and on shopping lists 99 years after it was
first used as a health food for invalids.
   Peanut butter was invented by a St. Louis physician, but his
identity and details about his creation have been lost.
   ``We don't know how it came about, other than that he ground up
peanuts to make a health food that they could consume,'' said
Marilyne Moore, director of promotions and education for the
Georgia Peanut Commission.
   The process was later patented by the Kellogg family of Battle
Creek, Mich., and peanut butter became a common food item in mental
institutions, said Don Koehler, the commission's executive director.
   Peanut butter has a tendency to stick to the palate, so the
doctor's frail patients probably got a glass of milk to wash it
down and further invigorate them, Ms. Moore said.
   ``Mom and apple pie and peanut butter are a way of life in
America,'' Koehler said, noting Americans consumed about a billion
pounds of peanut butter last year. ``We'd like to think that peanut
butter may be pushing apple pie.''
   Peanut butter is a high-energy food, rich in protein, B vitamins
and minerals. It has no cholesterol and contains 50 percent
mono-unsaturated fats, which can help reduce cholesterol in the
body, said Ms. Moore.
   The national appetite for peanuts continues to grow.
   U.S. residents each ate an average of 9 pounds of goobers last
year, which, compared with 1987, included 11.9 percent more shelled
peanuts, 19.1 percent more peanut butter, 9.9 percent more salted
peanuts and 1.9 percent more peanut candy.
   Other peanut facts: 65 percent of the U.S. peanut crop is turned
into peanut butter; men prefer creamy peanut butter, while women
prefer crunchy; and the creamy kind accounts for about 60 percent
of peanut butter sales, Ms. Moore said.
   The commission, along with other grower groups that make up the
New York City-based National Peanut Council, sponsored the first
annual convention of the 40,000-member Adult Peanut Butter Lovers
Club last year.
   Members include actor Charlton Heston, rock star Madonna,
columnist William F. Buckley and former President Ford.
   The meeting, held at Opryland in Nashville, Tenn., featured a
peanut butter banquet and a peanut butter breakfast in bed.
   Club members, she said, ``got up and told why they love peanut
butter.''

<HEAD>Goodbye McCuddy's, The House Where Ruth Drank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCuddy's Tavern was built 79 years ago, just in
time to cool the throats of construction workers who were building
a baseball palace for Charles Comiskey's Chicago White Sox.
   On Monday, the scene was reversed: The bar was destroyed to make
room for a new ballpark.
   It was a tearful occasion for Jack Blachley, 12, who once sold
hot dogs at McCuddy's, a baseball landmark and one of Babe Ruth's
favorite hangouts when he came to play the White Sox.
   As the great-great grandson of the tavern's founder pulled the
lever and about 40 McCuddy family members watched somberly,
Speedway Wrecking Co. took the first big chunk out of the small
historic saloon that stood across the street from Comiskey Park.
   Young Jack was too choked up to talk about it at first and hid
his face as he said of the demolition, ``It's stupid.''
   But he later mustered up enough mischievousness to grab a piece
of rubble and shatter the front window, minutes before wreckers
made their final assault on the white, brick building.
   The demolition of McCuddy's was like a funeral, family members
said, but in two years the tavern will be resurrected a block away,
right next to the new Comiskey Park.
   Artifacts from the tavern, including the mahogany bar and
``hundreds of priceless photos from the inception of the team,''
have all been placed in storage and will be used to duplicate the
old tavern's interior in the new bar, Mrs. Blachley said.
   ``I feel very empty,'' said Puddy McCuddy Senese, Jack's
grandmother and grandaughter of John J. McCuddy, who opened the
tavern in 1910. Workers who built the ballpark that year used to
down a few beers on breaks.
   ``It's a very hard thing, it hurts,'' said Mrs. Senese, the
tavern's current owner, as she watched history turn into rubble.
   When the late Bill Veeck owned the White Sox, he used to toss
his wooden leg over a stool at McCuddy's and shoot the bull for
hours.
   When the Yankees were in town in the 1920s and '30s, Ruth would
guzzle a few drinks at the tavern.
   When the McCuddy family home was next door, the Sultan of Swat
``would come over and have dinner with my great-grandmother,'' said
Sheri Blachley, Mrs. Senese's daughter.
   Roast beef and homemade bread were Babe's favorite meals, said
Mrs. Senese. Both women declined to reveal their ages.
   The family home, where both women grew up, was knocked down
along with many other homes as the state cleared the way for
construction of the new ballpark, which will sit on top of the old
tavern site.
   ``I didn't want to come'' to watch the demolition, Mrs. Blachley
said. ``My mother asked me to. She put it this way: `It's only
going to happen once.'''

   Fifteen people were killed
when members of two Zulu clans fought with rifles and submachine
guns in a rural settlement in the KwaZulu tribal homeland, police
reported today.
   National police headquarters in Pretoria said the fight occurred
Sunday at Etimatola, near Pietermaritzburg in Natal Province.
   A police spokesman in Pietermaritzburg, Maj. Pieter Kitching,
said the cause of the clash was not known. There was no indication
it was related to the prolonged factional fighting in the region
between supporters of militant anti-apartheid groups and followers
of Inkatha, a more conservative Zulu organization.
   Kitching said the atmosphere in Etimatola was very tense.
   ``We have members of the riot unit on standby until we are
satisfied tempers have calmed down,'' he said.

   Barry Minkow, who conjured up a carpet
cleaning company that cleaned investors out of more than $100
million, got the maximum sentence from a judge who said he wasn't
buying the young entrepreneur's apologies.
   Before ordering a 25-year prison term and restitution of $26
million, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian compared Minkow's
new-found remorse to ``spreading toro poo-poo across the court.''
   Tevrizian issued the sentence Monday for Minkow's Dec. 14
conviction on 57 counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud.
   Minkow, 23, founder of the now-defunct ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning
company, used the sentencing hearing to tell the court how grateful
he was that justice prevailed.
   ``This is a great day for this country,'' said Minkow. ``This is
a great day for justice. This is how America works.''
   He commended the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the U.S. attorneys who prosecuted him, saying, ``They got the right
guy. They got the guilty guy.''
   Defense attorney David Kenner had asked for an eight-year
sentence.
   ``That would be a joke,'' snapped the judge. ``Here is someone
who has corrupted the financial system. Here is someone who has
lied and cheated. That sentence would be a slap on the wrist.''
   Tevrizian further denounced Minkow as a charismatic fraud and
said his harsh sentence should serve as a warning to white collar
criminals.
   ``I have to make sure that he pays the price for what he has
done,'' he said, expressing hope that his action would tell ``those
who feed the bulls and bears of Wall Street'' that stock fraud will
not be tolerated.
   ``You're dangerous because you have this gift of gab, this
ability to communicate,'' he told Minkow. ``You don't have a
conscience.''
   Tevrizian told Minkow he didn't buy his late show of remorse, or
his new-found admiration for justice.
   ``You tell me you're sorry and I think, `Is he trying to clean
my carpet or what?'''
   The judge elicited laughter as he added, ``I can't use the word
to describe what you're trying to do to me. Perhaps the best way is
to use my anglicized Spanish and say, `el toro poo-poo.'''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said Minkow would most
likely serve only a third of any sentence imposed. Once released,
the judge said Minkow would be placed on five years probation with
the condition he pay back taxes, any civil judgments against him,
the restitution and participate in a program for drug dependency.
   The judge has already sentenced 10 other defendants in the case
to terms of a month to eight years.
   Minkow, who was 16 when he began ZZZZ Best in his parents'
garage, has insisted he was a captive of mobsters who took over the
company and forced him to commit fraud.
   The government said he was a shrewd con man who convinced Wall
Street investors and TV talk show hosts that he was a teen-age
genius.
   The collapse of ZZZZ Best rocked volatile U.S. money markets and
exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks,
which bought Minkow's sales pitch and committed millions to his
company.
   Prosecutors said victims lost more than $100 million.

<HEAD>Report: South Korean Dissident Meets With North's Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite strong protests from the Seoul
government, a South Korean dissident has met with North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung to discuss reuniting the two countries,
according to reports today.
   Rev. Moon Ik-hwan had lunch Monday with the communist leader in
Pyongyang and they discussed ways to end the division of the Korean
peninsula, according to South Korea's official Naewoe Press, which
reports on North Korea.
   Moon's visit has provoked a massive controversy in South Korea.
Government officials say he is serving North Korean interests and
attempting to subvert South Korean policy.
   His visit has fueled demands from government hardliners for a
crackdown on South Korea's dissident groups. Government prosecutors
in Seoul said Monday that Moon will be prosecuted for aiding the
communist north if he returns home.
   South Koreans cannot visit the north without government
permission.
   Kim Il Sung thanked Moon for supporting his call for ``political
negotiation talks'' on reuniting the two Koreas, Naewoe said.
   ``I express my all out support to the democratic figures from
all walks of life in South Korea fighting under difficult
circumstances for self-reliant and democratic reunification,'' Kim
was quoted as saying.
   The North Korean leader said he was determined to realize his
plan of reuniting the two nations in a confederation under which
they would retain control of their internal affairs
   Moon's secret visit came right after President Roh Tae-woo
ordered a major crackdown on dissidents and radical students he
charged were trying to stage a leftist revolution. Roh cited the
threat in justifying his decision March 20 to postpone indefinitely
a promised referendum on his performance.
   South Korean dissident groups are calling for Roh's overthrow,
but they have little support and are not seen as a major threat
despite a recent spate of violent anti-government protests.
   Police seized more than 3,000 copies of pro-North Korean books
and arrested 11 publishers in raids Monday night in Seoul as part
of Roh's order to suppress leftist groups, prosecutors said.
   Many ordinary South Koreans were critical of Moon's visit,
charging the dissident leader was playing into the hands of the
totalitarian north.
   Kim Il Sung ordered the North Korean invasion in 1950 that
started the bloody three-year Korean War. Kim rules what is widely
regarded as one of the world's most repressive police states.
   North Korea often claims the Seoul government is a U.S. backed
military dictatorship with no public support and attempts to have
independent contacts with dissidents to help ``liberate'' the south.
   Leading South Korean newspapers charged in editorials today that
the north was trying to undermine the Seoul government by
supporting dissidents to incite opposition and eventual revolution.
   ``It is once again proven that North Korea is sticking to its
long standing policy of conquering the south through revolution,''
said the conservative Kyunghyang Shinmun.
   The two Koreas have been holding talks on improving relations,
but have made little progress. The Seoul government says only it
can handle contacts with the north.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces that
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Separate
countries were formed in 1948 and they have clashed repeatedly over
the years.

   A former mental patient charged with raping and
strangling a pregnant doctor told police the woman ``looked like a
real lady'' and it was ``just something I had to do.''
   Steven Smith described in a taped confession played at a
pretrial hearing Monday how he posed as a doctor and, along with a
man he calls ``John,'' strangled Dr. Kathryn Hinnant with an
electrical cord on Jan. 7. Police say John doesn't exist.
   Smith, 23, is charged with the crimes that took place in
Hinnant's office at Bellevue Hospital. Hinnant, 33, was five months
pregnant.
   In the videotape, Smith said that if he had received psychiatric
help earlier, ``the lady would be alive today.''
   ``I did it on purpose ... left evidence so I could get caught
and get help,'' Smith said.
   Smith, who authorities have said secretly slept in an unused
area on the hospital's 22nd floor, told police was able to approach
Hinnant by presenting himself as a doctor, Detective David Argenzio
testified.
   The detective said Smith recalled that when he knocked on the
doctor's office door and entered, she was wearing a red dress.
``Her hair was nice; she looked like a real lady. ... It's just
something I had to do,'' he quoted Smith as saying.
   Argenzio said Smith claimed ``John'' hit Hinnant in the face,
causing extensive bleeding.
   Smith said there was ``so much blood my hands slipped off the
electric cord twice.''
   ``While I'm doing my thing (robbing and stripping the body),
John all of a sudden wants to get sexy, and John makes love to the
lady.''
   Although Smith has admitted helping to kill Hinnant on the
videotape and in other statements, he has insisted that ``John''
raped her.
   Smith's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, told state Supreme Court
Justice James Leff that the confession was obtained illegally and
shouldn't be allowed as evidence.
   Kornberg said police knew Smith faced charges in an unrelated
case and he shouldn't have been questioned without a lawyer present.
   Smith is being held at a hospital under a suicide watch.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard
says she is isolated and mistreated at a federal prison hospital
where she is the only female inmate and that she should be
transferred.
   ``I'm hated by administrative and medical personnel,'' Anne
Henderson Pollard told Judge Harry MacLaughlin.
   ``I feel I've been in segregation the two months I've been
there,'' said Pollard, who weighs less than 100 pounds and appeared
frail and in pain during Monday's hearing.
   Pollard is serving two concurrent five-year prison terms on
charges related to her husband's spying. Jonathan Pollard, 34, was
sentenced in 1987 to life in prison for supplying classified
documents to Israeli agents.
   Pollard, 28, and her lawyers argued that she should be
transferred to a federal prison camp in Danbury, Conn., which they
said would be less stressful. They said her medical condition,
which includes a gastro-intestinal disorder, is worsening at the
Federal Medical Center in Rochester.
   U.S. Magistrate Janice Symchych has recommended that MacLaughlin
deny Pollard's request.
   Assistant U.S. District Attorney Robert Small argued that
Rochester was the best place to treat Pollard's medical problems.
He said the woman has made herself sicker by limiting her intake of
food and water.
   The prison hospital placed Pollard under 24-hour surveillance to
monitor her food intake, but the surveillance has been lifted.
   Pollard told MacLaughlin that the surveillance was ``the most
stressful and humiliating event I have ever undergone.''
   ``I could not sleep. I could not even have the dignity of going
to the toilet without someone watching me,'' she said.
   Pollard said she wants to return to the women's prison in
Danbury to be closer to her family. She began serving her sentence
at that facility in March 1987.
   The judge said he expected to rule on the request, which was
made in a lawsuit, next week.

<HEAD>Christians Repulse Syrian Tank Attack, 15 Reported Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army command
said today that its troops repulsed a tank-led attack by Syrian
forces and their allies against Christian positions southeast of
Beirut, killing 15 Syrian soldiers.
   Monday night's abortive attack was the first ground offensive
reported in three weeks of fierce clashes between Christians and
Moslems in a new round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   It targeted Christian army units positioned in the strategic
hilltop resort of Souk El-Gharb southeast of Beirut, a spokesman
for Aoun's command said. The spokesman, who refused to be named,
said the Syrians lost two Soviet-designed T-54 tanks and a battery
of multi-barreled rocket launchers in the attack.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio station said Syrian-backed
Palestinian guerrillas of Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising and
militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party also took part in the attack.
   The Syrian army command in Moslem west Beirut withheld comment
on the report. A Lebanese police spokesman said the department
usually was ``not informed on the Syrian army's activities.''
   But the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said police stations reported ``ferocious shelling of the army's
area of operations from Syrian-controlled territory''
   ``The whole Souk El-Gharb sector was in flames last night ...
the army's response was fierce,'' the spokesman added.
   He said two people were killed and 12 wounded in overnight
artillery clashes between Syrian gunners and Christian army units
in and around Beirut.
   The latest casualties from the daily shelling duel and the
Syrian attack raised to 116 killed and 362 wounded the casualty
toll since this round of fighting broke out March 8.
   The Voice of Lebanon accused the Syrians of launching a ``war of
annihilation against the Christians'' by firing 5,000 rocket and
mortar rounds from dusk Monday to dawn today at the Christian
enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Christian gunners responded to the barrage by pounding
Syrian-controlled west Beirut and Druse mountains southeast of the
capital with 155-millimeter howitzer shells.
   The 20-day confrontation began after Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports along Lebanon's 130-mile coastline. The ports
deprive the five legal ports of an estimated $100 million a year in
tax revenue.
   In retaliation, Jumblatt, the Syrians and Maj. Gen. Samir
Khatib's 22,000-strong Moslem army besieged the Christian enclave.
   The crescent-shaped 310-square-mile area has about one million
Christians, one-quarter of Lebanon's population. They are
surrounded by hostile Syrian troops and allied forces on the north,
east and south and by the Mediterranean to the west.
   Clashes continued all night and tapered off into sporadic
exchanges of mortar rounds after daybreak, the police spokesman
said.
   Beirut looked like a ghost city today, with rubble from the
overnight barrage littering the deserted streets.
   Witnesses in Zokak Blatt, the west Beirut neighborhood that took
the brunt of the Christian barrage, said Aoun's gunners scored at
least 10 direct hits on a 40-story unfinished skyscraper used as a
main base by the Syrian army in Beirut.
   ``A shell pierced the roof and slammed into our neighbors'
vacant apartment. It demolished a room and the balcony fell on us
in the ground floor,'' said Geraier Kafranbashian, a grocer in
Zokak Blatt.
   ``By sheer luck we are still alive. My wife, I and two children
can't hear properly, the noise of the deafening blast is still in
our ears,'' Kafranbashian said.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon maintains 40,000 troops
in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in quiet early European trading
today following the Easter holiday weekend. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said that, barring any unexpected
events, they expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range all week.
   Currency movements will be dampened by anticipation of the
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations, they said.
   That meeting is scheduled to be held during an International
Monetary Fund meeting starting Friday in Washington.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 132.90. Later, in
London, it was quoted at the same rate.
   Other dollar rates in London at midmorning, compared with late
Friday's rates in Europe:
   _1.8843 West German marks, up from 1.8733
   _1.6450 Swiss francs, up from 1.6252
   _6.3715 French francs, up from 6.3350
   _2.1239 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1138
   _1,381.20 Italian lire, up from 1,376.10
   _1.1935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1895
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7005, cheaper for buyers
than late Friday's European quote of $1.7190.
   Bullion markets were closed in Europe on Good Friday and Easter
Monday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price
for gold at midmorning Tuesday of $391.25 a troy ounce, unchanged
from the opening bid but down from $394.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $391.25, down from $395.00 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.50 to close at a bid $392.64.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $6.08.

   Drugs may have been involved in the
execution-style slaying of five men whose bodies were found in a
shed, police said.
   The bodies were discovered Monday morning by the wife of one of
the victims, said Sgt. Charles Armijo, head of the Police
Department's homicide unit.
   ``They appeared to have been executed,'' Armijo said. ``Drugs
may have been involved in some way or other.''
   The five, described by a neighbor as in their 20s and 30s, were
killed ``within the last day,'' Armijo said, adding he couldn't
provide a precise time.
   He said he wouldn't disclose the victims' names nor other
details of their deaths pending further investigation.
   A next-door neighbor said his wife told him she heard sounds
like gunfire before noon Sunday.
   The neighbor, who said he had thought there was drug-related
activity at the residence because of heavy traffic, said his wife
told him she had heard what ``could have been three (shots) or
more.''
   The owner of the property, Tien Chu, said the house had been
rented within the past three or four months, and that one of the
tenants said he was in the construction business. He said the
tenants put a fence around the property about two months ago.
   Another neighbor, Curtis Espinoza, said he frequently has seen
police parked late at night, ``like narcs, staking something out,''
on a street across from where the victims were found.

<HEAD>Chicago Suburb Bans Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has voted to ban
ownership of handguns by most residents, making this the fifth
Chicago suburb to impose firearms restrictions.
   Councilwoman Margie Weiss said the council ``will be sending a
strong message to Springfield and Washington: Highland Park is
tired of waiting for them to act.''
   The ban was approved by a 5-2 vote Monday.
   This affluent community of 33,000 north of Chicago is one town
away from the suburb of Winnetka, where 30-year-old Laurie Dann
entered a school last May and fatally shot one child and injured
five others. Later she injured a man and killed herself.
   The ordinance, which takes effect May 1, bans possession of
handguns except by police officers and security guards, members of
licensed gun clubs and firearm collectors ``whose possession is
limited to antique firearms.''
   The ordinance allows people to voluntarily turn over handguns to
the police without penalty.
   A first offense carries a fine of $50 to $500. Police also will
confiscate and destroy the offender's gun.
   ``I'll probably turn my gun in,'' said resident Larry Leviton.
``If I have an incident in my home where I can't defend myself,
I'll sue the city.''
   Wilmette, a suburb which borders Winnetka, approved a ban on the
sale and possession of handguns last month. Three other Chicago
suburbs _ Morton Grove, Evanston, Oak Park _ also have banned
handguns.
   A referendum to ban handguns will be held April 4 in Winnetka.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Reportedly Ponders New Plan for Soviet Bloc</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is cautiously
considering asking Moscow to loosen its grip over Eastern Europe in
exchange for a pledge from the West not to undermine the Soviets,
according to a report published today.
   The proposal is being considered as part of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's strategic policy review, which is to be
completed by the beginning of May, Baker said in an interview with
The New York Times.
   ``I think it is important that any such idea, to the extent that
it is going to be pursued, be pursued carefully, so that you do not
send a signal that somehow we are getting together with the Soviet
Union and carving up Eastern Europe,'' Baker said.
   The idea was first suggested by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger while George Bush was running for president, the Times
said.
   Kissinger reportedly suggested that Washington and its NATO
allies consider calling on Moscow to sharply ease its political and
military control over Eastern Europe. In exchange, the West would
promise not to exploit the new environment in a way that threatens
the Soviet Union.
   Baker said the proposal had elements of ``great appeal,'' but
added that the West should not rush into such a plan because the
counter argument also had appeal: Why strike a deal that would
grant the Soviets any type of formalized status in Eastern Europe
when countries in the region, like Poland and Hungary, are already
moving toward a more Western orientation in their economies and
political systems?
   Baker said that if progress did not continue in those countries,
``if there was a reversal, or if you had anarchy and a reaction by
the Soviets,'' then ``it would be much more appropriate in my view
to look at the possibilities of the proposal that Henry advanced.''

   A judge told a physician who specializes
in cancer treatment that he can't go to Switzerland where he faces
fraud charges because a patient might die if the doctor leaves.
   U.S. District Judge Sol Blatt Jr. on Monday ordered Dr. Rajko D.
Medenica to surrender his U.S. passport.
   The doctor, who has clinics on Hilton Head Island and in
Switzerland, is scheduled to stand trial next month in Switzerland
on fraud charges, authorities said.
   During the hearing, Medenica, represented by attorney F. Lee
Bailey, said he wanted to return to Switzerland to clear his name.
He said he is innocent of the fraud charges, which stem from
changes that were made in records at his Swiss clinic.
   Medenica has developed an unusual cancer treatment that uses the
drug interferon to treat tumors.
   One of Medenica's cancer patients, Charles E. Stevinson of
Colorado, filed suit to keep Medenica in the United States,
contending that he would die if the doctor were imprisoned abroad.
   Several other of Medenica's cancer patients also testified,
including Richard Walker of Columbia, a former ambassador to South
Korea.
   Bailey said his father-in-law has been treated by Medenica as
well.

   An Indian activist charged with taking
hostages in a North Carolina newsroom last year can fight
extradition now that a federal charge against him has been dropped.
   A federal magistrate on Monday dismissed a charge of unlawful
flight against Eddie Hatcher and turned him over to authorities to
begin extradition proceedings.
   Hatcher's lawyers said they would seek his release on bail and
try to deny extradition to North Carolina. Hatcher has said his
life would be in danger if he is returned to North Carolina, where
he has accused law enforcement authorities of corruption.
   Hatcher also contends he should not be tried on state charges
since he has been acquitted of federal hostage charges for the same
incident.
   Monday's hearing was to determine whether Hatcher should be
returned to North Carolina on the federal charge or to drop the
charge and begin extradition proceedings on the state charges in
California.
   Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, both Tuscarora Indians,
have been accused of holding up to 20 people hostage for 10 hours
in February 1988, in the offices of The Robesonian newspaper in
Lumberton, N.C.
   A state task force said their claims of corrupt law enforcement
officials were unfounded.
   In December, the two were indicted on state kidnapping charges.
   Jacobs, arrested in New York state, was returned to North
Carolina last week. A judge in Lumberton has set his bail at
$100,000.
   Hatcher was arrested in San Francisco three weeks ago after
unsuccessfully seeking political asylum in the Soviet consulate. He
is being held without bail.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors arrested a second former government
vice minister today in a widening stock-profiteering scandal that
has shaken public confidence in Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
administration.
   The arrest of Kunio Takaishi, 59, who retired last year as vice
minister of education, came the same day that formal charges were
filed in the case against a former vice minister of labor, Takashi
Kato.
   Both men, the highest-ranking public officials arrested in the
scandal, were accused of receiving bribes in the form of
bargain-priced stock shares in exchange for using their influence
in favor of Recruit Co., an information conglomerate. Both retired
before the scandal surfaced last summer.
   Opposition parties have demanded that Takeshita resign and call
new elections to allow for a public judgment of the Recruit
scandal, which has raised questions about money links between
business and government.
   Three members of Takeshita's Cabinet have stepped down as a
result of the scandal, but the prime minister has vowed to stay on
and work for reforms to restore public trust in government. Recent
public opinion polls have shown support for the Takeshita
government at only 12.6 percent.
   Takaishi is accused of helping Recruit executives win
appointments to government education committees.
   Recruit's main business is publishing specialized magazines on
job placement, giving it a strong interest in both education and
labor policy.
   Kato, 59, who retired as a vice minister in September 1987, was
arrested March 8 and accused of influencing a ministry decision not
to impose stricter regulations on employment information magazines
in 1984.
   The latest arrest, the 13th in the Recruit scandal, came a day
after prosecutors filed formal charges accusing Hisashi Shinto,
former chairman of the telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp., of receiving bribes from Recruit to help the
company expand its telecommunications business.
   Prosecutors say Kato was sold 3,000 unlisted shares of Recruit's
real estate subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., at a cut-rate price in
1986. He allegedly profited by about $45,450 when public sales of
the stock began and its price soared.
   Takaishi bought 10,000 shares and sold 6,000 immediately after
the public listing for a profit of about $90,000, prosecutors said.
   In all, about 700,000 bargain shares in Recruit-Cosmos
reportedly were offered by the founder and former chairman of
Recruit, Ezoe Hiromasa, and his aides to more than 150 influential
people.
   Today, prosecutors added alleged bribery of Kato to the charges
already filed against Ezoe and two aides, Masao Tatsumi and
Toshihiro Ono. They also arrested Ezoe again and another aide,
Hiroshi Kobayashi, in connection with the Takaishi case.
   At least 17 leading politicians, including Takeshita and
Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the scandal. Nakasone was
prime minister during the stock transactions. However, none have
been arrested.

<HEAD>NAACP Lawsuit Over Los Angeles Schools Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP has abandoned an 8-year-old
desegregation lawsuit against the nation's second-largest school
district.
   NAACP attorney Joseph Duff said Monday the group cannot afford
to pursue the case and does not have enough time to assemble
evidence to prove its allegations of racial inequities in the
595,000-student school system.
   ``I don't think there's any failure with the substance of the
case,'' Duff said.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
remains convinced that local government, with the acquiescence of
the state, established segregated neighborhoods and schools, he
said.
   At the NAACP's request, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima
on Monday dropped the last defendants in the class-action lawsuit _
the state, its Education Department and school superintendent. The
district was dropped in January.
   Duff argued that local government fostered segregation by
concentrating public housing in black areas, requiring children to
attend schools in their neighborhoods and steering black teachers
toward primarily black schools.
   He said the state was at fault for failing to prevent such
decisions.
   Deputy Attorney General Samuel Overton said racial inequities
were the result of private housing patterns rather than government
activity.
   ``There are certainly racially isolated schools ... (but) it's
not because somebody has made a conscious decision to make them
that way, not someone in government,'' he said. ``There's certainly
private discrimination that takes place every day, certainly in the
housing market.''
   Of the district's students, 59 percent are Hispanic, 16.7
percent black, 15.8 percent white, 5.9 percent Asian, 1.9 percent
Filipino, and less than 1 percent are Pacific islanders or native
Americans.
   The NAACP sued in 1981, two years after a state ballot measure
overturned a court-imposed busing plan.
   The group had sought new education programs for minorities, more
aid to minority schools with the lowest achievement records and
smaller classes in minority schools.
   Since 1980, the state has given the district $1 billion toward
mandatory and voluntary desegregation programs, Overton said. The
district still buses thousands of students a day in voluntary
programs.

   Drunken drivers are being forced to
publicly acknowledge their sins by putting their photo and an
apology in the newspaper.
   Indian River County Court Judge Joe Wild has been ordering
first-time offenders to place the ads since February. The first
appeared on Friday, and 13 more are to follow.
   Wild still fines offenders, suspends their licenses and requires
them to take driving classes but goes one step further, making them
publish the message, ``I apologize to all the people of this
community for driving impaired over the streets of Indian River
County.''
   The judge said the message makes the community aware of what can
happen to those who drink and drive.
   But lawyer Bob Pegg, who often handles drunken driving cases,
said the ads could ``sentence a guy to financial ruin'' by
affecting businesses and reputations.

   New York City has all but banned pit bulls.
   The Board of Health on Monday adopted regulations barring any
new pit bull terriers from being brought into the city after Oct. 1
and requiring current owners to obtain hard-to-get liability
insurance of at least $100,000.
   All such dogs must be registered; spayed or neutered; identified
by photographs and tattoos, and muzzled and kept on a leash in
public. In addition, owners of pit bulls must post warning signs at
home.
   Only Lloyd's of London offers such insurance policies, and it
charges $3,000, said ASPCA spokesman Jeffrey Hon.
   ``No insurance company will give (coverage) for any price,''
said Mordecai Siegel, president of the Society of New York Dog
Trainers. ``Anyone with a pit bull will be forced to give it up.''
   Unregistered pit bulls could be seized and their owners fined up
to $500 a day, said Health Department spokesman Barry Adkins.
   Pit bull terriers were bred long ago to battle bulls for sport.
They have been known to attack people without warning or
provocation.
   ``After October 1,'' Adkins said, ``there will be no pit bulls
allowed into New York City. This will lead to the grandfathering
out of all pit bulls. Eventually, there will come a time when there
will be no pit bulls in New York City.''
   Adkins said that, ``by rigorously controlling pit bulls, the law
seeks to prevent serious bites by these animals before they occur,
thereby protecting the public health.''
   He guessed pit bulls would be gone from the city in 12 to 16
years.
   City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph said in January that
while pit bulls are estimated to account for only 2 percent of the
total city dog population, they are responsible for close to 14
percent of all reported bites.

   Maris Liepa, the Bolshoi Ballet star known for his
glamour and charisma on stage and off, has died of a heart attack.
   The dancer died Saturday at age 52, the official Tass news
agency said.
   Liepa created the role of Crassus, the Roman tyrant in
``Spartacus,'' Yuri Grigorovich's ballet based on a 1968 score by
Khachaturian. He also danced leading roles in ``Swan Lake,''
``Sleeping Beauty,'' ``Raymonda,'' ``Les Sylphides,'' ``Don
Quixote,'' and ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   In his book, ``Yesterday and Today in Ballet,'' Liepa wrote:
``We give all our physical and spiritual powers so that our art,
transformed into ourselves, would influence people's hearts and
minds.''
   Liepa began dancing professionally in 1955 with the Latvian
Opera and Ballet Theater. He later moved to Moscow's Stanislavsky
and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theater and finally joined the
city's Bolshoi Ballet.
   Twenty-six years ago, Liepa began teaching ballet, and this year
he worked on setting up his own ballet troupe. His daughter, Ilze,
and son, Andris, have distinguished themselves as ballet dancers.

<TEXT>
   Moslem insurgents said today they set
up a military committee to revamp their strategy in the battle for
Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad.
   The move came after an Afghan government official said Monday
the three-week guerrilla attack around Jalalabad was collapsing and
the rest of the country was quiet.
   ``There has been terrible coordination in Jalalabad,''
acknowledged a guerrilla source today, speaking on condition of
anonomity.
   He said the guerrillas' strength lies in harassment, not
launching a conventional attack on an urban center. To return the
Jalalabad fight to a hit-and-run battle, he said ``would be a
better strategy.''
   Western diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
today reported a lull in battle for control of Jalalabad. A
guerrilla victory would give the insurgents control of their first
major city and provide a base for the interim government they
elected Feb. 23 in Pakistan.
   The diplomats said the fighting had dropped off because the
U.S.-backed insurgents are trying to coordinate their military
strategy.
   However, the insurgents are also moving more supplies toward the
battlefront and trying to negotiate the surrender of government
troops, diplomats said.
   Casualty reports in the fight for Jalalabad have varied widely.
Official government sources put the guerrilla death count at more
than 4,000. Guerrillas and Western sources said about 300
insurgents have died and another 900 have been injured.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman in the
Afghan capital of Kabul, said 190 guerrillas were killed between
Sunday night and Monday night. He said two government soldiers and
three civilians also died.
   Amani said guerrillas fired 250 rockets and shells at Jalalabad
during that time, compared with 12,000 in the previous 24 hours.
   ``We're of the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that
they cannot achieve any success through military means,'' he said
of the guerrillas.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldiers
were killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting around
Jalalabad.
   The guerrillas launched their offensive on Jalalabad March 6. At
its peak the fighting, was said to be the heaviest in the
decade-long war.
   The insurgents have been fighting the Afghan government since
1978. The Soviet Union, which sent troops into Afghanistan in
December 1979 to support the Moscow-allied government, withdrew the
last of its soldiers Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrillas today blew up a
building used by Israeli troops and allied militiamen on the edge
of Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   At least two militiamen from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army were wounded in the 7:40 a.m. blast, which occurred just
before the two-story administration building was to open for the
day, police said.
   The explosion at the Zumarraya crossing point into the zone, 1.8
miles north of Hasbaya, leveled the building and destroyed a nearby
armored personnel carrier, a police spokesman said.
   After the blast, Israeli troops and their militia allies in
tanks and armored personnel carriers opened fire on Moslem villages
north of the security zone. There were no immediate reports of
casualties, police said.
   Guerrillas of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine used a remote control device to detonate an estimated 110
pounds of TNT at the four corners of the administration building,
the police spokesman said.
   Two guerrillas were arrested later a few miles north of
Zumarraya, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
rules.
   The Zumarraya crossing has been a flashpoint of tensions in
recent days over attempts by the Israeli-backed militiamen to open
a recruitment office in the nearby Moslem hamlet of Shab'a,
according to sources with the United Nations Interim Force In
Lebanon.
   Shab'a residents are known to be sympathetic to Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Since pulling out of Lebanon in 1985, Israeli troops have
maintained a buffer zone in south Lebanon to guard against
cross-border attacks into Israel by Palestinian and Lebanese
guerrillas. The six-to-10 mile deep security zone is policed by
1,000 Israeli troops and 2,000 allied militiamen.

<TEXT>
   District health officials have asked the
Washington Hospital Center to sign an agreement that essentially
admits doctors violated the law by performing a heart-pancreas
transplant without city approval.
   The agreement requires the hospital to set up procedures to
prevent a violation from happening again.
   ``The important thing to do is reestablish the rules. If there
is another violation, I'm not sure we'll be so lenient,'' said
Carolyn Graham, acting director of the District of Columbia's State
Health Planning Agency. She said the city could have sought
financial penalties against the hospital.
   Surgeons at the hospital performed a combined heart-pancreas
transplant Saturday on Barry Katz, 45, of Silver Spring, Md., the
first time such a procedure has been successfully performed in the
United States.
   Katz's doctors argued that they had to go ahead with the
transplant to save the patient's life. Katz was reported in serious
condition following the operation.
   Katz, whose heart was deteriorating, also suffers from diabetes,
which is caused by a defective pancreas. The one-year survival rate
for recipients of pancreas transplants has been estimated at 50
percent.
   On the ``CBS This Morning'' program, one of Katz's physicians,
Dr. John A. Macoviak, said the Defense Department physicist was
feeling better today.
   ``He yelled at me, `I feel lousy, now get me out of bed,'''
Macoviak said.
   The physician added that Katz has not had any insulin for 48
hours. ``We're hoping that we will learn a lot about this disease
diabetes from patients like Dr. Barry Katz,'' he said.
   ``When he got here (March 17) he was deteriorating,'' Macoviak
said Monday. ``His condition did not give us the luxury of time to
consider this.'' Hospital officials were not immediately available
for comment.
   The city has yet to act on an emergency application the hospital
filed late Thursday for permission to perform pancreas transplants.
The hospital has approval to perform heart transplants.

   Convertible owners put their tops down to watch a sneak preview
of summer as Florida-style temperatures reached Michigan, Ohio and
West Virginia today.
   ``It's not normal,'' National Weather Service meterologist Jerry
Orchanian in Charleston, W.Va., said this morning of the 84
degree-reading there Monday and the record-tying 86 forecast for
today. ``Usually we're in the 60s at this time of year, for example
yesterday was about 24 degrees above normal.''
   He credited warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, and said a cold
front will cause temperatures to drop and rain to fall Wednesday.
   A stalled cold front that blocked cool air from entering
Michigan from the south produced temperatures as high as 62 at
Grand Rapids and 59 at Detroit at 5 a.m. today, forecaster Dick
Wagenmaker said.
   In Michigan, Lansing and Flint had record-tying 78-degree
readings Monday, while the same high in Detroit brought tops down
on convertibles and lured joggers outdoors.
   Akron, Ohio, and Norfolk, Va., had 79 and Washington reached 74,
the weather service reported. Forecasters predicted 81-degree highs
today for Norfolk and Washington.
   Columbus and Akron, Ohio, were expected to have 80-degree highs
today, matching the temperature the spring break crowd will be
enjoying in sunnier Daytona Beach, Fla.
   It's too early to pack up coats, of course. Cooling
thunderstorms were expected to bring Flint's high down to the 70s
today and 50s Wednesday, while showers should dunk temperatures
into the 50s in Ohio.

official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency said Larijani was replaced by Mahmoud Vaezi, the
Foreign Ministry's European director. It gave no reason for
Larijani's resignation, which was submitted March 19, the agency
said in the report monitored Sunday in Nicosia.
   Larijani recently went to Moscow for meetings with Soviet

   Five-month-old Christy Andrews, one of
the tiniest infants ever to survive premature delivery, is ready to
come home from the hospital _ five times heavier than at birth but
still only 5 pounds.
   At birth, Christy weighed 15 ounces and measured 10 inches, so
small that neonatologists at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in
Camden rated her chance of survival at less than 5 percent,
according to the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill.
   ``She finally fits into her preemie clothes. She's a nice size
now; she's a cuddly size,'' said Leslie Andrews, 28, who gave birth
to Christy 3 months prematurely in October.
   The baby, who was to come home today, has about an 80 percent
chance of growing up to be a normal child, said Dr. Margaret
Fernandes D'Souza, director of the hospital's neonatal intensive
care unit.
   ``She should catch up and, at the age of 3, should be like any
3-year-old. But a baby who starts off so small usually tends to be
a small child and adult,'' the doctor said.
   As Christy prepared to go home with her family _ her father,
Edward, 31, her sister, Michelle, 8, and her mother _ Mrs. Andrews
shouldered the 15-pound portable oxygen tank that she probably will
be carrying for the next year.
   ``She needs extra oxygen because of her lung damage,'' she said.
``We have two big tanks at home _ in the living room and in the
bedroom _ and the portable one for when we go out.''
   Once a week, Christy will be back at the hospital for a checkup,
and a therapist will visit her at home to monitor her speech,
hearing and motor development.
   ``Babies this size have up to a 25 percent chance of
developmental problems,'' Dr. Fernandes D'Souza said. ``If she
didn't have such a good home to go to, she would be sent to a
rehabilitation hospital for six months to a year.''
   Mrs. Andrews said Christy was ``just skin and bones when she was
born.''
   ``Her skin was transparent, because there was no fat on her,''
the mother said. ``I slipped my wedding band over her hand, and it
went up past her elbow.''

<HEAD>Votes Cast On $8.4 Billion Mass-Transit Plan For Phoenix</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fate of an $8.4 billion highway and
mass-transit program for the Phoenix area rested today with the
voters, who were asked to add a half-penny to their sales tax to
pay for the project.
   Turnout of 30 percent to 35 percent of Maricopa County's 860,000
eligible voters was predicted in the one-issue special election.
   Maricopa County includes Phoenix, Glendale, Scottsdale, Tempe,
Mesa and Chandler. The sales tax varies from city to city; the rate
in Phoenix is 6.7 percent.
   Recent polls indicated that the public was about evenly split on
the program, which calls for a 103-mile elevated railway; an
increase in the number of buses to 1,500 from 350; operation of a
commuter train linking suburban Chandler, Mesa and Tempe with
Phoenix, and accelerated freeway construction.
   The metropolitan area of 2 million people is the nation's
largest without an integrated freeway system, and county residents
have some of the highest auto insurance rates, partly because of
accidents.
   Most of the controversy has focused on whether trains and added
buses would attract enough riders to justify the expense and reduce
air pollution and traffic.
   Neighborhood preservationists and tax-dolllar watchers have
lined up against the increase; politicans and others predicting
huge population growth support it. Cost estimates range from $8.4
billion to $10.4 billion by the year 2019.

   A small group of people lit candles in
the dark outside the Three Mile Island power plant at 4 a.m. today,
the moment the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident began 10
years ago.
   ``It was an accident that changed the world as people knew it,''
said organizer Gene Stilp, a Harrisburg attorney. Seven others
stood by him.
   In the distance, the two 350-foot concrete cooling towers of the
undamaged Unit 1 reactor silently puffed white steam.
   ``It was not the last nuclear accident. ... We're out here to
remind people of that,'' Stilp said. The vigil ended about two
hours later.
   About 150 people marched outside the plant Monday. Residents
nearby said they are still angry about the accident and that they
bear physical and emotional scars.
   ``The so-called accident at TMI was an act of violence against
mankind, an act of violence against the unborn,'' said Jane Lee,
who lives near the plant in Etters, about 10 miles southeast of
Harrisburg.
   The accident began March 28, 1979, when a series of human and
mechanical errors allowed the plant's 150-ton radioactive core to
lose cooling water. Half the core melted and 20 tons of molten
material raced to the bottom of the reactor before it was held in
check by a remaining pool of water. Radioactive gas was released
into the atmosphere over several days.
   Ms. Lee scoffed at how the federal and state governments
responded to the accident and their followup health studies that
found no evidence of accident-related illnesses.
   ``They're lying,'' she said. ``Why is it such a big, dark
secret? ... It must be covered up for national security. With those
kinds of friends, I don't need any enemies.''
   Gordon Tomb, a spokesman for GPU Nuclear Corp., the utility
subsidiary that operates the plant now, said extra people had been
assigned to the main gate this morning. The demonstration was
peaceful.
   Asked about the anniversary, Tomb said, ``We're inclined to take
the opportunity to note the lessons from the Unit 2 accident and
remind ourselves of the importance of remembering those lessons.''
   Officials of General Public Utilities Corp., the plant owner,
have said in the past few weeks that the company has made great
strides since the accident and learned from the mistakes that were
made.
   Since 1985, when TMI Unit 1 returned to operation, they said the
company has shown it has the integrity and capability to safely run
a nuclear power plant.
   The plant owner still faces about 2,000 damage claims.
   Deborah Baker of Middletown, who won a $1 million settlement
from the plant owners' insurance company, said her own research has
convinced her the accident caused her son to be born nine months
after the accident with Down's Syndrome.
   ``If I can touch one person today with my message, then I feel I
have accomplished my goal,'' she said. ``For us, the accident will
always be in our memories.''
   Ernest Sternglass, a professor of radiation physics at the
University of Pittsburgh and a critic of government health studies,
said radiation from the accident boosted infant mortality in
Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland and caused thousands of other
deaths by lowering people's immunity.
   He said government officials manipulated mortality data to hide
the damage and called for a congressional investigation into what
he called ``a scandal here of incredible proportion.''
   ``That's patently absurd,'' replied Faith Schottenfeld, a
spokeswoman for the New York Department of Health.
   ``His allegations are not new,'' said George Tokuhata, research
director for the Pennsylvania Health Department. ``They are
absolutely untrue. It's ridiculous. We don't have an ax to grind.
We're trying to report what we find.''
   Harvey Wasserman, who wrote a book, ``Killing Our Own,'' about
the health effects of nuclear power, said the nuclear industry has
not made all the plant improvements ordered after the accident. He
said only a shutdown of nuclear power would be a fitting memorial.
   ``This marks a decade of false denials and outright lies on the
part of the utility that owns and operates Three Mile Island ...
and on the part of the state of Pennsylvania, which has
systemically obfuscated and hidden any real statistics about the
deaths that have occurred in the wake of the accident at TMI,'' he
said.
   Bob Newlin, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
said TMI requirements are pending at 88 of the nation's 112 nuclear
plants. But he said almost 96 percent of the 10,514 post-accident
modifications have been completed, including most of the
significant safety items.
   In Hanover, N.H., the chairman of the presidential commission
that investigated the accident said he was pleased by the
industry's progress of the past decade.
   ``I'm not saying that every problem has been fixed,'' John
Kemeny said. But he said it was ``very hard for me to believe that
it's the same industry we really tore apart 10 years ago.''

<TEXT>
   A Soviet court convicted a former army colonel of
planting a defective bomb in his wife's airplane luggage and
sentenced him to 13 years in a labor camp, Tass reported today.
   The former colonel, identified only as V. Grib, planned for the
crude explosive device to go off 35 minutes into the 870-mile
commercial flight from the Ukrainian capital of Kiev to the Volga
River city of Kuibyshev, but it failed to detonate, Tass said.
   His wife, who was traveling with their 15-year-old daughter,
found the bomb last summer while unpacking at her relatives' house
and reported it to authorities, the official Soviet news agency
said.
   A court in Kiev found Grib guilty of attempted murder and of
endangering the lives of the 168 passengers and eight crew members
on board the plane. He also was found guilty of trying to destroy
the airliner and of making an explosive device, Tass said. The
agency did not say when the conviction or sentencing occurred.
   Grib was working as an engineer at a Kiev factory at the time of
the incident, and Tass reported earlier that he disappeared after
learning the plane had landed safely. He later was located by
police.

   Soviet voters offered their first real choice in
70 years spurned many Communist Party and government leaders in a
stunning rejection of the status quo, election returns showed today.
   Moscow's mayor, its No. 2 Communist Party leader, five regional
party chairmen in the Ukraine, and Communist Party chiefs in
Leningrad and Kiev were all rejected Sunday in elections for the
new Congress of People's Deputies.
   Asked if the results indicated a loss of confidence in the
Communist Party, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said today: ``Maybe they were wrong for their posts. Maybe they
failed to advertise their platforms.
   ``As far as party members are concerned, about 20 percent of
party members lost, 80 percent won,'' he said.
   The voters' rejection of top local officials for the national
parliament did not sweep them from their jobs in the party or
government apparatus. However, it could weaken their power base and
eventually lead to their replacement.
   Gerasimov said local party organizations would examine the cases
of officials who lost their races and decide their futures.
   Voters appeared to be expressing dissatisfaction with the
inefficiency and mismanagement associated with an entrenched party
elite that many see as resisting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
efforts to reform Soviet society, to end chronic food shortages and
improve the quality of life.
   The 1,500 winners in Sunday's vote and in subsequent runoffs
will join those chosen earlier by the party and other officially
sanctioned organizations in the 2,250-seat congress, which is
certain to be dominated by the Communists.
   Still, many indepedent voices are expected to make a lively body
of the congress, which will meet once a year to choose a standing
legislature and the country's president.
   Final figures were not available on voter turnout, but figures
from individual cities indicated it was high. The Communist Party
paper Pravda said 89 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the
southern city of Krasnodar and 90.3 percent voted in the Ukrainian
city of Kharkov.
   Officials at the Central Election Commission in Moscow said Yuri
Solovyev, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo and regional
party chief in Leningrad, was defeated in the election even though
he was unopposed. Enough voters crossed Solovyev's name off the
ballots to deny him the required majority and force a runoff.
   Election officials said two full Politburo members, Ukrainian
party leader Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky and Russian republic
President Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, won seats without opposition, as
did the premier of the Russian republic, Alexander V. Vlasov.
Vlasov is a candidate Politburo member.
   City officials in Voronezh, where Vorotnikov was a candidate,
said he received 84 percent of the more than 2 million votes cast
in his district. Totals were not available for Shcherbitsky's
district in Dnepropetrovsk and Vlasov's in Rostov, but the Moscow
officials said both won.
   As returns were reported, Boris N. Yeltsin left Moscow for a
vacation after the resounding success of his anti-establishment
candidacy for Moscow's sole at-large seat in the new congress.
   Yeltsin received 89.4 percent of the vote in Moscow, a city he
ran as Communist Party chief until he was sacked in November 1987
for criticizing the party's style of leadership and warning of a
Stalin-like cult developing around Gorbachev.
   Voters did not get a chance to voice their opinion of Yeltsin's
replacement as Moscow party boss, Politburo member Lev N. Zaikov.
Like Gorbachev and most other Politburo members, he took one of the
100 seats alloted to the Communist Party in the new congress.
   But two other top Moscow officials _ Mayor Valery Saikin and
Communist Party second secretary Yuri Prokofiev _ faced voters
Sunday and were denied seats in the congress.
   Saikin received 42.5 percent of the vote, while his opponent
received 24.8 percent, the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported. A
new election will be held.
   Prokofiev received only 13.5 percent of the vote in his
district. The winner was Vladimir Markov, director of a radio
communications institute, the newspaper said.
   Tass reported Leningrad party leader Anatoly Gerasimov received
only 15 percent of the vote in a contest with a shipbuilder.
   The official news agency said the regional Communist Party
leaders in Kiev, Voroshilovograd, the Carpathian region, Lvov and
Chernigov all were defeated.
   Pravda reported that regional party leader in the Ural Mountains
city of Perm was defeated, but that regional party leaders in
Volgograd, Krasnodar, Kursk, Omsk, Stavropol, and Kharkov won
election.
   Another defeated candidate was the commander of Soviet forces in
East Germany, Gen. Boris Snetkov. Voters in a district east of
Moscow favored another military officer, Lt. Col. Viktor Podzeruk,
by 1.8 million votes to 871,000 for Snetkov, local journalists
reported.
   In the Baltic republics, candidates from grassroots movements
that have tapped popular dissatisfaction with Moscow's control over
their economies, cultures and politics generally fared well in the
election.
   In Estonia, Edgar Savisaar, a founder of the People's Front, won
more than 80 percent of the vote in defeating a local party chief.
Another Estonian People's Front leader, Marju Lauristen, also
received more than 80 percent to defeat the editor of a
Russian-language newspaper.
   Lithuania's president, Vitautas Astrauskas, and its premier,
Vitautas Sakalauskas, were defeated. Sajudis, the Lithuanian
grassroots movement, claimed all 39 of its candidates either won or
advanced to run-off elections, which are scheduled for April 9.
   Latvia's premier, Vilnis Bresis, lost to a television reporter,
and the republic's party chief, Janis Vagris, was elected by a
small margin, Tass said.

   Space shuttle Atlantis next month
will carry out the nation's first interplanetary launch in 12 years
when it sends the Magellan probe toward Venus to map the planet
surface with super-sharp radar.
   ``I believe that we are looking at a rejuvenation, if you will,
of the planetary space program, that is very important, that has
been in the doldrums for a while due to budgetary concerns and, of
course recently, to a lack of launches,'' Atlantis commander Dave
Walker said Monday at a news conference with his four crewmates.
   Shuttle missions were grounded for nearly three years in the
wake of the Challenger explosion, which killed its seven astronauts
Jan. 28, 1986.
   Walker said the upcoming Atlantis flight is a ``logical marriage
between the manned and unmanned space programs.''
   Magellan will be the nation's first interplanetary launch in 12
years and the first from a shuttle, noted astronaut Ronald Grabe,
who will pilot Atlantis.
   ``So Magellan will be a very fulfilling flight for us. Not only
when we launch it, but 15 months later when it orbits Venus,'' he
said.
   The shuttle is scheduled to begin its four-day mission April 28.
Deployment of Magellan, the crew's primary goal, is scheduled to
occur about six hours after blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
After Magellan is released from the cargo bay, a payload motor will
start the 8,000-pound probe on a 466-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to reach its destination on Aug. 10, 1990, swooping
into orbit around Venus to begin a 243-day period during which it
is to map the entire surface of the planet with high-resolution
radar.
   ``Venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space, mass and
size,'' said astronaut Norm Thagard. ``Planetary science is very
important to learning how the Earth evolved and what is going on
here. ... We worry about the greenhouse effect here on Earth.
Magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between Earth and
Venus.''
   Mary Cleave, a mission specialist on Atlantis, said the radar
images could also show whether Venus has shifting crustal plates
similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes.
   ``Because there is no water on Venus, the radar can look at the
entire planet and this might help us understand plate tectonics on
Earth,'' she said.
   Earth and Venus were almost identical at the beginning of the
solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Today, Venus is shrouded
in a cloud of gases and its surface temperature is 900 degrees.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Recovering Attorneys' Fees in Texas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
those who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits to recover
their attorneys' fees.
   The court, in a case involving Texas school teachers, ruled
unanimously that those who prevail on a ``significant'' issue in
such suits are entitled to reimbursement for legal fees even if
they lose the ``central'' issue.
   The court ruled in favor of teachers in the Garland Independent
School District who challenged anti-union regulations imposed by
school officials.
   The regulations barred teacher union representatives from
visiting schools during regular school hours or using school public
address systems or other communications facilities.
   The rules also prohibited private conversations among teachers
regarding the employee organizations and also barred any teacher
from using a school's internal mail system or bulletin board
facilities.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the regulations
affecting union representatives. But the appeals court said it
violates free-speech and free-association rights of teachers to ban
private conversations or prevent them from using the mail or
bulletin board facilities.
   The appeals court also ruled that the Texas State Teachers
Association and the Garland Education Association, which filed the
suit, are not entitled to be reimbursed for attorneys' fees.
   Federal civil rights law provides that ``the prevailing party''
in such cases is entitled to reimbursement from the losing side.
The idea is to give an incentive to lawyers to represent civil
rights plaintiffs, who may lack the financial resources to hire
lawyers.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her opinion for the high court
today, said the teachers are entitled to reimbursement even though
they lost the central issue of the case.
   She said under federal law, ``A prevailing party must be one who
has succeeded on any significant claim affording it some of the
relief sought.''
   Otherwise, O'Connor said, there would have to be
``excruciating'' inquiries by federal judges to determine the
intent of lawsuits.
   ``The search for the central and tangential issues in the
lawsuit, or for the primary as opposed to the secondary relief
sought, much like the search for the Golden Fleece, distracts
(judges) from the primary purposes'' of the civil rights law, she
said.
   The case is Texas State Teachers Association vs. Garland
Independent School District, 87-1759.

   The rugged wilderness that makes Prince
William Sound a rich marine habitat stands as a barrier to efforts
to rescue the thousands of animals expected to be fouled by
America's biggest oil spill, officials say.
   ``There's just a lot of problems out there,'' said Pam Bergman,
head of the regional response team for the U.S. Department of the
Interior.
   Problems cited by Bergman and others include:
   _A coastline so remote that rescuers are afraid to send out
volunteers for fear they might not be prepared for wilderness
survival;
   _Beaches so rugged that in many places it is impossible to land
a boat, let alone chase down and capture oil-coated birds or
wildlife;
   _Distances to aid facilities so great that animals captured on
the beach would probably die in captivity waiting to be taken to a
hospital;
   _Wild animals so large and powerful that rescuers could be
seriously injured.
   A body count of dead animals is about all anyone can hope to
accomplish, said Jon Lyman, Alaska Department of Fish and Game
spokesman. That count stood at fewer than 100 birds late Monday,
but thousands more are expected to die.
   Bergman said environmental groups have begun organizing to help,
but she has asked the volunteers not to come to Valdez. There is no
place to stay, no boats to take people out, no equipment and
nothing to do, she said.
   Officials in the state of Washington estimated that 10,000 birds
died there after a barge spilled 231,000 gallons of bunker oil off
the coast last year. Bunker oil is thicker than the North Slope
crude that spilled in Prince William Sound, but the Washington
spill was only about one-fiftieth the size of the spill near Valdez.
   In Washington, rescuers were able to mobilize thousands of
volunteers who could easily get to the scene.
   In Alaska, strong winds Monday and Tuesday pushed the oil
farther from the rescue coordination center at Valdez, beyond the
reach of would-be animal rescuers, and made it impossible to
retrieve oil-soaked wildlife, Bergman said.
   Bergman said there is no place to put a rescue facility any
closer to the advance of the oil slick, which covers more than 100
square miles. There are no communities in the southwest portion of
the sound, an area of rocky reefs and tree-studded islands.
   A lot of the beaches are too small, she said, and catching birds
from boats is out for safety reasons.
   ``It's real hard to sneak up on (birds),'' she said. ``You end
up racing the birds down the beach with a net trying to catch them.
Once you capture an oiled bird, you can't leave it in a box for 12
hours.''
   Contaminated birds must go almost immediately to a
rehabilitation center to be fed, de-oiled and dried.
   Sea otters present even bigger problems, she added. ``They look
sweet and cuddly and wonderful, but they got sharp teeth and
claws,'' Bergman said.

<HEAD>Belgian Hero Guerisse Dead At 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Guerisse, a hero of the Belgian
underground who helped Allied airmen escape from occupied Europe
during World War II, has died at age 78, his family said today.
   Guerisse died Sunday. His family did not give the cause of death.
   Guerisse was an army doctor when Nazi Germany invaded Belgium in
1940 and fled to Gibraltar after the Belgian army's surrender. He
joined a British Royal Navy special operations unit and, using the
name Patrick O'Leary, participated in secret missions in the
Mediterranean.
   Captured by the Germans, he escaped and returned to Belgium
where he headed an underground network through which hundreds of
Allied airmen, shot down over the continent, returned to England.
   In 1943, he was arrested for a second time by the Gestapo and
was held in several concentration camps, including Dachau, where he
was tortured and sentenced to death. The end of the war prevented
his execution.
   After the war, Guerisse joined the Belgian army's medical corps.
He volunteered for service as a major in a Belgian batallion during
the Korean War.
   Later, he was appointed to head the Belgian army's medical corps
with the rank of major-general.

   A privately owned rocket
ship carrying experiments on weightlessness will blast off on a
15-minute mission Wednesday, the nation's first licensed commercial
space flight.
   The flight of Consort I, owned by Space Services Inc. of
Washington, marks another stage in the private space research
efforts that gained in significance after the 1986 Challenger
tragedy.
   ``This launch you can probably trace to the Challenger disaster,
because these experiments were hoped to be carried aboard the
Challenger or future shuttles,'' said Walter Pennino, an investor
and spokesman for Space Services.
   The company launched the first privately financed space shot,
Conestoga I, with a dummy payload in 1982. Since then, the federal
government has begun licensing private launches, and Consort I is
the first to get the green light.
   Conestoga I proved private industry could launch spacecraft, and
also showed that the government was unprepared for the new
industry, Pennino said.
   ``There was no single agency we or anyone else could go to and
ask if we could do this,'' Pennino said, adding his firm had to
consult with the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal
Communications Commission and Defense Department, among other
agencies.
   The Department of Transportation was assigned the task of
licensing private launches and coordinating with different
agencies. Consort I received its license from the department's new
Office of Commercial Space Transportation.
   Consort I's 650-pound payload will include experiments that will
measure how liquids mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms
and cures, how liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in
weightlessness and how finely powdered metals bond under high
temperature to produce alloys without melting.
   The experiments have applications in the manufacture of
medicines, alloys and ball bearings, and in the construction of
future space stations.
   The payload was assembled by the University of
Alabama-Huntsville's Consortium for Materials Development in Space,
one of 16 NASA-sponsored consortiums for the commercial development
of space.
   Consort I will be boosted into space by a modified Terrier Navy
rocket; the second stage is a Black Brant rocket. The entire
vehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds at liftoff.
   The rocket will achieve a top speed of 5,016 mph, and in a
little less than five minutes will rise 198 miles above Earth. It
will land about 50 miles north of the launch site.
   The entire venture should cost about $2 million, including the
cost of reimbursing White Sands for the use of its time and
personnel, Pennino said.

   Federal criminal defendants who fail to
persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because of alleged
misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are tried and
convicted, the Supreme Court said today.
   The unanimous ruling is a defeat for a Buffalo, N.Y.,
contracting firm and its president, both charged with rigging bids
in selling liquid bituminous coal to the state and some western
counties.
   The justices upheld the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals'
refusal to hear arguments by Midland Asphalt Corp. and Albert C.
Litteer that grand jury abuses by prosecutors tainted the
indictment.
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said federal court
rules bar criminal defendants, once a judge dismisses such
allegations in pretrial proceedings, from appealing immediately to
a federal appeals court.
   Scalia said Midland and Litteer, indicted in early 1987, must
wait until after a trial is conducted, and pursue their
prosecutorial-misconduct arguments if they are convicted.
   The decision resolves conflicting rulings between the New York
City-based 2nd Circuit court and the San Francisco-based 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The 9th Circuit court had ruled that dismissals of such
allegations are immediately appealable.
   Lawyers for Midland and Liteer contend that prosecutors violated
federal rules by disclosing details of a grand jury investigation
to the public.
   They said the information was released in connection with a
separate civil case.
   The case is Midland Asphalt vs. U.S., 87-1905.

   Three evangelists accused of molesting
scores of boys along the Southern revival circuit represent
``everything bad under the sun,'' a federal judge said in
sentencing them to a combined 47 years in prison.
   ``All of you have preyed on the uneducated and the poor, because
I think anyone else would have seen through you, and you've
blackened the eye of religion,'' U.S. District Judge James C. Turk
said Monday.
   Mario ``Tony'' Leyva, 42, of Columbus, Ga., and the two other
traveling preachers pleaded guilty to transporting boys across
state lines for sexual purposes. Leyva and Rias Edward Morris also
pleaded guilty to conspiracy.
   Leyva, who has admitted to having sexual relations with as many
as 100 boys over the past two decades, received the maximum of 20
years in prison. He already is serving 2{ years on state charges he
sexually abused two boys.
   Morris, 47, an organist for Leyva, received the maximum 15-year
sentence.
   Freddie H. Herring, 50, of Lighthouse Assembly of Dougasville,
Ga., also faced up to 15 years but received a 12-year term.
Testimony indicated he has diabetes and a heart condition.
   The maximum sentences were spelled out in plea agreements in
October. Each defendant also was fined $5,000.
   Authorities identified more than 30 boys molested by Leyva.
Morris was accused of having sexual relations with 11 youngsters,
Herring with nine.
   The judge, noting that Leyva committed acts he told his
followers were sinful, said, ``Everyone who ever heard you out
there ought to kick you good.''
   That brought a cheer from those assembled in court, including
some victims and their families.
   All three men expressed regret in court, but government
psychologists testified the preachers expressed little remorse and
blamed their victims by characterizing them as promiscuous.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennie Montgomery asked for the maximum
sentences ``solely for the protection of the public.''
   Psychiatrist William H. Gray, who said he counseled four of the
evangelists' victims, said the judge should consider castration as
part of the sentences. ``Massive doses of estrogen also is a
possibility,'' Gray said.

   The head of Israel's police ordered policemen
not to put ``press'' signs on their cars while searching for
Palestinians suspects unless they have his permission, a day after
saying the practice was to continue.
   Journalists' plans to put ``police on duty'' signs in their own
cars were canceled after the agreement with Police
Inspector-General David Krauss.
   The decision came after an appeal from Jerusalem's Journalists
Association, which said the officers' use of press signs could
endanger reporters traveling in the occupied territories and Arab
east Jerusalem to cover the Palestinian uprising.
   Palestinian youths routinely stone cars with yellow Israeli
license plates but are more likely to let journalists pass
peacefully. Arab-owned cars in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip have blue or white license plates.
   Members of the Journalists Association met today with Krauss to
ask him to forbid the decoy method even though the police chief
said Monday the signs were not illegal and that police were to
continue using them.
   Krauss responded today with a statement saying he will instruct
police units to refrain from impersonating journalists unless they
have his permission.
   ``Any request by police figures to make use of such means will
be subject to the approval of the inspector general,'' the
statement said.
   ``I am satisfied,'' said Elisha Shpigelman, chairman of the
Journalists Association, after his meeting with Krauss. ``I
certainly see this as an acceptance, though not fully, of our
position.''
   On Thursday, several Western news agencies and an Israeli
photographer filmed Jerusalem police driving a rented car with a
handwritten sign saying ``TV'' and arresting a 15-year-old Arab
girl for throwing stones.
   Israeli journalists and the Foreign Press Association condemned
the ruse, but Krauss defended the practice as legal.
   ``The policemen did not disguise themselves as journalists,'' he
said in a television interview. ``They camouflaged their vehicle in
one of the possible camouflage ways.''
   ``The police have very difficult and very important duties in
the field including arresting stone-throwers and firebombers on the
spot without harming them and I think that's preferable,'' Krauss
said.
   Shaked said on Israeli radio that the practice endangers freedom
of the press. Another journalist leader, Gabi Brun, said the
Journalists' Union planned to distribute signs saying ``Police on
Duty'' for reporters' cars.
   Meanwhile, an organization of Jewish settlers in the West Bank
said it plans to distribute thousands of ``Press'' signs to
settlers in the area.
   If reporters are stoned as a result, ``maybe they'll understand
the distress of the settlers,'' the Committee for Secure Roads said
in a statement.
   About 70,000 settlers live among the 1.7 million Palestinians in
the occupied lands, which Israel seized in 1967.
   The settlers often have been involved in confrontations with
Arabs during the 15-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli
rule, and complain that the news media pays little attention to
their problems.

   The White House has told President Bush's
legal counsel to keep internal policy disputes inside the
administration and off the front pages of newspapers.
   Straying from a course set by Bush, C. Boyden Gray had publicly
challenged a new agreement with Congress on Central America,
arguing that it dilutes the constitutional powers of the president.
   It is highly unusual for an official serving at the pleasure of
the president to publicly criticize a policy the president has
endorsed, but that's just what Gray did.
   ``There's a lot of discussion of this and a feeling that it was
really a somewhat bizarre occurrence and shouldn't have happened,''
said one senior White House official. ``The general rule of thumb
for senior White House aides is that they're not supposed to be on
the front pages of the newspapers, particularly not raising
concerns about the president's policies.''
   The official, who declined to be identified, says Gray was
``backing off'' on his challenge.
   Another White House official, also speaking anonymously, said:
``Gray was told, `Dumb move, but move on (to other subjects).' It's
not as if everybody's wringing their hands over this.''
   Asked today for his reaction to Gray's comments, Bush said,
``No, but I shared my reaction with Boyden. That's how I handle
things.''
   Bush on Monday also sidestepped whether he was mad at Gray for
putting a critical spotlight on the first major plank of the
administration's emerging foreign policy.
   ``On a day like this, I'm not angry at anybody,'' Bush said at
the annual Easter egg roll on the South Lawn, surrounded by
thousands of youngsters.
   White House officials made clear, however, that they thought
Gray had blundered.
   ``I can't tell you what was in Boyden Gray's mind,'' said press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``That's more than I can handle.''
   Fitzwater said White House chief of staff John Sununu dealt with
Gray. ``They had a polite discussion about how things work in the
White House,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said he was not aware if Gray had been told to work
within administration channels instead of complaining to the press.
However, Fitzwater said: ``I think that's a good idea. I'd tell him
that.''
   It was the second time in two months that Gray had shed the
traditional anonymity of the counsel's position to pose a challenge
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the chief architect of
the Central America accord and one of the most powerful figures in
the administration.
   Earlier, Gray had questioned the propriety of Baker holding
stocks in a New York bank with outstanding Third World loans. Baker
denied any impropriety but sold the stocks. Fitzwater said he was
not aware of any problem between Gray and Baker.
   Gray ignited the latest controversy by telling The New York
Times that the agreement Bush announced Friday with Congress allows
lawmakers to encroach too far on the constitutional powers of the
president to conduct foreign affairs.
   The accord provides $4.5 million a month in non-lethal aid for
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. A side letter stipulates that the
money will not continue after November without the approval of four
key congressional committees.
   Gray complained that he had not had a chance to review details
contained in the side letter. Moreover, he said he had reservations
about the pact.
   Brushing aside Gray's objections, Fitzwater said the agreement
had been reviewed by Bush, Baker, Sununu, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and two legal counselors at the State Department.
Fitzwater said they didn't feel it needed further staff review.
   ``Their conclusion was and our conclusion is that the
president's powers were enhanced by this agreement, there was no
abrogation of authority and that this is an agreement that brings
to conclusion years of dissension between the executive and the
legislative branch, brings to a halt many of the practices of the
Congress dealing directly in foreign policy, which was a threat to
presidential authority,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``So our feeling is this is very helpful in this regard.''
   Gray has refused to comment since Sunday, when Baker discussed
the dispute on a television news program.

   Earl Nightingale, a radio
commentator and voice of the adventure character Sky King during
the 1950s, has died at age 68.
   The gravel-voiced broadcaster, who died Saturday at Scottsdale
Memorial Hospital of complications following heart surgery, was
also a pioneer in the production of motivational audiotapes.
   After serving in World War II, where he was one of only 12
Marines to survive the 1941 attack on the USS Arizona in Pearl
Harbor, he began a daily talk show, ``Our Changing World,'' on
radio station WGN in Chicago.
   It went into syndication in 1949 and still is carried across the
nation and in a number of countries overseas.
   From 1950 to 1954, Nightingale was the radio voice of ``Sky
King,'' an adventure about a rancher who used an airplane instead
of a horse to fight bad guys.
   In 1960, Nightingale and Lloyd Conant formed the
Nightingale-Conant Corp.
   Vic Conant, a son of Nightingale's late partner, said the
company produces tapes by Nightingale and other motivational
speakers, including Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca.
   Nightingale is survived by his wife, Diana; two sons, and a
daughter.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   States may not tax federal pensions while
exempting the pensions of retired state and local government
workers, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices struck down Michigan's differing
tax treatment of the pensions received by retired government
employees.
   The challenged Michigan law ``violates principles of
intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local
government employees over retired federal employees,'' Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
   He said Paul S. Davis, an East Lansing lawyer, is entitled to a
refund of $4,299 on taxes he paid from 1979 through 1984.
   Davis worked for the federal government at various times in his
career, retiring in 1980.
   He challenged the Michigan law that allows federal retirees
living in the state to deduct only up to $7,500 of their annual
federal pensions when computing their state tax liability.
   The law permits retired employees of the state government and
local governments within Michigan to deduct all their state
pensions from their state taxes.
   The Michigan Court of Appeals had upheld the law, but that
ruling was reversed today.
   Kennedy said the law violates a federal law that authorizes
states to tax federal employees ``if the taxation does not
discriminate against the ... employee because of the source of the
pay or compensation.''
   The justices rejected arguments by Michigan authorities that the
law applies only to federal employees _ and not to federal
pensioners.
   Under the Michigan law, federal pensioners faced the same state
tax liabiity as private industry retirees while state and local
government pensioners do not.
   The court said the inequity among government workers may not
continue. But the justices left it up to Michigan courts to decide
whether the proper remedy would be exempting all federal pensions
from state taxes or exposing the pensions of state and local
government retirees to some state taxation.
   According to the National Association of Retired Federal
Employees, at least five other states give special preferences to
state or local government retirees not afforded to federal retirees.
   Those states are Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, New York and
Virginia.
   Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter. ``I cannot
join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a state's power
to administer its own affairs,'' he wrote.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Made it easier for those who win partial victories in civil
rights lawsuits to recover their attorneys' fees.
   The court, in a case involving Texas school teachers, ruled
unanimously that those who prevail on a ``significant'' issue in
such suits are entitled to reimbursement for legal fees even if
they lose the ``central'' issue.
   _ Ruled that federal criminal defendants who fail to persuade a
judge to throw out their indictments because of alleged misconduct
by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are tried and convicted.
   The unanimous ruling is a defeat for a Buffalo, N.Y.,
contracting firm and its president, both charged with rigging bids
in selling liquid biruminous coal to the state and some western
counties.
   The pension case is Davis vs. Michigan Department of Treasury,
87-1020.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Extradite Britons To U.S. To Face Drug Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Spanish high court has granted a U.S.
request for extradition of a Briton wanted for allegedly
masterminding a worldwide hashish and marijuana smuggling ring,
court sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Audiencia Nacional court agreed to extradite Dennis Howard Marks to
face trial on federal drug smuggling charges in Miami.
   The sources also said the court agreed to a U.S. request for the
extradition of Marks' wife, Judith, on related charges.
   Last July 25, Spanish police working with agents of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Marks, 43, his wife and a
third Briton, Geoffrey Kenion, at the Marks' house in Palma de
Majorca, a Spanish Mediterranean island.
   On that same day, an indictment unsealed in the federal court in
Miami named Marks as the alleged leader of a worldwide ring that
shipped tons of drugs from Asia to the United States, Britain and
several countries in Western Europe from 1970 to 1987.
   Mrs. Marks, Kenion and 19 other people were named in the
indictment as ring members.
   The court said the extradition carried a condition that U.S.
authorities limit any possible prison sentence for both Marks and
his wife to 30 years, the maximum permitted under Spanish law.
   Before the Marks can be sent to the United States, the Spanish
government must approve the extradition request.
   Thomas Cash, head of the DEA's Miami office, has described
Marks, an Oxford University graduate from London, as ``the Marco
Polo of drug trafficking.''

   An estimated 2,500 AIDS activists picketed City
Hall today, protesting what they said was inaction in dealing with
the disease, and nearly 100 were arrested, police said.
   Police carried, dragged and escorted away protesters who sat in
the street chanting, ``We will never be silent again.'' Most of the
arrests occurred after demonstrators blocked major roads such as
the Brooklyn Bridge off-ramp.
   Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct. The 8 a.m.
demonstration was over in about two hours.
   The demonstrators, organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, shouted ``ACT-UP, fight back, fight AIDS,'' and ```Just say
no' is not enough, teach safe sex.''
   The group demanded improved and expanded health care; safe
housing for homeless people infected with the AIDS virus; free
treatment for all drug users, and AIDS education that ``teaches
protection, not morality.''
   ``We're here because we're angry, because we're dying and the
mayor won't do what he has to do,'' said Ann Northrop, an AIDS
educator who works with adolescents.
   Michael Nesline, a registered nurse at Bellevue Hospital, said
Mayor Edward I. Koch failed to prepare the hospital system for the
expected increase in AIDS cases, especially among the poor and
uninsured.
   ``Thousands of people will be dying in the street in a couple of
years. Ed Koch is making political decisions, making decisions for
a few rich people,'' Nesline said.
   Koch said in a statement that New York City ``does more than any
other city or state to serve the needs of those with AIDS and to
prevent its spread to others.'' He said the federal government is
not doing its part.

   Police fired on hundreds of ethnic
Albanian protesters in Kosovo province today, killing at least one
person and wounding 14, in rioting against Serbia's bid to gain
more control over the region, authorities said.
   Serbia's parliament today formally adopted constitutional
changes to increase authority over government and schools in
Kosovo, the republic's autonomous southern province bordering
Albania.
   Six straight days of protests since Kosovo's parliament approved
the changes have left 21 people dead and scores injured,
authorities said. It is Kosovo's worst violence since 1981, when
nine people died in ethnic riots and the province was briefly
placed under martial law.
   The ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.9
million citizens, say the constitutional changes will curb the
broad autonomy they won under the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution.
   Serbia says the changes are needed to protect the province's
Slav minority, which alleges constant harassment from the ethnic
Albanians.
   The federal Interior Ministry, in a statement issued in the
capital Belgrade, said extra police forces from throughout the
country were being dispatched to Kosovo.
   The ministry, in the statement published by the official Tanjug
news agency, said two policemen were shot dead Monday and 25 police
were injured, five seriously, in the two days of unrest. Nineteen
demonstrators lost their lives, and 49 were injured, the ministry
said, adding that police were not responsible for all the deaths.
   Maria Gasi, a spokeswoman for Kosovo's information secretariat,
told a news conference told foreign correspondents at a news
conference that a dusk-to-dawn curfew in effect since Monday would
apply to them. She told foreign photographers they would no longer
be allowed to shoot pictures in Kosovo.
   Authorities on Monday also banned gatherings of more than three
people. Schools, the university, cinemas, theaters and sports
stadiums were closed indefinitely.
   Police in Djakovice used tear gas ``and other technical means''
today against a crowd of several hundred chanting, rock-throwing
youths, Tanjug said.
   Today's death and injuries came in a fierce clash in Zur, a
village neaer the Albanian border, and more violence was reported
from Orohovac, where about 250 stone-throwing ethnic Albanians were
said to have smashed windows.
   Tanjug said an 18-year-old youth died in Zur when police opened
fire after shots came from a rock-throwing crowd of about 500. The
crowd wrecked two police vehicles, the agency said.
   Ms. Gasi reported major incidents today in Zur, and the towns of
Prizren, Djakovice, Dusanovo and Orahovac.
   Tanjug said tear gas was fired to disperse crowds in Orahovac,
Djakovice and Dusanovo, where it reported an unspecified number of
injuries. Tear gas also was used in Decani, it said.
   Security was tight in Pristina, the provincial capital, 160
miles south of Belgrade, with dozens of military vehicles visible
and frequent patrols by riot police, some wearing bulletproof
jackets.
   Sonic booms were heard as military jets flew low overhead, a
tactic that was used in Pristina last September to try and
discourage unrest.
   Tanjug said Monday's riots appeared ``well prepared and
coordinated.''
   There have been allegations that ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are
part of an underground separatist movement that wants to join with
neighboring Communist Albania.
   The continuation of violence despite Monday's clampdown and
dozens of arrests after a partial state of emegency was declared in
Kosovo last month indicated the strength of ethnic Albanian anger
over the constitutional changes.
   Tanjug reported celebrations in factories and schools in several
Serbian towns today after the parliament formally approved the
changes.
   A rally was scheduled later in Belgrade to celebrate the passage
of the constitutional reforms, which give Serbia more control over
the judiciary, schools and police in its provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina.
   The Serbian drive for more control over Kosovo has produced
nationwide divisions in the Communist leadership of this
non-aligned and ethnically diverse country.

   President Bush today dispatched three senior
federal officials to Alaska's oil-polluted Prince William Sound to
``take a hard look at where this disaster stands'' and said there
are conflicting reports on whether Exxon's cleanup of the massive
spill is sufficient.
   A federal takeover of the cleanup operation is one option that
will be considered, the president told reporters at an Oval Office
meeting with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Bill Reilly and Coast Guard
Commandant Paul Yost.
   Bush said he would asked the three ``to go up to Alaska to take
a hard look at where this disaster stands.'' They were leaving
immediately after the White House.
   ``I think it's important these top officials, federal officials,
go there and then they will report to me after they've had a chance
to assess the situation on the ground,'' the president said.
   Bush said the spillage of 11 million gallons of oil from the
tanker Exxon Valdez, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, was ``a
matter of tremendous concern to Alaskans and to all of us.''
   Asked whether Exxon, which is overseeing the cleanup effort, was
doing enough and if he was satisfied with the pace of the effort,
he said:
   ``They're certainly making a good beginning here, but there are
some conflicting reports on that. I don't want to prejudge that. I
think one of the things that we're interested in hearing is exactly
how our top officials feel the cleanup is going.''
   A federal takeover of the operation is ``an option,'' Bush said.
``And then the question is: is that the most prudent way to go. And
that's one of the recommendations I'll be awaiting.''
   Both Bush and Skinner hinted that Exxon might face big civil
penalties.
   ``There are a variety of legal options that are available. But
now the primary consideration is to make sure everything possible
is being done,'' Skinner said.
   ``And the president has directed us to assess that, that oil is
being contained and that the oil that remains on the tanker is
being offloaded as quick as possible. That is our primary objective
as mandated by the president. We'll then later on worry about who
is going to pay for the damage.''
   Bush said, ``the thing is to get it cleaned up, to protect the
very precious environment out there, to make sure everything is
being done to clean up this disaster. And then we'll have all these
penalties and all that later on.''
   Bush said he still supports a proposal to open a pristine arctic
wildlife refuge to oil drilling faces more intense scrutiny after
the spill of millions of gallons of oil into environmentally
sensitive waters off the Alaska coast.
   ``There's no connection'' between that and the oil spill, he
said.
   Bush has endorsed what he calls ``environmentally prudent'' oil
exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an expanse of
wilderness that is home to caribou, polar bears and a variety of
waterfowl in the northeastern reaches of Alaska.
   But some members of Congress, which must approve opening the
refuge for drilling, said Monday the oil tanker spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound _ the worst such spill in U.S. history _
raises questions about whether environmental safeguards can be
assured.
   It's too early to tell whether the controversy over the spill
will dash the oil industry's hopes for quick passage this year of
legislation allowing drilling in the refuge. Such a bill earlier
this month cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' Washington
lobbying group, called the spill ``very regrettable'' and said
simply: ``We cannot tell what impact it might have on pending
petroleum industry issues here in Washington.''
   At a news conference today, 11 major environmental groups
blasted the oil industry for breaking promises of assuring that
environmental accidents such as the spill in Alaska would not
occur, or if they happen would be quickly cleaned up.
   ``The great accident they said wouldn't happen has now
happened,'' said Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club.
   Brock Evans of the National Audubon Society said, ``We've had
enough of oil industry promises. They can't be kept.''
   Other speakers from the environmental movement ridiculed
suggestions that the Exxon Valdez tanker spill is an isolated
accident. They cited other tanker spills in recent years, although
of a much lesser magnitude, still harmful to the environment.
   ``The term environmentally safe oil development is a
contradiction,'' said Lisa Spear of the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate environmental
protection subcommittee, said Monday the spill ``is the latest and
most tragic evidence of the gap that exists between past industry
assurances and actual industry performance in preventing
environmental damage.''
   Another member of the environmental panel, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., suggested that the spill and the problems
containing it ``graphically refute those who maintain that the oil
industry in Alaska does not harm the environment.''
   Meanwhile, a House Interior subcommittee with jurisdiction over
Alaska oil drilling plans hearings into the spill and its
significance for opening the Alaska refuge to oil exploration.
   ``Obviously the tanker spill and the inadequacy of the cleanup
effort could have serious implications for the expansion of North
Slope oil development,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Interior subcommittee on water, power and offshore
energy resources.
   Oil companies and the environmental movement have been facing
off over exploratory drilling in the Alaska wildlife refuge for
several years since preliminary indications raised the prospect of
finding more than 3 billion barrels of crude under the region's
tundra.
   Bills opening the refuge for drilling are under consideration in
both the House and Senate. Legislation also has been introduced to
declare the refuge a formal wilderness area, which would prohibit
oil or gas development.
   The oil industry wants exploratory drilling along a 1.5
million-acre coastal stretch of the refuge which also is the
breeding ground for North America's largest remaining herd of
migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears, musk oxen,
wolves, arctic foxes and an assortment of waterfowl.

<HEAD>Britain Won't Recognize Afghan Guerrillas; Promises Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's foreign secretary, Sir
Geoffrey Howe, ended a 26-hour official visit to Pakistan today and
said Britain could not recognize neighboring Afghanistan's
guerrilla government-in-exile.
   Howe said he promised the equivalent of about $3 million to
non-government organizations helping refugees from the Afghan war.
He then left Pakistan for India.
   About 3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan and another 2
million in Iran.
   Unprecedented security arrangements were made for Howe's visit
after protests over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel written by
British author Salman Rushdie that Moslems say blasphemes their
faith.
   Protests forced Howe to cancel a trip to Pakistan's Northwest
Frontier province, where most Afghan war refugees live.
   ``The modern world must find a balance between mutual respect
for the great religions and the traditions of free speech and free
expression within the law,'' Howe said.
   After a meeting with Howe on Monday, Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto said she emphasized the ``anguish Moslems felt'' over the
book but said she ``appreciated that Britain has its own laws.''
   Hours after Howe arrived Monday, a bomb exploded near a British
cultural center in the Pakistan capital. Although no group claimed
responsibility, the blast was apparently linked to protests over
Rushdie's novel.
   Seven people died Feb. 12 in an anti-Rushdie demonstration
outside an American cultural center in Islamabad and another person
died in two other bombings at British Council libraries outside the
capital.
   Howe met briefly with representatives of the Pakistan-based
Afghan guerrillas, who are fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-supported
communist leaders.
   But he said there was no question of diplomatic recognition. He
said Britain recognizes only states and never governments.
   ``The meeting was an encouragement and not a recognition,'' Howe
said.
   The provisional Afghan government _ formed about one month ago
after Soviet troops withdrew Feb. 15, ending a nine-year
intervention _ is lobbying for diplomatic recognition. The
Organization of Islamic Conference Nations has recognized the
rebels as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Cordis Corp. Pleads Guilty In Pacemaker Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cordis Corp. today pleaded guilty to charges it
sold defective heart pacemakers and corrosion-prone batteries and
agreed to pay $764,000 in fines and costs.
   Cordis general counsel Daniel G. Hall entered the plea on the
company's behalf to 12 felonies and 13 misdemeanors, including
fraud and false labeling.
   The Miami-based medical equipment company, which has sold its
pacemaker division, was accused of distributing 2,200 possibly
defective pacemakers and 6,000 batteries subject to corrosion from
December 1983 to October 1985.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration charged that the
pacemakers, implanted under the skin to regulate the heartbeat,
could stop without warning. No medical emergencies have been
reported because of the suspect devices.
   Sentencing was set for April 25. Four company executives also
face criminal trial in September on related charges.
   Cordis agreed last week to pay $5 million to settle a civil
claim that it defrauded the Veterans Administration, which bought
an undisclosed number of the pacemakers.
   The Justice Department said the settlement was one of the
largest Medicare recoveries ever.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus approved the plea bargain
today after rejecting one in October as too lenient. It had called
for $264,000 in fines and costs.
   The new agreement added a felony charge carrying a $500,000
penalty for intent to defraud the FDA by failing to report adverse
field reports as required.
   When the pacemaker case was announced, federal officials called
it the most significant felony prosecution to date under a 1976
amendment to FDA law.

   While the attorney general's men were out at
lunch, Oliver North scooped up documents in the Iran-Contra affair
that he had missed the night before and walked them to a shredder,
North's former deputy testified today.
   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl told the jury in North's trial that
the lunchtime document sweep occurred on Nov. 22, 1986, the day
after North had announced to Earl that it was ``time for Ollie to
be the scapegoat'' in the Iran arms initiative.
   Earl said William Bradford Reynolds and John Richardson, two
aides to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, had come into the
National Security Council office that Saturday morning, the day
after massive document destruction by North caused the office
shredder to break.
   At North's request, Earl had turned over his own records on the
secret arms initiative to Iran, which included a document showing
how the Iranians had been overcharged for the weapons they had
purchased.
   Some of the overcharges were funneled to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels while much of the remainder wound up in private bank
accounts controlled by arms dealers Richard Secord and Albert
Hakim, who are awaiting trial in the Iran-Contra affair.
   During a morning of reviewing documents at North's office,
Reynolds iscovered the diversion memo outlining a plan to channel
proceeds from the Iran arms sale to the Contras. Evidence of a
diversion raised the possibility that crimes had been committed.
   North stepped off the elevator down the hall from his office as
Reynolds and Richardson left for lunch and the three men spoke
briefly, Earl testified.
   While Reynolds and Richardson were at lunch, North began
collecting documents, Earl testified. ``I believed that those were
documents that should have been sabotaged'' the previous day ``but
weren't,'' he said.
   Earl said North then went outside through an alleyway and headed
for a shredder in the White House Situation Room, where national
security crises are monitored.
   ``It was your understanding that those papers would never been
seen again?'' prosecutor David Zornow asked.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Earl replied.
   Meese and his aides had launched, with approval from President
Reagan, a fact-finding inquiry into the Iran arms sales in an
attempt to develop a complete account of what happened.
   The prosecution closes out its case this week with testimony
from Meese and two of his ex-aides. They will testify about North's
alleged lies in connection with the diversion of Iran arms sale
money to the Contras.
   Meese, now with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
Washington think tank, will testify about North's alleged
statements that the NSC wasn't involved in the diversion.
   North is accused of falsely telling Meese that the Israelis
determined how much would be diverted to the Contras and that North
had advised a Contra leader to open bank accounts in Switzerland to
receive money from Israel. The alleged false statements were made
at a Nov. 23, 1986, meeting with Meese and his aides, including
Charles Cooper and John Richardson, who both are scheduled to
testify.
   Meese's weekend fact-finding mission in November 1986 that
uncovered the channeling of Iran arms sale money to the Contras was
criticized later as inadequate by congressional investigating
committees.
   The inquiry started as an effort to gather information on the
secret Iran arms sales. During it, a Meese aide discovered a memo
by North outlining a plan to divert money from the Iran weapons
sales to the Contras. Two days later, Meese announced that there
would be a criminal investigation.
   Meese said he never asked CIA Director William Casey about the
diversion and waited two days to speak to North's superior,
national security adviser John Poindexter.
   When he did, Meese said he didn't ask Poindexter whether he had
told the president about the diversion of Iran arms sale proceeds
to the Contras.
   After North admitted to Meese there had been a diversion, the
NSC aide went back to his office and shredded documents until early
the next morning.
   Meese ``waited too long to seal North's offices'' and ``these
lapses placed a cloud over the attorney general's investigation,''
Congress concluded.

<TEXT>
   The congressional seat that launched the
political career of Vice President Dan Quayle was at stake today in
a special election that pitted a newcomer against a candidate who
has sought the seat before.
   Republican Dan Heath and Democrat Jill Long campaigned at
daybreak today, meeting voters in coffee shops in efforts that
could prove crucial given an expected turnout of as low as
one-third of the district's more than 200,000 voters.
   The seat was vacated by Dan Coats, a Republican who resigned to
take the Senate seat Quayle occupied before taking the oath as vice
president. District voters were the first to send Quayle to
Washington in 1976 as a 28-year-old congressman. Quayle won
re-election in 1978, then gave up the seat for a successful effort
to defeat three-term Democratic senator Birch Bayh.
   A poll released Sunday by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette showed
Heath with a 44 percent and Long with 36 percent, with 20 percent
undecided. The poll among 1,019 likely voters was conducted in the
week before the election and had a margin of error 3.1 percent.
   In the final evening of campaigning Monday, Long, a business
professor at Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne,
chose not to cancel a scheduled class in public finance that
followed a campaign rally with Gov. Evan Bayh, the son of Birch
Bayh.
   Heath made evening campaign stops at several bowling alleys
after a round of door-to-door campaigning.
   The district has voted Republican 2-to-1 in recent congressional
elections.
   The candidates, picked by party caucuses in January, attacked
each other's sources of campaign funding, with Long hammering on
Heath ads produced by the National Association of Realtors. ``This
congressional district should not be bought by an outside interest
group,'' she said.
   Heath countered with copies of finance reports showing 62
percent of Long's funds came from out-of-state political action
committees.
   Heath also turned to the White House for campaign help and was
visited by Quayle _ his first visit to the city as vice president _
Barbara Bush, and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Long was boosted by a campaign visit from Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn., a presidential hopeful in 1988.
   Long, 36, lost to Quayle in 1986, when Quayle ran for
re-election to the Senate. She lost to Coats last fall in her first
bid to win the 4th District seat.
   Heath, 36, making his first run for office, has been a
congressional aide to Coats.

   Ayatollah Ali Montazeri said today he
would not be the successor of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast said Montazeri told Khomeini in a letter that he
was not ready to be Khomeini's successor.
   Khomeini thanked Montazeri for the decision, according to the
broadcast monitored in Nicosia. It quoted Khomeini as saying that
even when Montazeri was designated as his successor by the Council
of Experts, he had opposed the choice.
   The move came amid signs of a major shakeup in the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. It closely followed the resignations of Mohammad
Jaafar Mahallati, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, and
Javad Larijani, an assistant foreign minister for European and
American affairs.
   Mahallati resigned from his post today, Tehran radio said.
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Larijani's
resignation on Sunday.
   Montazeri declared last month that Iranian leaders made many
mistakes in the first 10 years of the Islamic revolution, isolating
the republic from much of the world. He also said the revolution
had failed in its policies and promises.
   Questioning the 8-year war with Iraq has been anathema in Iran,
but Montazeri also has dared to ask, ``Did we succeed in doing will
during the imposed war, or did the enemies who imposed it turn out
to be the victors?''
   Although Khomeini did not mention Montazeri by name, last week
he proclaimed: ``How short-sighted are those who thing that because
we did not reach final victory at the front, that martyrdom and
self-sacrifice are worthless?''
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati were the chief movers behind the drive to soften
Iran's radical image following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf war.
   But Khomeini, claiming Iran had drifted away from the values of
its 1979 revolution, said last week that ``the government must do
its best to govern the people as best it can, but this does not
mean that it should drive them away from the great goals of the
revolution, which is the creation of a global Islamic government.''
   Khomeini also said recently: ``As long as I am alive I shall
never let the state fall into the hands of the liberals.''

<TEXT>
   A former nurse's aide accused of
suffocating two nursing home patients for the ``emotional release''
it gave her has been charged with murdering three more elderly
women.
   Gwendolyn Graham, 25, of Tyler, Texas, was arraigned Monday in
the February 1987 deaths of the three women at Alpine Manor Nursing
Home in Walker, a suburb of Grand Rapids. She has been jailed since
December in the other deaths.
   She worked at Alpine Manor in 1986 and 1987 before leaving to
return to Texas. At the time, the five deaths were considered to
have resulted from natural causes.
   The first two bodies have since been exhumed for autopsies, but
the remains of the three other women were cremated.
   Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth said Graham's
co-defendant, Catherine Wood, has agreed to testify against her
former co-worker and lover. Wood has said she served as a lookout
while Graham suffocated the women, court records show.
   Another nurse's aide, Russell Shawn Thatcher, testified earlier
that Wood told him Graham killed the patients ``to relieve Gwen's
stress if she was having a bad day.''
   Witnesses also testified Wood told them she and Graham took
souvenirs from their victims.
   Wood's ex-husband, who went to police in October, said Wood told
him she and Graham had tried to select victims whose initials
spelled out ``murder.''
   Police said they have been unable to confirm that.

<TEXT>
   A federal safety investigator looking into the
deadliest accident in U.S. history attributed to drunken driving
said today that school buses should have to meet more stringent
emergency evacuation standards.
   Bernard S. Loeb, investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, testified as the board considered recommendations and
conclusions it will make in the head-on collision between a pickup
truck and a church-operated school bus that killed 24 children and
three adults near Carrollton, Ky., on May 14, 1988.
   Loeb told the five-member board that standards for evacuation
from public transit buses exceed the federal standards for
school-type buses. He said performance-related standards are needed
rather than those which only require certain widths between benches
and set dimensions for exits.
   ``I don't care how they do it, but they've got to be able to
evacuate that bus'' in a shorter period of time, Loeb said.
   NTSB staff members, based on interviews with many of the 40
children and adults who escaped the fiery crash, described children
crawling over each other to get out of the bus after it was hit by
a pickup truck driven by Larry Mahoney, 34, of Worthville, Ky.
   NTSB investigator John V. Moulden testified that Mahoney could
have had up to a 0.29 blood alcohol level, which is nearly three
times the legal level for presumption of intoxication and
two-thirds of the way to a lethal dose.
   Mahoney, who faces a Nov. 8 trial date on 27 murder charges, was
driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 when his truck collided with
the bus. The crash blocked the front door and sent flames and smoke
through the bus, which was returning from a church outing at an
amusement park.
   Moulden said Mahoney likely drank about a full case _ 24 cans _
of light beer on the day of the crash, which occurred at 10:55 p.m.
``He in no way could be judge competent to operate a vehicle,'' the
investigator said.
   Investigators said Mahoney, 35, had been arrested in 1984 on
drunken-driving charges. They said he had been twice divorced and
was planning to remarry his first wife.
   About an hour before the crash, friends took away his keys
because they thought he would lose his driver's license, but gave
them back when he told them he was only driving a short distance on
a dirt road to the trailer where he lived, said Jean Fassone, who
headed the on-site investigation.

   The government said today it withheld
parts of a report on the assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi because they contained top secret material.
   Home Minister Buta Singh told reporters the government did not
release certain passages of the report because they were classified
or considered sensitive, Press Trust of India reported.
   The agency quoted Singh as saying the speaker of Parliament will
be given the full report and will be able to seek the attorney
general's opinion on whether the secret portions should be made
public.
   The report, released Monday and based on the findings of a
special state commission, accuses an adviser to Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi of complicity in the 1984 shooting death of Mrs.
Gandhi. The adviser, Rajendra Kumar Dhawan, was personal secretary
to Mrs. Gandhi at the time.
   The government said Dhawan had been exonerated of involvement in
Mrs. Gandhi's death.
   Opposition members said today the government failed to release
two volumes of the report.
   ``Is the Parliament at the mercy of the government?'' asked
opposition leader Madhu Dandavate, a Janata Party member of the
lower house.
   Dandavate presented a motion for breach of privilege, a form of
parliamentary sanction, against Singh, who delivered the report to
Parliament.
   In the upper house, opposition members wrested an assurance from
Deputy Chairman Najma Heptulla that the issue would be taken up
with the government.
   The Statesman newspaper reported the report had four volumes and
was about 8,000 pages long. The government released 657 pages in
two volumes.
   The report links three people directly to the assassination: the
two gunmen and Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal secretary for more
than 20 years.
   Mrs. Gandhi was slain by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984,
as she walked through the garden of her New Delhi residence to a
television interview.
   One of the two Sikh assassins was killed by other bodyguards
just after the assassination. The other was sentenced to death and
hanged along with a third Sikh, Kehar Singh, who was convicted for
instigating the assassins to commit the crime.
   The report accuses Dhawan of facilitating the crime by reversing
an order to remove all Sikhs from Mrs. Gandhi's inner security
circle as well as changing the shift of one of the assassins and
the time of the television interview.
   It says Dhawan lied or gave inadequate reponses to questions
about entries in his diary about one assassin, foreign money, the
CIA and his association with a Sikh suspected of having ties to the
U.S. intelligence agency.
   It said Mrs. Gandhi had looked into replacing Dhawan and had
reprimanded him a month before she was killed. It did not say why
he was reprimanded.
   In releasing the report to Parliament, the home minister said a
special investigating team had ``unraveled a conspiracy, a larger
conspiracy to eliminate Mrs. Gandhi.'' He said more charges are to
be filed but gave no details.
   According to the report, the commission accepted that Mrs.
Gandhi was killed by her bodyguards. However, it did not rule out
involvement of a foreign power.
   The government says Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple to clear
the Sikhs' holiest shrine of militants. At least 1,200 people died,
most of them Sikhs.
   India has long accused Pakistan of training and arming Sikh
militants. Pakistan has denied the charge.
   Dhawan, 52, left his post after Mrs. Gandhi's death, but
returned to the government last month as an adviser to her son.
Dhawan could not be reached at his home or office for comment on
the report.

<HEAD>North Sea Oil Rig Wreck Sunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wrecked North Sea oil and gas platform where
167 men died in an explosion last year was sunk Tuesday because it
was a hazard to shipping.
   The Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, which owned the
Piper Alpha platform, said three tugs and a barge pulled the
remains of the structure over after the legs were weakened by
controlled explosions under water.
   John Brading, the company's chairman in Britain, said there is
now 250 feet of clear water above the wreck on the seabed, 110
miles east of Aberdeen on Scotland's east coast.
   The worst disaster to a platform at sea occurred July 6, 1988,
and was attributed to a leaking gas valve. There were 62 survivors,
and 31 of the victims were never found.
   Occidental said the 12,500-ton pile of wreckage will be
inspected and mapped, and ``every effort'' will be made to retrieve
any human remains.
   Brading said salvage of the undersea wreckage was not attempted
because it would have cost up to $1.7 billion.
   Lawyers said each victim's family would get about $1 million in
compensation.

<HEAD>Chinese Customs Officers Seize Petition Calling For Amnesty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officers on Tuesday seized a petition
signed by 24,000 Chinese abroad that called for the release of
political prisoners in China, according a priest who tried to carry
it into the country.
   The seizure occurred a day before the 10th anniversary of the
arrest of dissident Wei Jingsheng, who is serving a 15-year
sentence for ``counterrevolutionary'' crimes.
   Lau Chin Shek, a Roman Catholic priest from Hong Kong, said he
had planned to present the petition to the National People's
Congress, China's legislature, now meeting in Beijing.
   Under Chinese law, Chinese residing in the mainland, Macao and
Hong Kong have the right to present petitions to the congress.
   Lau said most of the signatures were from Hong Kong residents.
Chinese students studying in the United States, Canada and Western
Europe also participated, he said.
   The petition comes as a growing number of intellectuals in China
are calling for an amnesty for political prisoners. Since January,
intellectuals here have written four open letters urging an amnesty
and democratic change. So far, about 200 people have signed.
   Lau was part of a group of seven Hong Kong intellectuals,
including doctors, journalists and clergy, which had traveled to
Beijing to present the petition.
   ``We made it but the petition didn't,'' Lau said.
   The group also asked Chinese authorities to let them visit Wei,
who was one of the leaders of the Democracy Wall movement before he
was arrested on March 29, 1979, for calling for democracy. Amnesty
International, a London-based human rights group, has adopted him
as a prisoner of conscience. Unverified reports say Wei, who was
sentenced in 1979, is not well.
   Lau and the group flew from Hong Kong to Tianjin, a city near
Beijing on the coast of the Bohai Sea, on Tuesday. As they
proceeded through customs, Chinese officials searched their bags.
   ``They found the petition and told us they were going to `study'
it before returning it,'' Lau said. ``They kept us in the airport
for three hours. Finally, they said we could go but they still had
to `study' the petition.''
   Lau said the petition was similar to the recent open letters.
   ``It was very simple,'' he said. ``We called for the release of
political prisoners. We believe that this goal is one that will
benefit not just China but the whole world.''
   Lau said he was upset at the seizure and accused China of
infringing on his rights.
   ``This is a basic right guaranteed in the Chinese
constitution,'' he said. Hong Kong, a British colony since the 19th
century, returns to China in 1997. Both Hong Kong and Macao, a
Portuguese trading post since the 16th century that returns to
Chinese rule in 1999, have begun sending delegates to the National
People's Congress.
   In recent weeks, China has condemned the petition drives and
sought to discredit them as invitations for foreign pressure on
Beijing.
   Chinese delegates to the congress and to the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, a major government advisory
group which closed Monday, have said they expected a call for
political amnesty to be raised at both meetings. So far no call has
been raised, and the congress closes next week.

   Sports officials from South Korea and
North Korea made progress Tuesday on forming a joint team for the
1990 Asian Games and expressed optimism on reaching an overall
agreement.
   Delegates agreed after about three hours of talks to meet again
April 18 at the Panmunjom truce site to clear the way for forming a
joint national team. Such a development could be a big step in
easing tension on the divided Korean peninsula.
   ``The north seemed to be sincere about the talks ... I can say
we made some progress today,'' said chief South Korean delegate
Chang Chung-shik.
   Chief North Korean delegate Kim Huong Jin said the talks must
help the two sides improve relations and end their rivalry.
   ``What is most important ... is for both to get rid of the
concept of confrontation and think, first of all, that they are
members of one nation sharing the same destiny,'' Kim said in an
opening statement.
   The talks must still overcome major obstacles before they can
form a joint team to send to the games in Beijing. Past efforts
failed on such issues as the name of the team and what flag it
should use.
   Both sides agreed a team would be selected after joint training
of candidates. South Korea had wanted selection before training.
   North Korea offered a concession on the name of the team and
both sides offered suggestions on a team flag _ both critical
issues. They agreed March 9 that a traditional Korean folk song
would serve as the team anthem.
   The nations have been holding intermittent talks at various
levels to try to improve relations. Both sides say they want to end
their long, bitter rivalry.
   Separate talks between parliamentary delegations and senior
government officials were stalemated by North Korean demands last
month that Seoul call off annual ``Team Spirit'' military exercises
with U.S. forces.
   South Korea refused, and the exercises, involving 200,000 South
Korean and U.S. troops, concluded last week.
   Pyongyang proposed the sports talks in December, saying the two
sides should stop fielding separate teams at international sports
events.
   North Korea boycotted the Summer Olympics in Seoul last year
after South Korea and the International Olympic Committee refused
to let Pyongyang be a co-host. North Kora also boycotted the 1986
Asian Games in Seoul.
   The two nations have been enemies since the division of the
Korean peninsula by U.S. and Soviet forces in 1945 at the end of
World War II. North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the
three-year Korean War.
   The Korean border is sealed and the two sides have hundreds of
thousands of troops facing each other along their 150-mile border.

<HEAD>Greece Again Says it Won't Take Part in Annual NATO Exercise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Greece said Tuesday it again won't take
part in NATO's annual ``Dragon Hammer'' military exercise April
20-May 2 because of a continuing dispute over an island in the
Aegean Sea.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said Greece was not
participating because the exercise would violate a treaty
concerning the military status of the northern Aegean island of
Lemnos.
   Greece claims that international treaties allow it to garrison
the island, while neighboring Turkey, a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Alliance, says Greece has no such right.
   Greece, which keeps a large military presence on the island,
refuses to take part in NATO exercises unless Lemnos is included in
the war games. Turkey strongly objects to the fortification of
Lemnos, located near its Aegean coast.
   Although Greek-Turkish relations have improved recently, the two
still are at odds over control of Aegean airspace, its seabed and
mineral rights.
   Greece has not taken part in any NATO exercises held in the
Aegean since Premier Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government came
to power in 1981. Parts of ``Dragon Hammer,'' are to take part in
the Aegean.

<TEXT>
   The aspirations of the young Pole in the
crowd outside the U.S. Embassy weren't grandiose: ``I would like to
work and live a normal life.''
   But they speak volumes in a country where little is ``normal''
other than spirit-sapping shortages of everything from housing to
hope.
   So he and hundreds of thousands of others worldwide have taken a
chance on finding a place in what they see as a land of plenty.
They have entered a U.S. State Department lottery to win one of
20,000 immigration visas to the United States to be issued over two
years starting in October.
   A computer will select the winners, rather than the immigration
officers, who normally must strictly limit visas to those who have
specialized skills or a close relative in the United States.
   ``This lottery may be their only chance of immigrating,'' said
Phyllis Villegoureix-Ritoud, consul-general of the U.S. Embassy in
Warsaw.
   Many Poles learned about the program from Voice of America
broadcasts ``as my ringing phones can testify,'' said embassy
Second Secretary Sylvie Martinez. ``We haven't had a moment's peace
since.''
   Rules for the lottery are quite specific. The applications are
mailed directly to Washington, a difficult prospect to start with
in many parts of the world. The deadline is Friday.
   Each person can send only one application. It must by
typewritten, contain specific information and photographs, and be
mailed in an envelope no larger than 9{ by 4{ inches and no smaller
than 6 by 3{ inches.
   ``The people who would really benefit from a visa won't be able
to make the application,'' complained a Rome spokesman for the
private Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, which is
supported by countries including the United States. ``What
assurance do they have that it will arrive on time?''
   In impoverished Bangladesh, a business started overnight to sell
applications and envelopes following the prescribed form. An
envelope sold for about 31 cents, five times normal, and the same
price was charged to get the address typed.
   In Peru, a mail strike that started Feb. 2 has complicated
matters, with many people much too poor to afford a private courier.
   Nonetheless, the applications have been streaming toward
Washington. State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones said
hundreds of thousands are expected, although they won't be counted
until the deadline. A more restrictive lottery program for 10,000
visas in 1986 generated 1.4 million applications.
   Bangladesh authorities report 500,000 immigration applications
were sent during the first 15 days of March. With the number
expected to swell to a million, the postal service has opened
special counters and added hours.
   On line at one post office was Jalaluddin Sikder, a prayer
leader at a mosque at Savar near Dhaka, who said: ``It's a lottery,
there is no harm to try my luck. Allah will help me.''
   Golam Mostafa, a 30-year-old elementary school teacher, applied
``because I have no future here. I heard that the States is a rich
country and I will be able to lead a good life there.''
   Many applicants seemed philosophical about the daunting odds.
   Polish-born Bozena Trela, who learned of the lottery from a
translated embassy bulletin posted in a Rome hotel housing Polish
refugees, sees it as another small chance of getting to America.
   ``I'm not very hopeful I will win, but maybe if I'm lucky,''
said Trela, 30. If she gets to America, she hopes to ``earn enough
not just to exist, but to live.''
   The random selection by computer worries her, though, because
``it is a risk to let people into America without knowing their
background.''
   ``I am university educated with work experience, but how will
they know that?'' she said.
   Some who might qualify through customary immigration channels
also are applying for the lottery, hoping to reduce waits that can
add up to a decade or more for siblings of U.S. citizens. In
Poland, 3,500 immigrant visas and 70,000 temporary visas were
issued last year from more than 110,000 applications.
   Lottery applications also are coming from among the estimated
17,000 Soviet Jews in Italy waiting to enter the United States.
   ``They must also apply for this program because they no longer
are having much luck with refugee status because those quotas have
been filled,'' said Jim Wagner of the Tolstoy Foundation for Soviet
refugees in Rome.
   A Romanian mechanical engineer who defected and now must wait
for a U.S. visa at the Traiskirchen refugee camp south of Vienna,
said he learned about the lottery in a friend's letter from the
United States.
   ``If I am lucky (in the lottery) I may leave early next year. If
not, I'll have to waste more time here, which I hate because I am
not allowed to find a job and I am bored stiff doing nothing,'' he
said.
   In Thailand, where 40,000 information sheets on the program have
been passed out, Saranpat Anumutrachakit, a 24-year-old who wants
to study in the United States, sees the lottery as taking a chance.
   ``You know, it is like the Thai lottery _ you may win or you may
lose,'' she said.

   The Postal Service has decided to follow a
trend in business technology by offering facsimile machine service
on an experimental basis.
   The ``fax'' machines have blossomed across the nation in the
last few years, speeding copies of documents from business to
business for people too impatient to wait for even messengers to
make the trip.
   The experiment is expected to start in June at 260 post offices
across the country, postal officials said. Bids are being let for
the machines to be used.
   The plan is for the machines to be in post office lobbies,
available to either send or receive fascimiles of documents.
Payment will be by credit card, MasterCard, Visa or American
Express, to cover the service and phone costs. The rates have not
been determined.
   The machines are expected to be designed to store received
documents for a period of time, so that customers do not have to be
on hand at the moment they arrive. Customers will punch a code into
the machine to obtain their particular document, officials said.

   Officials differed today
on whether hundreds of women and children inside a prison seized by
rebellious convicts are hostages or supporters of the uprising.
   Government negotiators held a second day of talks with leaders
of the rebellion that began Sunday, when friends and relatives of
inmates were visiting the prison.
   The Roman Catholic priest who is chaplain of Guatemalan prisons
said he considered most of the more than 600 visitors still inside
Pavon penitentiary ``virtual hostages.''
   ``Though some are there by choice, the rebellious prisoners know
that they (the family members) are their protection. They know that
once they are gone, the armed forces could try to retake the
facility,'' the Rev. Antonio Lopez Martin said before entering the
prison.
   Authorities said at least four guards and three inmates were
killed and 20 people wounded as prisoners seized about 75 M-1
rifles and tried to escape Sunday.
   About 1,000 soldiers and police joined the prison's 180 guards
outside the 2.5 square-mile facility, where inmates were demanding
better food and reduced sentences.
   Prison spokesman Conrado Monroy told reporters friends and
relatives ``fear that if they leave, authorities will take
reprisals against the rebel inmates.''
   The inspector-general of the National Prisons System, Carlos
Ramos Moncada, said he believes the visitors are not hostages.
   ``They remain there by choice,'' he said. ``The family members
still inside are backing the movement.''
   Ramos Moncada said 607 people besides the up to 100 rebellious
inmates remained inside the prison.
   Officials said the visitors on Sunday included more than 150
children, 360 women and 100 men.
   Esmirla Cheti, 19, walked out today with her nephew Edgar, 13.
She said they were visiting a friend when the uprising occurred and
she remained voluntarily for two days.
   ``But we were also afraid about what might happen if we tried to
leave,'' she said. ``We were going to leave last night, but they
(the prisoners) told us to wait until morning.''
   She said some people have food in the prison, but other people
were going hungry.
   President Vinicio Cerezo ordered prison and other authorities
``to exhaust every alternative'' in negotiating a solution.
   Ramos Moncada said Monday night that ``serious problems remain''
in resolving the standoff. ``(The rebels) must reform their conduct
and surrender the weapons.''
   He said six people who were hostages _ four doctors and two
firefighters _ were released at midday Monday. He said the rest of
the people inside the prison were considered to be supporting the
uprising.
   On Monday night, inmates escorted 15 adults and four children
out of the prison.
   Ramos Moncada said the rebellious prisoners had about 75 M-1
rifles taken from prison guard dormitories.
   He said their demands _ for better food and reduced sentences _
had not changed since Sunday and that they did not demand a plane
to fly to Cuba as reported by a local radio station.
   The roughly 1,250 prisoners who did not take part in the
uprising apparently remained in areas of the prison outside the
rebels' control.
   Clementina Diaz and her 2-year-old son, Miguel Angel, were among
those who left the prison Monday night.
   Mrs. Diaz, who was visiting her eldest son Gerardo on Sunday,
said she left because her little boy had a fever. She said inmates
asked visitors if they had health problems that made their stay
impossible.
   Another visitor who left, Alicia Rodriguez, cried as she spoke
from inside a Red Cross van outside the gate. She had been visiting
her husband.
   ``I was sick from nerves,'' she said to explain her departure.

   The driver of a big-wheeled truck
chased federal drug agents as they attempted to make a cocaine
bust, then used his high-riding vehicle to run over the hood of a
police car, authorities said Tuesday.
   Three men inside the truck Monday evening were arrested for
investigation of attempted murder and possession of drugs for sale,
Sgt. Bill Thompson said.
   No officers or agents were injured, he said, but one of the men
inside the truck was bitten by a police dog when he tried to
escape. The men were held at the Inglewood jail.
   Federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents had tried to
arrest the men after meeting them in a parking lot for a cocaine
buy, Thompson said. But the men fled in the four-wheel-drive
Chevrolet Blazer.
   ``The Blazer at one point drove over the top of one of our
unmarked cars,'' he said, ``just like you see at the Coliseum'' in
truck shows.
   Officers fired after the truck as it sped off and then then
crashed into a building.

   Strikes by bus and train workers
Tuesday over wages slowed millions of commuters in Rio de Janeiro.
   Nearly all of the 25,000 workers in the category were on strike,
said Luis Martins, president of the Bus Workers Union. A spokesman
for employers said almost half the 6,200 buses were operating.
   The union wants a six-hour day and a 30 percent pay increase,
Martins said. Drivers make around $150 per month, and employers
have offered an 18 percent increase, he said.
   Rio's buses carry around 4 million passengers per day.
   Only 2,000 of the 11,000 train workers showed up to work,
paralyzing the government-run commuter lines in the city, said Luis
Carlos de Souza, a spokesman for the Brazilian Company of Urban
Trains.
   Train workers demanded a six-hour day and bonus pay, which
employers said was unwarranted. The trains normally carry 1 million
workers daily.
   Train and bus workers called meetings to decide whether to
continue the strikes.

   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
loaned three aircraft to Paraguay to help eradicate marijuana
fields in the northeast of the country, officials said Tuesday.
   ``Our decision is to spray these plantations as soon as they are
identified by the aircraft,'' said Inspector Inocencio Montiel of
the Paraguayan Narcotics Department.
   Ten U.S. pilots, mechanics and support personnel will accompany
the two Thrush spray planes and a Cessna Caravan.
   The loan stems from a 1987 agreement under which the United
States pledged to supply Paraguay with $200,000 in training and
equipment to combat drug trafficking.
   In 1987, the U.S. State Department estimated there were 7,400
acres of Paraguayan marijuana plantations.
   An increase in marijuana cultivation in Paraguay in the past two
years has been attributed to aggressive eradication efforts in
neighboring Brazil and Bolivia.

   Albania sent its first official delegation to
China since the two former communist allies parted company more
than a decade ago, the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday.
   The delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Muhamet Kapllani
and Foreign Trade First Deputy Minister Kostandin Hoxha, arrived in
Beijing on Tuesday for a five-day visit, Xinhua said.
   Albania was one of China's last loyal friends in the communist
camp after Mao Tse-tung split with the Soviets in 1960 and veered
sharply to the left during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   However, relations cooled with the rise to power in the late
1970s of Deng Xiaoping, a pragmatist who has transformed China with
his experiments in market-oriented economic reforms.
   The report said the Albanians will hold talks with officials
from the Foreign Ministry and from the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade.
   Albania, one of the world's most closed nations, has showed
signs recently of opening to both the West and its former communist
allies.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has tentatively voted to give
ground to both opponents and backers of Denver's ``living-in-sin''
zoning ordinance.
   The Council voted 8-5 Monday night to give tentative approval to
amendments in zoning measures that were adopted in the 1960s to
discourage hippie communes by barring unrelated people from living
together in some parts of town.
   Council members then postponed any further vote April 24.
   The exact number of residents affected by the zoning rules was
not immediately known. Denver has a population of 505,000.
   As many as 53 percent of the residences in Denver are in an R-1
zone, where a homeowner must obtain a $20 boarder's permit to cover
a non-relative. The amendments would drop the permit requirement
but would bar nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and in-laws from
moving in, said City Councilwoman Cathy Donohue.
   Donohue, who voted for the amendments, counted that as a setback
to opponents of ``living-in-sin'' restrictions. ``Since 1956, you
have been allowed to have all these relatives in your home,'' she
said.
   A more restrictive code, called R-0 and applying to 7 percent of
Denver residences, bans boarders or unrelated people from living in
the same house. The amendments would allow two unrelated adults to
live together, but no more.
   The penalty for violating the city's ordinance is $999 a day. In
practice, Donohue said, people just move.
   The city zoning office keeps no count of boarder permits issued,
and the city attorney's office said it has no figures on people who
have challenged the law or paid the fine.
   Among those affected are three nuns who are being forced to move
out of a four-bedroom home.
   ``They wanted all but one of us to move out,'' said one of the
nuns, who asked that her name not be used. ``To me, it's wasteful
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms.
It's very sinful.''
   Five years ago, five people challenged R-0 zoning in state
Supreme Court and lost, said Jennifer Macy, administrative
assistant to the City Council.

   The Air Force has temporarily grounded its
fleet of B-1B bombers in a precautionary move following an incident
Monday in which an internal fuel tank on one of the bombers was
punctured, the Pentagon said today.
   The incident occurred at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, during a
routine pre-flight check before a B-1B training flight, said Dan
Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   The fuel tank appears to have been punctured when the mechanism
that sweeps the bomber's wings back and forth malfunctioned, he
said.
   The spokesman, disclosing the grounding during a regular
Pentagon news briefing, said the bomber's crew was sweeping the
wings forward and backward before takeoff and discovered the wings
were not moving evenly together.
   ``It was noted that they were out of sync,'' Howard said.
   ``The third time that they swept the wings forward, a clunking
noise was heard; they shut down the aircraft, and they observed the
fuel leak. They're currently conducting an investigation to see
what caused the problem.''
   Howard said it appeared the left wing, in being swept to a full
forward position, ``exceeded its normal limits and subsequently
fuel was noticed in the wing root area.''
   The Strategic Air Command has suspended training flights on its
B-1B aircraft until further notice, Howard said.
   The spokesman said there was ``no current indication'' that the
incident was related to a Nov. 8, 1988, crash of a B-1B bomber at
Dyess ``or any other previous incident.''
   The November crash has been blamed on a wing fire, the precise
cause of which remains unknown.
   The Air Force has lost three of its 100 B-1B bombers to crashes.
Besides the Nov. 8 crash, one was lost in 1987 when it ran into
pelicans on a low-level training flight, and the third was lost
last Nov. 17 during a landing attempt at Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D.
   Howard said the grounding order affected only training flights
and was not being applied to the B-1B's currently standing nuclear
alert.
   ``The B-1B's alert status is not affected by this standdown and
the aircraft remains capable of meeting its war-time
requirements,'' he said.

   President Bush said today he is still seeking
clarifications on an arrangement with Japan for joint production of
the FSX fighter plane.
   ``What I want to know is that the agreement is clear. There's no
point in having an unclear agreement. We have a lot at stake
here,'' Bush told reporters.
   The president also said the two sides were continuing to talk
and he does not know whether a Friday deadline set by Japan in
accordance with requirements of its fiscal calendar would be met.
   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga met with Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger, the first official meeting between the
sides since a negotiating session last Thursday.
   But State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the FSX
fighter was discussed only briefly because the meeting was a
courtesy call planned before the controversy arose.
   Bush said last week that he endorsed the pact for joint
manufacture of the FSX fighter, which was concluded by the Reagan
administration, but wanted some changes to protect U.S. technology.
   Administration sources said the holdup now is over nailing down
who owns the technology that derives from the FSX project and what
percentage of the fighter should be built in the United States.
   Under the agreement signed late last year, St. Louis-based
General Dynamics would join with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to co-develop and co-produce the FSX as an advanced
version of the U.S. F-16 fighter.
   Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the
United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to
buying F-16s directly from this country. They say the deal will
promote exchanges of technology while helping U.S. industry.
   Critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of
advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel its civilian
aircraft industry into competition with the United States in the
world market. They say Tokyo should purchase American-made planes
to help offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

   A judge today disqualified the San Diego Yacht
Club as the winner of last September's America's Cup challenge and
awarded the international trophy to a New Zealand club.
   State Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick said the San Diego
club ``violated the spirit'' of the 101-year-old Deed of the Gift,
which sets out the rules for the America's Cup race.
   The San Diego crew, skippered by Dennis Conner, sailed a
catamaran to victory against the Mercury Bay Yacht Club's 90-foot
monohull in a race off San Diego in September and retained the
America's Cup.
   But the judge said, ``It is clear that a catamaran may not
defend an America's Cup competition against a monohull.''
   Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the San Diego club, said his group
would meet this afternoon to decide what action to take next.
   The Mercury Bay Yacht Club of Auckland, New Zealand, first went
to court in 1987, arguing it should be allowed to challenge San
Diego in a one-on-one race for the Cup in a boat larger than the
12-meter yacht ordinarily used.
   The New Zealand club also argued the race should be held in an
interval of less than the customary once every four years.
   The deed establishing the Cup requires only a 10-month interval
between races and sets no limit for boat length; it also does not
require a series of elimination races as there have been for the
past several decades.
   The judge on Dec. 21, 1987, agreed to the matchup, and ordered
San Diego to defend the Cup against the New Zealand challenge and
its 90-foot craft. San Diego was to use the 12-meter boat, which
runs about 45 feet at the waterline.
   But Conner instead decided to use a catamaran _ a much faster
and more maneuverable craft _ and easily defeated the challenging
craft financed by Michael Fay.
   Fay went back to court after losing that race and asked the
judge to invalidate the results.
   The judge today said she was ``mindful that forfeiture is a
drastic remedy'' because of the Cup's ``large economic significance
and prestige.''
   But she said the parties had suggested no other alternative and
``nor is alternative relief feasible under the circumstances.''

   George Bush dropped in unannounced at a
suburban high school today, eating lunch in the school's cafeteria,
visiting a computer center and telling students ``you learn
something from every step outside the White House you take.''
   The president visited James Madison High School in Vienna, a
suburb of Washington, D.C., in advance of his upcoming release of a
package of legislative proposals dealing with education.
   Bush, who during the campaign vowed to be the ``education
president,'' first chatted with students in the school's computer
center. Then he sat on a stool in the school's library and answered
questions for nearly 30 minutes.
   Bush talked about ``this stupid abuse of drugs,'' and said
``we've got to mobilize the entertainment media'' to combat drugs,
suggesting that movies have tended to glamorize drug use over the
years.
   ``We've got to change the way this problem has been looked at,''
he said.
   He said movies often treat cocaine use ``in a humorous vein, or
made the user look like a silly idiot ....''
   ``We've got to say, look, don't put out great emotion in favor
of cocaine or other drugs. A lot of it is education. This is not
going to be solved from the White House. It's going to be solved by
the American people, young and old, saying `enough is enough.'''
   Answering a question about international terrorism, Bush said:
``It's like dealing with fog _ you can't get hold of it very well.''
   One student asked Bush how a president ``has time to visit a
high school?''
   ``A very good question,'' he replied. ``We're perfecting now an
education package. Tell you how it works: in a campaign, you get
certain themes of what you think is right for education ... It is
important that people be computer literate. I think math and
science are important. I favor magnet schools. I favor trying to
set up a system to reward the better teachers ... I think you learn
something from every step outside the White House that you take.''
   Now, Bush said, he was trying to put his campaign vows on
education into a legislative package. On his two-hour trip to the
school, Bush said: ``It's symbolic, in some sense. But you also
pick up information as you go along.''
   ``You have go balance that with your overall responsibilities,''
he added.
   On a foreign policy question, Bush said the long-sought peace in
the Middle East ``has escaped us all, escaped the world ... You
still see a lot of killing. And so, we have a particularly
important role there. We are the only country that can be a
substantial catalyst for peace there.''
   He mentioned his meetings next week with leaders from Israel,
Egypt and Jordan.
   Bush joined the students in the school cafeteria, downing a
lunch of pizza, french fries and milk.

   The rejection of top officials in multicandidate
balloting by Soviet voters is a blow to the Communist Party's
prestige but not necessarily to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
masterminded the electoral reforms.
   Legions of angry voters may have done for Gorbachev what he has
not been able to accomplish in four years of reform: shake up
entrenched bureaucrats he says are slowing him down.
   At the same time, Gorbachev has said he's willing to risk public
criticism of the Kremlin in order to establish a more open society,
and the elections demonstrated that will be a price he pays for
tolerance. But the outcome also enhanced his standing as a leader
serious about reform.
   Gorbachev's proposal of a new election law last year was
designed to increase public participation in government affairs and
perhaps to make the Kremlin more responsive to the public. In its
first, admittedly imperfect round of nominations and balloting, the
law focused a spotlight on many government and party officials
unaccustomed to the glare of nationwide multicandidate balloting,
and some found the exposure most unpleasant.
   The losses suffered would have been unimaginable until just
recently: a candidate Politburo member and party leader of
Leningrad; the party chief of Kiev; the president and premier of
Lithuania; Moscow's mayor; Moscow's No. 2 party leader; and
regional party chairmen throughout the country.
   In contrast, Moscow residents gave 89 percent of their votes to
Boris N. Yeltsin, the capital's former party boss, in a stunning
endorsement of his anti-establishment campaign.
   Gorbachev has long complained that the complacency or outright
opposition of many ranking officials is slowing his 4-year-old
reform effort.
   Asked Tuesday about the effect of the election on Gorbachev's
political standing, a senior Western diplomat in Moscow said: ``I
suspect it will strengthen his hand. There are instances in which
party chiefs were defeated, and the Yeltsin vote is evidence that
the radical reforms have to continue.'' The diplomat spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   Virgilijus Chapaitis, a leader of the Lithuanian grassroots
movement Sajudis, which defeated the republic's president and
premier, said, ``Gorbachev need not fear this election. It's not a
victory against the party; it's a victory of the progressives.''
   At least some of those rejected by voters Sunday _ including the
government leaders in Lithuania and Kiev city party chief
Konstantin Masik _ had been targeted by reformers because of their
hard-line views. But information on the leanings of many others was
not available.
   The voters' rejection of top local officials for the national
parliament did not sweep them from the jobs that give them great
power and prestige. However, it was an embarrassment that could
seriously weaken their power base. Party leader Anatoly Gerasimov
in Leningrad and the party's No. 2 leader in Moscow, Yuri
Prokofiev, received less than 20 percent of the vote.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the party
would review reasons why candidates lost, and local party
organizations would decide what to do with unpopular officials.
   Gorbachev has said that criticism leveled at top leaders,
including himself, by Soviet citizens is an acceptable price for
reform.
   He said after voting Sunday that he supports competition at all
levels, and said that even supporters of Yeltsin's populist
candidacy could be a positive influence because they wanted to push
the reform process further along.
   Gorbachev did not face the voters on Sunday because he and most
other members of the ruling party Politburo were elected to be
among the 100 deputies to which the party is entitled in the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.
   Of 641 top party officials who took part in that balloting, 12
voted against Gorbachev. ``I would be very much upset if there was
no criticism,'' Gorbachev said when asked Sunday about the negative
votes.
   The size of the anti-establishment vote nationwide showed
officials did not tamper with the results, thereby indicating
Gorbachev is serious about democratic reforms.
   Monitors from the U.S.-based International Human Rights Law
Group said the election process appeared efficient, and that they
saw no evidence of cheating.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, asked on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show if he thought Gorbachev would regret the election,
said:
   ``I don't think so. I would have to say of course that we feel
that the jury is still very much out on whether or not perestroika
will succeed,'' Baker said. ``We don't think there'll be any
reversal of what's taken place, though, because once you let people
taste the fruits of freedom, it's pretty hard to put the genie back
in the bottle. But I'm not sure he'll rue the day.''

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Differing Tax Treatment of Government Pensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday barred states
from taxing federal pensions if they exempt the pensions of retired
state and local government workers.
   By an 8-1 vote, the court struck down Michigan's differing tax
treatment of the pensions received by retired government employees.
   The court's lone dissenter said the decision will affect similar
tax laws in at least 14 other states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia,
Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, New York, North Carolina,
Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   The challenged Michigan law ``violates principles of
intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local
government employees over retired federal employees,'' Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
   He said Paul S. Davis, a lawyer living in East Lansing, is
entitled to a refund of $4,299 on taxes he paid from 1979 through
1984.
   Davis worked for the federal government at various times in his
career, retiring in 1980.
   He challenged the Michigan law that allows federal retirees
living in the state to deduct only up to $7,500 of their annual
federal pensions when computing their state tax liability. The law
permits retired employees of the state government and local
governments within Michigan to deduct all their state pensions from
their state taxes.
   Michigan courts had upheld the law.
   Kennedy said the law impermissibly clashes with a federal law
authorizing states to tax federal employees ``if the taxation does
not discriminate against the ... employee because of the source of
the pay or compensation.''
   The justices rejected arguments by Michigan authorities that the
law applies only to federal employees, not federal pensioners.
   The court said the inequity among government workers may not
continue. But the justices left it up to Michigan courts to decide
whether the proper remedy would be exempting all federal pensions
from state taxes or exposing the pensions of state and local
government retirees to some state taxation.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a spirited dissenting opinion,
said, ``I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on
a state's power to administer its own affairs.''
   In a separate ruling, the court said federal criminal defendants
who fail to persuade a judge to dismiss their indictments because
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are
tried and convicted.
   The unanimous ruling in a case from Buffalo, N.Y., likely means
the court will turn down two appeals that have been pending before
the justices for some time.
   In one, ex-White House aide Oliver North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim
are attempting to challenge a judge's refusal to dismiss their
indictments stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
   A federal appeals court ruled that the three could not make
their prosecutorial-misconduct appeal before they stand trial.
   North currently is on trial, and the other two are awaiting
trial.
   In a second pending case, hotel owners Harry and Leona Helmsley
are challenging their 1988 tax-evasion indictment in New York City.
   In a third decision Tuesday, the court made it easier for people
who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits to get their
lawyer fees paid by the losing side.
   The court ruled unanimously in a Texas case that those who
prevail on a ``significant'' issue in such suits are entitled to
reimbursement even if they lose on the case's ``central'' issue.

<HEAD>Chinese Can Sue Government, Under New Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese will be allowed to sue their government
under a new law submitted Tuesday, but a noted legal scholar said
the legislation comes down heavily on the side of protecting the
state.
   Another law, also submitted Tuesday, delineates the powers of
the National People's Congress, China's legislature. It, too,
favors a centralization of power.
   Both laws are expected to pass as submitted during the current
session of the legislature.
   The legislation allowing the lawsuits, officially known as the
Administrative Procedure Law, completes a series of legislation
promulgated since 1979 which aim at instituting a rule of law in
China.
   In 1979, China passed its criminal code law, allowing the state
to take the people to court. In 1985, it passed a law on civil
suits, allowing people to sue each other.
   Under a draft of the new law, Chinese may sue their government
and its agencies if their ``lawful rights and interests have been
infringed upon by a specific administrative act of an
administrative organ or its personnel.''
   Infringement can include fines, the restriction of ``freedom,''
refusal by an administrative bureau to carry out a task, and the
compulsory seizure of property.
   The main problem is that the law allows Chinese people to
challenge the legality of an act but not the law itself. Thus, if
the government can prove its action was based on a law, no suit can
be brought, according to the draft.
   Zhang Shuyi, a researcher at the Political Science and Law
College of China, said this problem shows the law ``doesn't
adequately protect the interests of the people.''
   Writing in the World Economic Herald, Zhang said the law ``ends
up protecting the government more than anything else.''
   ``The strange thing is that for the longest time we've turned a
blind eye to the violation of the people's rights,'' he said, ``but
at soon as someone says the people should be allowed to sue,
somebody says we have to protect the interests of the government.
   ``Since when do we have to protect the power of the
government?'' he said. ``The goverment by its nature is power.''
   The key to understanding this problem is that lawmakers and
executors in China want to ensure the courts don't become too
powerful, he said.
   ``This is not like the United States where they have a
separation of powers and the various departments battle on an equal
footing,'' he said. ``The goal is to keep the courts weak.''
   Since the communist revolution in 1949, law was regarded as
``bourgeois,'' and a ``tool of capitalist society.''
   But in reality, political campaigns and purges since 1957,
culminating in the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, resulted in a
massive infringement of basic rights. Red Guards closed the
schools, religion was repressed, and people were jailed, beaten and
killed because they were born into a family that once belonged to
the upper classes.
   Beginning in 1978, a reform movement to open China to the West
and introduce elements of a market economy into the state-run
system pushed change in the legal system.
   Reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, were concerned they did not
repeat the abuses of the past. They also were sensitive to the
demands for legal protection for foreign clients who want to do
business in China.
   Major problems remain, however.
   Although China's constitution guarantees freedom of opinion,
thousands of prisoners remain jailed for political beliefs. In
addition, the courts remain powerless when compared to the
Communist Party and the administrative wing of the government.
   An example appeared on the front page of Sunday's People's
Daily, which reported that three lawyers were arrested and jailed
for several months because they chose to enter an innocent plea for
a rape suspect. The prosecutor's office disagreed with the plea and
ordered them jailed on charges of ``protecting a criminal,'' the
paper said.
   Their case eventually was taken up by the National People's
Congress and they were released.
   Another problem with the legal system concerns the function of
the congress, ostensibly responsible for making laws in China.
   Under the second piece of legislation submitted Tuesday, the
congress can only propose laws after 30 of the approximately 3,000
delegates submit a bill and it passes the inspection of the
congress' Presidium.
   Since the Presidium is nominated by the State Council, China's
Cabinet, the effect of the law is to further centralize government
power in the council's hands. The law, known as the Rules of
Procedure for the National People's Congress, gives the State
Council power to submit legislation directly. The Communist Party
controls the State Council.

<HEAD>Court: Arab Ruler Can't Claim Immunity From Questioning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the United Arab Emirates
can't avoid questioning in a lawsuit involving his personal
investments by claiming ``head of state immunity,'' New York
state's top court ruled Tuesday.
   His Highness Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, who rules Abu
Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, must submit himself
to a deposition before litigation involving $96 million can be
resolved, the New York Court of Appeals said in a unanimous
decision.
   Sheik Zayed's testimony is needed to resolve a flurry of
lawsuits involving Lasidi, S.A., a Swiss investment firm, and
Financiera Avenida, a Panamanian firm, both of which funneled the
Arab leader's money into overseas investments.
   The Panamanian company sued Lasidi, S.A., claiming it used the
Sheik's funds in an unauthorized manner, the court said. The Swiss
company launched a defamation suit and asked for the Sheik's
testimony.
   Lower courts dismissed Avenida's lawsuits because the Sheik
refused to give a deposition, claiming he didn't have to under the
international common-law doctrine of ``head of state immunity.''
The Court of Appeals upheld the lower court rulings.
   ``The Sheik cannot seek to recover some $96 million in personal
funds by counterclaims brought in an American court through his
corporate alter ego while at the same time invoking head of state
immunity as a means of insulating himself from discovery on the
matters directly related to the substance of those counterclaims,''
the court wrote.
   Since Avenida is a corporate shell, with no functioning officers
or directors, there's no one else for the lawyers to talk to, the
court said.

   James Garner has reached a
multimillion-dollar settlement of his lawsuit against Universal
Studios over delayed profit payments from the ``Rockford Files''
television series, Garner's lawyer said.
   Attorney Marvin Burns declined to reveal terms of the
settlement, which he called ``satisfactory.'' Garner previously had
rejected a $6 million offer by Universal to settle the lawsuit, in
which he demanded $16.5 million in damages and unpaid profits for
the popular 1970s show.
   Garner and other actors claimed that studio accountants charged
excessive expenses, using these calculations to cut into payments
to actors.
   Garner in 1983 sued Universal, a unit of MCA, Inc., for fraud,
deceit and breach of contract.
   Garner received no profit payments until December 1988, when he
was paid $607,000 after the show had grossed $125 million in
network and syndicated runs, Burns said. Garner's contract called
for the actor to receive 37.5 percent of net profits from
syndication and other sales, Burns said.
   Universal and other studios usually deduct expenses and other
charges before they calculate the net profit percentages that are
paid actors.
   ``Rockford Files'' ran for five years on NBC.

   Marie Biaggi, wife of former U.S. Rep. Mario
Biaggi, has filed for separation after nearly 48 years of marriage,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Biaggi, a former Bronx congressman, is scheduled to surrender to
federal authorities April 10 to begin serving a 30-month prison
sentence for his 1987 conviction for obstruction of justice and
receiving two free vacations from Meade Esposito, the former
Brooklyn Democratic Party boss.
   Biaggi is appealing his August conviction on racketeering
charges in the Wedtech case, in which he was sentenced to eight
years in jail.
   Mrs. Biaggi filed for a separation March 2, the Daily News
reported, citing papers filed at the Bronx County clerk's office.
   The Biaggis were married April 20, 1941, and have four grown
children.
   Mario Biaggi's lawyer, James LaRossa, told the newspaper he did
not know whether Mrs. Biaggi planned to file for divorce.

   The television sets at the women's prison
were tuned to the same channel Monday night, for a Burt Reynolds'
TV movie that featured an escape scene filmed here.
   Thirty inmates of the Lantana Correctional Institute crowded
into a viewing room and cheered each time the minimum-to-medium
security prison appeared on the screen during the B.L. Stryker
episode, ``Blind Chess.''
   ``We never had a movie star here before,'' said inmate Paula
Creed, 21, during a commercial break.
   The inmates watched on new television sets paid for by Reynolds'
production company, Blue Period Inc., which paid $1,500 to LCI for
a location fee.
   The prisoners applauded wildly during an escape segment in which
Reynolds, playing the Stryker character, clung to a helicopter
trying to prevent one of the female prisoners from escaping with
her boyfriend.
   Prison Superintendent Ray Henderson, who played a prison guard
in the episode and watched the show with the inmates, said he and
the guards who appear in the film had been looking forward to it.
   Lantana city officials critisized prison officials last year
after a string of real breakouts.

   ``Singin' in the Rain'' will become
the first musical to tour the Soviet Union, and the show also will
hit the stage in China, actor Tommy Steele said Tuesday.
   Steele told a news conference the 1993 tour may also include
South Korea and Hong Kong.
   Harold Fielding, the show's producer, said he was looking at
theaters in Moscow big enough to take the musical, which is based
on the hit movie starring Gene Kelly.
   Steele, 52, starred in ``Singin' in the Rain'' in London from
1983-85. Since last appearing in the musical in Tokyo 18 months
ago, Steele has been performing in concerts in Scandinavia and the
United States.

   Seventy-five years after Joe Hill died,
the man who brought him to life in a song has been honored in a
ceremony at the state Capitol.
   A proclamation signed by Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner was
presented Monday to Earl Robinson. Then the shy, soft-spoken writer
sat down to the piano and belted out his favorites to a small but
enthusiastic audience in the Capitol rotunda.
   Robinson's best-known song was about Joe Hill, the
Swedish-American labor organizer who was executed by a Utah firing
squad in 1914.
   Robinson's tune, which begins with the line, ``I dreamed I saw
Joe Hill last night, alive as you and me,'' is one of the most
popular labor songs of the century.
   Robinson's other songs include ``Ballad for Americans'' made
famous by black baritone Paul Robeson; ``The House I Live In,''
sung by Frank Sinatra at the 100th anniversary of the Statue of
Liberty; and the 1954 desegregation song ``Black and White,'' which
became a hit for Three Dog Night in 1972.

   A Jesuit community whose members include former
anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan has defeated a landlord's efforts
to evict it from its home, lawyers said Tuesday.
   Landlord Johny Melohn had claimed the 23 Jesuits occupying 16
apartments in his building on Manhattan's Upper West Side were in
effect operating a monastery, which he said were grounds for him to
deny them a new lease.
   But Civil Court Judge Joan Lobis ruled that the apartments _ on
several floors in a 135-apartment building _ did not constitute a
monastery, and the lease was renewable, said Carol Anne Herlihy,
lawyer for the Jesuits.
   The judge also rejected Melohn's argument that the Jesuits did
not use the building as their primary residence, Herlihy said.
   The Jesuits work as chaplains, teachers, counselors, writers and
lecturers. Berrigan gained public attention as an anti-war
protester of the 1960s.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The harbor reopened and a fleet of tankers
anchored offshore churned in to pick up oil today for the first
time since the biggest spill in U.S. history closed the port at the
southern end of the Alaskan pipeline.
   Authorities, meanwhile, investigated reports that the captain of
the tanker responsible for the 100-square-mile spill in Prince
William Sound had drinking problems, and winds that had the oil
moving ``like it's on a superhighway'' died down.
   At the White House, President Bush said that the federal
government would consider taking over the cleanup after top
officials travel to Alaska today ``to take a hard look at where
this disaster stands.''
   Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkiewicz said an Arco tanker would be
the first to arrive at the Valdez marine terminal, and nine other
tankers would follow. He said the oil slick spreading across the
sound was clear of shipping lanes.
   The port had been closed since the accident Friday, cutting the
flow through the Alaska pipeline, which supplies nearly 20 percent
of the nation's domestic oil. Some industry experts had predicted
sharp price increases from an extended shutdown.
   The accident reduced the oil flow through the pipeline to
800,000 barrels a day from 2.1 million.
   ``We look at all areas in an investigation and that's an area of
concern,'' National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Bill
Woody said of reports that Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood had
a drunken driving conviction as recently as September.
   Hazelwood probably will be required to testify at NTSB hearings
that begin April 4, Woody said.
   Hazelwood, 42, was not on the bridge when the vessel left
shipping lanes on Friday to avoid ice and ran aground, said Exxon
officials. The third mate, who did not have proper certification,
was in charge, company President Frank Iarossi said.
   Investigators said the results of drug and alcohol tests on crew
members will be made public perhaps in two or three days.
   Hazelwood pleaded guilty in 1984 to driving while intoxicated
after an accident near his home in Huntington, N.Y., The New York
Times reported today. He was convicted of drunken driving in
September in New Hampshire and his license was revoked, the paper
said. His driver's license had been suspended on two other
occasions during the past five years, the Time said.
   The cleanup Monday was set back by 70 mph gusts that swept the
slick more than 30 miles toward the southwest. But gusts died down
to 13 mph today, officials said.
   Beaches on four uninhabited islands have been fouled, and the
slick fast approached sensitive salmon-spawning areas.
   The cleanup ``is not proceeding well _ believe me, that is an
understatement,'' Iarossi said Monday. ``We've got a mess on our
hands.''
   ``It's unbelievable. That slick is moving like it's on a
superhighway,'' said Iarossi.
   Fewer than 135,000 gallons of oil have been recovered from the
10.1 million-gallon spill.
   Asked whether he was satisfied with Exxon's efforts, Bush said,
``They're certainly making a good beginning here, but there are
some conflicting reports on that. I don't want to prejudge that.''
   Bush said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Bill Reilly and Coast Guard
Commandant Paul Yost would evaluate the operation first hand and
that a federal takeover is ``an option.''
   The goo also threatened the region's abundant herring, marine
mammals and seabirds, biologists said.
   ``There are bird populations all over the place,'' said Pamela
Bergman, an Interior Department spokeswoman. Nearly 100 oiled birds
and two oiled sea otters have been spotted, and many more stricken
animals likely have gone undetected, she said.
   The cleanup was getting more difficult as the leading edge of
the slick moves into more remote areas of the sparsely inhabited
sound.
   Bergman and others said efforts to rescue thousands of animals
were hampered by fears that volunteers would be endangered in the
remote area, with its rugged shores, harsh weather and powerful
wild animals. Also, any animals rescued could die in the time it
would take to transport them to a hospital.
   The 987-foot tanker was carrying 1.2 million barrels of North
Slope crude oil when it ran aground.
   About 240,000 barrels spilled through the hull, creating the
slick that has spread to more than 100 square miles.
   The Port of Valdez has been closed since the accident, stranding
tankers and cutting production on the North Slope, which supplies
nearly 20 percent of the nation's domestic oil.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Steven McCall, however, said he planned to
reopen the port today.
   The vessel remained stuck on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles from
Valdez. Iarossi said the wind pivoted the ship 12 degrees to the
north, and that the crew said the new position felt much more
stable.
   Iarossi and Exxon spokesman Don Cornett said efforts to unload
the 1 million barrels that remained on board the vessel were
progressing well. Iarossi said Exxon hoped to have about 95 percent
of the remaining oil off the vessel in three or four days.
   Cornett said it appeared increasingly likely salvage crews will
be able to unload the Exxon Valdez, refloat it and get it to
drydock without spilling more oil.
   The wind did damage some of the containment booms used to corral
the oil, Iarossi said.
   Fishermen held a news conference Monday to complain that Exxon
was not taking adequate steps to warn cleanup workers and nearby
villagers about the health threat from the oil and from burning it
with jelled gasoline.
   Smoke from test burns conducted on the spill last week prompted
complaints of nausea and severe headaches among residents of
Tatitlek, a village of 100.
   ``You're talking about fish. We're talking about human lives,''
said Norman Vlasoff. ``The whole village is getting sick.''
   Gov. Steve Cowper has declared Prince William Sound a disaster
area and said he would seek federal money to help with the spill.
   ``I think sorting out the money is something that will occupy
lawyers for years to come,'' Cowper said. ``We will do everything
possible to make sure the industry pays for this.''
   Cornett said the company has no cost estimate for the cleanup,
which could take months.

<HEAD>Korean Dissident Meets with Communist Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Korean dissident defied his
government and met with North Korean President Kim Il Sung to
discuss reunification of the two nations, it was reported Tuesday.
   The Rev. Moon Ik-hwan and Kim held talks Monday that were
``overflowing with compatriotic sentiments'' about ways to end the
division of the Korean peninsula, according to North Korea's news
agency.
   Kim told Moon that since ``national reunification is a
nationwide cause, anyone may come even individually, if he wants to
discuss the question of reunification, and we will welcome him,''
the Korean Central News Agency said.
   On Tuesday, Moon visited Kim's birthplace, a favorite North
Korean tourist spot, and watched a revolutionary opera, the news
agency said.
   Moon's visit has provoked controversy in South Korea, where
government officials say he is serving North Korean interests.
Public opinion appears to be against his trip.
   The visit also has fueled demands from Seoul hardliners for a
crackdown on South Korea's dissident groups. Prosecutors in Seoul
said Monday that Moon will be prosecuted for aiding North Korea
when he returns.
   South Koreans cannot visit North Korea without government
permission.
   Moon's secret visit came shortly after President Roh Tae-woo
ordered a crackdown on dissidents and radical students he allleged
were trying to stage a leftist revolution. Roh cited the threat in
justifying his decision March 20 to indefinitely postpone a
promised referendum on his leadership.
   Police seized more than 3,000 copies of allegedly pro-North
Korean books and arrested 11 publishers in raids Monday night in
Seoul as part of Roh's suppression of leftist groups, prosecutors
said.
   North Korea appealed for Koreans on both sides of the border to
take a more active part in efforts to reunify the peninsula. It
said South Korean authorities, along with the United States, sought
to keep the division.
   The news agency said North Korean political parties and
organizations met Monday and declared that reunification is not a
task ``confined to specified classes and strata or to the
authorities.''
   ``To our regret,'' the agency said, ``the South Korean
authorities are openly suppressing the efforts of South Korean
personages and organizations or various circles to have dialogues
with the North.''
   It said, ``If people meet and hold a dialogue, they can easily
come to understanding and pool their will and ... turn the
atmosphere of confrontation into that of unity and resolve the
tangled problems between the authorities without much difficulty.''
   Also on Tuesday, sports officials from both countries reported
progress on forming a joint team for the 1990 Asian Games in
Beijing.
   Aside from the sports talks, begun March 9, the two Koreas have
been holding intermittent talks since August on improving
relations. Little progress has been made as each side has tended to
push its own proposals.
   The peninsula has been divided since the end of World War II in
1945. North Korea's invasion in 1950 triggered a three-year war,
and the two sides continue to station thousands of troops along
their border.

   Inmates infected with the AIDS virus
will be able to use pseudonyms and wear disguises when they appear
as witnesses in a trial of their lawsuit against the state, a
federal magistrate has ruled.
   But they will have to give their testimony in an open courtroom,
U.S. Magistrate Joan Glazer Margolis said Monday.
   Attorneys for the inmates, who are suing the state Department of
Correction to improve medical care, had asked that all proceedings
be held in a judge's chambers and that only edited versions of the
trial transcripts be made public.
   The attorneys, from the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and
Yale Legal Services, had argued that strict secrecy was needed to
protect the prisoners from harassment by other inmates and
retaliation by the state.
   The class-action lawsuit brought by the inmates seeks to force
the Correction Department to improve medical care for inmates
carrying the AIDS virus and increase AIDS education and counseling
for all prisoners.
   Attorneys for the state had agreed to the use of pseudonyms but
opposed efforts to close the trial and seal portions of the
transcripts.
   In her ruling, Margolis noted the importance of protecting the
privacy of the inmates but said she reluctantly concluded there is
a less restrictive alternative.
   Margolis authorized the use of fictitious names by those
bringing suit, and ordered ``there shall be no testimony of a
sufficiently detailed nature to compromise their identities.''
   Inmates may also testify in ``a disguised manner, so that he or
she will not be recognized by facial or other characteristics,''
the decision said.
   The magistrate held out the possibility she would be willing to
modify her ruling on a case-by-case basis in instances where the
guidelines are insufficient to protect an identity.

   Actor Carroll O'Connor, who underwent heart
bypass and gallbladder surgery at Emory University Hospital, was
discharged Tuesday and said, ``I feel a lot better than when I went
in.''
   O'Connor, who gained fame as the neighborhood bigot Archie
Bunker in the television series ``All In The Family,'' was admitted
to the hospital March 10 after a routine physical examination. He
was working on his current series, ``In The Heat Of The Night,'' in
nearby Covington at the time.
   He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery the next day.
The gallbladder surgery was performed March 20 after O'Connor
developed unrelated gallbladder problems while recovering from the
bypass.
   O'Connor, 64, said he did not suffer a heart attack. ``I had a
surgery that is going to prevent a heart attack,'' he told
reporters outside the hospital.
   ``The heart is better than it has ever been, and here I am
walking out. Thank the Lord,'' he added.
   He said doctors told him he could return to work in about a
month. He also said he will quit smoking and get more exercise.
   He said filming of ``In The Heat Of The Night'' will not resume
until July.

<HEAD>`Roseanne,' and `Brewster Place' Women Almost Spoil NBC Streak</HEAD>

   NBC tied CBS' 26-year-old record of 40 weeks
atop the Nielsens last week by barely edging ABC, whose
``Roseanne'' and ``The Women of Brewster Place'' came in first and
second.
   ``We were lucky,'' said Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for
research projects. He said NBC would be lucky to win again next
week to become the all-time record-holder, because ABC has the
Academy Awards on Wednesday.
   But for the week ending March 26, according to the A.C. Nielsen
Co., NBC had an average, prime-time rating of 14.9, half a rating
point in front of ABC, which had a 14.4. CBS trailed with 11.6. NBC
has won all 27 weeks in the season to date, plus 13 in a row before
that. The last time a network won 40 weeks in a row was when CBS
did it during the 1962-63 television season.
   It appears unlikely that CBS will catch ABC for second place
this season. With only three weeks to go _ the 1987-88 television
season has an asterisk beside it because of delays caused by last
summer's writers' strike _ NBC has an average 16.1 to ABC's 12.9
and CBS' 12.6.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the top-rated show of the week for the
third week in a row, with a rating of 25.7 and a 38 share. The
second half of ``The Women of Brewster Place,'' starring Oprah
Winfrey who was also co-executive producer, had a 24.5 and a 38
share. It became the highest-rated, two-part movie this season.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC, ``The Golden Girls'' NBC,
``Day by Day Special'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Empty Nest'' NBC and
``L.A. Law'' NBC.
   CBS was shut out of the top 10. Its highest-rated show, ``60
Minutes,'' was 13th.
   Some venerable old-timers made a showing. The 29-year-old tape
of Mary Ma as ``Peter Pan'' ranked 21st with a
16.1 rating and a 27 share. NBC broadcast it Friday night for the
first time since 1973.
   ABC also goecent showing out of the 1956 epic ``The Ten
Commandments.'' It was 31st with a 14.7 rating and26 share.
   Among the spring tryouts, NBC's `antum Leap'' premiered at a
respectable 30th. Co new Monday comedies, ``Live In'' and
``Heartld mediocre performances, landing in 41st and 44th
place, respectively. ABC's new ``Men'' was a lowly 71st in the
rankings.
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``Hard Time on
Planet Earth,'' ``NCAA Basketball Championship Thursday Prega
``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Purple Hearts,''
``The Shaggy Dog, Part One,'' ``HeartBeat,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Men''
and ``TV 101.''
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' won the news race, edging the ``CBS
Evening News,'' which was affected by NCAA basketball pre-emptions.
ABC had a 10.8 and 20 share, CBS a 10.5 and 20 share, ``NBC Nightly
News'' a 9.6 and 19 share.

<HEAD>Officials to Judge Whether Government Should Take Over Cleanup from
Exxon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush dispatched three high-ranking
officials to Alaska on Tuesday to ``take a hard look'' at the
nation's worst oil spill and judge whether the government should
take over the massive cleanup job from Exxon.
   With an oil slick spread across 100 square miles of Prince
William Sound, Bush said the first priority is to protect the
environment and ``clean up this disaster.'' Then, he said, the
government will decide on any penalties for the spill.
   ``This is a matter of tremendous concern to Alaskans and,
indeed, to all of us,'' Bush said. ``The conservation side is
important. The energy side is important.''
   Bush was briefed on the disaster by Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner, Environmental Protection Agency chief William
Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost. Immediately after the
meeting in the Oval Office, they left for Alaska.
   The oil spilled into the water after the 987-foot tanker Exxon
Valdez, trying to avoid ice, rammed a reef and ran aground Friday.
Fewer than 135,000 gallons of oil have been recovered from the 10.1
million-gallon spill.
   The ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on bridge when the
accident occurred. Instead, the third mate, who did not have proper
certification, was in charge, according to Exxon Shipping Co.,
which owns the tanker.
   The harbor reopened Tuesday, tankers anchored offshore churned
in to pick up oil, and winds which had been moving the oil died
down. The port had been closed since the accident, reducing the
flow of oil through the Alaska pipeline. Coast Guard Lt. Ed
Wieliczkiewicz said the oil slick spreading across the sound was
clear of shipping lanes.
   Commenting on reports that Hazelwood had a drinking problem,
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Bill Woody said,
``We look at all areas in an investigation and that's an area of
concern.''
   Bush and Skinner hinted Exxon could face big civil penalties.
   ``There are a variety of legal options that are available. But
right now the primary consideration is to make sure everything
possible is being done,'' Skinner said.
   ``And the president has directed us to assess that, that oil is
being contained and that the oil that remains on the tanker is
being offloaded as quick as possible. That is our primary objective
as mandated by the president. ... We'll then later on worry about
who is going to pay for the damage.
   ``But there are significant penalties and provisions for
reimbursement,'' Skinner said.
   Bush said, ``the thing is to get it cleaned up, to protect the
very precious environment out there, to make sure everything is
being done to clean up this disaster. And then we'll have all these
penalties and all that later on.''
   At this point, Exxon is in charge of the cleanup in one of the
world's most environmentally sensitive and biologically rich marine
waters. Bush said that 14 federal agencies also were involved, and
that much of the equipment has been furnished by the Coast Guard.
   Asked whether Exxon was doing enough, Bush said, ``I've just had
a report that they're certainly making a good beginning here, but
there's been some conflict reports on that and I don't want to
prejudge that. I think one of the things we're interested in
hearing is exactly how our top officials feel the cleanup is
going.''
   Bush said, ``There is an option for federalization (of the
cleanup) and then the question is, is that the most prudent way to
go?''
   By some estimates, the cleanup will require several months.
Exxon Shipping Co. president Frank Iarossi said Monday the cleanup
``is not proceeding well _ believe me, that is an understatement.
We've got a mess on our hands.''
   Bush said he was dispatching the federal team ``to take a hard
look at where this disaster stands.'' He said they would report to
him after their investigation.
   The president said the disaster had not affected his endorsement
of ``environmentally prudent'' oil exploration in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, a vast expanse of wilderness that is home
to caribou, polar bears and a variety of waterfowl in the
northeastern reaches of Alaska.
   ``I see no connection,'' Bush said.
   ``They've been shipping oil out of here for a long, long time
and never had anything of this magnitude or this concern. ... I
don't know how you design against what appears to be the cause here
_ you have a ship that's out of the channel, going 12 knots and
ripping the bottom out of the most modern tanker that's ever been
built to haul this oil.''
   At a separate news conference, 11 major environmental groups
blasted the oil industry for breaking promises of assuring that
environmental accidents such as the spill in Alaska would not
occur, or if they happen would be quickly cleaned up.
   ``The great accident they said wouldn't happen has now
happened,'' said Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club.
   Brock Evans of the National Audubon Society said, ``We've had
enough of oil industry promises. They can't be kept.''

<HEAD>Medical Manufacturer Agrees To Pay $764,000 In Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical equipment manufacturer agreed in a plea
bargain Tuesday to pay $764,000 in penalties for selling thousands
of defective pacemakers and batteries prone to corrosion.
   Cordis Corp. pleaded guilty to 12 felony counts and 13
misdemeanors in the criminal case.
   The company agreed last week to pay $5 million to settle a
civil-fraud claim filed by the government. Four company executives
still face a criminal trial in September on related charges.
   The Miami-based company, which sold its pacemaker division two
years ago, was accused of distributing 2,200 faulty pacemakers and
6,000 batteries subject to corrosion between December 1983 and
October 1985.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration charged the pacemakers,
implanted under the skin to regulate the heartbeat, could stop
without warning, but no medical emergencies have been linked to the
devices.
   The Justice Department and Cordis had been negotiating a plea
since last year, but U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus rejected
one version last October, saying the punishment was insufficient.
   The company had offered to plead guilty to 24 counts and pay
$264,000 in fines and costs.
   The agreement accepted by Marcus on Tuesday added a felony
charge carrying a $500,000 penalty for intent to defraud the FDA by
failing to relay adverse field reports as required.
   Formal sentencing in the criminal case against the company has
been set for April 25. Marcus is not bound by the restrictions of
the plea agreement.
   The company agreed last week to pay $5 million to settle the
civil claim by the Veterans Administration, which purchased an
undisclosed number of the pacemakers, and to cover reimbursement
for devices purchased through Medicare and Medicaid programs.
   Cordis spokesman Chick McDowell said there haven't been any
lawsuits filed by people who bought the pacemakers or had them
implanted by the VA.
   The Justice Department said the civil settlement was believed to
be one of the largest Medicare recoveries ever.
   Cordis general counsel Daniel G. Hall, who entered the guilty
plea on the company's behalf, said the company has paid $1 million
already and the remaining penalty plus interest will be paid within
three years.
   Cordis, which sold its pacemaker business to the Australian
medical device manufacturer Telectronics, now concentrates on
making catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and
gauges for monitoring pressure on the brain.
   The company reported net losses of $56.1 million in 1987 but
underwent a major restructuring after selling the pacemaker
operation. Net earnings for 1988 totaled $2.4 million on sales of
$132 million.

<HEAD>End of Long-Running Hospital Soap Leaves Void in Saturday Night TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saturday nights won't be the same
in Germany now that TV viewers can't get a dose of their favorite
hospital drama.
   The hour-long ``Schwarzwaldklinik'' _ a moralistic soap opera
about a country clinic in the Black Forest _ has captivated viewers
since 1985.
   The often-folksy plots caused some wags to dub it
``Schmalz-waldklinik,'' but that didn't stop it from becoming the
top TV series in West German history.
   ``There were an average of 20 million viewers every Saturday it
ran. That is an absolute record for a weekly series,'' said
Bernward Frank, media research chief for ZDF television.
   According to ZDF, the 20 million viewers represent 50 percent of
West German households in this country of 61.5 million people.
   ZDF originally planned only 23 episodes, but viewers demanded
more.
   Now, after 70 episodes about the intrigues, tragedy and romance
surrounding the fictitious hospital, the show has ended.
   Following Saturday's last episode, the weekly newspaper Bild am
Sonntag claimed that 55 percent of viewers want the show to
continue.
   ``The show should continue,'' said Harald Kerner, a fan.
   ``It was exactly right for the mass audience,'' Kerner told the
Munich daily Abendzeitung newspaper. ``Dream professions, beautiful
scenery, and love stories _ things that make life worthwhile.''
   One of the reasons for the show's success was that it regularly
featured well-known West German actors as guest stars, such as Gerd
Froebe, who was in the James Bond movie ``Goldfinger.''
   Froebe, who died in September, made his final major appearance
in the ``Schwarzwaldklinik'' as a zestful old man who celebrates
his 100th birthday at the clinic.
   The show revolved around handsome, middle-aged surgeon Klaus
Brinkmann, portrayed by Klausjuergen Wussow, his family and the
close-knit hospital staff.
   Brinkmann soon fell in love with Christa, a nurse who later
became a physician. Christa, played by Gaby Dohm, appealed to many
West German women who saw her realizing a successful career as a
doctor.
   One of the highlights of the series was when Brinkmann suffered
a heart attack at the same time Christa was giving birth to their
son, Benjamin.
   Brinkmann's father-figure image to his staff and family was
enhanced in one of the last episodes when he donated of his own
kidneys to save the life of his nephew.
   Adding to interest to the series was Udo, Brinkmann's
physician-son from a previous marriage. Udo, played by Sascha Hehn,
easily won viewers' hearts with on-again, off-again romances, the
last being with a nurse named Elke, played by Wussow's real-life
daughter, Barbara.
   Udo finally marries Elke in the last episode to provide a happy
ending after keeping audiences in suspense over the years.
   ZDF said it has sold the series to entertainment outlets in more
than 45 foreign countries.

   Eight people stood in silent vigil
outside the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Tuesday to mark the
10th anniversary of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident.
   The group held lighted candles and took up places about 50 yards
from the plant gate at 4 a.m., the hour on March 28, 1979, when
alarms pierced the air, warning of a water blockage that melted
part of the plant's core.
   ``It was an accident that changed the world as people knew it,''
said anti-nuclear organizer Gene Stilp of Harrisburg. ``It was a
safe atom no more.''
   Commemorative events Monday included a march and rally outside
the plant that drew more than 100 sign-carrying participants.
   Judy Richards, 38, said the protests ``reinforce people's bad
feelings about this place, and hopefully makes a difference to
people who work at the island. It's good to keep it current in
people's minds, because the danger is here, every day.''
   Tuesday morning, TMI Unit 1 puffed white steam into the inky
pre-dawn sky, signaling that the reactor deep inside the plant was
pumping heated water and driving steam turbines.
   Ten years ago, in the adjacent Unit 2, water was blocked on the
steam side of the reactor and a pressure relief valve on the
radioactive side stuck open. Within three hours, loss of cooling
water caused half of the 150-ton core to melt, and 20 tons of
uranium fuel and debris streamed to the reactor bottom. Water still
in its lower reaches of the vessel prevented a meltdown through the
steel reactor vessel.
   Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere and within days,
tens of thousands of nearby residents had fled for safer areas.
   Gordon Tomb, a spokesman for GPU Nuclear Corp., the utility
subsidiary that operates the plant now, said extra people had been
assigned to the main gate this morning.
   ``Over the years, these demonstrations have been peaceful and we
didn't expect anything different this year,'' he said.
   As for the anniversary itself, Tombs said: ``We're inclined to
take the opportunity to note the lessons from the Unit 2 accident
and remind ourselves of the importance of remembering those
lessons.''
   The health effects of the accident continue to be debated.
Various studies found no evidence of increased human cancers. But
anti-nuclear activists claim the studies were flawed and say they
have seen evidence of increased cancers and vegetation mutations.
   The nearly $1 billion cleanup of Unit 2 should be completed late
next year. At dawn, only three protesters remained, their candles
flickering as photographers took a last round of shots.
   ``Even though the numbers were small, people are tired after 10
years, everyone still has strong feelings,'' said Sean Downey, one
of the protesters.
   ``The accident it not over ... it's still in effect.''

<HEAD>Operation Behind Because of U.N. Budget Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Nations is two to three
weeks behind schedule in preparing an observer force for the
Namibian independence process, which begins Saturday, a top-ranking
official said Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, officials reported the first gunfire against U.N.
soldiers in Namibia, but there were no injuries.
   The wrangle in the U.N. General Assembly over how much to spend
on the one-year operation and how many observers to send cut
drastically into time available for logistical arrangements, said
Cedric Thornberry of Ireland, the main assistant to U.N. Special
Representative Martti Ahtisaari.
   ``We had told them we needed a minimum of six to eight weeks. We
got a month,'' Thornberry said. ``But it looks like we will start
on April 1.''
   Ahtisaari, a Finn, is scheduled to arrive Saturday to oversee
U.N. efforts to ensure that South Africa conducts free elections in
the territory it has controlled for 74 years.
   The voting, planned for the first week in November, will be to
choose a constituent assembly that will write a constitution and
organize Namibia's first independent black majority-ruled
government.
   ``We are not going to delay the elections,'' Thornberry said,
``except in the case of something being done or not done that would
interfere with the fairness of the election. Then we would stop the
clock.''
   He said most of the U.N. military units are in position, but the
arrival of civilian workers and police monitors may be delayed
because of the lack of accommodation and vehicles.
   The U.N. group will consist of 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers, 500
police monitors, about 620 election monitors from various nations,
more than 760 U.N. civilian administrators and about 820 locally
hired staff.
   Ahtisaari said 803 military staff and 129 civilians are already
in Namibia. Thornberry said he expects the South African
administrator-general of the territory, Louis Pienaar, soon will
begin repealing discriminatory laws that might interfere with a
fair election and start the process of freeing political prisoners.
   But in the meantime, he said, the South Africans remain in
charge of border controls and law enforcement. He said there is no
plan to force repeal of laws which restrict hospitals and schools
by race.
   He said there would be discussions about Pienaar's plan to set
the voting age in Namibia at 21, rather than 18 as in South Africa.
Government opponents say Pienaar wants to restrict the numbers of
younger voters who may be more likely to favor the South-West
African People's Organization, or SWAPO, which fought South African
rule since 1966.
   The mission is budgeted at $416 million, of which over $52
million has already been collected from U.N. member states.
Ahtisaari said the total will go over $100 million by late next
week when some major pledges are paid.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 74 years, since it captured
the colony from Germany during World War I.
   In 1920, the League of Nations granted Pretoria a mandate to
govern Namibia. In 1966 the U.N. General Assembly revoked that
mandate, but the world body was unable to wrest control of the
mineral-rich territory from South Africa.
   In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to free Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola
are sent home by mid-1991.

   New battles broke out Tuesday
between police and ethinic Albanians who oppose new laws giving
Serbia more control over Kosovo province, and officials said 21
people had been killed in two days of fighting.
   The federal Interior Ministry said scores were injured. It said
extra police were being sent to Kosovo to try to quell violence
that began Monday and resumed Tuesday in at least 10 cities and
towns.
   An Associated Press reporter saw tanks and other military
vehicles on the roads outside Pristina, the provincial capital.
Army units were bivouacked in fields along the main roads into
Kosovo and police at roadblocks checked the identities of travelers.
   In Belgrade, capital of both Yugoslavia and of Serbia, its
largest republic, thousands of Serbs gathered in the streets to
celebrate of the constitutional changes.
   Kosovo's own legislature passed the constitutional changes last
Wednesday and the Serbian parliament approved them Tuesday.
   Protests in Kosovo, which was the heart of ancient Serbia but
now is 85 percent ethnic Albanian, began after the provincial
lawmakers acted and turned violent Monday.
   In one confrontation Tuesday, police killed an 18-year-old and
wounded 14 protesters when they opened fire after shots came from a
stone-throwing crowd of about 500 in Zur, near the Albanian border,
the official news agency Tanjug reported.
   The official death toll was the highest reported in Kosovo's
ethnic unrest.
   At least nine paople are known to have died during riots in
1981, when martial law was improsed briefly. Saturday is the
anniversary of those riots.
   Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew Tuesday in Kosovo and
banned public gatherings of more than three people. Schools,
theaters, movie houses and sports stadiums were closed indefinitely.
   Tanjug reported trouble in at least 10 towns before the curfew
hour. It said police repeatedly faced groups of between 50 and 400
stone-throwing youths that formed quickly and were dispersed with
clubs and tear gas.
   Shots occasionally were fired from the crowds, as in Zur, the
agency said.
   Some of Monday's worst violence occurred in Pristina, but the
town was comparatively calm Tuesday and was quiet after the curfew
hour.
   Dozens of military vehicles were visible during the day and riot
police patrolled in bulletproof vests. Sonic booms cracked as
military jets flew low overhead, a tactic used in Pristina
previously to discourage unrest.
   The federal Interior Ministry said two policemen were shot and
killed Monday and 25 had been injured, five seriously, in the two
days of violence. Nineteen protesters were killed and 49 injured,
and police were not responsible for all the deaths, the ministry
said.
   It said 146 of the ``most aggressive'' demonstrators were
detained. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been jailed in Kosovo
since a partial state of emergency was imposed last month.
   According to Tanjug, the ministry said the violence displayed
elements of ``an armed uprising,'' with snipers firing on police
from high floors of buildings. It blamed the trouble on ethnic
Albanian separatists and nationalists working with ``hostile
emigres'' and ``foreign factors.''
   In Serbia, nationalist demonstrations and rallies were reported
in towns, factories and schools.
   Flags waved in the center of Belgrade, which was closed for the
occasion. Thousands of people milled around podiums and stages to
hear speeches and folk musicians.
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Communist Party chief and
architect of the changes, received a standing ovation in the
republic's parliament.
   Hundreds of thousands of Serbs have rallied in central
Yugoslavia in recent months to press Milosevic's demands for
greater control over Kosovo's schools, judiciary and police force.
   Serbs say the changes are necessary to protect the Slavic
minority in Kosovo. They and others claim there is an underground
movement in Kosovo that seeks to unite it with Albania.

   U.S. officials said Tuesday that Iraq's
agreement to pay $27.35 million to the families of the 37 sailors
killed in the attack on the USS Stark is a satisfactory and fair
settlement but it is unclear when the payments will be made.
   The agreement, formally announced by the State Department,
represents about 92 percent of the $29.6 million the United States
had requested for the families of those who died in Iraq's
unprovoked missile attack on the Stark in 1987.
   Bush administration officials privately described the agreement
as ``satisfactory'' and a ``fair settlement.'' The sources,
speaking on condition they not be identified, also said it remained
unclear when Iraq would hand over the money. They said Iraqi
officials had offered the settlement in a take-it-or-leave-it
manner.
   The officials said Americans who were in Baghdad to settle the
matter were called in to see Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on
Monday ``and told that this was what (Iraqi) President (Saddam)
Hussein had decided.''
   ``There were no negotiations,'' one source continued. ``They
just announced this was what they were prepared to pay.''
   ``It was apparent to our delegation that this was going to be
the best they could do. They didn't dicker,'' said another official.
   The sources said they could not explain how Iraq settled on the
figure.
   ``The government of Iraq has agreed to pay over $27 million as
full compensation for (the) deaths,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler announced Tuesday.
   ``The agreement was reached in Baghdad (Monday) following
discussions between the foreign ministry of Iraq and a United
States delegation,'' she added.
   A victim compensation payment by Iraq has been described by U.S.
government officials as the most important step the Mideast country
can take to maintain good relations and follow through after its
public apology.
   Iraq has acknowledged that one of its warplanes fired on the
Stark on May 17, 1987, in what it said was a case of mistaken
identity. The Iraqis said the fighter thought it was attacking an
oil tanker bound for Iran.
   The United States has accepted that explanation by Iraq, while
pressing for financial compensation.
   Administration sources said the United States still plans to
press Iraq on two other claims _ a request for $82.9 million to
cover repairing the ship, and a request for compensation for
sailors who were injured but survived the attack.
   The Stark was part of a U.S. naval task force that has patrolled
the Persian Gulf since 1949. The attack in 1987 came when the
Iran-Iraq war was heating up.
   The Stark was steaming on a routine patrol, tracking a jet
fighter it had been told was ``assumed friendly, assumed Iraqi.''
   Then two Exocet missiles struck the guided-missile frigate, 30
seconds apart. The first was a dud. The second left 37 dead, almost
sinking the ship.
   Two months later, the United States was protecting oil tankers
owned by Iraqi ally Kuwait and the U.S. Navy had made the
transition to a wartime footing. Because of the Stark incident,
skippers were authorized to shoot first and ask questions later.
   Before fighting ended in a cease-fire last August, the USS
Vincennes had shot down an Iranian airliner with 290 aboard,
mistaking it for an Iranian jet fighter.
   While the cease-fire brought relative calm to the gulf, American
officials were unhappy over Iraq's failure to settle the Stark
compensation claim.
   Defense officials recently accused the Iraqi government of
``stonewalling,'' and the administration decided to send a team to
Baghdad last week led by State Department legal adviser Abraham
Sofaer.
   The original claim was based on a complicated assessment under
which each of the families would receive an average of $800,000. It
was not known what the average payment would be under reduced total
in the Iraq agreement.
   ``The government of Iraq has undertaken to make prompt payment
of the full amount,'' said one defense official. ``Payments will be
made to the families as quickly as possible after the receipt of
the funds.''

   At least 37 key Communist Party and government
leaders went down to embarrassing defeats in the Soviet Union's
first multicandidate election, according to results trickling in
Tuesday from across the nation.
   The losers in balloting for a new national parliament included a
candidate member of the ruling Politburo, the premiers of Latvia
and Lithuania, and 27 Communist Party leaders from major cities,
regions and republics, according to results obtained from
interviews and various press reports.
   The humiliation was greatest for officials who ran unopposed on
the ballot and still lost because more than 50 percent of the
voters crossed out their names.
   Activists in cities from Leningrad to Kiev waged ``cross-out''
campaigns urging citizens to vote against certain officials by
blacking out their names on the ballots.
   Izvestia reported Tuesday what it called the ``sensational''
result that no one was elected in 168 electoral districts where
there were only one or two candidates because so many citizens
voted against them.
   In the weeks prior to the election, activists carried posters in
Kiev illustrating ballots with several names crossed out. Ukrainian
Communist Party chief Vladimir Shcherbitsky won anyway, but voters
rejected both the party chief and the mayor of Kiev. All three ran
unopposed.
   In Leningrad, Deputy Mayor Alexei Bolshakov also lost despite
facing no opposition. Scraps of hand-made posters appeared
throughout the city in recent weeks suggesting he be defeated for
that reason alone, according to a resident.
   The defeat of so many top Communist Party and government
officials was seen as a blow to the establishment, but Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Tuesday that 80
percent of the party's candidates had won.
   Although those rejected for seats in the new Congress of
People's Deputies retain their current positions, Gerasimov said
local party organizations will examine the losses and decide their
future.
   ``Maybe they were wrong for their posts,'' he said. ``Maybe they
failed to advertise their platforms. Every case should be taken
separately.''
   In Lithuania, where voters rejected the Baltic republic's
president, premier, two vice premiers, the planning commission
chairman, the minister of justice, five party officials and a
mayor, local media questioned whether the Council of Ministers and
Presidium should be dissolved ``in light of the people's lack of
trust.''
   Lithuanian Council of Ministers spokesman Cheslovas Jurshenas,
responding to that question at a press briefing, said only that the
election was for the national parliament and did not concern the
officials' posts in the government of the republic.
   Despite intense interest, most election results have yet to be
reported in Soviet media. Tuesday night's television news did not
mention any specific races.
   Run-off elections are scheduled April 9 for districts in which
candidates failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote. But it
was not clear how soon there could be new nominations and entirely
new elections in the districts where voters rejected one or both
candidates.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov is expected to be
nominated next week as a candidate from the Academy of Sciences,
where only eight of 23 contenders received 50 percent of the votes
on the first round. The academy has 20 guaranteed seats in the new
congress.
   Although a number of the winners are progressives from inside
and outside the party, it is not clear if they will constitute a
significant force on the 2,250-member Congress of People's
Deputies, or on the approximately 500-member working parliament to
be chosen from among the deputies.
   Nor is it clear if the newcomers will find common issues to
unite them.
   But Virgilijus Chepaitis, a leader of the political reform group
Sajudis, which swept the Lithuanian elections, said he believes
one-third of the new deputies will be progressives dedicated to
liberalizing the political and economic system of the Soviet Union.
   Chepaitis also raised the possibility that deputies would
quickly form coalitions to enhance their political power. He
specifically suggested that the Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia might find common interests with the smaller
autonomous regions inside the huge Russian republic.
   Boris Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief who campaigned for
an end to special privileges of the party elite, swept to an 89
percent victory in the parliamentary district encompassing all of
the capital. After his win, he left for a month's vacation.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire H. Ross Perot, saying the nation's
capital has some of the nation's worst schools, urged local
business leaders Tuesday to pitch in and help fight the city's
murder, drug and crime epidemic.
   ``Get out of your fancy house,'' Perot said. ``Get down there
where the rubber meets the road ... and say, `Let's fix this; let's
help these folks.'
   ``It's pure self-interest, if I can't get you excited any other
way, because you're helping the tax base,'' he said.
   Perot, a colorful and controversial Texas businessman, spoke to
more than 500 Washington-area business leaders who support the
Salvation Army at the charitable group's annual district luncheon.
He cited Washington's surge in drug-related slayings, which have
given it the highest per capita murder rate in the nation.
   ``You say, `What can I do?' Here's what you can do. ... You can
clean up the schools in this town. You can clean up streets in this
town. You can make it a safe place for people to live.''
   Perot, who led an education reform drive in Texas, said of
Washington's schools, ``You've got one of the worst school systems
in the country right here.'' He added that the remark would be
controversial locally, and said: ``I'm not up here looking for love
... I'm going to stir things up and leave town, frankly.''
   ``The point is, how can you live with having one of the worst
school systems in the nation? That's inexcusable.''
   Perot made a fortune from his Electronic Data Systems and is
embroiled in a legal dispute with General Motors, which bought the
data-processing company and now seeks to block him from competing
through a new company.
   Noting Washington's crime problem, Perot said, ``I checked to
make sure General Motors hadn't arranged this invitation, and came
on.''

<TEXT>
   Here are texts of letters between
Ayatollah Ali Montazeri and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, indicating
that Montazeri is being ousted as Khomeini's successor. They were
translated from Tehran Radio reports monitored by The Associated
Press.
   Montazeri's letter to Khomeini:
   I received your letter dated March 26.
   I thank you for your kindness and guidance, and assure you that
just as I have been like an obedient soldier always with you in the
way of Islam and the revolution, now too I see myself compelled to
obey your orders, because the survival and stability of the Islamic
Republic rests on obeying your orders.
   It is not doubtful for anyone that this great Islamic revolution
has passed through many dangers through your leadership and
guidance, and has thwarted many enemies such as the heartless
monafeqin (hypocrites, referring to Iranian rebels), whose hands
are red with the blood of thousands of our people, and our great
personalities, including my own son, and many other opposing
fronts, and anti-revolutionaries and misled liberals.
   Can anyone forget the horrific crimes and the inhumane blows of
these heartless lot to the revolution and the nation?
   And if their mouthpieces and alien radios think that by
spreading rumors about me they can reach their vile goals, and
cause rifts in the unity of our nation, they are greatly mistaken.
   And about my designation as your successor.
   I myself was seriously opposed to it, and with attention to the
many difficulties, and the heaviness of the burden of
responsibility, wrote to the Council of Experts at the time that my
designation was not correct, and now I openly declare my lack of
readiness, and ask you to order the Council of Experts to keep in
mind the good of the future of Islam, the revolution and the
nation, and allow me just like before, to remain a small teacher in
the Islamic schools under your guidance.
   And if there have been mistakes, which are the nature of
mankind, God willing, they will be rectified by your guidance.
   And I would like to ask my dear brothers and sisters not to do
anything about the the great leader's decision anb the Council of
Experts, using their support for me as an excuse.
   Because the leader and the Council want nothing but the good of
the nation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Khomeini's letter accepting Montazeri's resignation:
   As you have written, the leadership of the Islamic Republic is a
difficult task; it is a very grave responsibility which requires
endurance more than your capacity.
   For that reason both you and I were both, from the beginning,
against your appointment. In this regard both thought in the same
way.
   But the experts (Council of Experts) had arrived at that
conclusion and I did not want to interfere in their legal
jurisdiction.
   Having accepted your resignation, I sincerely thank you for
declaring your lack of readiness for the position of deputy
leadership. Everybody knows that you are the result of my life (as
a student) and that I have strong attachment to you.
   In order that former mistakes are not repeated, I advise you to
cleanse your household from unsuitable individuals, and seriously
prevent the comings and goings of the opponents of the system who
pretend to be in favor of Islam and the Islamic Republic.
   I also gave you the same advice in the case of Mehdi Hashemi.
   I see your interests and that of the revolution in the fact that
you must be a theologian whose views could be utilized by the
regime and the people.
   Do not be affected by the spread of lies from foreign radio
stations. Our people know you well. They have also learned well of
tricks by the enemy who show their enmity to islam by making
(false) attributions to Iranian authorities.
   The dear scholars, and the leaders of the Friday prayers, as
well as the media, should clafify this simple matter for the
people, that in Islam the good of the regime takes precedence over
everything else. And we must all obey this.

   A man who claims he lost his job as a Dallas
high school football coach because he is white should collect
damages from the school district, his attorney told the Supreme
Court on Tuesday.
   But the Dallas Independent School District's attorney countered
in oral arguments that Norman Jett, former South Oak Cliff High
School coach and athletic director, has no right to seek damages
from a government entity.
   Jett, who said he is now in the building and construction
business, has settled with the principal who transferred him to
another school, Frederick Todd, who is black, for $75,000.
   A federal jury had awarded Jett $850,000 in damages, but he said
it was reduced to more than $600,000, with 10 percent interest for
five years, by a federal trial judge.
   Jett had coached the South Oak Cliff football team since 1962.
In the spring of 1983, he was transferred to another high school.
   Jett had been named head coach and athletic director at South
Oak Cliff in 1970, the year the racial composition at the school
changed from chiefly white to chiefly black. Todd became the
school's principal in 1975.
   Jett claims the school superintendent had the final say on his
transfer and thus the school district should be held liable for
damages for violating his civil rights because he says he was a
victim of racial discrimination.
   His attorney, Frank M. Gilstrap of Arlington, Texas, said that
even though the school district has an anti-discrimination policy,
it can still be held liable for actions of an employee who violates
that policy.
   School district attorney Leonard J. Schwartz of Dallas said a
person's civil rights are not violated when people cannot seek
damages from a municipality or school district, because they can
still collect from the individual responsible.
   The Supreme Court is studying a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling that ordered a new trial for Jett's lawsuit.
   His suit alleged that school officials violated his due-process,
free-speech and equal-protection rights.
   A jury found that the city school district should be held
legally liable for what it found to be violations of Jett's rights,
but the appeals court ruled that the jury ``did not make sufficient
findings to support municipal liability.'' The appeals court
ordered a new trial for that reason.
   The cases are Jett vs. Dallas Independent School District,
87-2084, and Dallas Independent School District vs. Jett, 88-214.

   A team of U.S. military officials is returning
to Hawaii on Wednesday after excavating in Laos remains thought to
be American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the Pentagon
said Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said it was
impossible at this point to say how many sets of remains had been
found. Attempts will now be made to identify the remains at the
Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, he said.
   The excavation lasted eight days and was conducted at the site
where an Army CH-34 helicopter crashed in November 1968, Howard
continued. Seven crewmen were lost when the helicopter disappeared,
he said.
   ``The Joint U.S.-Lao excavation in Savannakhet Province
concluded March 26,'' Howard said.
   ``Human remains found at the site, which may be associated with
Americans missing in Laos, will be analyzed'' at the Army
laboratory, he added.
   ``The team also surveyed four other potential aircraft crash
sites in southern Laos to aid in determining possible future
excavation sites.''
   According to the Pentagon, 545 of the 2,371 Americans still
missing from the Vietnam War are listed as missing in Laos.

   Syrian gunners and Christian army units
dueled with artillery and rockets Tuesday after the army command
said its troops thwarted an overnight tank offensive against its
strategic positions.
   Flares lighted the sky of the divided capital Tuesday night as
rocket volleys criss-crossed overhead on the sixth straight night
of bombardment.
   Police also said the fighting from midnight Monday to nightfall
Tuesday left three civilians killed and 22 wounded. That raised the
overall toll to 117 dead and 372 wounded since the three-week
confrontation broke out March 8.
   The Arab League's Council of Ministers called for an immediate
end to the fighting and urged support of the league's peace
efforts. The Israeli government pledged not to interfere with the
fighting.
   Artillery hit an auxiliary power plant feeding the city with
four hours of electricity a day after the main power station was
destroyed two days ago.
   ``Beirut is now plunged in total darkness indefinitely. There
will be no electricity until security conditions permit the repair
of the two plants,'' a police statement said.
   A spokesman for Gen. Michel Aoun's command said 15 Syrian troops
were killed in the abortive attack on his Christian army units
entrenched in the strategic hilltop resort of Souk el-Gharb, 10
miles southeast of Beirut.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Syrians also lost two Soviet-designed T-54 tanks and a
truck-mounted battery of multi-barreled rocket launchers.
   The Syrian army command in Moslem west Beirut withheld comment
on the report and a Lebanese police spokesman said the department
was ``traditionally not informed on the Syrian army's activities.''
   Beirut looked more like a ghost city Tuesday, with rubble
littering deserted streets.
   ``A shell pierced the roof and slammed into our neighbors'
vacant apartment. It demolished a room and the balcony that fell on
us in the ground floor,'' said Geraier Kafranbashian, a grocer in
west Beirut's Zokak Blatt district.
   ``By sheer luck we are still alive. My wife, I and two children
can't hear you properly, the noise of the deafening blast is still
in our ears,'' Kafranbashian said.
   The American University of Beirut and the U.S.-affiliated Beirut
University College, both based in the city's western sector, said
they were suspending classes until further notice.
   The current confrontation broke out March 8, shortly after Aoun
ordered a blockade of militia-run ports. The ports were draining an
estimated $100 million a year from five government harbors along
Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast.
   The latest rift between Moslems and Christians started Sept. 22,
when the six-year term of President Amin Gemayel expired with
parliament failing to elect a successor.
   Minutes before leaving the presidential palace, Gemayel named
Aoun head of an interm military Cabinet to rule pending the
election of a new head of state.
   Syrian-backed Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment because it
violated a 45-year-old unwritten national covenant that gives the
premiership to the Sunni Moslems, the house speaker's post to the
Shiite Moslems and the presidency to the Maronites. Salim Hoss
heads the rival Moslem Cabinet.
   An Arab League mediation committee called for a cease-fire in
the confrontation. The league's Council of Ministers, after the
first session of their spring meeting, called for a halt ``without
delay to the fighting in Lebanon.''
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday that Israel
won't interfere as Syria does not move either its troops or
weaponry too close to Israel's border.

<TEXT>
   More than half a million 1984 Oldsmobiles and
Buicks were recalled Tuesday because of a pollution control switch
that has brought at least 3.5 million General Motors Corp. cars and
trucks back for repairs.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, in requesting the recall,
said the thermal vacuum switch failed to open and close at the
proper times, allowing gasoline vapor to escape into the atmosphere.
   The vapor, combined with other pollutants and heated by the sun,
forms smog, the EPA said.
   GM recalled the 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Delta 88,
Ninety-Eight, Toronado and Custom Cruiser; and the 1984 Buick
LeSabre, Estate Wagon, Electra and Riviera. The cars are all
equipped with the five-liter engine.
   The company estimated the number of cars involved at 672,117
vehicles, about 37,000 more than the EPA estimated.
   The recall brought to 3.5 million the number of 1982-1985 GM
vehicles that the EPA, as a result ofthe problem, has ordered the
automaker to fix for free.
   ``The replacement is going to be a switch of a better design,
for it is a design problem with General Motors,'' said Martha
Casey, EPA spokeswoman.
   GM said it had voluntarily complied with the EPA's finding that
the recall was needed. ``The folks in Detroit were anxious to
stress we were doing it on our own,'' said Grey Terry, a GM
spokesman in Washington.
   He said the malfunctioning switch doesn't affect the operation
of the vehicles.
   Although EPA issued no formal recall order, under the agency's
program, failure of a maker to recall the cars would result in an
order, Casey said.
   The EPA said the gas vapors escaped not only from the exhaust
but also from the carburetors, gas tanks, fuel lines and other
parts of the vehicles.
   The thermal vacuum switch, when working properly, funnels
unburned gasoline fumes into a cannister, from which they are
rerouted to the engine and burned before entering the atmosphere,
Casey said.
   GM began notifying owners by mail that they may bring their cars
in to a dealership for repair without charge. The automaker said
the work would take about an hour.
   The EPA estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of the cars
manufactured each year are recalled to fix emissions problems. The
agency ordered more than 3 million vehicles recalled last year, the
third largest number in the program's history.
   ``This trend is expected to continue as the vehicle population
grows,'' said Richard Wilson, director of the EPA's office of
mobile sources. ``We will continue to work with vehicle
manufacturers toward solving these emissions problems.''

<HEAD>U.S. Accuses Noriega of Fostering Harassment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Tuesday accused
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega of fostering harassment
against U.S. military personnel and workers at the Panama Canal.
   ``There's clearly a deliberate effort by the Noriega regime to
harrass U.S. and Panamanian citizen employees of the U.S.
government,'' said department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The statement comes as William R. Gianelli, chairman of the
Panama Canal Commission, has expressed fears the campaign of
harassment could jeopardize continued use of the waterway.
   His office has issued a statement urging countries that send
ships through the canal to pressure Noriega to end the harassment.
   Over the past several months, members of Noriega's Panamanian
Defense Forces have accosted canal workers and U.S. military
personnel stationed in Panama. The incidents have increased as
U.S.-Panamanian relations have worsened.
   Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug trafficking
charges and the United States has refused to recognize the
authority of Noriega's ally, President Manuel Solis Palma.
   As the United States continued pressing its campaign to force
Noriega to step down, the Panamanian government began to take steps
against the canal workers, such as denying them license plates for
their cars.
   In one incident earlier this month, several buses containing
children attending the U.S. military-run schools were detained for
nine hours because they allegedly did not have the proper license
plates.
   The Panamanian government now states that in order to obtain
license plates, the driver must prove he or she has paid local
taxes. But Washington has barred tax payments to Panama as part of
its program of economic sanctions against the Noriega regime.
   Asked about reports of continued acts of intimidation directed
against the U.S. military protecting the canal and the Americans
and Panamanians who work there, Ms. Tutwiler said the United States
intends to fulfill its role under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties.
   Under the pacts, the United States has the primary
responsibility for the canal's operation and its defense until Dec.
31, 1999, after which Panama assumes responsibility and sovereignty
over the waterway.
   ``We respect our treaty commitments and intend to meet our
obligations to ensure the canal's safe, efficient, uninterrupted
operation,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Asked whether the United States intends to increase its security
in the area if harassment continues, Ms. Tutwiler replied only that
``we will continue to meet our treaty responsibilities.''
   The United States has about 10,000 military personnel in Panama
to defend the Panama Canal. Most of the about 8,000 employees
working at the canal are Panamanian.

<HEAD>10 Years After TMI, Nuclear Plants Still Unsafe, Group Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear power plants are ``a danger to the
public's health and safety,'' an advocacy group charged Tuesday,
releasing a report that showed more than 33,000 nuclear plant
incidents have occurred in the 10 years since the Three Mile Island
accident.
   The study, ``Nuclear Power Safety: 1979-1989,'' charts an
increase at the beginning of the decade followed by a leveling off
in the number of reported events at nuclear plants.
   The incidents include failures or breakdowns of plant systems
and procedures which may pose a threat to public safety. The
operating utility must report these incidents to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission by filing a ``Licensee Event Report,'' or LER.
   The report was released a decade after the March 28, 1978
accident at Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant in
Pennsylvania where the nation's worst commercial atomic plant
accident occurred.
   Since the Three Mile Island accident, no utilities have begin
construction of nuclear plants. There are now 108 operating nuclear
plants in the nation.
   ``Although some of these mishaps may seem relatively innocuous,
it should be remembered that when combined in sequence, these
seemingly small incidents can result in a major nuclear accident _
as was the case at TMI,'' said the report, prepared by Public
Citizen, an organization founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader.
   The NRC has a system for grading the severity of LERs, but
Public Citizen did not take this into account, presenting only
total numbers of LERs.
   ``A decade after the accident at Three Mile Island, the NRC and
the nuclear industry have forgotten the lesson of TMI,'' said Joan
Claybrook, Public Citizen's president. ``The plants pose a
continuing danger to the public's health and safety.''
   But NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchard said the plants are safer than
a decade ago, and noted that ``Public Citizen gets its numbers from
us and, of course, analyzes them in its own way.''
   ``There have been fewer challenges to the system, fewer
automatic shutdowns, the amount of waste generated at these plants
has gone down, they're cleaner, and the amount of cumulative
radiation exposure to employees has gone down,'' Fouchard said.
``All of the safety indicators are going in a positive direction.''
   In 1979, there were 2,310 reported mishaps at the nation's 67
nuclear reactors, including the partial meltdown of TMI 2 in
Middletown, Pa. The number increased to 3,804 in 1980, to 4,060 in
1981, and to 4,500 in 1982. By 1983, the number of reported
incidents exceeded 5,000 at 82 operating plants, the group found.
   In 1984, however, the NRC changed its system for reporting such
events, and the total number of LERs dropped to 2,460 that year,
according to Public Citizen.
   The following year, 1985, there were 3,050 LERs and the NRC said
the period was one of the worst years in the history of the nuclear
power industry, marked by 645 emergency plant shutdowns and 38
fines totaling nearly $4 million levied against utilities.
   Since then, the number of nuclear plant mishaps has apparently
leveled off, although ``even the NRC's data is incomplete and thus
these figures probably do not reflect the entire sum of reportable
mishaps each year,'' the report said.
   For example, in 1984, the first year that the new reporting
requirements were in effect, the NRC estimated that between 12
percent and 35 percent of reportable mishaps were not reported, the
study said.
   ``If the NRC's assessment is correct, the LER count per reactor
simply reflects the mishaps which the industry chooses to report,
while the actual number of potentially significant safety events
may be much higher,'' Public Citizen said.
   The number of LERs has remained relatively constant since 1985:
2,960 in 1986 and 2,955 in 1987. Incomplete data for 1988 reveled
2,296 mishaps at the nation's 108 licensed-to-operate reactors.
   Total mishaps for the 10 years: 33,475.
   The report is a compilation of findings from Public Citizen's
annual nuclear power safety reports and preliminary data being
gathered for the group's forthcoming 1988 report. The data were
obtained under Freedom of Information act requests and from other
NRC sources.

<HEAD>Bush Fields Questions on Surprise Trip to High School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush paid a surprise visit to a
suburban high school Tuesday and fielded questions on subjects
ranging from drugs to the Middle East, telling students: ``You
learn something from every step outside the White House you take.''
   Bush also ate lunch in the school cafeteria where, surrounded by
several hundred chattering teenagers, he munched on pizza and
french fries and sipped milk through a straw.
   In the excurison, which was unannounced and for which the
school's principal had only 90 minutes' warning, the president
travelled by motorcade to James Madison High School in this
Virginia suburb, about 15 miles from the White House.
   The president, who during the campaign vowed to be ``the
education president,'' first chatted with students in the school's
computer center, then perched on a stool in the library and
answered questions for 30 minutes.
   ``Anybody got any questions about my line of work?'' Bush asked.
   One student asked about the new White House puppies. ``They're
doing fine,'' Bush said. Another student asked Bush how a president
``has time to visit a high school.''
   ``A very good question,'' Bush said. ``I think you learn
something from every step outside the White House that you take.
... It's symbolic, in some sense. But you also pick up information
as you go along. You have to balance that with your overall
responsibilities.''
   The trip comes in advance of Bush's submission to Congress of an
education package, expected to include a variety of proposals
highlighted in Bush's budget speech to Congress last month,
including the first installment in a $500 million national merit
schools initiative, an effort to reward the nation's best teachers,
a $100 million expansion of a magnet schools program and an
expansion of Head Start.
   Bush aide Stephen Hart said that the legislation would be
submitted to Congress sometime ``within the next few weeks,'' but
that now specific date had yet been spent.
   Bush talked with the students about ``this stupid abuse of
drugs,'' and said ``we've got to mobilize the entertainment media''
to combat drugs, suggesting that movies have tended to trivilize
drug use in recent years.
   He said movies of late have tended portrayed cocaine use ``in a
humerous vein, or made the user look like a silly idiot. ...''
   ``W've got to change the way this problem has been looked at,''
Bush said.
   Answering a question about international terrorism, Bush said,
``It's like dealing with fog _ you can't get hold of it very well.''
   On a foreign policy question, Bush said that the long-sought
peace in the Middle East ``has escaped us all, escaped the world.
... You still see a lot of killing. And so, we have a particularly
important role there; we are the only country that can be a
substantial catalyst for peace there.''
   He said he hoped some progress toward the peace process could
come from his meetings next week with the leaders of Israel, Egypt
and Jordan.
   Asked a question on drugs and guns, the president cited the
review going on in his administration on semiautomatic assault
weapons. ``There's a lot of laws on the books that need to be
enforced and maybe there's a need for more laws.
   ``You have to balance out all those interests.''
   Sami Van Vliet, a 16-year-old junior, told Bush her church group
had inflated balloons for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll
the day before but were prevented from taking extra balloons home
with them because they were ``government property.''
   She complained that the group had wanted ``to take some of the
balloons to Ghana for our mission trip that we're going on.''
   ``I was just wondering what you do with 10,000 balloons that
say, `A Family Easter at the White House, 1989?'' she asked.
   ``If only I had known about it, you'd have been able to carry
more than that one with you,'' Bush said.
   Another student invited Bush to speak at the school's graduation
on June 15, asking him, ``How busy is your schedule?''
   ``I don't know how busy it is. I don't even dare look till
tomorrow. But thanks for the invite,'' he said.
   A spokesman for Fairfax County schools, Dolores Bowen, said the
Education Department had asked for information on seven or eight
schools Monday afternoon.
   At 7:30 a.m. today, a White House advance team showed up to meet
with principal Edward Ryan, who thought the officials were there to
set up a visit, possibly by first lady Barbara Bush, sometime in
the future.
   About 9:30 a.m., roughly 90 minutes before Bush arrived, Ryan
learned his visitor would be the president and he would be there
before the morning was out.

<HEAD>Still No Approach for Compensating Families of 290 Aboard Iranian
Airliner</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iraq-Compensation, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has been unable to come up
with an approach for compensating families of the 290 people who
died when the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner over the
Persian Gulf last year, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   ``Nothing much has happened,'' said the official who has
knowledge about the situation and spoke on condition of not being
identified.
   Then-President Reagan had said families of the victims of last
July's tragedy would be compensated but that no other reparations
would be made. The administration said compenation must go to the
families and not to the government of Iran.
   The official said the government viewed the compensation as
``simply an expression of grief for the loss of life,'' and that no
liability has been assumed for the incident.
   The official said the United States has received a passenger
list from the Iranians, but specifics such as age and other
information about the individuals have not been obtained.
   Such information is needed to help determine the compensation,
he said.
   ``We've tried a number of channels to obtain information,'' but
nothing has been accomplished over the past several months, the
official said.
   The United States broke formal diplomatic relations with Iran
after the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

   As part of a Justice Department
reorganization, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is creating a new
Office of Policy Development and abolishing the Office of Legal
Policy, and on Tuesday he appointed the current legislative affairs
chief to lead the new office.
   Thomas M. Boyd, 42, who has been assistant attorney general in
charge of the Office of Legislative Affairs for the past year, said
Monday in an interview that as the new office's director, he will
be ``working with the attorney general in his capacity as chairman
of the Domestic Policy Council'' and ``developing policy for the
department to implement.''
   The office will replace the current Office of Legal Policy, said
Thornburgh aide David Runkel, who said he did not know if the 29
people in that office, including a dozen attorneys, will be laid
off or transferred to the new office.
   Boyd is a rare Justice Department holdover from the Reagan
administration.
   Runkel said Edward S.G. Dennis, the assistant attorney general
in charge of the Criminal Division, is expected to remain in that
post, saying, ``There are no current plans for any changes in the
Criminal Division.''
   Elsewhere in the department, Runkel said New York lawyer Robert
B. Fiske, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, is a ``leading
candidate'' to become deputy attorney general, the Justice
Department's second-ranking position.
   Thornburgh earlier had taken away the Legal Policy Office's
mandate to conduct screening of judicial candidates, and the new
Policy Development Office will not be involved in that effort
either, Runkel said.

<HEAD>Wyden Calls For Trade Sanctions Against Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oregon lawmaker Tuesday urged the Bush
administration to impose trade sanctions against Japan in an effort
to force the Japanese to lift trade barriers that block imports of
U.S. wood products that could be worth $1.2 billion a year.
   ``These are strong actions to contemplate,'' Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
``But we believe the record of Japanese restrictions with respect
to wood products may be among the most onerous in the Pacific Rim.
   Wyden asked Hills to investigate allegations from the National
Forest Products Association that the Japanese use duties, licensing
constraints, exclusive distribution arrangements and building code
restrictions to block imports of U.S. wood products into their
markets.
   Under federal law, Wyden said once the investigation is
complete, Hills would recommend specific ``remedies'' to the
president.
   Wyden told Hills that recent amendments to the 1974 Trade Act
``would then require the president to take agressive action against
these foreign trade barriers, up to and including counter-measurers
affecting Japanese imports to the United States, if a satisfactory
resolution cannot be negotiated.''
   Japan recently refused to reopen so-called ``sector-specific''
talks on forestry products, talks Wyden said ``offered what
appeared to be the surest and swiftest solution to these trade
problems.
   The National Forest Productions Association said that Japanese
barriers affect such U.S. products as softwood and hardwood logs
and lumber, plywood, veneer, millwork, laminated wood products,
waferboard and particleboard.
   The association said that while $2.2 billion worth of U.S. wood
products were sold in Japan last year, over 70 percent involved raw
materials.

   Prosecutors arrested a second former high
government official Tuesday in a bribery scandal that is generating
pressure on Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to resign.
   Tuesday's arrest of Kunio Takaishi, former vice minister of
education, coincided with formal charges being filed against
Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor who was arrested on
March 8.
   The two are the highest-ranking public officials to be arrested
in the case. Both were accused of receiving bribes in the form of
bargain-priced shares for using their influence to benefit Recruit
Co., an information conglomerate. Both left office before the
scandal surfaced last July.
   Takaishi's arrest was the 13th in the scandal, which has shaken
confidence in Takeshita's administration. Recent public opinion
polls put support for Takeshita's government at less than 13
percent.
   Takaishi, 59, is charged with having helped Recruit executives
get appointed to government committees dealing with education.
   Kato, also 59, was accused of influencing a ministry decision
not to impose stricter regulations on employment information
magazines in 1984. He retired as a vice minister in September 1987.
   Recruit's main business is publishing specialized magazines on
job placement, giving it a strong interest in education and labor
policy.
   Opposition parties are demanding that Takeshita resign and call
new elections to let the people be the judge in the Recruit scandal.
   On Tuesday, Junya Yano, head of Komeito (Clean Governmentosition parties
to join forces in demanding that
Takeshita quit, Kyodo News Service reported.
   It said leadf the four major opposition parties will meet
April 7 to demand that Takeshita resign and to discuss formation of
a coalition overnment.
   Takeshita has vowed to stay on and work for political reforms
that would restore public trust in government.
t a meeting of Komeito leaders, Yano repeated demands that
Yasuhiro Nakasone _ prime minister at the time of the stock
transactions _ testify in Parliament on whether he used his
authority to help Recruit. The government  far has refused.
   At least 17 senior politicians, including Takeshita and
Nakasone, have bne has been
arrested.
   In all, about 700,000 bargain shares in Recruit's real estate
subsiecruit-Cosmos Co., reportedly were offered by the
founder and former chairman of Recruit, Ezoe masa, and his
aides to more than 150 influential people.
   Prosecutors say Ti was sold 10,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos at a cut-rate price in 1986 and profited by about
$90,000 when overrading in the stock began and its
price soared.one acknowledged that three of his aides bought a total of
29,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares and made more than $454,500 in profits.
   Kato bought 3,000 unlisted shares and reportedly made about
$45,450 when the stock was publicly listed, prosecutors said.
   On Tuesday, prosecutors added bribery of Kato to charges already
filed against Ezoe and two aides, Masao Tatsumi and Toshihiro Ono.
They arrested Ezoe again and another aide, Hiroshi Kobayashi, in
connection with the Takaishi case.
   Prosecutors on Monday filed formal charges accusing Hisashi
Shinto, former chairman of the telecommunications giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., of receiving bribes from Recruit to
help its advance into the communications field. They said Shinto
was sold 10,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares and reaped about $168,000 in
profits.

   The 10th anniversary of New Music America, a
69-event contemporary music festival, will be hosted this year by
the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy, made the
announcement Tuesday at the Kitchen in Manhattan. The festival,
which has been held in a different city each year, started at the
Kitchen and featured Laurie Anderson, Steve Reich and Philip Glass.
   Lichtenstein said that New Music America will be held Nov. 10-18
and will be a major component of the Brooklyn Academy's seventh
annual Next Wave Festival. He said the festival ``reflects BAM's
interest in exploring new directions in the performing arts.''
   New Music America will present 104 ensembles and composers
working in extended forms of rock, jazz, classical and electronic
music. Performances are scheduled in 23 locations. For the first
time, a Recording Industry Council will help support the festival.
   A group of radio stations will record the festival and make the
concerts available the next day, via satellite, to more than 300
U.S. radio stations. On the final night, radio stations in four
cities will record different concerts in each of the Brooklyn
Academy's four theaters.
   Lichtenstein said that Philip Morris Companies Inc. has renewed
its grant of $350,000 as sponsor of the Next Wave Festival for the
fourth year. Benson and Hedges will support New Music America.

   Residents gathered at the VFW hall to

   About 200 people attended Monday night's ``minus 239th birthday
party'' of James T. Kirk, the captain of the Starship Enterprise
played by William Shatner in the movies and popular television
series Star Trek.
   Gene Roddenberry, creator and executive producer of the series,
wrote in ``The Making of Star Trek'' that Kirk was ``born in a
small town in the state of Iowa.'' The Riverside City Council
picked up on the idea in March 1985, declaring a site behind what
used to be the town's barbershop the ``future birthplace'' of Kirk.
   Roddenberry sent along a certificate of commendation.
   ``Whereas Capt. Kirk's future birthday is March 26, 2228, the
Mayor of the City of Riverside has proclaimed that March 26 will be
set aside to honor and celebrate the future Capt. James T. Kirk's

   And now, for the pet owner with everything _
cosmetic surgery for dogs.
   ``There are medical reasons and reasons like they just don't
look pretty. People don't want to be apologetic for their pets'
looks,'' said Dr. Bill Sanders, who performs pet makeovers in his
Aardvark Etc. Veterinary Hospital.
   ``It's amazing what you can do with animal skin that you can't
do with a person's,'' he said.
   Sanders says he most often removes unsightly scars from dogs,
cats and other domestic animals. But he also repairs broken jaws
and crooked legs, and removes unwanted patches of white hair.
   Although it sounds like a luxury reserved for the rich and
famous, Sanders said he discusses pet owners' requests at length to
ensure they are best for the animal.
   ``Sometimes, the animal doesn't need cosmetic surgery,'' Sanders
told a newspaper columnist recently. ``It's wonderful that so much
can be done with just good grooming.''
   Sanders disputes that cosmetic surgery is frivolous or cruel.
   ``One of the big things on my side is to stop pet abuse,''
Sanders said. With the surgery, people often, ``take an attitude
that the pet is more than just something you kick around.''

   An official human rights committee
wrote a letter to the prime minister criticizing new legislation on
human rights and proposing changes, the state news agency reported
Tuesday.
   In the letter, the government-appointed committee suggested
legislators distinguish more clearly between civic rights and
responsibilities in March legislation that stiffens penalties for
protestors, the CTK agency said.
   The official Human Rights Committee was established on Dec. 9 in
an apparent move to offset rising protest.
   So far, the committee has focused on helping citizens obtain
exit permits and other cases of minor human rights abuse.
   Some Czechoslovaks have accused the committee of failing to
speak against police brutality during a week of anti-government
protests in January that spurred the new legislation.
   The protests focused on the anniversary of the Jan. 15, 1969,
suicide of Jan Palach, who burned himself alive to protest the
August 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring''
liberal reforms.

<TEXT>
   The Three Mile Island accident which he faced
as Pennsylvania governor 10 years ago taught Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh not to rely on bureaucratic channels or on the news
media, he said Tuesday.
   Thornburgh had been Pennsylvania's chief executive 72 days when
a combination of human and mechanical error triggered the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident at the Susquehanna River plant on
March 28, 1979.
   Widely credited for his calm handling of the accident,
Thornburgh has often spoken in the past about the lessons he
learned during the five days following a stuck valve that allowed
vital cooling water to drain from the Unit 2 reactor's radioactive
core.
   The speech Thornburgh gave Tuesday at the National Press Club
was virtually identical to an address he presented at Duke
University in April 1985 called, ``Three Mile Island: Ten Lessons
In Emergency Management.''
   In the speeches, Thornburgh said he learned a manager ``should
not be afraid to scramble the organization chart, as we did during
Three Mile Island.''
   He compared his handling of the accident to President Kennedy
during the Curban missile crisis, ``when his own brother's advice
weighed more heavily with him than that of the secretary of state
or the Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   Thornburgh also said managers in emergencies should ``respect,
but do not depend on, the news media.'' While much of the reporting
of the accident was reliable, he said some was ``downright
outrageous.''
   No one was hurt during the accident, although radioactive gas
was released into the atmosphere and pregnant women and
preschoolers were advised by Thornburgh to evacuate within five
miles of the plant.
   Thornburgh added a postscript to Tuesday's speech, saying the
1986 accident at Chernobyl that killed at least 31 people ``might
have been prevented if the people of the Soviet Union were as free
to question their authorities'' as were Americans in 1979.
   After TMI, Thornburgh served a second term as governor beginning
in 1982, then headed the Institute of Politics at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government before becoming attorney
general last August.

   Police in a black homeland
have been arresting and beating residents of a rural community who
unsuccessfully sought to keep the area part of South Africa, civil
rights workers said Tuesday.
   Chief Pupsey Sebogodi, leader of the Braklaagte community, said
more than 100 residents have been arrested in recent days by police
of the Bophuthatswana homeland, according to field workers of the
Transvaal Rural Action Committee.
   Aninka Claasens, one of the workers of the Johannesburg-based
civil rights group, said the arrests began after high school
students returning to Braklaagte in a bus were stopped at a
roadblock last week and asked by Bophuthatswana police if they
considered themselves citizens of South Africa or the nominally
independent homeland.
   Those who declared they were South Africans allegedly were
clubbed with rifle butts.
   Ms. Claasens said Sebogodi was arrested Friday after he
complained about the incident to officers at a new police base set
up in Braklaagte.
   She said lawyers had been unable to locate Sebogodi since his
detention and had been barred from visiting many other Braklaagte
residents held by police.
   Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope issued a statement
Tuesday saying Sebogodi and 40 other people were arrested on
charges of arson, damage to property and public violence after four
homes in Braklaagte were set afire last week.
   The police action was ``a routine maintenance of law and
order,'' Mangope said. ``No persecution of South African citizens
took place nor were any children assaulted.''
   The South African Foreign Affairs Department, which handles
relations with the four black homelands established by South
Africa's white-dominated government, said it had asked
Bophuthatswana about the allegations and was awaiting a replay.
   Sebogodi, on behalf of Braklaagte's 9,000 residents, went to
court last year to try to nullify the South African government's
declaration that Braklaagte would be placed under the jurisdiction
of Bophuthatswana. He said his people faced hardship and
discrimination if the community was incorporated into the homeland.
   On March 13 a judge dismissed Sebogodi's petition, upholding the
government's claim that it had authority to allocate land to tribal
homelands regardless of the residents' wishes.
   Sebogodi's constituents, who live in a farming area about 100
miles west of Pretoria, had voiced opposition to the Bophuthatswana
government and sought to retain South African citizenship, which
could give them advantages in seeking employment.
   The incorporation is part of South Africa's policy of locating
black ethnic groups in self-governing homelands to limit the size
of the black population in the rest of South Africa.
   The homelands are not recognized internationally.
   Bophuthatswana includes seven separate pieces of territory
covering about 18,000 square miles and has a population estimated
at 1.7 million.

<HEAD>Kim Basinger Buys Georgia Town For $20 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASELTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Kim Basinger has bought this town
for $20 million from a family that has owned most of it for more
than a century.
   For her money, she got about 1,800 acres, the town's water and
sewer system, an industrial park bordering Interstate 85, a bank, a
shopping center with 70,000 square feet of retail and storage
space, several small businesses and about 50 homes and other
buildings.
   The papers for the sale were signed Monday night, eight years
after members of the family put their holdings up for sale, said
Herbert B. Braselton, whose grandfather, William Harrison
Braselton, settled the community in 1876.
   Herbert Braselton, 69, said Tuesday from his hardware store that
the sale will close during the summer.
   ``It's very sad. We shed some tears today,'' he said. ``But
we're glad to get somebody we trust that will do this place proud.''
   Ms. Basinger, whose movies include, ``Blind Date,'' ``9{ Weeks''
and ``The Natural,'' grew up in nearby Athens.
   Braselton said he doesn't know exactly what her plans are for
the town, though he has heard she might renovate some of the older
buildings and establish some sort of tourist attraction.
   Braselton said 24 members of his family own stock in the family
holdings, including the 1,800 acres, which is 80 percent of the
northeast Georgia town. Most of the family members are elderly, and
none of the younger Braseltons was interested in holding onto the
land, he said.
   ``We've gotten to the age where we had to let someone else take
over ... while we have our senses and can make good judgments,'' he
said.
   Braselton said he doesn't know how much money he will make on
the deal. ``What I receive will be ample,'' he said, adding that he
is keeping his own residential property.
   He said it was a relief to finally sell the land, and he added
that the family rejected numerous offers.
   ``I have a box full of offers,'' Braselton said. ``The primary
difficulty was the terms. People wanted 40 years (to pay). To
people in their 70s and 80s, that doesn't interest them. We got a
cash deal.''
   Braselton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, has about 500
residents. The local government will not be affected by the sale,
Braselton said.
   Basinger's father, Athens businessman Don Basinger, said his
daughter would hold a news conference to discuss the deal later in
the week.
   Calls seeking comment from Ms. Basinger's Los Angeles public
relations firm, PMK, were not immediately returned.

<HEAD>Volunteer Doctors Help Homeless Fight Street Ills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The health hazards of living on the street: dirt,
skin disease and swollen feet, are treated three nights a week by
doctors who volunteer their services at a temporary shelter for the
homeless.
   The free service is among fewer than 100 around the country that
tap the good will of the medical profession. Advocates say they
wish there were more.
   Trying to help the homeless hang on to their health involves
coping with some ailments, such as lice and tuberculosis, that are
virtually unknown in affluent America, doctors say.
   ``They come with sore feet. They come with skin infections. They
come with skin breakdown,'' said Dr. Joseph Dorsey, one of the
volunteers from the Harvard Community Health Plan. ``Alcohol is a
very major factor in leading people to be here,'' he said. ``It's a
real leveler.''
   The state- and city-funded shelter at a vacant National Guard
armory is run by the non-profit private corporation Positive
Lifestyles. It takes in about 200 men a night, shift supervisor Sam
Larsen said Monday.
   ``We have everything from chronic alcoholics to working poor to
heavily drug-addicted guys,'' he said. ``I think the common theme
is that they were once able to afford housing and they can't any
longer.''
   About 50 medical personnel volunteer at the shelter, with
another 50 involved in other ways, Dorsey said. He said an intern
at Harvard Community Health Plan came up with the idea to volunteer
at the shelter and participants were sought through a sign-up list.
   Similar volunteered services are available elsewhere in such
diverse cities as Washington, D.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Duluth, Minn.;
Cleveland; San Francisco; and Seattle.
   Estelle Nichols runs the 14-year-old Free Clinic of Roanoke,
Va., and is treasurer of the National Association of Free and
Community Clinics. She estimated there are fewer than 100 such
clinics nationwide relying on free help from doctors.
   ``There are a good number out there, but there really are not
enough,'' Ms. Nichols said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
``There are not more now because cities have not organized them.
   ``If there is one thing I have found out, it's that (doctors)
are waiting out there for you to call them,'' Ms. Nichols said.
``They want an opportunity to do good work. That's the reason they
went into medicine. To do good work.''
   The Boston shelter, which opened Dec. 2 and is scheduled to
close this April, operates the clinic seven days a week, with the
volunteer doctors working three evenings, said Eileen McGee, head
nurse.
   By 7 p.m. Monday, a steady stream of patients filed into the
clinic to get their blood pressure tested, foot sores washed and
dressed and, mainly, to talk to the doctors about their aches and
pains.
   Clinic patients say the free medical services make it easier to
stay healthy.
   ``If you have to go to a doctor outside, you have to pay,'' said
Dominic, 52, who asked that his last name not be used.
   Dominic, who has had surgery for throat cancer, said he has
received medical care from Veterans Administration hospitals and
from a clinic run by nurses at the Pine Street Inn, a downtown
homeless shelter.
   But he said the services offered at the armory shelter are more
convenient for him and he's more likely to make follow-up visits.
   Ivan Forman, 72, said he worked as a contractor for much as his
life, serving in the Navy during World War II and working most
recently at odd jobs in a hospital and synagogue.
   Forman, who says alcoholism took him from studying psychology at
a university to life on the streets, complained of a headache
during his visit with the volunteer doctors and was given a mild
pain reliever.
   ``I think it's nice and I think the doctors get something out of
it,'' he said.
   Like Forman, many of the patients seen at the clinic have
relatively minor complaints, said McGee, who noted that any serious
cases are referred to a hospital.

<HEAD>NASA Rejects Recommendation That It Scrap Plans For New Rocket</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA officials rejected Tuesday a suggestion
by an independent safety panel that the agency cancel a $1.5
billion rocket development program and direct the money instead
toward improvements in the space shuttle.
   The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual report
released Tuesday that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration should abandon plans to build an advanced solid
rocket motor because the money could be better used to make
improvements in the orbiter stage of the space shuttle.
   But NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said development of the
advanced rocket had been thoroughly debated within the space agency
and ``I haven't changed my mind on that.''
   Fletcher said NASA wants to develop a second source manufacturer
for space shuttle solid rockets so the agency is never again left
without a reliable rocket engine as it was after the Challenger
accident.
   ``We don't want to be stuck with the situation we got stuck with
(before),'' said Fletcher. ``We need to have the option of changing
contractors.''
   The Challenger accident, in which seven astronauts were killed,
occurred when a solid rocket booster leaked hot gas and caused the
spacecraft to explode 73 seconds after launch from the Kennedy
Space Center, Fla. on Jan. 28, 1986. The accident forced a total
redesign and testing of the solid rocket manufactured by Morton
Thiokol Inc., and caused the space shuttle fleet to be grounded for
38 months. Thiokol remains NASA's only supplier of the solid rocket
booster.
   Fletcher said that because of this experience, the agency wants
to develop an improved, more powerful solid rocket that could be
manufactured by more than one contractor.
   ``We need the option to change contractors quickly,'' he said.
``You would like to have somebody to fall back on.''
   Joseph F. Sutter, a former Boeing vice president and chairman of
the safety advisory board, said that the panel of experts felt that
the redesign of the Morton Thiokol rocket had ``produced a booster
that is safe'' and that efforts to build another booster would mean
that it would have to be extensively tested to develop the same
level of safety.
   Sutter said that if building the new rocket takes funds away
from other shuttle improvements, ``we feel like it would be
degrading to safety.''
   The committee chairman also said he felt NASA was forced into
building the new booster by congress. Sutter suggested this was a
mistake and that congress ``should get the hell out of that.''
   Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight,
said that though the panel made ``good points,'' the space agency
decided to build the new rocket because the shuttle ``needs the
performance.''
   The new rocket planned by NASA would enable the shuttle to carry
an additional 12,000 pounds into orbit, he said.
   Also, said Truly, there is no assurance that the rest of the
shuttle ``would see those dollars'' if NASA decided to not build
the new rocket.
   Plans call for NASA to spend $1.5 billion through fiscal year
1994 to develop the new rocket motor. A number of rocket companies
besides Morton Thiokol are competing for the rocket contract.
   The aerospace safety advisory panel is made up of 14 independent
experts who monitor safety issues throughout NASA and make annual
recommendations.
   Other recommendations by the panel included:
   _ Modify the structure of the shuttle orbiter so that the
spacecraft is not as sensitive to adverse wind conditions during
launch. Upper level winds have caused delays in the last two space
shuttle launches.
   _ Modifications to increase reliability and safety of the
liquid-fueled rockets on the space shuttle.
   _ Make certain that the final plans for the Space Station
Freedom include a emergency rescue vehicle that would enable
astronauts on the station to quickly return to Earth.
   _ That a new space suit be developed for use on the space
station.

   Israel's police chief ordered his officers on
Tuesday to limit their practice of disguising themselves as
journalists, driving cars carrying press signs, while seaching for
Palestinian suspects.
   Police Inspector-General David Krauss said he will instruct all
police units to refrain from impersonating journalists unless they
had his personal permission.
   The decision came after an appeal from Jerusalem's Journalists
Association, which said the practice could endanger reporters
traveling in the occupied territories and Arab east Jerusalem to
cover the Palestinian uprising.
   Palestinian youths routinely stone cars with yellow Israeli
license plates, but are more likely to let journalists pass
peacefully. Arab-owned cars in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip have blue or white license plates.
   Israeli journalists and the Foreign Press Association in Israel
protested last week after two policemen in east Jerusalem were
spotted with a press sign in the window of their unmarked car and
were later seen arresting Palestinians.
   Krauss said Monday police were legally permitted to pose as
journalists and would continue to do so. However, he reversed
himself after meeting the journalists on Tuesday.
   The journalists argued that police officers' posing as reporters
threatened the security and professional freedom of journalists.

Affair</HEAD>

Edits to tighten.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
testified at Oliver North's trial Tuesday that the specter of
impeachment hung over the White House in the 72 hours after aides
discovered a planned diversion of Iran arms sale money to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   In two hours of testimony, Meese said he told then-President
Reagan about the diversion the day after North confirmed that the
plan, outlined in a memo, had become a fact.
   ``Your worst nightmare had come true?'' asked North lawyer
Brendan Sullivan.
   ``Yes, it was,'' Meese replied.
   ``You knew that spelled trouble?''
   ``Yes, I did.''
   The nightmares that Sullivan referred to was the revelation that
two activities in which North was deeply involved had been
intertwined: the administration's secret sale of weapons to Iran
and the fact that money from the arms sales _ with the knowledge of
U.S. officials _ secretly was going to the rebels fighting the
Nicaraguan government at a time such aid was forbidden by law.
   ``Merging of those two factors could cause toppling of the
president himself?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``Yes,'' Meese replied.
   The memo, which had survived massive shredding efforts by North,
his secretary and an aide, was found on Nov. 22, 1986 by Meese
aides William Bradford Reynolds in North's office. The next day, a
Sunday, Meese met with North and others at the Justice Department.
   Meese said that in the Sunday meeting, North appeared surprised
that Meese had obtained the memo which outlined the arms sales
profit diversion plan.
   ``I believe he asked where we had gotten the memo,'' said Meese.
   He testified also that North assured him then that the plan was
Israel's and U.S. involvement was ``none.'' And he said North told
him he had contacted Contra leader Adolfo Calero and suggested
Calero open three accounts in Switzerland to get the money from the
Israelis.
   In truth, North co-defendants Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
had arranged to receive the Iran money in private Swiss accounts
they established and controlled, investigators found.
   Meese said he talked to the president on Monday and they talked
of the impact the public disclosure might have.
   ``I don't know whether the actual word impeachment was used,''
Meese testified. But he said there was concern over ``the
tremendous consequences'' of the discovery.
   The former attorney general said the administration also was
concerned that its political opponents might get hold of the
information about the diversion before it could be made public.
   ``I felt it vital that there not be any appearance of a
coverup,'' he said. It was decided that decided that Reagan would
hold a news conference. At the Nov. 25 news conference, Reagan
announced that North had been fired, and that his boss, Adm. John
Poindexter, had resigned.
   Among the 12 criminal counts on which North is being tried in
federal court are destruction of documents, attempting to derail
Meese's investigation and making false statements to the attorney
general.
   A former North deputy told the jury earlier that the National
Security Council aide carried sensitive documents to a shredder
even as Meese's investigators were taking a lunch break from
searching his office.
   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl said North slipped through an
alleyway to a White House shredder that day. Among the papers Earl
said he had previously turned over to North were documents on the
secret arms initiative.
   Meese said that he learned about the diversion of funds to the
Nicaraguan rebels from the memo his men found. On page five, he
said he found the plan for taking profits from the weapons sales
and using them to buy supplies for the Contras. This was at a time
when U.S. intelligence agencies were forbidden by Congress to spend
money in military support of the rebels.
   North assured him, Meese said, that the plan for the diversion
was Israel's. Israel was a conduit for arms involved in the
transactions.
   ``He said Israel would decide how much money would go to the
resistance and our involvement, the CIA and the NSC, was none,''
Meese testified.
   Earl, who was a deputy to North in the NSC structure, said North
came from a meeting in the West Wing of the White House on Nov. 21
and asked Earl for his Iran files, which included records on the
secret arms initiative to Iran.
   ``I asked him what was going on,'' Earl testified. ``He said it
was time for Ollie to be a scapegoat.''
   North asked him to look for ``sensitive intelligence
documents,'' Earl said, and when he brought them out, North put
them on top of a stack of papers on his desk.
   He said he understood that North was going to ``sanitize'' the
papers.
   ``To destroy documents, that was your understanding?''
   ``Yes, sir,'' said Earl.
   Earl said he began to destroy documents, too, and when he left
the office, North was till there.
   The next day, a Saturday, Richardson and Reynolds searched the
office and discovered the diversion memo.
   The investigators crossed paths with North only as they walked
down the hall for lunch as North was arriving, Earl said,
exchanging only a few words.
   ``At that time you saw Lt. Col. North going around culling
additional papers to destroy?'' asked prosecutor David Zornow.
``Yes,'' Earl said.
   He said he saw North go outside through an alleyway and head for
a shredder in the White House situation room, where national
security crises are monitored.
   ``It was your understanding those papers would never be seen
again,'' asked Zornow.
   ``Yes, sir,'' said Earl.
   In a related development, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
federal criminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to dismiss
their indictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutors
cannot appeal before their trial. The decision likely means the
court will turn down an appeal by North, who is challenging a
judge's refusal to dismiss his indictment.
   North has alleged that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh acted
improperly in using North's testimony to congressional committees
to indict him. North testified before the congressional panels
under a grant of immunity from prosecution.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
considering a new U.S. approach to Eastern Europe with the overall
goal of promoting self-determination and freedom among the Soviet
allies.
   U.S. relations with the countries, whose fortunes have been tied
to Moscow for more than 40 years, are undergoing review along with
other aspects of American foreign policy, Margaret Tutwiler, the
State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has proposed the
new arrangement in which Moscow would loosen its hold on the region
in exchange for a pledge by the United States and its NATO allies
not to threaten Soviet interests there.
   Without going into detail, Ms. Tutwiler said ``part of this on
the merits deserves to be taken a look at.''
   The overall review is due to be completed April 21 or, at the
latest, in early May.
   Baker intends to use the results in talks he will hold in Moscow
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in May.
   ``Our principal objective in Eastern Europe is to promote
demoncratic self- determiantiona and individual freedoms,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   The spokeswoman said Baker had noted ``welcome signs of
movement'' in some of the East European countries. Referring to
Kissinger's proposal, she said ``part of this on the merits deserve
to be taken a look at.''
   Baker, on a visit to Vienna earlier this month, met with the
foreign ministers of Hungary and Poland and called in a speech for
the Soviets to cancel what is known as the Brezhnev Doctrine.
   Baker's aides said he was impressed with developments in the two
countries.
   The late Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev sent troops into
Czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down a revolt by Communist party
leaders who sought to liberalize the system in Prague.
   The Soviets explained the intervention as coming to the support
of socialism. This became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine.
   Baker first disclosed his interest in the Kissinger proposal in
an interview in The New York Times.

<HEAD>Bush Appointee To Oversee Forest Service Opposed Protection For Owl</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man President Bush has nominated to
oversee the Forest Service adamently opposed making the spotted owl
an endangered species, the fired director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service's West Coast office said Tuesday.
   James Cason was nominated last week as assistant secretary of
agriculture for natural resources and environment, a job that would
give him control over the Forest Service and the Soil Conservation
Service.
   Cason is now deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals
management at the Department of Interior. As such, he oversees the
operations of the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of
Minerals Management Service.
   Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are
embroiled in lawsuits over efforts to protect the spotted owl,
which is thought to nest only in the ancient forests of the
Northwest.
   Cason ``was adamantly opposed to listing the spotted owl as an
endangered species,'' Rolf Wallenstrom, the fired Fish and Wildlife
Service official said of Cason. ``He was part of the group at
Interior putting pressure on the director'' of the Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   Cason, through spokeswoman Kelly Shipp, ``categorically'' denied
that he exerted pressure on the Fish and Wildlife Service not to
list the spotted owl as endangered.
   ``He said he contributed to the policy process and was asked for
his opinion,'' said Ms. Shipp.
   Ms. Shipp said Cason, who was in Denver on Tuesday, will
probably not grant interviews until after his confirmation hearing
before the Senate Agriculture Committee and presumed Senate
confirmation.
   Wallenstrom was fired as director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service's Region 1 Office earlier this year after refusing to take
a job as a special assistant to the director.
   At the time he was fired, Wallenstrom said that he and other
employees were being punished by Frank Dunkle, the agency's
director, for their views on various natural resource issues that
were opposite those of the Reagan administration.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for deciding which
species should be protected under the federal Endangered Species
Act, with the decisions to be based strictly on ``biological
factors.''
   A recent General Accounting Office report concluded that
officials of the Interior Department had put political pressures on
the agency not to list the owl as an endangered species.
   The report said that regional biologists has been ordered to
``sanitize'' an initial report warning that the bird faced
extinction if logging of the old-growth forests in the Northwest
weren't slowed.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service eventually concluded there was not
sufficient evidence to list the owl as endangered. A federal court
subsequently found that decision was ``arbitrary and capricious''
and gave the agency until May 1 to review it.
   Wallenstrom said that Cason at one point didn't even want the
Fish and Wildlife Service to consider a petition asking that the
owl be listed.
   Wallenstrom said in a telephone interview that Cason essentialy
said ``the bird will be listed over my dead body. Cason seemed to
think he had a bigger role in the decision than he did.
   ``He had no official veto power, but I'm sure he did try to
influence (then-Secretary Donald) Hodel and others.''

   Results of key races in the Soviet parliamentary

   _Boris N. Yeltsin, former Moscow party chief and former
non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, defeated Yevgeny Brakov,
director of the giant factory that makes the ZIL limousine, for a

<HEAD>Denver Area Water Officials Meet with EPA on Two Forks Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denver area water officials sought
clarification Tuesday on what steps must be taken to keep the
proposed Two Forks dam and reservoir alive but got no hint on
whether the project will survive.
   ``I think it's an uphill battle,'' William Miller, manager of
the Denver Water Board, told reporters after he and other Denver
area water officials met with the Environmental Protection Agency
about the dam.
   Last Friday, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly stunned the
water board officials by ordering a review of the dam project and
raising broad environmental objections to a construction permit
which earlier this month had been approved by the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Environmentalists and other critics of the $500 million dam and
reservoir planned on the South Platte River southwest of Denver
immediately declared that Reilly's intervention was tantamount to
killing the project, although no final EPA veto has yet been issued.
   Miller and three other Denver area water officials were among
several dozen people, including representatives of the Corps of
Engineers, who met with Rebecca Hamner, acting EPA assistant
administrator for water, and other EPA officials on the dam project.
   The session was generally described as one in which procedural
details were outlined on what steps proponents of the dam must take
in trying to overcome EPA objections to the project.
   Miller told reporters that he and other proponents of the dam
would resubmit their proposals to EPA regional review officers in
hopes of overcoming Reilly's objections.
   Nevertheless, the Denver official said he was ``disappointed and
hurt'' that Reilly intervened after the agency's regional director
in Denver had indicated that environmental concerns had been
resolved.
   The Corps of Engineers had approved a permit for construction of
the dam on March 16 and the EPA's regional director, Jim Scherer,
had indicated he was satisfied that accommodations had been made to
mitigate environmental concerns. But Scherer was overruled by
Reilly who said last Friday that the project as outlined in the
permit ``could result in very serious adverse environmental
impact.''
   Miller said that while the water board would resubmit the
proposal to the EPA there was no plan to change the project
significantly to provide additional environmental safeguards.
   Another participant in the meeting, Bernie Goode, chief of
regulation for the Corps of Engineers in Washington, said that the
decison on the Two Forks project now rests solely in the hands of
the EPA.
   ``The EPA is in the driver's seat,'' Goode told reporters.
   The Two Forks dam has been the focus of bitter controversy
between Denver water officials, who maintain that it is needed to
meet the region's water needs into the next century, and
environmental and conservation activists.
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615-foot
dam and reservoir would flood a large area of the South Platte
including a canyon area with some of the best trout fishing in the
state and home for a variety of wildlife.
   The project also has been under attack because of fears that it
will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend wetland region of
western Nebraska, a favorite resting spot for whooping crane and
thousands of sand hill crane on their migration north.

   The United States threatened to impose higher
tariffs on various fish products from Canada on Tuesday in a
dispute involving Canadian restrictions on the sale of raw salmon
and herring to American companies.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said she had determined
that the Canadian ban on sales of unprocessed herring and pink and
sockeye salmon taken by Canadian fishermen off the coast of British
Columbia violated U.S. trade law.
   Hills' decision represented the latest round in a long-standing
trade dispute between the two countries.
   Canada, in an effort to protect the jobs of workers at
processing plants in British Columbia, prohibits the sale of
unprocessed salmon and herring directly to American processors. The
fish must first be processed in Canadian plants before sale to U.S.
companies.
   The United States has been urging Canada to remove this
prohibition since 1986. America took the issue before the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization which
governs world trade, in 1987 and later that year received a ruling
upholding the U.S. position.
   ``It has been more than a year since Canada's export
prohibitions were found illegal under the GATT. I see no choice at
this point but to take action,'' Hills said in a statement.
   Hills said an inter-agency group of U.S. officials would hold
hearings next month to determine what Canadian products would be
subjected to the higher tariffs.
   In the announcement of the action, the U.S. trade office said it
would consider higher tariffs on various varieties of fresh,
chilled and frozen fish now imported from Canada.
   The dispute over herring and salmon was brought up at a meeting
earlier this month between Hills and Canadian Trade Ministter John
Crosbie but the two officials were unable to narrow the differences
between them.
   At the time, Hills said that the landing requirement was
unacceptable to American companies because ``it bruises the fish
and we feel that we end up with a less valuable product.''
   Canada has contended that the landing requirement was needed as
a conservation measure to assure that Canadian waters were not
depleted. American officials contend that the fish could be counted
and inspected on the boats, allowing the fish to be sold directly
to U.S. buyers.

   Afghanistan is preparing for an uncertain spring
in the aftermath of the Soviet troop withdrawal. The New Delhi
bureau chief of The Associated Press, who has made periodic
reporting trips to Kabul, filed the following report.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people of this capital dig in the
earth as it thaws after a fierce winter, making defenses for war
with guerrillas and planting crops to sustain life.
   Green sprouts are appearing in dun fields within and just
outside the city. More plots are being prepared for planting wheat
and vegetables.
   Machines carve trenches inside the airport and along a barren
ridge that overlooks the runway, and is overlooked in turn by
mountains where the Moslem fighters wait and occasionally fire
rockets at the airport or city.
   ``If you lose the airport, you've lost Kabul,'' a U.N. official
said, asking that his name not be used. ``They're building new
defenses there and strengthening old ones.''
   The Soviet Union continues to supply weapons and ammunition, but
for the first spring since 1979 the Kremlin's client government is
bereft of direct Red Army support against the U.S.-supported
insurgents.
   Some Soviet advisers remain under a friendship treaty predating
the civil war, which began after a Communist coup in April 1978.
   A Soviet colonel who was at the airport in February during the
final days of the Red Army withdrawal was seen there about a week
ago, this time in civilian clothes, a well-placed source said
privately. He added that the colonel smiled and said he had retired
from the armed forces.
   Most Soviets attached to Kabul University and government
ministries left in the past year, as the military withdrawal
progressed. Afghan and foreign observers say, however, that air
traffic controllers and hundreds of other technical workers remain.
   U.N. staff members counted 123 Soviet transport planes landing
at the airport during a week in mid-March. Scud-B missiles and
ammunition crates have been seen being unloaded or taken from the
airport.
   Although the Afghan government describes it as a food airlift,
the Soviets themselves have said they would continue military
resupply operations.
   Even if all available land in and immediately around the city is
planted, the crops can feed only about one-eighth of the 2.2
million people crowded into the city, according to U.N. estimates.
The rest must come by air or on roads subject to guerrilla attack,
harassment and sabotage.
   Only four major highways connect Kabul with the rest of the
country. Two lead south and west into guerrilla areas, some of
which are only 15 miles from the city.
   The eastern route passes through Jalalabad, 75 miles away, where
the guerrillas have besieged government forces for three weeks.
   That leaves the Salang Highway, which runs through the Hindu
Kush mountain range and the northern wheat plain to the Soviet
border 260 miles away.
   It passes through territory controlled by Ahmed Shah Masood, one
of the ablest guerrilla commanders. Buses and some trucks have
reached Kabul on the Salang in recent days, but Masood's men have
been able to cut the highway in the past.
   Government and foreign aid workers agree there is no starvation
in Kabul, but both say the plight of the poorest residents grows
worse because supplies are scarce and they cannot meet the rising
prices.
   Nan, the staple flat bread, goes for the frozen price of 6
afghanis _ about 10 cents at the official rate of exchange _ but
mutton, the favorite meat, has risen about 40 percent in three
months while wages remain unchanged.
   A kilogram of mutton (2.2 pounds) costs 1,000 afghanis _ $18 at
the official exchange rate and $4.50 at the black market rate. That
is one-fifth the average monthly pay of a government office worker
and about half that of an unskilled laborer.
   Few Afghans have access to the black market because they do not
have the hard foreign currency on which it is based.
   Tur Pekii, a 35-year-old woman with nine children, was among
1,000 people who received free flour and sugar this week from the
United Nations.
   She said her husband earned 3,000 afghanis a month as a teacher,
$54 at the official rate.
   ``We can't find sugar,'' she said through the mesh face-panel of
a brown chadri veil that enveloped her from head to toe. ``We don't
want it anyway. It's too expensive.''
   Sugar has gone since January from 180 afghanis a kilo to 400 _
$3.25 to $7.25 at the official rate.

   The mother of Joseph Hazelwood, captain of
the oil tanker involved in the nation's worst oil spill, confirmed
Tuesday her son had a history of alcohol abuse and that Exxon was
aware of it.
   ``I do know that he had a problem with alcohol in the past,''
Margaret Hazelwood said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press. ``I know he was rehabilitated. Exxon knows it.''
   ``But I had thought things were on an even keel,'' she added.
She declined to elaborate on that comment, and refused to say
anything further about her son's drinking.
   Hazelwood, 42, also of Huntington, N.Y., was captain of the
Exxon Valdez when the tanker went aground last Friday in Prince
William Sound near Valdez, Alaska.
   Hazelwood is banned from driving in New York and New Hampshire
because of a drunken driving conviction in North Conway, N.H., six
months ago.
   On July 21, 1981, Hazelwood was charged with driving while
intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident stemming from a
collision.
   His license was suspended for 18 months when he refused to
submit to a chemical test. Later he pleaded guilty to the driving
while intoxicated charge, and was fined $510.
   In 1984, his license was revoked after he refused a Breathalyzer
test following a minor automobile accident near his home.
   His license was restored in May 1986 after he completed the
program, but it was withdrawn after last year's conviction in New
Hampshire.
   He grew up in Huntington, where he lives with his wife Susan and
teenage daughter.
   Mrs. Hazelwood said her son has been in close touch with his
wife since the incident.
   ``He calls her whenever he can get to a phone but it's difficult
because the hearings are going on,'' said Mrs. Hazelwood.
   Les Rogers, an Exxon spokesman in Houston declined to comment on
Hazelwood's drinking problem. He referred all question to Exxon
officials in Alaska.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain said Tuesday she is willing to meet in Europe with Cabinet
ministers from South Africa, which she pointedly refused to visit
on her current African tour.
   She repeated her call for South Africa to free Nelson Mandela,
the African National Congress leader who has been imprisoned since
the early 1960s.
   Also, however, Mrs. Thatcher emphasized her view that economic
sanctions are not effective against apartheid, the policy with
which South Africa's 5 million whites retain privilege and deny a
voice in national affairs to the 28 million blacks.
   President Robert Mugabe greeted her at the airport when she
arrived from Lagos, Nigeria.
   On the flight to Harare, the prime minister said she had told
South Africa she would meet with any ministers who happened to be
in Europe, according to Press Association, Britian's domestic news
agency.
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose visit to Africa began Monday in Morocco, is
to be in Zimbabwe until Thursday, then go to Malawi and return to
London on Saturday.
   South Africa could learn from the negotiations that produced an
independent Zimbabwe, which as the British colony of Rhodesia was
once ruled by a white minority, Mrs. Thatcher said at the airport.
   ``There is a sea change in the region,'' she declared. ``There
is an atmosphere about these problems now that they can be solved
by patient negotiation.''
   Earlier, she told journalists: ``It is better to have a
constructive policy than one of hitting out with sanctions. I do
not think it makes sense to isolate South Africa as she approaches
these very difficult decisions. The need for tact and persuasion is
greater than ever.''
   The visit is Mrs. Thatcher's first to Zimbabwe, which her
government steered to independence nine years ago. She will confer
with Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique on
Wednesday in a border area called Nyanga.
   Mrs. Thatcher was received warmly in Lagos, where she had been
the target 14 months earlier of what appeared to be officially
sanctioned anti-apartheid demonstrations.
   Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, president of Nigeria, said to her: ``In
the last two years the relationship between our two countries has
gotten very, very close together. This is made possible under your
very dynamic and able leadership.''

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady assured Texas
business leaders Tuesday that federal regulators would not disrupt
the state's fragile economic recovery by flooding the real estate
market with property obtained from insolvent savings and loan
institutions.
   Brady also warned that delaying the Bush administration's plan
for rescuing the nation's hundreds of insolvent thrifts was costing
taxpayers $20 million per day and continued debate over alternative
proposals would add millions more to the costs.
   Key elements of the plan call for the government to close some
350 insolvent but still open thrifts and meet commitments for 205
institutions rescued last year.
   Local business leaders frequently have expressed fears that the
federal government would unload real estate acquired with the
failed thrifts at below-market prices to help clear their books.
   Such transactions would be carried out by the Federal Asset
Disposition Association, which is charged with selling assets from
failed thrifts, or a proposed alternative vehicle.
   FADA currently manages about assets valued at about $3.8 billion
in 33 states. Of those assets, an estimated $2.59 billion worth are
in Texas.
   ``We understand the potential destructive effects on the local
economies of wholesale dumping,'' Brady said in a speech to the
Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce. ``Let me assure you that we
intend to proceed very carefully with real estate sales.
   ``Decisions will be evaluated and made with the best interest of
everyone involved, particularly local communities, taken into
consideration,'' he said.
   Brady said the government would be robbing itself by cut-rate
sales, which would reduce the money that the sales could generate
to help finance the rescue plan.
   The administration is resisting efforts by Sen. Timothy Wirth,
D-Colo., and other legislators to write dumping obstacles into the
S&amp;L rescue bill being considered by Congress.
   Brady's first trip this year to Texas _ the state hardest hit by
the thrift crisis _ is sandwiched between the end of congressional
hearings on Bush's plan and the expected start of committee work on
the legislation when lawmakers return next week from their spring
recess.
   The Treasury Department is working on an alternative operating
plan for the so-called Resolution Trust Corp., the government
entity in the Bush proposal that would liquidate failed S&amp;Ls,
according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The RTC will be free to consider a number of innovative
proposals for preventing dumping, including the creation of
regional trusts to buy and manage problem properties or the
``securitization'' of pools of real estate for sale to public
investors, the official said.
   ``Obviously there's some real estate that's junk...that has no
value now, that never did have, never will have. You might as well
get that behind you,'' Brady said Tuesday. ``There's other real
estate that's well-conceived which has tenants in buildings and
people living in condos...and those kinds of properties shouldn't
be thrown on the market willy-nilly and won't be.''
   The Bush plan, which would bring thrift regulation under the
Treasury Department, would spend $40 billion to finance the
insolvent institutions that already have been taken care of and
would borrow another $50 billion to be spent during the next three
years, Brady said.
   The Treasury secretary disagreed with past suggestions for a
one-time lump sum appropriation of taxpayers' money to pay for the
massive thrift rescues. he said such an expense would make it
impossible to meet budget deficit reduction targets, which in turn
would boost government borrowing costs.
   ``We cannot afford delay. If the debate over alternate financial
plans takes even three weeks, the cost to the taxpayer goes up by
$500 million,'' Brady said said.

<TEXT>
   A combined force of leftist guerrillas and
drug traffickers overran a jungle police post in the heart of
Peru's cocaine region, killing 10 officers and wounding 12,
military officials reported Tuesday.
   The attack at dusk Monday was among the bloodiest of recent
months. Officials said it may have been a response to U.S.-financed
testing of a powerful herbicide against coca, the raw material of
cocaine.
   Premier Armando Villanueva and Defense Minister Enrique Lopez
flew to Uchiza, site of the attack 245 miles northeast of Lima, on
Tuesday, the government news agency Andina reported. Officials said
more than 100 soldiers and police troopers were sent to the town as
reinforcements.
   In June 1987, drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas of the
Shining Path destroyed the police post at Uchiza in the cocaine
country of Peru's Huallaga Valley. Six policemen were killed in
that raid.
   Shining Path guerrillas has provided protection to drug
traffickers for about two years in exchange for arms and money.
They began their insurgency in 1980, in the region around Ayachuco
in the Andes.
   Military officials said 150 rebels and drug-runners attacked the
50-man post Monday with gunfire and grenades. They said surviving
defenders fled into the surrounding jungle.
   Six attackers were slain and their companions carried the bodies
away, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
   They said telephone connections with Uchiza were cut and word of
the attack reached Lima hours later by radio, still with sketchy
details.
   Ten days ago the U.S. and Peruvian governments began a second
phase of tests of the herbacide Tebuthiuron, sold under the name
Spike, in the Huallaga Valley, which produces about 60 percent of
the world's coca.
   Environmentalists say the chemical could destroy other plants
and lead to widespread erosion. Officials said tests on 40 acres
would track the herbicide's effects on coca and the environment
over at least a year.
   Coca produced in the Uchiza region is partially processed in
jungle laboratories and flown from clandestine airstrips to
Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine for sale in U.S. and
European markets.

   Ayatollah Ali Montazeri resigned on
Tuesday as the heir-apparent to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and
said he did so at the bidding of the 88-year-old revolutionary
patriarch himself.
   Montazeri and two high Foreign Ministry officials appeared to be
the first government casualties in a fierce drive by Khomeini to
return Iran to the roots of its fundamentalist revolution.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Jaafar Mahallati, also resigned
Tuesday, two days after Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad
Larijani stepped down. Both are U.S.-educated.
   Khomeini last month harshly attacked those who would rebuild
links with the West and denounced lagging revolutionary fervor.
   Montazeri's resignation came after Khomeini sent him a letter on
March 26 asking him to step down, reported Iran's official Tehran
radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``I see myself compelled to obey your orders, because the
survival and stability of the Islamic Republic rests on obeying
your command,'' the radio quoted the 64-year-old Montazeri as
saying.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, Iran's main opposition group, commented in
a telex to The Associated Press from its Baghdad, Iraq,
headquarters: ``A wave of dismissals and resignations ... at
various levels is on the rise. ... The disposal of Montazeri
indicates an eruption at the highest level of the unending internal
conflicts. ''
   The immediate cause of Montazeri's ouster appears to be his
critical assessment of the revolution's accomplishments.
   In a speech published Feb. 12 by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency, Montazeri declared that Iranian leaders made many
mistakes in the first 10 years of the revolution which isolated the
fledgling republic from much of the world. His remarks drew a
stinging rejoinder from Khomeini.
   Montazeri was chosen by an 83-member Council of Experts as
Khomeini's successor in 1985. The ad hoc assembly itself had been
elected in 1982 to ensure succession in case of Khomeini's death.
   Montazeri, an close ally of Khomeini since they organized an
uprising against the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1963, was
chosen after Khomeini hinted his support. On Tuesday he said he
always opposed the move and that he simply wanted to return to
being a religious student.
   No immediate word surfaced on another Khomeini successor.
   Khomeini had assailed Montazeri, without mentioning Montazeri's
name, after the Feb. 12 speech. ``How short-sighted are those who
think that because we did not reach final victory at the front,
that martyrdom and self-sacrifice are worthless,'' he said.
   Immediately after the cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war
last August, Khomeini apparently gave free rein to the pragmatists.
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, seeking loans and technology to rebuild Iran,
spearheaded a drive to soften Iran's radical image.
   Mahallati and Larijani were instrumental in rebuilding
diplomatic ties with the West. The ties had been strained since the
radical outbursts of the first days of the 1979 revolution. Iran
saw the West then as backing the ousted shah. It violently purged
internal opposition and held 52 Americans hostage in the U.S.
Embassy for 444 days.
   By last week, Khomeini was proclaiming that Iran had drifted
away from the values of the revolution.
   He warned pragmatists that ``the government must do its very
best to govern the people as best it can, but this does not mean
that it should drive them away from the great goals of the
revolution, which is the creation of a global Islamic government.''
   Khomeini first fired up the resurgence of the fundamentalist
camp by condemning Salman Rushdie to death for the British author's
novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' saying the book was blasphemous and
proof of the West's attempt to undermine Islam.
   When 14 Western nations withdrew their top diplomats to protest
the death sentence, Khomeini said it was proof of the futility of
normalizing relations, and Parliament voted to sever ties with
Britain.
   In his letter, the radio said, Khomeini told Montazeri, ``In
order that former mistakes may not be repeated, I advise you to
cleanse your household from unsuitable individuals and seriously
prevent the comings and goings of the opponents of the system who
pretend to be in favor of Islam and the Islamic republic.''
   Montazeri has had close contacts in recent months with
opposition groups such as the tiny Freedom Movement of Mehdi
Bazargan. Bazargan, Iran's first prime minister, now is the
government's most outspoken critic inside Iran.
   In advising Montazeri to distance himself from the so-called
liberals, Khomeini wrote, ``I also gave you the same advice in the
case of Mehdi Hashemi.''
   Montazeri has been at odds with the government since December
1986, when Hashemi, son-in-law of Montazeri's brother, exposed the
government's clandestine contacts with the United States in the
arms-for-hostages deal.
   Hashemi was tried for treason, terrorism and kidnapping, and was
executed by firing squad on Sept. 22, 1987.

<HEAD>Lawyers Argue District Death Penalty Ban Precludes Extradition To
Alabama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a juvenile facing murder and arson
charges in Alabama told a District of Columbia Superior Court judge
Tuesday that sending the 17-year-old back to Alabama and a possible
death sentence would violate the district's ban on capital
punishment.
   But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the district
government, told Judge Stephen F. Eilperin he has no choice but to
enforce an interstate agreement requiring states to extradite
juveniles charged with crimes by other states.
   Failing to honor that agreement, Alper argued, would quickly
turn the nation's capital into ``a haven for fleeing fugitives.''
   Eilperin said he would rule Thursday morning on Alabama's
petition to extradite the youth, identified only by the initials
O.M. He also said he would issue an immediate stay of that ruling
to give the losing side a change to appeal to the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals.
   O.M. is charged in the May 1988 firebombing of an apartment in
Gadsden, Ala., which resulted in the death of 14-month-old Tamel
Jackson. Yul Devoe Guice, 31, an uncle of O.M., was arrested soon
after the bombing and charged with murder and arson.
   O.M. was arrested by district authorities in December and has
been fighting extradition ever since. His grandmother, Alice Guice
Thomas, testified at a hearing last month that O.M., who is black,
cannot get a fair trial from the white authorities of Etowah
County, Ala.
   Alper argued Tuesday, however, that the fairness of the Alabama
judicial system is not at issue in the case.
   ``We would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabama
attempted to pass judgement on our system of justice,'' Alper said,
arguing that O.M.'s lawyers would have Eilperin pass judgement on
the quality of Alabama justice.
   Gerald Fisher, O.M.'s lead attorney, focused on the death
penalty issue, contending that the district's City Council, in
banning the death penalty, incorporated that ban into the
interstate agreement governing juvenile extraditions.
   But Eilperin seemed reluctant to acceept that argument. He told
the boy's lawyers several times that the ``major problem'' with
their reasoning was that O.M. is not facing the death penalty as
long he is tried as a juvenile.
   ``If Alabama decides to try him as an adult, this court is
constitutionally obligated to send him back to Alabama for trial,''
Eilperin said.
   Fisher argued, however, that Alabama authorities cannot certify
O.M. for trial as an adult _ and subject him to a possible death
sentence _ without him first being returned to the state.
   An extradition order, he said, thus would violate the district's
ban on capital punishment because it would clear the way for
Alabama authorities to try O.M. as an adult, should they so chose.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. was fined $500 Tuesday
by the District of Columbia's Office of Campaign Finance for not
disclosing his partnership with a prominent local developer in a
Nantucket, Mass., real estate deal.
   Marianne Coleman Niles, who heads the campaign finance office,
determined that a promissory note the mayor signed in 1985 when he
bought an interest in a Nantucket building constituted an
interest-free loan and should have been listed on Barry's financial
disclosure forms.
   However, Niles concluded that Barry did not violate the city's
conflict of interest statute by entering into the partnership with
developer Jeffrey Cohen, despite Barry's personal approval of some
of Cohen's business dealings with the city.
   Top city officials are required by law to annually disclose any
liability of more than $1,000 that is owed to anyone except family
members, banks, or other credit institutions. The note obligates
the mayor to pay $49,000 over 10 years for a 10 percent interest in
the building.
   Barry failed to list the partnership on his 1986, 1987 or 1988
disclosure forms.
   ``This (disclosure) policy applies with full force to the mayor
and every other District of Columbia government official,'' Niles
said in a release.
   However, Niles concluded that Barry may not have known that he
was required to disclose the complicated loan deal, and concluded
the mayor did not willfully omit it.
   Herbert O. Reid, Barry's legal counsel, wrote Niles that Barry
will pay the $500 fine and amend his disclosure forms to include
the loan, but added that Barry is operating ``with the clear
understanding that he has not engaged in any wrongdoing.''
   John C. White, Barry's spokesman, said the mayor would not
comment on the matter.
   Barry could have been fined up to $1,500 _ $500 for each failure
to disclose _ and Niles could have recommended that the U.S.
Attorney's office investigate the matter.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that Reid
told Niles that Barry did not view the arrangement as a loan, but
simply an agreement to pay his $49,000 share in installments.
   Barry's interest in the building was held in the name of another
investor, Israel Kogan, a local obstetrician who served as the
legal ``nominee.'' Kogan and Barry formed an unregistered
partnership named KB Associates.
   The building, now valued at more than $1 million, is owned by
nine people, including Barry and Cohen. Situated in the island's
historic district, it houses two antique shops and three apartments.

   The Soviet Union said Tuesday it wants
U.N. military observers posted between Afghanistan and Pakistan to
stop cross-border raids by the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topple
the communist government in Kabul.
   ``It is very important now to look into the situation on the
border between Afghanistan and Pakistan,'' Soviet U.N. Ambassador
Aleksandr M. Belonogov said after meeting with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``The government of Afghanistan is suggesting that United
Nations (military) observers should be posted in the border area,
and we think this is the right idea.''
   The 50 military observers of the U.N. Good Offices Mission in
Afghanistan and Pakistan monitored the Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan that ended Feb. 15.
   Belonogov said the observers now should focus on what he said
was Pakistan's policy of allowing the guerrillas to operate from
bases in Pakistan.
   He said he believes ``the situation now demands much more
attention by ... (the Good Offices Mission) to the border area
between Afghanistan and Pakistan.''
   U.S. officials were unavailable for comment.
   Earlier in the day, the State Department declined comment when
two lower-ranking Soviet diplomats suggested in Washington that the
United Nations consider posting U.N. border monitors.
   Belonogov said that he ``also drew the attention of the
secretary-general to the inadequate situation with regard to the
implementation of the Geneva Accords,'' under which the Soviet army
left Afghanistan.
   Those accords, signed last April 14, require Afghanistan and
Pakistan not to interfere in each others' internal affairs.
   ``We are proud that we honored our obligations under the
agreements and that at the moment there are no Soviet soldiers on
Afghan soil, but at the same time we are concerned that these are
not honored, they are disregarded by Pakistan,'' said Belonogov.
   ``We are now witnessing deeper involvement by Pakistan into the
internal affairs of Afghanistan.''
   The Soviets and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of letting the
rebels maintain bases on its territory and launch cross-border
raids. They also say the United States violates the accords by
supplying the guerrillas with weapons.
   The rebels also received support from China and Saudi Arabia.
Other rebels operating in western Pakistan receive aid from Iran.
   Afghan officers have accused Pakistani officers of directing the
current rebel seige of the Afghan city of Jalalabad, 75 miles east
of Kabul.

   If the Academy Awards are best known for
garish gowns and overlong acceptance speeches, then Oscar-oriented
pickets run a close third, and Wednesday night's awards ceremony
will be no exception.
   As the producers of the 61st Academy Awards hurried on Tuesday
to prepare the show, protesters picketed the studios of MGM-United
Artists, demanding an apology for the comic depiction of stuttering
in the triple-nominated film ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   ``If young children across the country are watching this film,
they really won't understand how the person who stutters is abused
verbally and shamed by everyone around him,'' said Mark Power, a
member of the advisory board of the National Stuttering Project.
   ``I don't think (a film maker) would have a blind person walking
into walls and have people kid him about that or make fun of him,''
Power said. ``But it's the same thing with stuttering. People are
born with the problem, and there's nothing you can really do about
it.''
   Ironically, another United Artists release has been praised for
its sensitive depiction of a disability. ``Rain Man,'' in which
Dustin Hoffman portrays an autistic savant, is this year's most
nominated film, and is favored to win several major awards,
including best picture.
   Other protesters were expected to congregate at the Shrine
Auditorium to take full advantage of the tremendous news media
attention (700 members of the press will be on hand).
   The Rev. R. L. Hymers said he plans to demonstrate against ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' which a variety of conservative
Christian leaders denounced last year for its depiction of a
doubting Jesus. The film received only one nomination, for director
Martin Scorsese.
   ``If they give him the Academy Award it will be approval of the
spiritual pornography,'' Hymers said.
   Yet the show's production team was largely unconcerned with any
controversies surrounding this year's Oscars as it headed toward
curtain time.
   ``Every moment is a crisis, but we're sitting here perfectly
relaxed and happy,'' said show producer Allan Carr between the last
Oscar rehearsals Tuesday. ``This is as good as it's going to be.''
   ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is nominated for best original
screenplay, best supporting actor (Kevin Kline) and best director
(Charles Crichton). In the bank-robbery farce, Kline taunts a
character played by Michael Palin for his severe speech impediment.
   The character loses his stutter at the end of the film when he
runs over Kline with a steam roller. The movie was a box-office
hit, grossing more than $62 million, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   The 4,000-member National Stuttering Project, which says that
more than 2 million Americans stutter, is asking MGM to add a
disclaimer to ``A Fish Called Wanda'' stating that the film did not
intend to perpetuate ``negative inferences about people who
stutter.''
   Tracy Lorie, a spokeswoman for MGM-UA, said the studio felt it
had nothing to apologize for.
   ``We didn't make a movie that is derogatory toward stutterers,''
she said. ``Michael Palin's character is the most likable in the
film.''
   John Cleese, who both co-wrote and stars in ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' joked last week that the movie's use of stuttering was why
it received as many nominations as it did.
   ``The best way to get nominated for something is to have someone
in the film who is suffering from some kind of psychological or
physical handicap,'' Cleese said.
   Carr, the Oscar show producer, has added some new twists this
year. There will be no emcee. Instead, presenters will be duets of
stars, some married or romantically linked to each other. These
include Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett, Melanie Griffith and Don
Johnson and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.
   Carr, who took Broadway by storm with ``La Cage Aux Folles,''
predicted a show that will combine ``the best of movies, the best
of Broadway and the best of television all rolled into one.''
   ``I think it's a triple,'' Carr said, ``but it just might be a
home run.''
   Last-minute odds put ``Rain Man'' in the lead for best picture
over ``The Accidental Tourist,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
``Mississippi Burning'' and ``Working Girl.''
   ``Rain Man'' director Barry Levinson was thought by many to be a
shoo-in for best director, as was Hoffman for best actor for his
starring role in the film.
   The best actress category, though, was thought to be much
closer. Meryl Streep was nominated for ``A Cry in the Dark,'' Glenn
Close was selected for ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' Jodie Foster was
named for ``The Accused,'' Sigourney Weaver was nominated for
``Gorillas in the Mist'' and Miss Griffith was chosen for ``Working
Girl.''

   Hundreds of students laid money at the feet
of evangelist Oral Roberts Tuesday after he said he must raise $11
million by May 6 or creditors will start dismantling his university
and ministry.
   The 71-year-old evangelist said scandals in other ministries
have caused contributions to his ministry to decline from $5
million a month to $2.7 million during the past two years.
   Speaking to a sometimes hushed and often raucous gathering of
4,300 Oral Roberts University students at a campus chapel service,
Roberts described himself as a ``tough old bird'' intent on keeping
the university going ``until Jesus comes.''
   Roberts' son, Richard, executive vice president of the school,
told students it was the greatest financial crisis in his father's
41-year ministry.
   After the elder Roberts made an impassioned speech to students,
Richard Roberts laid a $100 bill on the stage at the feet of his
father and mother, Evelyn. Mrs. Roberts suggested students might
want to contribute, too, and hundreds filed down to the stage to
leave checks, change and bills in a pile.
   The collection raised $8,500, Richard Roberts said.
   University officials declared Wednesday a day of prayer and
fasting on campus.
   Roberts first made his plea during a taping session Monday for
his weekly ``Expect A Miracle'' television program, scheduled to
air in part on Sunday on 147 statons.
   ``If we can't make our payroll, I don't know what will happen to
this man or this ministry,'' Roberts said during the taping.
``People, this is serious. This is a life-and-death matter.''
   He lambasted the news media for the way they cover his ministry,
but school officials contacted reporters about his comments and
made the unedited tape available for viewing.
   The evangelist's plea comes two years after he raised a furor by
saying his life depended on raising $8 million to provide
scholarships for his university's medical students.
   Roberts announced on April 1, 1987, that the money had been
raised.
   ``Two years have passed, and I have been silent,'' he said.
   During that time, he said, contributions to his ministry have
declined by nearly half. He said the ministry needs 10,000 to
15,000 additional ``partners'' to boost monthly income to $3.3
million.
   With that amount coming in, ``we can pay all bills and keep them
paid,'' Roberts said.
   He said he was ``laughed at, mocked, scoffed'' two years ago,
but said he was only repeating what God had told him about
redirecting efforts in medical school missions work at the
university.
   Roberts said he has fallen behind in paying for time on the
television stations that air his program, as well as for food
services at the university, supplies and other bills owed to
hundreds of vendors.
   ``Now our vendors and suppliers have to have their money,'' he
said. ``If we cannot pay the $11 million by the first week in May
... they will have to go to the extent of the law to collect their
money.''
   ``If we don't pay it, then they start coming in, start
dismantling,'' he said.
   Richard Roberts said the university has no plans to sell its
commercial property, including a hotel and three office buildings
in Tulsa.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir toured Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday and said he is
still working on peace proposals he will take to Washington next
week.
   Israeli news reports interpreted Shamir's visit to the West Bank
as a message to the U.S. administration, which has said Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories are an obstacle to peace.
   In other developments, two Palestinians were reported wounded by
Israeli troops, an Israeli passenger bus was set ablaze, and
militant Palestinians and Israeli forces prepared for Land Day
violence on Thursday.
   Arab hospital officials said two Palestinians were shot and
wounded by Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands. At least 412
Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed since a Palestinian uprising
began in the West Bank and Gaza strip in December 1988.
   In Arab east Jerusalem a firebomb burned an Israeli bus, but no
injuries were reported.
   Leaflets distributed in the West Bank and Gaza and signed by
various Palestine Liberation Organization factions called for a
general strike and attacks on Land Day.
   Palestinians mark Land Day from fighting in 1976 when six Arabs
were killed by army and police gunfire in riots over the
government's seizure of Arab land.
   ``Let us rain the occupiers and the settlers with thousands of
stones and firebombs because this is the only language our enemy
can understand,'' said a leaflet distributed in Gaza City.
   The army moved reinforcements into the occupied territories in
anticipation of Land Day violence. In the 1988 Land Day riots four
Palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded.
   Shamir, who wants more Jewish settlement in the occupied
territories, was given bread, salt and wine by dozens of cheering
settlers in the Har Adar settlement near Jerusalem. In nearby Givat
Zeev he was made an honorary citizen.
   At a meeting in Washington earlier this month, Secretary of
State James Baker III reportedly urged Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens to halt plans to expand Jewish settlements as a move to
improve the climate for peace talks.
   But a coalition agreement between Shamir's hardline Likud bloc
and the Labor party stipulates building eight new settlements over
the next four years. The two parties recently agreed to allocate
$19.4 million for that purpose.
   Some 70,000 Jewish settlers and 1.7 million Palestinians live in
the occupied territories.
   Shamir, who is to meet with President Bush April 6, was asked
about peace proposals he might make.
   ``We are still in the process of discussion,'' he said. ``There
is no point in publishing unfinished things. It's not clear these
would be accepted.''

   President Najib has offered Moslem
guerrillas local autonomy in exchange for peace with his Marxist
government, and he urged field commanders to discuss it with him in
Mecca, the holy city of Islam.
   The hourlong speech in Dari, the Afghan language, was broadcast
by state radio Monday night and Tuesday. The Foreign Ministry later
issued excerpts in English.
   Najib called repeatedly for an end to ``Afghan fratricide'' and
accused ``Pakistani militarist circles'' of forcing the war on the
Afghan people.
   At least 3.5 million refugees have fled to neighboring Pakistan
during the civil war, which began after a communist coup in April
1978, and the main insurgent groups are based there.
   Guerrilla political leaders lead ``a lavish life'' in Pakistan
while field commanders bear the hardship and risk of the war, Najib
said.
   He used the Dari word for ``compatriot'' in referring to the
commanders, reserving ``enemy'' for their leaders in Pakistan.
   ``Dear compatriots, local commanders, I invite you to peace
because I recognize you as the main party of the other side,'' he
declared.
   ``Before it is too late, please separate your path from the
warmongers so they do not take advantage of your blood and your
sweat.''
   His continuing effort to portray himself and his government as
Islamic rather than communist was evident in the offer to meet in
Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and his frequent references to the holy Koran.
   Najib, former chief of the KHAD secret police, has tried for a
year to achieve a negotiated settlement. The guerrillas, known as
mujahedeen, or holy warriors, refuse to negotiate with what they
call a ``godless communist regime.''
   On Feb. 15 the last Soviet troops withdrew under a U.N.-mediated
agreement, after more than nine years of direct involvement in the
war. Najib's conscript army, well-supplied with modern Soviet
equipment, was left to fight the insurgents alone.
   Soviet supply flights arrive regularly in Kabul and Najib's
government says they will continue until the United States and
Pakistan stop arming the guerrillas.
   In his radio appeal, Najib said the Soviet departure left no
reason to continue fighting. The guerrillas have said they won't be
satisfied until Najib and his Communist Party are removed from
power.
   For three weeks, insurgents have besieged Jalalabad, a strategic
city 75 miles east of Kabul on the only paved road to the Pakistan
border.
   Kabul has been quiet, but heavy artillery could be heard Tuesday
10 to 15 miles north-northwest of the city. Some of it was in the
direction of the Salang Highway, which runs north to the Soviet
border and passes through guerrilla-controlled territory.
   Najib promised field commanders they could keep their weapons if
they stopped fighting, and have their own territory.
   ``My brothers, wherever you are, you can establish your own
county, district and subdistrict and the state will act in those
regions on the basis of your recommendations,'' Najib said. ``You
can appoint your own government.''
   His frequent comments about Pakistani involvement in the war
seemed intended to rouse the centuries-old resentment of outsiders.
Since the Red Army left, Najib and his government have increasingly
depicted Pakistan as the source of evil for the Afghan people.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Soviet U.N. Ambassador
Aleksandr M. Belonogov said Tuesday that Moscow wants U.N. military
observers posted between Afghanistan and Pakistan to stop
cross-border raids by Afghan guerrillas.
   Artillery or rocket fire could be heard and seen over a low
ridge about 10 miles north of the Kabul airport Tuesday while three
Soviet Ilyushin-76 transport planes unloaded sacks of flour.
   Half an hour later, a Norwegian plane chartered by the
International Committee of the Red Cross landed with nearly four
tons of medicine, blankets and mattresses.
   Alexander Lange, the pilot, said it was his fifth Red Cross
flight to Kabul from Peshawar, Pakistan, since Feb. 15.
   He reported no trouble en route, but said he flew his Fokker
F-27 on a circuitous course that took more than two hours rather
than passing over Jalalabad on the 45-minute direct route.

   Federal agents seized $36.5 million and arrested
85 people over a two-year period to crush the biggest counterfeit
currency ring in Secret Service history, law enforcement officials
said Tuesday.
   They estimated that $2 million in bogus bills is still in
circulation.
   ``As strange as it may sound, they planned to take the currency
to Colombia'' and palm it off on drug cartels in exchange for
cocaine, Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel De Vita said at a news
conference.
   Instead, the ringleaders ``got a little greedy'' and started
selling the funny money, said De Vita, who prosecuted the case.
They got caught when the money surfaced in U.S. casinos, banks and
shopping malls, and even as far away as Paris.
   Thirty of the suspects, mostly ``mules (couriers) and go-fers,''
were arrested in New York and the rest in Los Angeles, Chicago and
Miami during the two-year investigation, said Richard Ward, the
chief agent in the Secret Service's New York office.
   Asked why authorities had waited so long to announce the case,
Ann Driscoll, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Brooklyn, said they had been waiting for the last of the
ringleaders to enter his plea.
   That occurred March 13, she said. Since then, the announcement
had been a question of scheduling.
   The spokeswoman said she didn't have figures on how many of the
85 arrested were prosecuted, or on the disposition of the cases
because a number of jurisdictions were involved.
   The five New York ringleaders, including former used car
salesman Francisco Scocozza, 55, a Uruguayan living in Queens, were
arrested between October and January. They pleaded guilty to a
charge of creating counterfeit currency and are awaiting sentences
of up to 15 years in prison.
   In all, it's believed that $80 million to $100 million in $10,
$20, $50 and $100 bills was cranked out at six locations in
Manhattan and Queens _ the bulk of it in the basement of ringleader
Juan Moran-Munoz, an Argentine living in Queens, said De Vita.
   The balance of the money was dumped or burned when the suspects
``realized the Secret Service was onto them,'' said U.S. Attorney
Andrew Maloney. Sanitation workers found $18 million in chopped-up
bills in a Bronx trash bin last July, said Ward.
   Of the estimated $2 million still in circulation, Maloney said:
``We think most of these bills are of first quality. To the
unsophisticated person, it could pass as real bills.''
   Ward said the portrait on a suspected counterfeit should be
compared to the one on a genuine bill.

   Heavy thunderstorms gave Texans a drenching on Tuesday while
Eastern Seaboard residents got a record-breaking preview of summer.
Snow and freezing rain fell in parts of Minnesota and far northern
Michigan.
   An upper-air disturbance moving across southern Texas produced
the strong thunderstorms that prompted flash flood watches for
northeast Texas, extreme southeast Oklahoma and all of Arkansas.
   Rainfall overnight averaged around 3 inches in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, with 5 inches falling in northern sections of Fort
Worth. Rivers and streams rose rapidly.
   Up to 4 inches of rain soaked portions of south-central Texas,
and over an inch of rain fell in 50 minutes in the town of Hondo.
Flooding was reported along Cowhouse Creek at Fort Hood.
   Winds from an intense thunderstorm gusted to 58 mph at Austin,
Texas, and blew a tree onto a house just west of the capital.
   A tornado watch was posted for much of southern and eastern
Texas.
   One to 2 inches of rain drenched western Arkansas, flooding
highways in Sebastian County.
   Welcome rains fell over eastern Kansas and western Missouri,
with 2 inches falling at Westwood, Kan., and over 1.75 inches at
Liberty, Mo.
   Northern Minnesota and western upper Michigan had wintry
weather, with rain mixed with freezing rain and light snow.
   Rain showers fell over central California, western Montana and
the upper Great Lakes. Portions of the Great Lakes were shrouded in
fog.
   A cold front moving through the central Pacific Coast produced
high winds, including gusts over 70 mph west of Reno, Nev. A high
wind warning was in effect for extreme western Nevada.
   Record spring warmth continued from the lower Mississippi Valley
to the Atlantic Coast, with temperatures in the 80s as far north as
southern New England.
   It was 90 degrees at Baltimore-Washington International Airport,
shattering a 44-year-old record. Elsewhere, records were set or
tied at Beckley, W.V. (81), Boston, (81), Cape Hatteras, N.C. (76),
Huntington, W.V. (86), Mansfield, Ohio (75), Montgomery, Ala. (85),
Portland, Maine (67), Providence, R.I. (79), Roanoake, Va. (82) and
Youngstown, Ohio (77).
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 88 degrees at McAllen, Texas, and
Fort Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low Tuesday was 17 degrees at Gunnison and Alamosa,
Colo.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from eastern portions of the southern plains to much
of the middle and lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the lower Great Lakes and the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast, with thunderstorms most prevalent from eastern Texas to the
lower Mississippi Valley and southern portions of the lower Ohio
Valley; rain showers from the Pacific Northwest to the northern and
central Rockies and the northern plains, with snow over northern
Maine and snow mixed with rain at higher elevations of the central
Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 30s from eastern
North Dakota to northern Minnesota, upper Michigan and northern
Maine; the 40s and 50s from the northern and central Pacific Coast
to the northern and central Intermountain West, the northern
Rockies, much of the northern Plains, the Great Lakes and northern
New England; the 80s from south central Texas to the Gulf Coast,
Florida, and the southern Atlantic Coast, and across southwest
Texas and the desert Southwest; and in the 60s and 70s in the rest
of the nation.

   Soviet Defense Minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov
on Tuesday toured Syria's Mediterranean coast, where Moscow
reportedly plans to expand a military facility it has operated for
20 years.
   Sources in the Soviet delegation said Yazov was accompanied by
senior Syrian officers on the trip from Damascus to the port city
of Latakia.
   Yazov arrived Monday for the first official visit to Syria by a
Soviet defense chief in more than a decade. Syria is Moscow's chief
Arab ally.
   It could not be determined if Yazov also visited Tartus, the
site where the Soviets have maintained military facilities since
1969.
   Tartus is about 40 miles south of Latakia and 25 miles north of
the border with Lebanon.
   Last year Western intelligence reports mentioned contruction at
the Tartus installation. The reports said the Soviets want to
expand the facilities so that naval units in the region would not
have to make the journey north to Soviet ports in the Black Sea for
repairs and maintenance.

   The city attorney filed suit Tuesday against
more than 100 alleged slumlords who ``trade buildings like cards at
a card game'' in order to stay a step ahead of the law.
   The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court by City Attorney James
Hahn, charges lenders and landlords with conspiring to make a
fortune off poor tenants while sidestepping city building code
regulations.
   The civil case was filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
   Several tenants peered out of windows at a four-story apartment
building where Hahn held a news conference to announce a crackdown
on 137 lenders, companies and individuals allegedly involved in the
scheme.
   The lawsuit alleges that for years the defendants ``have engaged
in a common enterprise and plan directed toward maintaining slum
buildings without the repairs to make them habitable, while
extracting from them ... the maximum amount of rent, earnings and
profit.''
   The landlords allegedly avoided prosecution for building code
violations by selling the properties after the city filed suit to
bring them up to code. When ownership changes, buildings must be
reinspected before city officials can resume the enforcement
process.
   Hahn said the 42-unit apartment building where the news
conference was held had changed hands eight times since 1984.
   ``These guys trade buildings like cards at a card game,'' Hahn
said. ``Clearly what they are doing is not normal business
practice.''
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for the tenants,
at least $1 million in civil penalties, and court orders to repair
buildings and to prohibit the lenders from continuing alleged
unfair banking practices.
   It involves the ownership of 11 apartment buildings and
residential hotels that house an estimated 1,450 people.
   The suit alleges that Highland Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association and A&amp;B Loan Co. arranged exorbitant loans for decrepit
buildings and extended credit to property owners with insufficient
financial resources.
   ``They lend to people who could never buy a house,'' said
Barrett Litt, a public interest attorney who joined Hahn and the
Legal Aid Foundation in filing the suit.
   Loans often were so huge that the revenues generated by tenants'
monthly rent went entirely for interest payments, and the mortgage
paid nothing toward the principal, Hahn said.
   However, Hahn did not paint the landlords as victims of the
lenders, but as their co-conspirators.
   ``Our evidence will show many instances of fraud and insider
dealing in transfers that were designed to falsely inflate the
value of property and subvert criminal prosecutions,'' Hahn said.
   Officials for the two loan companies did not immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   The lawsuit names 135 companies and individuals who allegedly
worked with the lenders by taking advantage of shell corporations
or shelters to borrow large amounts of money against the slum
buildings.
   The suit charges the defendants with unfair business practices
and alleges a number of violations committed against tenants,
including fraud, conspiracy, breaches of warranty and habitability
and failure to abate a nuisance.
   Deborah Dentler, a Legal Aid attorney, said tenants in most of
the targeted buildings pay $350 to $550 a month for one-room,
vermin-infested apartments.
   In one building, she said, toilets and showers were perpetually
clogged and there were no light bulbs in hallways. Tenants must
confront drug addicts, cockroaches crawling over their children,
mice and deteriorating plumbing fixtures, she said.

   The very wilderness that made Prince
William Sound a rich habitat for birds, marine mammals and fish is
hindering efforts to retrieve animals contaminated by the nation's
biggest oil spill.
   ``I don't want to encourage people by saying we're going out to
save all those birds,'' Pamela Bergmann, head of the U.S. Interior
Department's Regional Response Team, said Tuesday. ``It's just not
going to happen. It's even going to be tough to count the bodies.''
   A bird recovery center, set up shortly after Friday's
10.1-million gallon oil spill, had not seen a single bird by
Tuesday afternoon, Bergmann said.
   Bergmann said beaches in many places are too rough for rescuers
to land a boat, let alone chase down and capture oil-coated birds.
The oil is spreading southwestward away from Valdez, where cleanup
crews are based. In the hours it takes for a bird to be captured
and returned to Valdez, its chances of survival are greatly reduced.
   Even under favorable conditions, rescue officials figure they
are lucky if half the captured birds survive an oil spill. Alaska's
chilly waters are likely to drive down the survival rate as
oil-coated birds deprived of their insulating layer succumb to
hypothermia.
   ``Some will sink. They'll bash up against a cliff. Or eagles
will pray on them,'' Bergmann said. Toxins in the oil pose a threat
to the eagles and other predators, she said.
   A body count of dead birds is about all anyone can hope to
accomplish, said Jon Lyman, Alaska Department of Fish and Game
spokesman. That count stood at fewer than 100 Tuesday.
   Marine mammals such as sea otters also are at risk. At least two
dead otters have been spotted. A dozen killer whales were seen
surfacing in the slick during the weekend, but officials said the
oil does not pose as a great a danger to them.
   Rescue officials are discouraging volunteers, who usually are an
integral part of bird rescues in oil spills along more populated
coastlines. Not only is the terrain more rugged, but officials fear
volunteers might not be prepared for encounters with the bears that
prowl the sound's forested, uninhabited islands.
   Bergmann said she has had to tell would-be volunteers that there
is no place to stay in Valdez, no boats to take them out and little
they can do.
   Environmental groups are growing impatient with the situation.
   ``We have got to make the attempt _ not just sit here ...
twiddling thumbs,'' said Cindy Lowry, Alaska representative of
Greenpeace.

<HEAD>DA, Police Under Fire Over Dismissed Child Prostitution Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors and police came under sharp
criticism Tuesday following dismissal of criminal charges against a
mother and grandmother accused of forcing two young children into
prostitution.
   The case against Katherine Hubert, 29, of El Cerrito, and Glenda
Phillips, 48, of Concord, fell apart when Hubert's children
admitted they made up the story that has kept their mother in jail
since January 24.
   Hubert remains charged with a single count of felony child
endangerment. The dropped charges carried possible prison terms of
more than 400 years.
   Hubert's 12-year-old daughter had claimed she was forced to have
sex more than 100 times with men, while her 9-year-old brother
alleged he was made to perform more than 60 sexual acts with women.
   Municipal Court Judge Bessie Dreibelbis agreed to drop 58 of 59
criminal counts against Hubert and also dismissed the single
pandering charge against Phillips.
   Public Defender Oscar Bobrow said refusal of the District
Attorney's Office to drop the remaining count was ``outrageous''
and ``irresponsible.''
   ``What's going on is (the District Attorney's Office) is losing
face,'' Bobrow said following Monday's decision. ``They need
something to hold onto.''
   Bobrow criticized the prosecutor's office for filing unsupported
charges and the Police Department for making several arrests in
connection with the case.
   However, Deputy District Attorney Pat Sepulveda said the one
remaining charge of child endangerment is not related to the
prostitution allegations and is based on evidence of parental
neglect and lack of supervision. The children have been in foster
homes since May.
   Hubert was released from jail Monday night after she posted
$3,000 bail. A hearing on the lone charge is scheduled for
Wednesday.
   ``While the tremendous inconvenience to all parties caused by
these allegations is regrettable, justice has been served by the
early resolution of this case,'' said District Attorney Gary Yancey
in a prepared statement.
   Yancey said the children had lied to prevent their mother from
gaining custody of their two younger sisters, ages 2 and 4. The
children's guardian told prosecutors last weekend that the children
admitted concocting the prostitution story.
   When the charges were filed, both children had given consistent
accounts in separate interviews, one of the suspects had confessed
to a molestation and medical evidence indicated they had been
sexually abused, said Sepulveda.
   Charges against several people accused of being customers have
been or will be dropped or re-evaluated, Sepulveda said. One man,
who had spent almost two months in jail, was released Friday,
prosecutors said.
   Police Lt. Ray Howard defended the department's handling of the
case.
   ``You cannot go into a crime investigation of this nature
feeling the victims are lying to you,'' Howard said. ``That belief,
coupled with the fact that we do have evidence that some sexual
trauma did occur, led us to make the investigation.''
   Bobrow said Hubert was delighted at the developments and that
she had always contended the allegations were false.

<HEAD>Writer, Critic Malcolm Cowley Dead At 90</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writer and literary critic Malcolm
Cowley, who was one of the post-World War I ``Lost Generation''
authors that included Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald,
died Tuesday at age 90.
   Cowley suffered what appeared to be a heart attack Tuesday
morning at his home in nearby Sherman, said his nurse, Rhoda
Joyner. He was taken to New Milford Hospital, where he died, said
hospital spokeswoman Shirley Fredlund.
   Cowley, a former editor at the New Republic, belonged to the
group of American expatriates in Paris _ including Hemingway,
Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound _ that Gertrude Stein dubbed the ``Lost
Generation'' in the 1920s.
   He is credited with being among the first to recognize the
brilliance of those writers and with rescuing writer William
Faulkner from obscurity.
   ``Cowley was a living bridge, both in his genial person and his
engaging, shrewd criticism, with the generation that were young in
the 20s,'' author John Updike said in a statement from his
publisher, Alfred A. Knopf in New York.
   ``His reactions to and perceptions of Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Faulkner and (John) Dos Passos are invaluable,'' Updike said. ``He
was an energetic and gregarious man who lived the life of the mind
with gusto and good nature.''
   Born on Aug. 24, 1898 in Belsano, Pa., Cowley attended Harvard
University from 1915 to 1917, when he joined the American Ambulance
Service in France. He re-enrolled in Harvard in 1918 and graduated
cum laude in 1920.
   While a student, he began contributing book reviews to the New
Republic and Dial magazines.
   After graduation he spent much of his time writing free-lance
magazine pieces.
   Cowley won a fellowship to study French literature in 1921-22
and again the following year in France, allowing him to hobnob with
America's young expatriate writers. He returned to the United
States in 1923.
   At the encouragement of his friend Hart Crane, he compiled a
book of his poems. The book, ``Blue Juniata,'' published in 1929,
was enthusiastically received.
   Nineteen other poems dealing with his alienated generation were
later collected in ``The Dry Season,'' published in 1941.
   In 1929, Cowley became literary editor of the New Republic.
Among those he encouraged as writers was John Cheever.
   While at the New Republic, Cowley published the book for which
he was best known, ``Exile's Return: A Narrative of Ideas'' in
1934. The book dealt with writers of the 1920s who tried to pursue
alternative lifestyles in Paris and Greenwich Village.
   Some consider his most valuable contribution to be his editing
of ``The Portable Faulkner'' in 1945, which saved Faulkner from
obscurity.
   ``He did that at a time when Faulkner's books were still not
selling,'' said Cleanth Brooks, professor emeritus of rhetoric at
Yale University and an eminent Faulkner scholar. ``I date Cowley's
`Portable Faulker' and Robert Penn Warren's review on `The Portable
Faulkner' as the things that really brought Faulker into
prominence. After that very shortly came the Nobel prize'' for
Faulkner.
   In 1956, he published his 18-year correspondence with Faulkner.
In 1967, he produced a collection of his essays and reviews from
the New Republic and other periodicals. He published a ``A Second
Flowering: Works and Days of the Lost Generation,'' in 1973.
   Cowley is survived by his wife, Muriel; one son, Robert, of New
York; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Funeral
arrangements were not immediately available.

   Convicted killer Roy Allen Harich won a
24-hour reprieve Tuesday in his battle to avoid execution for the
1981 murder of a hitchhiker near Daytona Beach.
   The state Supreme Court scheduled a hearing for 9 a.m. Thursday,
two hours after Harich had been scheduled to die for the murder of
Carlene Gayle Kelly.
   Corrections officials rescheduled the execution for Friday
morning in the electric chair at Florida State Prison near Starke.
   Harich, 30, turned to the Supreme Court after losing an appeal
in state court. Florida's highest courd could issue another stay or
let the execution proceed.
   Harich was convicted of shooting Miss Kelly and a friend,
Deborah Miller, in the back of the head and slashing their throats.
Miss Kelley died, but Miss Miller, who had been left for dead,
crawled to a road and was helped by a passing motorist.
   According to court records, Harich picked up Miss Kelly and Miss
Miller, who were on their way to the boardwalk in Daytona Beach, in
his van. They drove around town smoking some marijuana the girls
had.
   They went to a wooded area where Harich was growing some pot and
after about an hour, Miss Miller asked to leave.
   According to the records, the three drove only a few yards when
Harich ordered the girls from his van and told them to disrobe,
forced Miss Kelly to perform a sexual act then shot them and
slashed their throats.
   Harich also was sentenced to 30 years for attempted murder, and
30 years each on two kidnapping counts.

   At least 15 people were killed as
Filipinos chose village leaders Tuesday. The government hailed the
voting as the final step in restoring democracy three years after
the Marcos era ended.
   The military claimed communist rebels would use the elections to
expand their control in rural areas by pressuring voters into
endorsing pro-guerrilla candidates.
   Election officials said it would take days or weeks to assess
the extent of rebel influence on the balloting.
   Voters in more than 41,000 villages and urban wards chose about
287,567 council members from more than 860,000 candidates. It
marked the fourth nationwide balloting since President Corazon
Aquino took power three years ago and Ferdinand Marcos, the
president for 20 years, fled into Hawaiian exile.
   Scattered violence, but no major incidents were reported.
   The military said gunmen killed one person and wounded three as
they went to a polling station in Tupi in South Cotabato province
on Mindanao island.
   Also in Mindanao, two gunmen killed a candidate Sunday in Tubura
in Bukidnon province and then were themselves killed by lawmen,
reports said.
   Other killings occurred in Luzon island, Samar island and Aklan
province.
   A candidate died Monday when a truck ran over him while he was
supervising a road repair project in Marbel in Northern Cotabato, a
military report said.
   The elections were non-partisan. But political analysts said the
outcome will influence national politics by enabling political
factions to establish grass-roots organizations prior to the 1992
presidential election.
   Col. Gerardo Flores, intelligence chief of the Philippine
Constabulary, said communist rebels were backing candidates in
hopes of capturing 60 percent of the council seats in areas under
their control.
   The rebels claim to control about 8,500 villages nationwide and
to operate in 3,500 more. The Commission on Election estimates the
rebels control about 2,800 villages and urban wards. The difference
is believed to lie in defining ``control.''
   Tuesday's elections are the last scheduled before the 1992
presidential vote.
   Voters ratified a new constitution in February 1987, selected
members of a two-chamber Congress the following May and chose
provincial officials, mayors and city council members in January
1988.

   A judge Tuesday disqualified the San Diego Yacht
Club as the winner in last year's America's Cup challenge and
awarded the international sailing trophy to the defeated New
Zealand club.
   State Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick said San Diego
``violated the spirit'' of the race by using a 60-foot catamaran to
defend against the Mercury Bay Boating Club's single-hulled yacht,
which is about 90 feet at the water line.
   San Diego's catamaran is the ``Stars and Stripes,'' a
multi-hulled boat that is lighter, faster and more maneuverable
than the ``New Zealand.''
   Skippered by Dennis Conner, the San Diego crew sailed to easy
victory over the Mercury Bay club in waters off San Diego last
September.
   Calling the contest a ``gross mismatch,'' the judge ordered the
138-year-old silver cup turned over to the New Zealanders.
   Patrick Goddard, commodore of the San Diego club, said a
decision on whether to file an appeal will be made in the next
several days after the boards of the San Diego Yacht Club and its
event organizer, the America's Cup Organizing Committee, are
briefed by attorneys.
   Until that decision is made, the Cup will remain with the yacht
club, Goddard said.
   The leader of the New Zealand syndicate, Michael Fay, expressed
no surprise at the decision.
   ``It had to come sooner or later,'' he said from Wellington, New
Zealand. ``We were always strong in our belief in what the Cup
meant and I think the Cup has come through.''
   Fay said the America's Cup itself was the real winner and the
ruling would be good for the integrity of the event.
   In her 14-page decision, the judge said: ``The court is mindful
that forfeiture is a drastic remedy in the instance of a
competition such as the America's Cup, with its large economic
significance and prestige.
   ``Nonetheless, the parties neither seek or suggest any
alternative relief upon the disqualification of a competitor, nor
is any alternative relief feasible under the circumstances.''
   The judge said the 102-year-old Deed of Gift which governs the
race does not specify the size a boat must be or the number of
hulls it must have.
   But, she said, ``the conclusion is inescapable'' that George
Schuyler, who established the race, ``contemplated the defending
vessel to relate in some way to the specifications of the
challenger.''
   Therefore, Ciparick said, ``it is clear that a catamaran may not
defend an America's Cup competition against a monohull.''
   The cup was first won in 1851 by the yacht ``America'' in a race
against several boats of the Royal Yacht Club in England. In 1857,
the ``America'' syndicate deeded the cup to the New York Yacht Club
with a trust document establishing the competition and its terms.
The deed was revised by Schuyler in 1882 and again in 1887.
   The New York group kept the cup for 131 years before losing it
to the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia in 1983 at Newport. R.I.
   The San Diego club, led by Conner, won the America's cup in 1987
in Australia from the Perth group.
   The Mercury Bay group of Auckland, New Zealand, led by Fay,
first came to court in July 1987, arguing it should be allowed to
challenge San Diego in a one-on-one race for the Cup in a boat
larger than the 12-meter yacht that had been used in America's Cup
contests since 1956.
   The judge agreed on Dec. 21, 1987, and ordered San Diego to
defend the cup against New Zealand. San Diego was to use the
12-meter boat, which runs about 45 feet at the waterline.
   But Conner instead decided to use a catamaran. Fay asked the
judge to find San Diego in contempt for preparing to sail such a
vessel but she refused to bar the catamaran's use.
   After losing the San Diego race, Fay asked Ciparick to void the
result.
   In awarding the cup to the New Zealanders, the judge wrote:
   ``It is hoped that further defender-trustees will place the
interests of the Cup and its spirit in a paramount position,'' she
wrote. ``The court urges Mercury Bay to fulfill its obligations as
trustee in the spirit of friendly competition that George L.
Schuyler intended.''
   Fay said talks would be held with the challenger of record, the
Royal Perth Yacht Club. He said he expected challengers to gather
in Auckland, New Zealand, in early 1991, with the finals in April.
   While pleased with court judgment, Fay said he was still
disappointed his boat did not win in the water.
   ``That was the disappointment _ that we could never get that to
happen. San Diego went off on a tangent, if you can call it that,
and even when we asked them to delay the race they didn't seem to
want to play the game,'' he said.

   A woman prepared to cut her son's
life-support system after a judge ruled Tuesday that an assailant
who may face murder charges if the youth dies did not have the
right to stop her.
   Sylvia Lane, mother of victim Mark Weaver, said her son had no
wish to be kept alive artificially, and she would remove his
feeding tube on Thursday.
   Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for stabbing Weaver
in 1985, had gone to court to keep Weaver alive because Pagan could
be charged with murder if the victim dies.
   ``I don't know how any judge could not have ruled in our
favor,'' Ms. Lane said. ``I don't see how he could have any right
to decide what happens to the victim of his crime.''
   Pagan currently is on probation while serving a suspended
sentence for the attack.
   The state attorney general's office said it will not decide
whether to file charges until after the death.
   ``Until there's a death, there's no cause of death,'' spokesman
David Cheever said Tuesday.
   Robert Mullen, Pagan's attorney, said his client had agreed
``that it was not in anybody's interest, certainly not in the
family's interest and not in Mark Weaver's interest'' to appeal the
ruling.
   Probate Judge Dana Childs said Pagan's interest in preventing
Weaver's death ``has nothing to do with the purposes of this
proceeding.''
   Mullen said he met Monday with prosecutors to try to talk them
out of filing additional charges.
   Pagan, 29, stabbed Weaver, 26, on a Lewiston street in 1985, and
the victim lapsed into a coma when his neck wounds prevented oxygen
from reaching his brain.
   Weaver, who doctors say is in a ``permanent vegetative state,''
has been under his mother's care at her Portland home.
   Childs said Feb. 27 that Ms. Lane was within her rights in
removing her son from life support. Ms. Childs said at the time
that she would do so on Thursday.

<HEAD>Roh Orders Major Shake-up Of Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo ordered a major
shake-up involving 49 senior generals after military hardliners
criticized his failure to suppress dissidents, officials and news
reports said Wednesday.
   Roh was reported replacing several right-wing hardliners in key
security posts with generals loyal to him. Many senior commanders
being retired or transferred to lesser posts were allies of former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, who refused to be identified in
keeping with official practice, said a major shuffle was ordered in
the army's high command. He would not elaborate, but details
appeared in all Seoul newspapers Tuesday.
   The shake-up had been expected next month. It follows reports
that hardliners in the government and military were unhappy with
what they saw as Roh's failure to curb anti-government radicals and
his efforts to build ties with communist nations.
   A further shakeup of divisional commanders was expected to be
announced in the coming weeks.
   Opposition parties said Tuesday the realignment was needed to
prevent military meddling in politics. The army has been a major
force in South Korean politics and twice seized power in the
nation's 40-year history.
   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in December
1987, has tried to pursue a moderate policy and portray himself as
a populist. But the government has not won the broad support Roh
sought.
   Ministry officials said spring changes in the army high command
were normal, but the number of posts said to be involved was much
larger than in routine shuffles.
   Indications of hardliner unhappiness with Roh had been
increasing. Administration Minister Kim Yong-kap quit the Cabinet
this month after attacking the government for not suppressing
dissidents and radical students.
   Last week, the commandant of the South Korean Military Academy,
Lt. Gen. Min Byong-don, failed to salute Roh at graduation
ceremonies and made a speech criticizing government efforts to
establish ties with communist nations.
   Roh wants to ease the confrontation with communist North Korea
by building relations with its allies.
   This week, senior generals issued an unprecedented statement
demanding that leading dissident Moon Ik-hwan be punished for
illegally visiting North Korea. Moon reportedly met Monday with
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to discuss reuniting the Korean
peninsula, divided after World War II.
   The two Koreas are bitter rivals, and Kim ordered the 1950
invasion that started the Korean War. The Seoul government said
Moon was trying to undermine its authority and warned he would be
arrested if he returned home.
   The government is reportedly split between hardliners demanding
a harsh crackdown on dissidents and moderates loyal to Roh who
favor pragmatic and conciliatory policies.
   Chun, Roh and other senior generals took power with military
backing in 1980. Chun and Roh were close allies, but then Roh
distanced himself from Chun's authoritarian rule in 1987.
   The reports said:
   _Lt. Gen. Koo Chang-Hwae, called a Roh loyalist, will be
appointed commander of the important Capital Garrison Command,
responsible for military security in Seoul. He will replace Lt.
Gen. Kim Jin-young, identified as a Chun loyalist, who will be
moved to Army Combat School.
   _Lt. Gen. Min, head of the military academy who criticized Roh,
would be retired.
   _Lt. Gen. Na Jung-bae will be named deputy commander of the
Korean-U.S. Combined Forces Command, which oversees most South
Korean troops and the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. A
U.S. general heads the command.
   _Lt. Gen. Lee Chin-sam will be named head of the 1st Army, a
major combat command.
   _Roh loyalist Maj. Gen. Cho Nam-pung will be promoted to
lieutenant general and kept on as head of military intelligence,
the Defense Security Command.

   Members of a U.S. church group said Tuesday they
were lucky to escape alive from a machete-wielding, rock-throwing
Haitian mob that rushed their pickup truck on a crowded street near
Port-au-Prince.
   ``It's a miracle we got out,'' said Roger Mercer, a member of
the Free Methodist Church in Alpena, Mich., who drove the truck.
``It was obvious to me it was a planned attack because of the way
they were prepared for us.''
   The 12 members of the church group involved in the Sunday night
incident, all from northern Michigan except for one Floridian,
arrived at Miami International Airport on Tuesday night.
   Mercer, whose left eye was swollen shut and whose head and left
foot were bandaged, rolled off the plane in a wheelchair. He said
his brother-in-law, John Freel, who was in the passenger side of
the pickup, was shot in the arm; Louis Haber, of Zephyrhills, Fla.,
was knocked unconscious by a rock, and others were hit by rocks but
not seriously injured. Their vehicle was demolished, he said.
   The Americans were treated at the St. Croix Hospital in Leogane,
a small town 18 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince.
   The Rev. Abner Rabouin, a Haitian minister of the Free Methodist
Church, said earlier in Haiti that the the truck struck two
Haitians as it tried to maneuver through a crowd of about 1,000
revelers at a Lenten celebration.
   The minister said a rumor passed through the crowd that the
truck was running down Haitians, provoking the mob attack. Rabouin
said two Haitians hit by the truck suffered broken legs.
   Mercer gave a harrowing account of the attack, which came
shortly after the group left a celebration at another town and were
headed to Gurim, where the members were helping build a church.
   The truck was inching through a huge crowd of revelers in the
road when some men broke the truck's mirrors, pounded on the hood
and started throwing rocks at them, Mercer said. ``At that point, I
knew I was in trouble,'' he said.
   Mercer said another man was ready to heave a huge rock at the
truck when he started to drive at him.
   ``My objective was to get him off balance and it did just that.
... I had no intention of hitting him,' he said, adding that he
wasn't sure if he struck the man.
   When he tried to accelerate and escape, Mercer said, another
truck came from behind and cut off the church group's vehicle.
   ``I rammed the truck from the rear, spun him around and kept on
going,'' he recalled.
   But another crowd of revelers ahead slowed the truck and the
attack continued. ``These machetes nearly carved the door off,''
Mercer said of the hour-long attack. ``They were saying we were
killers.''
   ``There were many angels there to protect them,'' Rabouin said.
``Otherwise, they would have been killed.''
   Elmore L. Clyde, director of the Free Methodist Church's world
missions headquartered at Winona Lake, Ind., said the group was on
a two-week trip to build a church in Leogane.
   According to Clyde, the Americans had gone to an Easter service
at another town and were returning to Leogane when the attack
occurred.
   Rabouin said Haitians in a car that preceded the Americans'
truck spread the rumor that the truck was deliberately running down
people.
   He called the rumor baseless and said the Americans ``did
everything they could to avoid hitting anyone.''
   He dismissed as ``abolutely untrue'' a report that occupants of
the truck had pulled out revolvers and fired in the air.
   Rabouin said it took about two hours for the truck to arrive at
a military outpost, where the mob dispersed when a soldier fired
into the air.
   The Free Methodist Church has operated a mission in Haiti since
1964 and has built 30 churches in the impoverished Caribbean nation.

   Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, who made the
traditionally money-losing Olympics profitable, is discussing a
purchase of strikebound Eastern Airlines, sources said.
   Another well-known figure, former Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, is being mentioned as a candidate for the airline's
bankruptcy examiner.
   News of Ueberroth's interest came as takeover specialist Carl C.
Icahn was reportedly resuming talks with Eastern's unions about a
possible takeover.
   A federal judge in Miami, meanwhile, scheduled a hearing for
Thursday on Eastern's efforts to force its rebellious pilots back
to work. The pilots' support for the Machinists' strike that began
March 4 virtually grounded Miami-based Eastern and forced it to
seek bankruptcy protection five days later.

   Moscow's mayor, its No. 2 Communist Party leader, five regional
party chairmen in the Ukraine and the party chiefs in Leningrad and
Kiev were all rejected Sunday in contested races for the new
Congress of People's Deputies.
   In addition, a non-voting member of the ruling party Politburo,
Yuri Solovyev, was defeated in Leningrad even though he had run
unopposed, officials at the Central Election Commission in Moscow
said.
   Enough voters crossed Solovyev's name off the ballots to deny
the regional party chief the required majority, forcing a runoff.

   Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn
curfew in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians angered by encroachments on
their autonomy battled police in the worst violence in the southern
province since 1981.
   State-run news media said two policemen were shot and killed
Monday in two of the seven Kosovo towns where violent protests were
reported. Reports that two demonstrators also were killed could not
be confirmed.
   Authorities ordered a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., banned any
gathering of more than three people and shut down schools, the
university, theaters and sports stadiums indefinitely, the official
Tanjug news agency reported.
   The protests began Thursday after Kosovo's Parliament approved
constitutional amendments that gave Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
republic, control of Kosovo's police, courts and civil defense.

   The Federal Reserve is likely to pause
momentarily in its credit-tightening efforts but the interest rate
relief will only be temporary, many economists believe.
   These analysts are forecasting that a variety of rates, from
banks' prime lending rate to home mortgage rates, will head higher
in the months ahead with the only debate being over whether the
central bank's anti-inflation campaign will wind up pushing the
country into a recession.
   Fed policy-makers were meeting today behind closed doors to
review monetary targets. The 12-member Federal Open Market
Committee, composed of members of the Fed board and regional Fed
bank presidents, meets eight times a year to set interest rate and
money growth policies.
   Today's session is an anniversary of sorts. It was at the March
meeting one year ago that the central bank decided to launch a
gradual effort to drive short-term interest rates higher in an
effort to keep the economy from overheating.

   A fallout shelter may protect you from a
nuclear attack but it can't double as a tax shelter.
   The Internal Revenue Service has a plan for staying in business
in case the bomb drops, and the top priority would be collecting
those taxes that would produce the most revenue. The agency does
acknowledge that a nuclear attack likely would cause collections to
suffer.
   Outlines of the plan were published in response to a directive
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to most government
departments. The plan, dated Dec. 14, 1988, was buried in the
Internal Revenue Manual, a voluminous document that guides IRS
employees through every challenge from auditing a church to
handling a menacing telephone caller.
   ``In the event of a national emergency (especially resulting
from nuclear attack) the primary function of the Service is to
support the secretary of the Treasury,'' the manual states. ``This
support as a minimum will consist of analyzing and reporting upon
emergency tax legislation, prescribing regulations and forms,
issuing rulings and technical information of an emergency nature.''

   Before ordering a 25-year prison term and restitution of $26

   Once Italian filmmakers dominated the world's
screens. Stars like Sophia Loren and Anna Magnani set hearts
throbbing or tears flowing. Then came a rapid decline and the
Italian movie industry hit bottom. There are signs of a
renaissance, however. Here is a report.

   In the dusty square, a crowd of villagers stares
wistfully at the movie palace that once brought them love and
death. Its sign is chipped, its facade blackened, its windows
smashed like broken teeth.
   Suddenly, a demolition expert presses a switch and the theater
explodes in a cloud of dust, to make room for a parking lot.
   The scene, from the recent film ``New Paradise Cinema'' by
Giuseppe Tornatore, is intended to symbolize the death of Italy's
once highly acclaimed cinema.
   The image reflects the grim reality Italian cinema has faced for
more than a decade: shrinking audiences, shuttered theaters, a drop
in quality. But although Italian filmmaking remains troubled,
recent signs indicate that reports of its death may be exaggerated.
   ``The Italian cinema in the past two years has had a small
recovery,'' says Carmine Cianfarani, president of the Italian
Motion Picture Association. ``We have huge possibilities, at least
on paper.''
   For years, Italians set the pace for moviemakers around the
world. Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica captured the
brutality of life in neo-realist films like ``Open City'' and
``Bicycle Thief.'' The 1960s brought the fantasy and metaphor of
Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini.
   No one is predicting a quick return to those glory days. But
movie production is up for the third straight year after hitting an
all-time low in 1985. And well-known directors who had to scramble
for financing are now being courted at home.
   ``1989 began in a positive way,'' Cianfarani said. ``All the
major directors are at work, from Fellini to (Ettore) Scola, from
Sergio Leone to the Taviani brothers, from Lina Wertmuller to
(Marco) Bellocchio.''
   In addition to the masters, a younger generation of filmmakers
is beginning to emerge after a long period in which Italy's
directors were turning steadily grayer.
   The reason for the flurry of activity is money, coming from a
host of television stations competing fiercely for the Italian
audience and hungry for films.
   ``The possibilities have opened up incredibly with television,''
said Cristina Comencini, 35, a slender, ginger-haired director. The
daughter of well-known director Luigi Comencini, she recently made
her own debut with an acclaimed film, ``The Zoo.''
   ``There's a bigger circulation of money,'' she said. ``This has
allowed many young people to make their first film.''
   But television is also seen as a mixed blessing. Many people
fear its influence is lowering film quality. And television is
considered the main culprit in the collapse in movie attendance.
   ``Television in Italy is destroying the cinema,'' declares Lino
Micciche, a prominent film critic. ``In the mid-70s, we sold 500
million tickets. Now we're under 100 million. ... That's not a
decrease, it's a disaster.''
   For most of this century the cinema was a focal point of life in
Italian cities and villages. Italians grew up laughing with the
comedian Toto, crying with Anna Magnani, lusting after Sophia
Loren, and being outraged by films like ``La Dolce Vita'' that
portrayed the emptiness of their society.
   This love of ``spettacolo'' (spectacle) gave Italy the highest
per-capita movie attendance in the West and the biggest production
of films after the United States.
   But all that changed after Italy's Constitutional Court
deregulated television in 1976. Almost overnight, new stations
popped up all over the country. Television went from showing two
movies a week in 1976 to a bewildering total of 2,000.
   ``Our theaters have been emptied, because the public could see
too many films free at home, above all Italian ones,'' complains
Silvio Clementelli, head of the national producers' association.
   The television explosion crippled an industry already hurting
from the withdrawal of U.S. producers, who had flocked to Italy in
the 1960s to take advantage of special financial laws and produced
blockbusters like ``Ben Hur'' and ``Cleopatra.''
   With the financial squeeze, production began to center on easy
comedies, pseudo-American adventures and a handful of proven stars
like Marcello Mastroianni or Ornella Muti. Many films were pushed
out of theaters by technically superior American movies with big
promotion budgets.
   ``In Italy, you see very little Italian film,'' said Luigi
Filippi, a spokesman for the Italian General Association of
Entertainment.
   The economic situation was so grim that Bernardo Bertolucci had
to find a foreign producer and capital to make his Oscar-winning
``The Last Emperor,'' which was filmed in English in China.
   But if television has caused a crisis, it is providing some
compensation. Competing stations _ particularly the state-run RAI
and magnate Silvio Berlusconi's three commercial networks _ are now
paying top dollar for the rights to films, and often adding another
chunk for a share of box-office profits.
   One of the trickle-down effects of their investment is growing
attention to new filmmakers.
   ``In the past year, we have begun to talk about the so-called
young Italian cinema,'' said Micciche. ``We are discovering that
young people's films do exist.''
   Indeed, in recent months three major films by new directors have
come out _ ``It's Happening Tomorrow,'' by Daniele Luchetti;
Massimo Guglielmi's ``Rebus,'' featuring Charlotte Rampling; and
``Mignon Has Come to Stay,'' by 28-year-old Francesca Archibugi,
who gave birth to her first baby on the set.
   Other beginners like Comencini and Tornatore (``New Paradise
Cinema'') are also winning acclaim, even though their films are
less widely distributed.
   The road is still long for relatively unknown directors. Many
have trouble getting their films into one of the dwindling number
of theaters. And with filmmaking depressed in recent years, few
bankable young stars have developed.
   ``There aren't any more Sophia Lorens,'' said Comencini. ``All
the great actors are of the older generation.''
   Some observers say young directors also lack the inspiration
provided by the idealistic postwar period or the 1960s.
   ``This moment in Italy is one of passage,'' says Micciche. ``The
young generation is unable to find new truths, new ideals, because
the society doesn't know what they are. We are so cynical.''
   While it has provided new opportunity, the flood of television
money may have drawbacks. Some directors are abandoning sweeping
panoramas, complicated plots and other things that don't adapt
easily to television.
   Despite the problems, producers and directors are hopeful that
the small upturn will continue.
   ``Cinema may never be popular mass entertainment again. That's
what television is,'' said Comencini.
   ``But it's still an area where you can create new things,
different things.''

   When Royal Viking's new luxury liner sailed
under the Golden Gate Bridge at the beginning of a recent
television news report, it was the end of a successful promotional
journey for the cruise lines' publicist.
   The segment _ shown on stations from San Diego to Boston in
January _ was shot, edited and transmitted not by news crews, but
by a video public relations agency.
   ``If we do it right it looks like their own tape,'' said Gail
Cottman, whose Pro Video News Service produced the clip. Her
$10,000 fee included contacting more than 100 television news
outlets, distributing the piece via satellite and making follow-up
calls to see where it was broadcast.
   Parts of the story, including the ship's christening and an
on-board interview with actor Jimmy Stewart, screened on
Entertainment Tonight and CNN. It was retransmitted to more than
500 local stations that take newsfeeds from ABC, CNN or Group W,
Pro Video reported.
   As television news expands, more public relations agencies are
moving past typewritten press releases and still photos. They
target TV newsrooms with videocassette news releases and
promotional tape available via satellite.
   ``The most interesting things I see companies doing is putting
up satellite feeds on the day of an event. They put it up there for
people to grab,'' said CBS news West Coast bureau manager Jennifer
Siebens.
   When Honda offered visuals of its first U.S.-manufactured cars
being shipped to Japan from Portland, Ore., Ms. Siebens passed up
the reverse-import story. ``If we took their feed we would be
conceding total control of the story to the subject of the story,''
she said.
   Such ethical concerns divide news directors. Some argue against
ever using promotional clips within newscasts. Others use them, but
identify who supplied them. And still others broadcast the clips on
newscasts without any hint to viewers as to who supplied them.
   ``There is absolutely no consensus among our members,'' said
Ernie Schultz, president of the Radio-Television News Directors
Association in Washington, D.C. ``We've got 1,200 news directors
and 1,200 positions. Everybody is different.''
   ``We believe that if we do a story the viewer should be
confident that whatever he's seeing is 100 percent CBS news, that
we have been there as an independent set of eyes on the story,''
said Ms. Siebens.
   Sometimes news directors have little choice. A few months ago
CBS and other networks showed Drexel Burnham Lambert chief
executive Frederick H. Joseph reacting to the firm's settlement of
alleged federal securities-law violation.
   But Joseph wasn't interviewed or taped by news staffers.
Instead, his comments were issued as a video press release in the
late afternoon by Drexel. CBS noted the source when it broadcast
the edited tape.
   Ms. Siebens said CBS identifies publicity videos for viewers,
such as file footage of a factory assembly line. CBS newsfeeds
likewise identify sources for the local stations receiving them,
but Ms. Siebens doesn't know if stations pass the identifications
along to viewers.
   Radio-Television News Directors Association ethics don't require
newscasters to mention if the tapes were supplied by the subject
being mentioned, only that stations don't pass off tapes as their
own.
   ``We are not prepared to say that every time that you put
something on the air that you have not originated that you have to
name the source,'' said Schultz. ``The strength of our position is
that every editor uses his or her own judgment.''
   But broadcasting client-supported videos on news shows blurs the
line between publicity and news, critics contend. Publicity videos
allow companies to put their best visual foot forward, avoid
questions from probing reporters and promote story angles favorable
to their products.
   ``If they try to push anything corporate or push a product,
we're not going to take it,'' said Jake Wirtshafter, a news
assistant with ABC network news in Los Angeles, who fields
publicists' messages. He said they ``are lucky to get three items a
month on one of our (network) feeds.''
   ``A reporter can take information from a public relations piece
and sort it out,'' said Wirtshafter. ``But once we put it up we
can't do that. If we show something that makes their client look
good we can't balance it out.''
   Cottman averages two client-supported releases a week. She
produces both video news releases with narration that stations can
air as their own, as well as news tapes without sound for which
stations can provide their own narration from information provided
by Pro Video.
   ``In five minutes (of tape) the station gets everything it
needs,'' said Cottman. ``They can deal with the story as they
choose to show it.''

   Roman Catholicism is spreading across Africa and
African influence is spreading in the church. As Pope John Paul II
prepares for yet another voyage to the continent, he faces special
challenges in melding the fundamental tenets of his church and the
unique culture of the African.

   ``Yesterday the missionaries Christianized
Africa, today the blacks are Africanizing Christianity.'' _
Cardinal Joseph Malula of Zaire.
   When Pope John Paul II makes his fifth journey to Africa April
28-May 6, he will address a Roman Catholic flock that has grown by
22 million since his first trip in 1980.
   The pope's four-stop trip _ Madagascar, the French territory
Reunion in the Mascarene Islands, Zambia and Malawi _ dramatizes
his resolve to stimulate the fastest growing segment of his church.
   From a tiny European missionary movement a century ago, the
Catholic Church in Africa has become a powerful indigenous
institution of 75 million adherents. The Vatican expects their
numbers will increase to 100 million by the year 2,000.
   ``It is safe to say that in no other continent during the last
50 years has Christianity shown so much growth and diversity, such
a cheerful but perplexing flood of people confidently doing their
own thing, often in seemingly strange and contradictory ways,''
wrote Adrian Hastings in his book ``African Christianity.''
   The church's influence, extending far beyond the number of its
followers, is especially felt in education. Many of today's African
leaders are products of missionary schools, including the
Jesuit-educated Robert Mugabe, the Marxist president of Zimbabwe.
   Africans also play an increasingly influential role at the
Vatican, underlined by the growth in the number of African
cardinals from one to 17 in the past 30 years. Two of the cardinals
are based in Rome, including Bernardin Gantin of Benin, head of the
powerful Congregation of Bishops.
   African prelates have also made their presence felt in worldwide
church affairs. At the 1987 synod of bishops in Rome on the role of
the laity, African bishops led the way in blocking proposals by
U.S. bishops to allow women to serve in non-ordained ministries.
   But the African church also faces special problems, namely in
trying to adapt African traditions to a faith imported from Europe
while upholding its laws on polygamy, superstition and priestly
celibacy.
   The African church is also increasingly worried about the spread
of Islamic fundamentalism in countries such as Sudan and Nigeria.
   Other church-state difficulties include conflict with the
Marxist government in Mozambique and tensions with South Africa
over apartheid, which the Vatican recently called the most
systematic form of racism in the world.
   ``In spite of the problems, Africa appears as a source of joyful
hope for the church,'' the Vatican missionary agency's information
bulletin said in its 1988 review of missionary activity around the
world.
   That assessment is certainly shared by the pope, who visited 20
countries during his African pilgrimages in 1980, 1982, 1985 and
1988.
   In January, John Paul announced a special synod of Africa's 480
bishops to discuss various issues facing the church, saying he
hoped the assembly would further bolster the faith of ``those
beloved people to whom I feel so close.'' The date and site of the
synod have not yet been fixed.
   In another sign of the church's expanding presence in Africa,
the Ivory Coast is building a huge basilica, only slightly smaller
than St. Peter's in Rome, at a cost of at least $130 million.
Vatican officials, however, say the pope has no plans to attend its
inauguration later this year. Some have interpreted this as a show
of disapproval of a display of opulence.
   A dominant issue for the church has been the process of
``Africanization,'' incorporating traditional African customs and
culture in church services, liturgy, teaching, theology, music and
art.
   This movement grew out of the reforms of the Second Vatican
Council in 1962-65 and drew inspiration from the encyclical ``On
the Evangelization of Peoples'' by Pope Paul VI, who made the first
papal visit to Africa in 1969.
   The missionaries who evangelized Africa provided churches,
schools and hospitals but they often showed disdain for African
culture.
   Vatican officials say the church in recent years has gone a long
way in adopting the use of tribal drums, native dance, music and
the vernacular liturgy.
   The pope has frequently encouraged the trend but stressed that
the basic foundations of faith and teaching cannot be compromised.
   ``You are certainly aware of a danger: that of allowing the
growth of a philosophy and a theology of `Africanism' that would be
exclusively of native origin and lacking any real and profound
connection with Christ,'' he told visiting bishops from Zaire in
1983.
   One persistent problem has been polygamy, a practice outlawed by
the church but still common in much of Africa. During the pope's
tour of southern Africa last September, he lectured the 20-year-old
king of Swaziland and his four wives that family stability is based
on monogamy.

   The church has also been hard pressed to interpret the
relationship between superstition and religion in a continent where
some church ministers have been accused of practicing witchcraft
and voodoo.
   The primate of Zambia, Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, was recalled
to Rome in 1982 because of his faith-healing practices. He was
relieved of his position in Zambia and assigned to a low-ranking
Roman Curia post.
   According to the latest church statistics, Africa has the
highest number of catechists, religion teachers, in the world,
216,000. But it has only 18,000 priests, less than 8 percent of the
total in Europe.
   Officials say the shortage of priests is partly due to the
church's insistence on celibacy, which runs contrary to the stress
on family and children in African culture.
   To illustrate the dilemma, a Vatican official recounted how an
African cardinal was scolded by Rome for proposing three candidates
for bishop, all of whom had fathered children. The cardinal wrote
back to the Vatican: ``Finding angels is your job.''
   On a political level, the role and influence of the church often
depends on its size in each country _ ranging from Catholic
strongholds such as Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda to Sierra Leone where
they are latecomers in a Moslem majority.
   The pope and the African church have often spoken out against
human rights violations and called for peace, reconciliation and
negotiations to settle various civil wars and conflicts.
   This sometimes places the church in an adversary role. In
Mozambique, for example, the church was rebuked for urging direct
peace talks with right-wing rebels.
   In Burundi three years ago, the government nationalized some
seminaries, banned Catholic youth groups and shut down catechism
classes on grounds that the church was trying to discredit the
nation. The situation has improved since a military takeover in
1987, church officials say.
   While Islam has always been a main challenger for converts,
Moslem fundamentalism comes as a more recent threat to the church.
   The Vatican review of missionary activity listed ``fanatical
propaganda on the part of groups of radical Moslems'' as one of the
church's main challenges in Africa.
   It specifically named Sudan, where the Moslem-dominated
government in the north is fighting Christian rebels in the south,
and Nigeria, where it saw ``dangerous tension and violence created
by Islamic fanatics.''
   Fundamentalists in Sudan and Nigeria favor Islamic law. The
Vatican criticized its imposition on non-Moslems in a major
document on racism published in February.
   Nigeria's Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican's
office for relations with non-Christians, said in a recent
interview with the Italian Catholic monthly 30 Giorni (30 Days):
``It is true that in some African countries, especially among young
converts, people don't understand why the church dedicates so much
time and effort to dialogue (with Moslems) when Islam in their own
country appears so little disposed to dialogue. I understand the
difficulties of these Christians and in a certain way I can say
they are right.''
   One of the harshest public attacks on the church came from
Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``Africa is not Christian,'' he declared during a visit to
Rwanda in 1982. ``Christians are intruders to Africa. Christians
are agents of colonialism. You must wage a holy war so that Islam
may spread in Africa. God willing, Islam will triumph in Africa
over the religion of colonialism _ Christianity.''

<TEXT>
   Africa got its first native cardinal 29
years ago. Today it has 17, including the head of one of the most
powerful posts at the Vatican.
   Cardinal Bernardin Gantin of Benin, 66, is prefect of the
Congregation of Bishops, which directs the world's 4,000 Roman
Catholic bishops and plays a major role in the selection of bishops
under the guidelines of Pope John Paul II.
   Gantin, who has held the position since 1984 and is the first
black prelate to head a major Vatican office, has been mentioned as
a possible papal candidate.
   The other Vatican-based African cardinal is Francis Arinze of
Nigeria, who runs the office for relations with non-Christians, an
important issue in Africa where many Catholics live side-by-side
with Moslems.
   Another prominent African prelate at the Vatican is Archbishop
Emmanuel Milingo, the former primate of Zambia, who was recalled to
Rome in 1982 and stripped of his native post because of controversy
over his alleged faith-healing practices. He now has a post with
the Vatican office for migration and tourism.
   Pope John XXIII named the first black African cardinal, Laurean
Rugambwa of Tanzania, in 1960.
   The number of African cardinals has gradually increased under
John Paul, who last spring elevated three more prelates in
Mozambique, Cameroon and Mauritius.
   All the African cardinals are black, except for those from
Algeria and South Africa.
   Most of Africa's 480 bishops are black, reflecting the steady
Africanization of the church _ a process encouraged by the pope.
   ``It is not the church imported from outside,'' he said after
his first visit in 1980, ``it is their church, the church lived
authentically, in an African way.''

   ``When I see all these courageous Christians here, in Africa, I
cannot help thinking that, nowadays, Christ has many friends in
Africa, and that the church in Africa is mature to face up to all
vexations and all trials.'' _ Congo, May 1980.

   ``Preserve carefully your African roots. Safeguard the values of
your culture. ... Remain very vigilant with regard to models of
society which are based on the selfish pursuit of individual
happiness and on the god of money, or on the class of struggle and
violent means. All materialism is a source of degradation for man
and of enslavement of social life.'' _ Ivory Coast, May 1980.

   ``All Africa, when allowed to take charge of its own affairs,
without being subjected to interference and pressure from any
outside powers or groups, will ... astound the rest of the world by
its achievements.'' _ Nigeria, February 1982.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Moslems and Christians have generally understood each other
badly, and sometimes, in the past, we have opposed each other and
even exhausted each other in polemics and war. ... I think God
invites us today to change our old habits.'' _ Morocco, August 1985.

   ``Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the
foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with
the original plan of God for marriage.'' _ Swaziland, September
1988.

   ``Powerful political, economic and ideological forces endanger
the still fragile stability of countries which are only beginning
to consolidate their recently acquired independence. Those forces
impede the self-determination of peoples, they foment ideological,
ethnic and tribal conflicts, they delay the process of
development.'' _ Zimbabwe, September 1988.

   A Texas teen-ager getting ready for the Junior Livestock Show
had some thoughts about petulant porkers.
   ``Raising a pig is good fun, but how much fun depends on the
mood of the pig,'' Jenny Haley told the Anvil Herald of Hondo,
Texas.
   A great-grandmother in West Virginia, egged on by a
granddaughter-in-law, finally got around to earning a high school
diploma.
   ``I dreaded math the most,'' Dorothy Johns, 71, of Gay, W.Va.,
told the Ravenswood (W.Va.) News.
   When the 91-year-old founder of an egg and poultry company in
Electra, Texas, died, his obituary in the San Saba (Texas) News
matter-of-factly noted that he was born in Indian Territory and as
a child was brought across the Red River in a covered wagon.
   In the Bonners Ferry Herald, which has served Boundary County,
Idaho, since 1891, columnist Grace Bauman offered this observation:
``If you think you're getting too much government, just be thankful
you're not getting as much as you're paying for.''
   Headline from the Meade County Messenger of Brandenburg, Ky.:
``Rabies cases fewer, but stay alert.''
   So it goes in the American countryside. While Washington
concerned itself with the insolvency of the S&amp;Ls and the sobriety
of John Tower, the topic of the Tri-State Cow-Calf Symposium at
Haigler, Neb. was closer to home _ ``Producing the Cow of the
Future Today.''
   There are things to learn about the state of the nation from
America's 7,498 weeklies that you won't find in the Congressional
Record.
   Sure, there's some bad news:
   The taxpayers of Clinton County, Mo., may be stuck with the
$20,000 medical bill resulting from the amputation of both legs of
a suspect who escaped from the county jail and suffered severe
frostbite while at large, says the Lawson (Mo.) Review.
   The Osawatomie (Kan.) Graphic worries that Osawatomie's
reputation as a railroad town may be slipping; the Union Pacific is
thinking about routing even fewer trains through town.
   Drugs worry the countryside, as they do the big cities. Schools
get consolidated, young people leave, industries close. The big
drought of 1988 still takes its toll: still not enough rain in lots
of places, not enough snow cover for the winter wheat.
   ``Hunters are finding fewer rabbits and quail than usual in
Kentucky this season,'' reports the Bath County News-Outlook of
Owingsville, Ky. Blame the drought, says Jeff Sole of the Kentucky
Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.
   But for all that, the weeklies report the news that tells you
the heart of America is still ticking. Important news, because,
after all, doesn't everyone come from a small town, or think he
did, or wish he had?
   In that case, here's some of the news from back home:
   Wallace Wyatt Jr. promised that if he were elected probate judge
of St. Clair County, Ala., he would eat a super-hot barbecue
sandwich at Smitty's Barb-B-Que in Odenville, Ala. He was, so he
did. ``He said he wouldn't do it again for $500, and it wasn't
something he'd wish on anyone, even a Republican,'' said the St.
Clair News-Aegis.
   Working on a master's degree, Melanie Reid of Due West, S.C.,
researched the history of the Opera House which opened in
Abbeville, S.C., in 1908 and put the lie to some local legends. No
evidence at all, she told the Abbeville Press and Banner, that
Jimmy Durante, Sarah Bernhardt or the Ziegfield Follies ever
performed there.
   In Oconomowoc, Wis., high school football player Rich Andrus was
successfully recruited by the University of Wisconsin. Head coach
Don Morton and an assistant called on him on the first day home
visits were permitted. Exactly when did they arrive?
``Twelve-oh-one a.m.,'' Andrus told the Oconomowoc Enterprise. He
said such tenacity was ``pretty impressive.''
   The Enterprise also reported that people from the Oconomowoc
area drove in four trucks for 4{ hours to deliver food, clothes and
paper products to farmers from northern Wisconsin still suffering
from the effects of last summer's drought. The farm families need
work clothes, said Mrs. Gerhart Tetzlaff of Stone Bank, but they
especially need food. ``I think they are so hungry they don't care
about clothes.''
   The Garden Club of Stamford, Texas, celebrated the 100th
anniversary of Texas Arbor Day by planting two pecan trees on the
west side of Post Office Square as a memorial to Mrs. A.C. Denson,
longtime member of the club ``who, had she lived another month,
would also have been 100 years old,'' the Stamford American said.

<HEAD>Sweet Or Sour, the Legislative Battle Over Sugar Is On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again, Capitol Hill is bracing for a
bitter legislative battle over control of the nation's sugar bowl.
As usual on a noisy battlefield, it's sometimes difficult to tell
the good guys from the bad guys.
   Supporters of the current federal sugar policy, which includes
protective quotas on imports of cheaper foreign sugar and price
guarantees for American producers, are heartened by the Bush
administration's views so far.
   But the newest assault is just starting and is expected to
intensify as Congress begins to develop legislation to replace the
1985 farm law when it expires next year.
   Current sugar policy was set by the 1981 farm law and reafirmed
in the 1985 legislation. The Reagan administration had
unsuccessfully sought basic changes in the sugar program, but
Bush's people so far have indicated a holding pattern.
   For example, the American Sugar Alliance, which say it backs
``America's beet, cane and corn farmers'' in the struggle,
applauded when Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said during
his Senate confirmation hearing that the admininstration is ``not
about to make major changes here in sugar policy until and unless''
other countries make them.
   ``We're not going to unilaterally disarm in sugar any more than
we're going to unilaterally disarm in anything else,'' Yeutter
said. ``We absolutely cannot do so until our major trading partners
are prepared to deal with the (market) distortions that they
provide in sugar throughout the world.''
   But some consumer advocates and lobbyists want changes in the
present sugar law, particularly a reduction in the price supports
guaranteed domestic producers of cane and beet sugar.
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
have introduced legislation that would overhaul the sugar program,
including a reduction in the government price support loan rate for
raw sugar to 12 cents per pound over the next four years from the
current 18 cents.
   The bill also would set a floor on sugar imports and would
increase those floors annually by 500,000 tons.
   ``Like other agricultural subsidies, the price support for our
domestic sugar production has bloated the market,'' says Roth.
``This legislation will save the consumer, who now pays almost
three times the world market price of sugar, $3 billion annually in
sweetener purchases at the grocery store.''
   The Roth-Bradley measure is identical to one introduced in the
House by Reps. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., and Willis Gradison, R-Ohio.
   Leading the support for an overhaul of the sugar program is the
Sweetener Users Association, which represents industrial users of
sugar and other sweeteners.
   Tom Hammer, president of the association, says recent consumer
price reports show a rapid rise in sugar costs and adds that this
could have been headed off by ``a less protectionist'' U.S. sugar
policy.
   ``The U.S. sugar subsidy program has failed to maintain stable
prices,'' Hammer says. ``Domestic sugar growers are completely
insulated, no matter how low the market price may fall. The rest of
us, consumers and industrial users, have no protection whatsoever
from phenomenal increases in sugar prices.''
   Hammer said the current program is mandated by the 1985 farm
law, which says the program must operate at ``no cost'' to the
federal government. As a result, costs are passed on to consumers
``as a hidden tax'' estimated to be in excess of $3 billion a year.
   Eiler C. Ravnholt, chairman of the pro-program American Sugar
Alliance, says the price of sugar on the world market is ``an
inaccurate, inappropriate and unfair standard'' by which to compare
U.S. costs and needs.
   Ravnholt, who also is vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters' Association, says the current program does what it was
designed to do: assure the survival of the domestic sweetener
industry and provide consumers with plentiful supplies at
reasonable prices.
   In the 1985 law, he said, Congress ``once again recognized that
protecting the American sugar producer from unbridled foreign
competition remained a historic necessity. It is the nature of the
world sugar market which has made protection essential and which is
the basis for continuing the support by the U.S. government.''
   Rekha Mehra, a policy analyst at Resources for the Future, a
non-profit, independent, Washington-based research institution,
says U.S. sugar producers have had a varying degree of government
support for almost 200 years but that ``reform cannot be avoided
much longer.''
   The current program includes a price support loan for sugar and
a market stabilization price, or MSP. As with other commodity
programs, sugar processors can get the loan rate by committing raw
can sugar or refined beet sugar as collateral.
   If prices are favorable, the processor can repay the loan and
sell the crop commercially. If not, the sugar is forfeited to the
government's Commodity Credit Corp., which must store and dispose
of the surplus. The 1985 farm law, however, said the program must
be operated at no cost to the government.
   The minimum price support was set at 18 cents per pound for cane
sugar, with beet sugar somewhat higher in relation to the cane
rate. And one of the effects of the higher price for beet sugar has
been to stimulate production. would prefer to sell raw sugar
commercially rather than forfeit it to the government. Basically,
the MSP is the support level plus allowances for interest, freight
and a small marketing incentive.
   But Mehra added, ``The key instrument enabling the program to
function without cost to the government is still the import
quota.'' By adjusting how much cheaper foreign sugar can enter the
United States, the market price is kept at or above the MSP.
   ``By far the largest group of losers from the U.S. sugar program
is consumers,'' she said. ``They pay more both for direct sugar
consumption and for sugar-containing products.''

   Peter V. Ueberroth, the financial wizard who
made millions for the Olympics and baseball, is discussing a
purchase of strikebound Eastern Airlines, The Associated Press
learned Monday.
   An offer from Ueberroth may be presented to the board of
directors of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. in the next few days,
airline industry and baseball sources said on condition of
anonymity. Ueberroth's term as baseball commissioner ends Saturday.
   ``I know Peter's been trying to put together a group'' to
finance a purchase of Eastern, one source said.
   Ueberroth did not wish to comment on the matter, his spokesman,
Rich Levin, said here Monday night.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell, contacted for comment at his
Miami home, said, ``I've heard about it. But we just don't comment
on rumors.''
   Texas Air's board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday, said a source close to the company.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent in Houston said the company would
have no comment on the matter.
   ``There are a lot of those rumors going around,'' Kent said.
``If and when any agreement is reached to sell Eastern I'm sure all
the parties involved will issue a statement.''
   Ueberroth was approached last fall by officials of Eastern's
unions to consider taking over the troubled airline, which filed
for bankruptcy protection March 9, five days after the start of a
Machinists union strike that was supported by airline pilots.
   The unions have said they would make concessions if Ueberroth
took over, possibly in return for ownership of part of the airline.
   Telephone calls for comment to the office of the Machinists
local for Eastern in Miami and union officials were not answered
Monday night.
   Since the strike began, Eastern has been flying only about 10
percent of its normally scheduled 1,040 flights. Most of those
flights have been on the shuttle between New York and Boston and
Washington, and on its Latin American routes.
   Ueberroth met with Eastern officials during baseball's winter
meetings in Atlanta last December, then traveled to Miami for
further talks, a baseball source said. In addition, Ueberroth and
California investor Kirk Kerkorian have discussed a possible buyout
with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, a source said.
   However, another source said it was not clear whether Kerkorian
was involved.
   Minneapolis banker Carl R. Pohlad, who owns baseball's Minnesota
Twins, is a director of Texas Air and owns 12 percent of Jet
Capital Corp., Texas Air's holding company. Lorenzo owns 48.7
percent of Jet Capital. Pohlad reportedly brought Ueberroth in to
negotiate the purchase of the airline.
   Pohlad and other Texas Air directors have urged Lorenzo to sell
Eastern since the strike began, sources said. At the time of the
bankruptcy filing, Eastern had about $300 million in cash and was
losing about $4 million a day, according to papers filed with U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   Kerkorian, who is a friend of Ueberroth's, is majority owner of
MGM-UA Communications Co. Last fall, MGM Pictures Inc., a
subsidiary, offered to hire Ueberroth as chief executive officer,
but Ueberroth turned down the deal.
   Kerkorian also owns MGM Grand Air, a first-class-only airline
that flies primarily between New York and Los Angeles.
   A call to Kerkorian's Los Angeles office asking for comment was
not returned.
   A bid by Ueberroth could compete for Eastern's attention against
an offer by takeover strategist Carl Icahn, who has publicly
expressed interest and has been supported by Eastern's unions.
Icahn is chairman and owner of Trans World Airlines Inc.
   Ueberroth, 51, is known as an iron-willed administrator who
talked down to foreign officials during his five years as president
of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and then bullied
baseball's owners.
   The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, expected to lose money or at best
break even, made $230 million.
   He was elected baseball commissioner in March 1984, and took
office that October. Baseball lost money for 11 consecutive years
before he took office but then made $209 million in his four full
seasons, according to financial statements obtained by the AP.
   During his time in baseball, Ueberroth stayed active in
business. He is a director of several major corporations and as a
board member of E.F. Hutton Inc. engineered the company's sale to
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., earning $850,000 in fees.
   Ueberroth was vice president of Trans International Airlines for
two years when in 1963 he founded a small travel agency in Southern
California. Eventually, he built First Travel Corp. into the
second-largest business of its kind in North America.

   Exxon Corp. is likely to pay willingly for the
cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill to avoid controversy that could
hurt its opportunity to explore for oil in an arctic wildlife

   Exxon is so big that even if it had to pay $100 million out of
its own coffers for the cleanup its earnings would be lowered by
only a nickel a share, Frank Knuettel, an analyst at

   Strong winds Monday delayed efforts to
control a huge oil spill in Prince William Sound, and the president
of Exxon Shipping said the company was ``a little overwhelmed'' by
the magnitude of the cleanup.
   Federal investigators piecing together the sequence of events
leading up to the spill said they planned to interview the captain
and other bridge officers of the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   The captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge when the
vessel left shipping lanes to avoid ice, rammed a charted reef and
ran aground early Friday. The third mate, who did not have proper
certification, was in charge, Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank
Iarossi said.
   Investigators said at a news conference that the results of drug
and alcohol tests on crew members will be made public when
officials receive them, possibly in two or three days.
   Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., has had drinking problems in the
past, according to reports.
   ``Yes, there's a previous history going back five years or
more,'' Iarossi said Sunday in response to reporters' questions
about alcohol abuse by Hazelwood. ``Personally, what happened five
years ago to somebody is not germane to this accident.
   However, The New York Times reported Tuesday that Hazelwood was
convicted last September in New Hampshire of drunken driving and
that his license was revoked a second time.
   The New York Department of Motor Vehicles said his license
remains revoked.
   In 1984, Hazelwood was arrested in Suffolk County, N.Y., on Long
Island on a drunken driving charge, two sources connected with law
enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated
Press.
   Hazelwood pleaded guilty in 1985 to driving while intoxicated,
and received a conditional discharge and a fine of about $510, the
sources said. Under a conditional discharge, a person's criminal
record is cleared if there are no other arrests over a certain
period.
   Suffolk County Police Officer Peter Kelley confirmed the
essential details of the sources' account.
   Hazelwood's license was revoked then, but was restored in 1986
after he completed a state program, the Times said.
   Telephone calls to Hazelwood's home Monday were not answered.
   A National Transportation Safety Board spokewoman in Washington,
D.C., said Hazelwood, third mate, quartermaster and bridge lookout
are among those who will be questioned.
   NTSB officials said it was questionable whether the drug and
alcohol tests will be of much value.
   Drucella Anderson, an NTSB spokeswoman, said there were
indications the tests may have been administered as long as 10
hours after the accident.
   ``I don't know how good the (tests) will be,'' said Rachel
Halterman, another spokeswoman for the NTSB in Washington. The
board plans to open a formal inquiry in Anchorage sometime in the
next three weeks.
   The 987-foot tanker, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope
crude oil, apparently struck a glancing blow against a rock, kept
going and hit rocks a second time, then ran aground, Iarossi said.
   About 240,000 barrels spilled through the hull, creating an oil
slick that has since covered about 100 square miles, according to
the Coast Guard. The oil is slowly heading south toward the Gulf of
Alaska, but must pass numerous islands before it reaches open sea.
   At about 10.1 million gallons, the spill is the biggest such
accident on record in the United States.
   The spill closed the Port of Valdez, the southern terminus of
the Alaska Pipeline, and crude oil prices rose sharply on Monday.
   Meanwhile, gusts up to 50 mph idled most aircraft, including one
that was to spray chemicals to break up the oil slick.
   Four- to six-foot waves whipped the slick into a frothy mix that
Coast Guard Cmdr. Steve McCall called ``chocolate mousse.''
   The spreading oil stained another island as it stretched 40
miles southwest of Bligh Reef. The beaches on at least three
islands ``just got clobbered,'' McCall said.
   As the oil washes into inlets along the islands, it poses a
greater danger to animals and micro-organisms, but also will make
cleanup easier, McCall said.
   And as the oil gets whipped up, chemical dispersants may no
longer be useful, McCall said. Instead, cleanup crews intend to
rely on containment booms and skimmers and burning.
   Iarossi said the wind damaged some of the containment booms used
to corral the oil, including some around the stricken tanker.
   The vessel remained stuck on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles from
Valdez. Iarossi said the wind pivoted the ship 12 degrees to the
north, and that the crew said the new position felt much more
stable.
   Workers continued pumping operations to remove the 1 million
barrels of oil left on board the Exxon Valdez. By Monday evening,
about 120,000 barrels had been transferred to the Exxon Baton
Rouge. Iarossi said Exxon hoped to have about 95 percent of the
remaining oil off the vessel in three or four days.
   He said he cannot guarantee that all the oil will be removed
from the tanker nor that all of the slick will be cleaned up.
   ``Frankly, we are a little overwhelmed,'' Iarossi said. ``We
still have a major problem ahead of us, but we feel we are
gaining.''
   McCall said the Port of Valdez will be reopened to limited
traffic Tuesday. To get to the port, vessels will have to operate
outside normal shipping channels to avoid the spill, he said.
   To help them steer through unfamiliar waters, ships will be
required to take on local pilots farther offshore than normal, he
said.
   Nearly a dozen oil tankers were anchored more than 30 miles from
Valdez, waiting to be allowed in.
   The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. has reduced the normal daily
flow in the trans-Alaska oil pipeline from 2 million barrels to
about 800,000 barrels because of limited storage capacity in
Valdez. The port has been closed since the Exxon tanker ran aground.
   Gov. Steve Cowper was critical of the time it took Exxon and
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. to begin the cleanup. Alyeska operates
the oil-loading terminal at Valdez.
   ``People should have anticipated such a spill as this,'' Cowper
said at a news conference in Juneau.
   Fishermen held a news conference earlier in the day to complain
that Exxon was not taking adquate steps to warn cleanup workers and
nearby villagers about the health threat from the oil and new plans
to burn it with jelled gasoline.
   A spokeswoman for the Cordova District Fishermen's Union said
use of chemicals to disperse the oil is accceptable only under
limited conditions, and that burning the oil should be ruled out.
   The fishing industry objected to the two methods on
environmental grounds, but Iarossi said conventional methods such
as containment booms and skimmers are inadequate to deal with such
a large spill.
   A man from Tatitlek said many of the nearby village's 100
residents suffered nausea and severe headaches after burn tests
were conducted last week.
   ``The whole village is getting sick,'' said Norman Vlasoff.
   Cowper declared Prince William Sound, ordinarily teeming with
fish, marine mammals and birds, a disaster area. He said he would
seek federal money to help with the spill.
   Pamela Bergman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Interior, said at least 90 contaminated birds and two sea otters
had been spotted. But wildlife officials feared there were many
more that went undetected, she said.
   ``I think sorting out the money is something that will occupy
lawyers for years to come,'' Cowper said, adding that Alyeska and
Exxon should share the blame and all costs and that damages should
include any loss of income suffered by fishermen.

   More than 33,000 nuclear plant mishaps _
ranging from stuck valves to radioactive leaks _ have been reported
by utilities to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the 10 years
since the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, according to a
study released today.
   ``A decade after the accident at Three Mile Island, the Nand the
nuclear industry have forgotten the lesson of TMI,'' saan
Claybrook, president of PublCitizen, the advocacy group whicred the
report. ``The plants pose a continuing danger to the public's
health and safety.''
   But NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchard, who characterized the study
as ``pinging the industry,'' said nuclear powerlants are safer than
they were ago.
   ``There have been fewer challenges to the system, fewer
automatic shutdowns, the amount of waste geneed at these plants has
gone down, they're cleaner, and the amount of cumulative radiation
exposure to employees has gone down,'' Fouchard said. ``All of the
fety indicators are going in a positive direction.''
   The study, ``Nuclear Power Safety: 1979-1989,'' chartsincrease
at the beginning of the decade in the ner of reported nuclear plant
mishaps. These are or breakdowns of plant systems and procedures
which may pose a threat to public safety. The operating
utilitycidents to the NRC by filing a ``Licensee Event Report,'' or
LEThe NRC has a system for grading the severity ofc Citizen did not
take this into account.
   In 1979, there were 2,310 reported mishaps at the nation's 67
nuclear reactors, including the partial meltdown r increased to
3,804 in 1980, to 4,060 in 1981, and to 4,500 in 1982. By 1983, e
number of reported incidents exceeded 5,000 at 82 operating plants,
the group found.
   In 1984, however, the NRC changed its system for reporting such
events, and the tonumber of LERs dropped to 2,460 that year,
according to Public Citizen. 1985, with 3,050 LERs, was described
by the NRC as one of the worst years in the history of the nuclear
power industrarked by 645 emergency plant shutdowns and 38 fines
totaling nearly $4 million levied against utilities.
   Since then, the number of nuclear plant mishaps has apparently
leveled off, although ``even the NRC's data is incomplete and thus
these figures probably do not reflect the entmishaps each year,''
the report said.
   For example, in 1984, the first year that the new repting
requirements were in effect, the NRC estimated that betweeent of
reportable mishaps were not reported, the study said.
   If the NRC's assessment is correct, the LER counsimply reflects
the mishaps which the industry chooses to report, while the actual
number of poy significant safety events may be much higher,''
Public Citize The number of LERs has remaine relatively constant
since 1985:60 in 1986 and 2,955 in 1987. Incomplete data for 1988
reveled 2,296 mishaps at the nation's 108 licensed-to-operate
reactors.
   Total mishaps for the 10 years: 33,475.
   The report is findings from Public Citizen's annual nuclear
power safety reports and preliminary data being e group's
forthcoming 1988 report. The data were obtained under Information
act requests and from other NRC sources.

<TEXT>
   A $59 million telephone rate cut and $138
million refund ordered by state regulators prompted GTE Corp.'s
General Telephone Southwest to annouce it will eliminate about 600
jobs in Texas and defer filling 400 vacancies.
   In addition, a spokesman from GTE's corporate headquarters in
Stamford, Conn., said Monday the cutback means the regional
division will put off plans to relocate the headquarters of its
telephone operations division.
   Al Galletly, a GTE spokesman in Stamford, said the reassessment
of the $40 million headquarters decision was for financial reasons
and declined to comment when asked if it was in retaliation for the
rate decision.
   Plans called for about 2,500 GTE employees to be relocated to
the North Dallas area by the end of 1989, with another 1,500 hired
locally or transferred from other facilities by the project's
completion.
   E.L. ``Buddy'' Langley, president of General Telephone
Southwest, said that in addition to cutting regular employees, the
phone company will release more than 100 people who are working for
GTE as contractors and reduce its capital investment budget by more
than $100 million.
   He said the company would defer or eliminate further
modernization of its telephone switching centers and networks in
Texas that had been scheduled for completion in 1989.
   The company also will abandon plans for buying another facility
in Irving for $40, reduce vehicle orders $5 million and defer or
reduce expenses for training, building repairs and other items by
up to $3 million, he added.
   Langley said GTE has petitioned for a rehearing of the Public
Utility Commission rate decision, and that a hearing on the motion
is set for April 5 in Austin.
   The PUC in February voted to lower GTE Southwest's rates by $59
million and require the telephone company to refund $138 million to
customers over two years.
   The refund resulted because the commission set the effective
date of the rates retroactively to Jan. 1, 1987.
   GTE had requested an $81.4 million rate increase.
   GTE Southwest said the commission failed to recognize its
aggressive efforts to improve service and modernize, and that
``could have a chilling effect'' on future utility investment in
the state.
   A $59 million annual reduction would decrease residential rates
by an average of more than 17 percent, according to PUC figures.
   GTE Southwest serves 1.2 million residential and business
customers in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico.

<HEAD>GOP Figures Invest In Purchase Of Coldwell Banker Unit From Sears</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
former presidential aide Frederic V. Malek are among the investors
buying the Coldwell Banker commerical real-estate business from
Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   Carlucci, who ended a stint as defense secretary in January, is
co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchant
banking firm that is participating in the transaction announced
Monday.
   Carlucci also served as chairman of Sears World Trade Inc., a
Sears subsidiary, from 1983 to 1986.
   Malek, the former president of the Marriott Hotels division of
Marriott Corp., is a longtime Republican party activist and friend
of President Bush who now is affiliated with the Carlyle Group as
an independent merchant banker.
   He served as a special assistant to President Richard M. Nixon
and as a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in
the Nixon administration.
   But the largest shareholders in the Los Angeles-based company
will be its nearly 5,000 employees, officials said. They will own
50 percent of Coldwell Banker stock, which Sears is selling for
more than $300 million.
   Officials would not disclose the exact purchase price of the
unit, which is one of the nation's largest commercial real-estate
operations, with 1988 gross revenues of about $460 million.
   Bill Hinckley, a spokesman for the unit in Los Angeles, said the
price was between $300 million and $400 million.
   Chicago-based Sears said it would retain the residential
real-estate operations of Coldwell Banker and the Coldwell Banker
name. The new owners of the commercial unit have up to three years
to settle on a new name and logo.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer and a major player in the
financial-services industry, announced last fall that it planned to
sell the Coldwell Banker unit as part of a corporate restructuring
that also includes the planned sale of its headquarters, the
world's tallest building, in Chicago.
   Hinckley said other investors in the company include the Mellon
family of Virginia and other prominent U.S. and Japanese investors.
   Financing for the transaction is being arranged by Sumitomo Bank
and Bankers Trust Co., officials said.
   James J. Didion, chairman of the unit, said the ``enthusiasm and
commitment'' of the employee-owners would strengthen the firm's
``entrepreneurial direction.''
   The employees participating in the transaction include former
UCLA football star and 1967 Heisman Trophy winner Gary Beban,
president of one of the organization's three divisions.

   Manufacturers of latex condoms in the United
States have agreed to provide expiration dates for their products,
The New York Times reported today.
   A spokesman for a trade group that represents condom makers said
a letter would be sent today to several New York legislators and
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informing them of the
decision, the Times reported.
   The New York State Assembly passed a bill earlier this month
that would require manufacturers to give expiration dates for
condoms.
   The letter from the Health Industry Manufacturers Association
asks that the state Senate take no action on the bill since
manufacturers have agreed to the requirement.
   Norman Estrin, vice president of science and technology for the
association, told the Times that manufacturers would individually
determine an expiration date for their products.
   The issue of expiration dates has taken on increased importance
among legislators and consumer activists as more people turn to
condoms for protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several hundred salaried General Motors Corp.
workers are trying to block a proposed racial discrimination
settlement, calling it inadequate.
   About 600 employees met Monday to discuss their dissatisfaction
and sign petitions asking U.S. District Judge John Feikens to
refuse to approve the settlement. Feikens had asked members of the
suit to respond to the settlement by March 31.
   The recent settlement would cover more than 10,000 current and
former salaried workers in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana who sued the
automaker in 1983, claiming they were denied raises and promotions
given to white colleagues with similar jobs.
   The offer could cost the automaker $20 million to $40 million,
attorneys said. It includes payments to former employees and raises
for some current GM workers.
   GM would acknowledge no wrongdoing under the proposed settlement.
   ``The settlement is entirely, totally inadequate,'' said
Napoleon Quick, a leader of Concerned Black Salaried Employees,
which organized Monday's meeting.
   Members of the group said the settlement, among other things,
doesn't provide money for damages or lost salary, which affects
fringe benefits and requires individuals to file claims to be
eligible for settlement payments.

   Federal officials hailed a cash
settlement between the government and Unisys Corp. on fraud
charges, but the nation's second largest computer company said it
felt vindicated by the dismissal of charges.
   U.S. Attorney James Wilson announced Monday that Unisys made a
$700,000 payment to the government in return for federal
authorities throwing out the indictment.
   The charges last October against Unisys and its predecessor,
Sperry Corp., stemmed from a $526 million contract to upgrade the
Air Force's worldwide computer system. It followed a four-year
investigation by authorities.
   As part of the settlement, the company also agreed to abandon a
claim against the government by Sperry for more than $800,000 in
disputed unpaid invoices, Wilson said.
   ``We feel this is an overall victory, an outstanding victory,''
he said about the settlement.
   Convictions in the case would only have resulted in maximum
fines of $50,000, Wilson said. He said the settlement was not an
admission of guilt on the part of the companies.
   A spokesman for Unisys said the settlement was a ``business
decision'' reached to avoid continuing litigation and the company
continued to deny any wrongdoing. J. Peter Hynes said the dismissal
of charges vindicates the company.
   ``We have said all along that there was no criminality
involved,'' said Hynes in a telephone interview from the company's
Blue Bell, Pa., headquarters.
   He said the settlement was ``just a convenience to get the whole
situation behind us and continue working with the Air Force, which
is a valuable customer.''
   Unisys and Sperry were accused of overcharging the government in
1983 for an unspecified portion of a $500,000 invoice involving the
computer contract.
   Unisys was formed as a result of a merger of Burroughs Corp. and
Sperry in September 1986.
   Wilson said uncertainty about the criminal liability of
successor corporations following mergers played a part in the
government choosing to settle. Government prosecutors appealed
after U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina dismissed the case against
Unisys in December because the company did not exist until 1986.
   In the settlement filed March 21, Dubina's dismissal order was
thrown out as part of the legal work leading to the agreement to
drop charges against both companies.
   The death of a key government witness also was a factor in
dismissing the indictment, Wilson said.

   Oil prices receded slightly this morning, one
day after a major Alaskan oil spill incited a rally that pushed
crude to the highest level in 19 months.
   Traders attributed the decline partly to profit-taking and
uncertainty about the long-term impact of the spill, which forced
the temporary closure of an important oil-loading port.
   They also said more uncertainty about prices and supplies was
raised by the start of an Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meeting this morning in Vienna, Austria.
   The price of the May contract for West Texas Intermediate oil,
the benchmark U.S. crude, fell to $20.20 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. On Monday, the contract rose 38 cents a barrel
to close at $20.53.
   It was the highest near-month closing price for the key grade
since Aug. 14, 1987, when it closed at $20.57.
   Refined products traded on the mercantile exchange also weakened
in price after sharp runups Monday. The April contract for unleaded
gasoline fell 0.68 cent a gallon this morning to 59.07 cents, and
home heating oil fell 0.83 cent a gallon to 56.75 cents.
   The price surge stemmed largely from the accident off the
Alaskan port of Valdez, where an Exxon Corp. tanker ran aground,
spilling an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound.
   The accident forced the closing of the port, the southern
terminus of the Alaska pipeline that carries all crude oil from
Alaska's North Slope.
   The shutdown temporarily cut U.S. crude supplies by a quarter,
and it was this development that incited heavy buying of energy
futures.
   ``The market's reaction was a little overdone,'' despite the
interruption in North Slope supplies, said Madison Galbraith,
senior energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.

<TEXT>
   Fruehauf Corp., struggling with indebtedness and
weak earnings, today announced plans to sell operations that
include its truck trailer manufacturing business to Terex Corp. for
$232.5 million, while retaining its Kelsey-Hayes Co. auto
components subsidiary.
   A Terex subsidiary, FRH Acquisition, will pay $169.4 million
cash and assume about $63.1 million in long-term debt in a
transaction expected to be closed May 15, Fruehauf said.
   FRH Acquisition will acquire the truck-trailer manufacturing
operations, a maritime refinishing products business and Fruehauf's
80 percent interest in CEMCO, a company that makes loading cranes
for shipping.
   Fruehauf then will consist primarily of Kelsey Hayes, which
manufactures wheels, brake components, anti-lock braking systems
and other components.
   The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on changes in
the net assets of the businesses to be acquired before the closing
date, Fruehauf said.
   Company spokesman David A. Hladik said Fruehauf had been
reviewing several acquisition proposals in addition to one from
Varity Corp., a Toronto farm equipment maker, that was withdrawn
Feb. 27.
   Fruehauf said it expects to receive acquisition proposals for
the remainder of the company, minus the trailer and other
operations being sold, in the near future.
   The company had battled high debts, interest payments and
operating losses since its managers avoided a hostile takeover
attempt by acquiring control of the company in a debt-financed
takeover in December 1986.
   Fruehauf managers arranged the buyout with the financial help of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which obtained a 31 percent voting interest,
to avoid a takeover bid by New York investor Asher Edelman. Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. are acting as
financial advisers in the current transaction, Fruehauf said.
   Fruehauf, which employs about 15,800 people, reported losses of
$41.5 million on revenue of $1.96 billion in 1987 and losses of
$56.5 million on revenue of $2.09 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>TWA Plans To Buy $3.6 Billion Worth of Airbus Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a drive to modernize its fleet, Trans World
Airlines Inc. announced plans today to buy up to 40 jets from
Airbus Industrie in a deal worth more than $3.6 billion.
   It was one of the biggest orders for new aircraft and followed
multibillion dollar purchases announced recently by American
Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn said the airline will place firm orders
for 20 A330-300 twin-engine wide-body aircraft and take options on
an additional 20.
   Airbus, a consortium backed by Britain, France, West Germany and
Spain, will begin delivering the 301-seat aircraft to TWA in late
1994 or early 1995, depending on engine selection.
   Commenting on the deal in a prepared statement, Icahn said:
``This concludes an aircraft evaluation study begun more than two
years ago, and reaffirms our commitment to TWA's long-term growth
and prosperity.''
   The Airbus jets are being purchased under a fleet renewal
program aimed at replacing TWA's L-1011 and 747-100 aircraft, he
said. TWA intends to operate the A330 on major North American and
trans-Atlantic routes.
   ``The A330, which offers the most advanced technology available
today, also gives us the option to expand the airline to take
advantage of market opportunities,'' Icahn said.
   Under the terms of the deal, TWA has the right to convert up to
10 firm orders and 10 options to Airbus Industrie's A340s, which
are four-engine, very long-range wide-body aircraft.
   Operating the A330 will cost 33 percent less than operating
TWA's L-1011s, the airline said. The A340, which also seats 301
passengers, has a range of 7,600 nautical miles.
   The A330 and A340 jetliners were launched as a single program in
June of 1987. The two models are similar in looks with the only
major difference being in the number of engines and in their
engine-related systems.
   The A340 will begin service in May 1992 and the A330 will take
its first commercial flight in September 1993.
   Jean Pierson, president and chief executive officer of Airbus,
said TWA's planned order represents the ``beginning in a long and
fruitful relationship for both companies.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Steady On Reported Soviet Interest In Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that
Monday's sharp price break had stirred some Soviet interest in
buying U.S. corn.
   Prices tumbled on Monday as rain began falling in the Great
Plains and Midwest, where dryness from last year's drought lingers.
   Rain continued to fall this morning but trading was more heavily
influenced by the unconfirmed talk of a Soviet bid for U.S. corn
and by a National Weather Service forecast issued late Monday that
predicted dry weather in the Midwest for the latter half of next
week.
   Traders also are jockeying for position ahead of Friday's
quarterly grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate
from the Agriculture Department.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.29 a bushel; corn was { cent
to 2\ cents higher with May at $2.73} a bushel; oats were 2} cents
to 3} cents higher with May at $1.99 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent
to 1\ cents lower with May at $7.68 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .05 cent higher with April at
78.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent
higher with April at 82.20 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .27 cent lower with April at 42.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .27 cent lower with May at 36.90 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher on Monday while pork
futures were mostly lower.

<HEAD>The Massive Myth of The Green Eyeshade</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release AMs Wednesday, March 29</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nonsense, said the professor, ``pure myth, the
myth of the green eyeshade.''
   He was referring to repeated stories in the business press that
the financially-oriented executive, a once popular breed of
manager, is about to become a management fossil.
   The truth, he said, is that the breed is alive, well and
multiplying. The misunderstanding, he said, is based on inaccurate
assumptions and superficial analyses _ as well as on old-fashioned
notions of financial people.
   To begin, said Professor Eugene Jennings, who pioneered studies
of routes to executive success, it is assumed that the heyday of
the financially oriented executive was in the 1950s, when it
actually was in the `70s.
   Those with an understanding of numbers came into their own, he
says, when corporations discovered, somewhat belatedly, that they
were in the business of enhancing shareholder value. That was even
more of a factor than was the rise of computers.
   In the 1950s and 1960s, he says, fewer than 15 percent of chief
executive officers were financially trained. Companies then were
functionally organized _ around manufacturing or sales, for example
_ rather than around finances.
   In the 1970s there developed a corporate culture more oriented
to numbers. Chief financial officers, controllers and the like
proliferated, one reason being that corporations divided themselves
into smaller business units.
   Hewlett Packard, for example, now has 50 business units.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has 19. And some corporations such
as General Electric have more than 100 units of varying
independence, all needing financial leadership.
   The financial groundswell continues, says Jennings, a professor
of business at Michigan State University.
   Even plant managers today are aware of such data as the real
return on invested capital, he says. ``Once they worked only
against a budget; now they work against a financial plan. They
understand cash and capital needs.''
   Jennings, who often serves as adviser to top officers and
boards, tells of a very large corporation that surveyed 39 plant
managers in 1979 to determine their understanding of elementary
accounting and finance.
   Fewer than 30 percent achieved what he calls a decent score,
spurring the company to send all plant managers to an extensive
financial seminar. In addition, it added to their objectives a high
return on invested capital.
   Result: In 1986 the same plants were surveyed and more than 70
percent of the managers received a decent score.
   ``In our largest corporations today you cannot tell what plant
and general managers were formally educated in accounting and
finance from those whose college major was engineering or
marketing,'' said Jennings.
   He calls this the institutionalization of numbers and he
provides some numbers from his own research to document the
phrasing.
   _The number of individuals holding the title chief financial
officer in large corporations has more than doubled since 1979.
   _The number of titled controllers has nearly tripled.
   _There are one-quarter more chief executive officers with
financial background and experience than in 1979.
   _The number of chief financial officers with formal education in
accounting has doubled in 10 years.
   Keeping tabs on such things is the professor's life work. He
began his studies of what he calls corporate mobility patterns in
the late 1940s, when he published his first book, ``The Mobile
Manager,'' now considered a basic reference.
   It is for this reason, among others, that he feels compelled to
set the record straight on the premature demise of the
financially-oriented breed of corporate executive. And he seeks to
deflate these other popular myths:
   _Financially-oriented executives are in place strictly for the
short run, to correct immediate or temporary problems.
   If this is so, he says, how do you explain the reign of Roger
Smith as chief executive officer of General Motors, who has been
entrusted with a $65 billion rebuilding program?
   _Financial executives are not creative, do not make good general
managers, and are risk-averse.
   All wrong, he says, none more so than the last. ``Because they
know the numbers they are in fact more apt to understand prudent
risk,'' says the professor.
   _They have tunnel vision _ they see all through a narrow prism.
   ``Unfounded,'' he says. He maintains that about half the very
largest companies with new, advanced product lines in electronics,
consumer goods, fast foods, chemicals and retailing are headed by
financially-oriented executives.
   All such notions are old-fashioned and dated, he said. All, that
is, are part of the the massive, master myth of the green eyeshade.

   Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, who made the
traditionally money-losing Olympics profitable, is discussing a
purchase of strikebound Eastern Airlines, sources said.
   Another well-known figure, former Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, is being mentioned as a candidate for the airline's
bankruptcy examiner.
   News of Ueberroth's interest came as takeover specialist Carl C.
Icahn was reportedly resuming talks with Eastern's unions about a
possible takeover.
   A federal judge in Miami, meanwhile, scheduled a hearing for
Thursday on Eastern's efforts to force its rebellious pilots back
to work. The pilots' support for the Machinists' strike that began
March 4 virtually grounded Miami-based Eastern and forced it to
seek bankruptcy protection five days later.
   An offer from Ueberroth may be presented to the board of
Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp., in the next few days,
airline industry and baseball sources said Monday, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Ueberroth's term as baseball commissioner
ends Saturday.
   ``I know Peter's been trying to put together a group'' to
finance a purchase of Eastern, one source said.
   Ueberroth did not wish to comment, his spokesman, Rich Levin,
said in New York City.
   Texas Air's board was to hold regularly scheduled meetings today
and Wednesday, said a source close to the company. Texas Air
spokesman Art Kent in Houston said the company would have no
comment.
   ``There are a lot of those rumors going around,'' Kent said.
``If and when any agreement is reached to sell Eastern I'm sure all
the parties involved will issue a statement.''
   Ueberroth was approached last fall by Eastern's unions to
consider taking over the airline. The unions have said they would
make wage concessions if Ueberroth took over, possibly in return
for part ownership.
   Eastern's demand for $125 million in concessions from its
Machinists triggered the strike.
   Telephone calls to the office of the Machinists local for
Eastern in Miami and union officials were not answered Monday night.
   Capt. Jack Bavis, a spokesman for Eastern's pilots union, said
Ueberroth would provide greater job security at the airline than
the current management.
   ``I've got my fingers crossed,'' Bavis said.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo met with Bavis on March 11 to
approve discussions between Ueberroth and the carrier's unions, Air
Line Pilots Association spokesman Hank Weber said in Miami today.
   ``Discussions have been ongoing since that time,'' Weber said.
``We're viewing this with cautious optimism because Frank Lorenzo
has been in this position before. It is an option we didn't have
before.''
   Ueberroth met with Eastern officials in December during
baseball's winter meetings in Atlanta, then traveled to Miami for
further talks, a baseball source said. Ueberroth also has discussed
a possible buyout with Lorenzo, other sources said.
   The Wall Street Journal today said Ueberroth's offer ranged from
$300 million to $500 million.
   Minneapolis banker Carl R. Pohlad, who owns baseball's Minnesota
Twins, is a Texas Air director and owns 12 percent of its holding
company, Jet Capital Corp. Lorenzo owns 48.7 percent of Jet
Capital. Pohlad reportedly brought Ueberroth in to negotiate the
purchase of Eastern.
   Pohlad and other Texas Air directors have urged Lorenzo to sell
Eastern since the strike began, sources said. At the time of the
bankruptcy court filing, Eastern said it had about $300 million in
cash and was losing about $4 million a day.
   Ueberroth, 51, is known as a strong administrator who bullied
baseball owners and whose hard negotiations with foreign officials
as president of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee
helped the games turn an unprecedented $230 million profit.
   He has been a director of major corporations. As a board member
of E.F. Hutton Inc., he engineered the company's sale to Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., earning $850,000 in fees.
   Ueberroth could face competition from TWA owner Icahn, who has
publicly expressed interest and has been supported by Eastern's
unions.
   Icahn is meeting again with union officials to discuss a
possible takeover and hopes to use union concessions to persuade
Eastern's creditors to let him take control, said Brian Freeman, an
investment banker with close ties to the Machinists union.
   The list of possible bankruptcy examiners includes Carlucci and
top securities fraud lawyer Leon Silverman, sources said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Harold Jones, who is administering
Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in New York City,
said he is considering about a dozen candidates for examiner and
hopes to recommend a candidate to Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton
Lifland by early next week.
   Lifland has said the examiner would have sweeping power to try
to mediate the labor dispute. The examiner also will review
financial transactions between Eastern, sister carrier Continental
Airlines and Texas Air.
   Silverman, a Washington-based securities lawyer who represented
some claimants in Manville Corp.'s Chapter 11 proceeding starting
in August 1982, also is one of the lead attorneys for imprisoned
insider trader Ivan F. Boesky.

   Share prices closed higher Tuesday on the London
Stock Exchange, as trading resumed after a four-day Easter holiday
and the market awaited the British trade report for February.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 13.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,070.5.
   Volume was a scant 342.8 million shares, compared with 407.8

   But the upward move couldn't be sustained Tuesday afternoon,
despite renewed rises in early Wall Street business. Dealers said
apprehension ahead of Wednesday's trade report pulled prices down
from their best levels.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 9.6 points at 1,708.0
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.14 points
to close 1,180.44.

   Ingersoll Publications plans to hit the streets
with a daily newspaper called the St. Louis Sun in the fall, it was
learned today.
   The morning paper would be a direct competitor of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the city's only daily since the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat closed in 1986.
   A source told the Associated Press today that the newspaper will
be published seven dsays a week and will be operated directly by
Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of
Ingersoll Publications Co.
   Ingersoll Publications Co. scheduled a news conference for later
today to make ``a major announcement concerning expansion of its
operations in St. Louis.''
   In a statement prepared for the news conference and provided to
the AP by the source, Ralph Ingersoll said: ``A new sun is rising
the Midwest. As the economic base of metropolitan St. Louis adapts
successfully to compete in the 21st Century, we believe there is
now a need for a new daily newspaper which reflects St. Louis'
renaissance.''
   Ingersoll said the Sun will be committed to ``active,
constructive involvement in the community's life'' and will also
emphasize sports.
   The source said Ingersoll will be chairman and editor in chief;
Robert M. Jelenic, executive vice president of Ingersoll
Publications, will be the president; and Thomas M. Tallarico, a
senior vice president and general manager of the Post-Dispatch
since 1986, will be the publisher.
   Tallarico submitted his resignation today.
   Ingersoll said in the statement that his company has invested
more than $100 million in the St. Louis area with its non-daily
publications and is committing millions more to establish the Sun.
   Ingersoll Publications, a privately held company that had
revenues of more than $700 million in 1988, operates 40 daily
newspapers and more than 150 non-daily newspapers.
   Circulation of the Ingersoll group daily newspapers exceeds more
than 1.25 million. Its non-daily editions reach an additional 5
million homes.

   National Semiconductor Corp.,
striving to cut its losses, announced Tuesday it plans to close
next February a chip-making plant in Danbury, Conn., that employs
about 400 people.
   The company said the closing is intended to reduce the company's
excess manufacturing capacity, ``particularly in older products and
processes.'' The plant makes transistors and other microelectronic
products.
   Some employees will be offered transfers and others will receive
severance pay and job counseling, the company said.
   National Semiconductor, which has 37,000 employees worldwide,
reported a loss of $103 million on sales of $1.85 billion in the
nine-month period that ended Feb. 26. In the third quarter alone it
lost $44.6 million on revenues of $589 million.
   The Santa Clara-based company has been closing or selling off
businesses unrelated to its core operations of computer chips. It
agreed in February to sell its mainframe computer marketing
subsidiary to Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp.'s Electronc
Data Systems Corp.
   Last year, National closed its research and development
operation in Palo Alto and is now in the process of closing its
Mountain View facility. Most employees from those plants were
shifted to other locations.

<TEXT>
   Baseball bosses, casino kings, astronauts and
corporate raiders _ the saga that is Eastern Airlines now features
a virtual honor roll of big names and big egos from the big leagues.
   From baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth and developer
Donald Trump to former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
takeover artist Carl Icahn, glamour names from business and
politics are being mentioned for key roles in either saving or
buying the beleaguered carrier.
   The cast of characters isn't surprising for an airline that has
been run by a World War I flying ace, an Apollo astronaut and its
current high-profile chairman, who has been reviled by unions as
the Boris Badenov of the airline industry.
   The name-dropping potential has grown almost daily during the
25-day Eastern strike as the soap opera of the 60-year-old airline
has moved from boardroom to picket line to bankruptcy court.
   ``There's a little emotional, sentimental factor in it,'' said
Robert Serling, an aviation historian in Tuscon, Ariz., trying to
explain part of Eastern's allure. ``It is an old, very respected
carrier that's played a part in the country's air transportation
history since the '20s.''
   Ueberroth, who steps down as baseball commissioner Saturday, is
being mentioned as a possible Eastern buyer. A former vice
president of Trans International Airlines, Ueberroth also founded a
small travel agency that later grew into giant First Travel Corp.,
the continent's second largest such business.
   Ueberroth has turned around unprofitable operations before _
leading the 1984 Olympics to an unprecedented $230 million profit
and boosting baseball's drooping attendance and earnings.
   Trump, the multimillionaire casino and real estate developer,
made an artful $365 million deal last year for Eastern's Northeast
shuttle. Since the strike, Trump has said he wants to cut his price
by a third.
   Icahn already owns Trans World Airlines and is a union favorite
to acquire Eastern. Talks between Eastern and Icahn were held last
year and Icahn has restarted negotiations with unions.
   Carlucci, whom President Reagan appointed national security
adviser after the Iran-Contra debacle and later became defense
secretary, is among the candidates for a different kind of cleanup
job, the bankruptcy examiner who would scrutinize deals between
Eastern and its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Another candidate for examiner is Leon Silverman, an attorney
for jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The board of Texas Air itself includes Carl Pohlad, owner of
baseball's Minnesota Twins and a longtime business associate of
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo. Pohlad reportedly brought in
Ueberroth to negotiate an Eastern sale.
   Eastern, once one of the world's four largest carriers, always
has been a place for glamour names. It was run by Eddie
Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace, from 1935 until he was
ousted by the company's board in 1964.
   Later piloting Eastern was Frank Borman, an Air Force colonel
who commanded the Apollo 8 moon orbital mission. Borman, who
appeared in the company's television ads, governed Eastern at a
time it ran up huge debts and later oversaw the sale of the airline
to Texas Air in 1986.
   As Eastern's fate emerges in bankruptcy court and business
deals, some analysts say even bigger fish may emerge.
   ``You don't know who's the real money behind it right now,''
said Robert Joedicke of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``They may
not want to surface yet.''

<HEAD>Soybean Prices Slide Again As Rain Soaks Midwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rumored Soviet purchase of U.S. corn helped
boost grain futures prices Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
but soybean futures fell for the third straight day as rain soaked
the Midwest.
   The modest rally in the grain markets followed a sharp,
across-the-board drop in prices in the previous session.
   Traders said Monday's price break apparently brought the Soviet
Union into the cash market.
   ``Most guesses are that they bought 2 million tons for April
through June shipment,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``There are all the earmarks of
business actually being done; the only real question is how much
was done.''
   Rainfall in the Midwest, where dryness from last year's drought
still lingers, kept pressure on soybean prices.
   Soybean oil futures fell sharply on selling inspired by
weakening chart signals. The contract for May delivery of soybean
oil closed .54 cent lower at 22.88 cents a pound.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with May
at $4.28} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2{ cents higher with May at
$2.74 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with May at

   Kirk Kerkorian makes most of his
news these days trading in movie and casino companies, but the
investor who's among those rumored to be interested in Eastern
Airlines made his first fortune in airplanes.
   Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA Communications Co. and the luxury
airline MGM Grand Inc., got his start in business by building a
charter airline after World War II. Over the years, he has showed
varying degrees of interest in Western Air Lines and Pan Am as well.
   Now, sources close to strike-bound Eastern say Kerkorian may be
interested in bidding on the airline.
   Kerkorian's staff wouldn't comment Tuesday on media reports
concerning Eastern.
   The 71-year-old investor, whose personal wealth is estimated by
Forbes magazine at $950 million, shuns publicity. But the complex
financial maneuvers of his Tracinda Corp. investment company are
frequent news, particularly in Hollywood, where almost weekly
rumors swirl over the fate of debt-burdened MGM-UA.
   Kerkorian controls about 80 percent of the movie company, which
he assembled out of parts of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United
Artists studios. In the last year he has proposed bringing in
outside investors to run the MGM half, then suggested he would sell
the UA half, then recapitalized the whole company with $180 million
of his own money.
   All or part of the company that made Oscar nominees ``Rain
Man,'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is officially up for sale now,
but most observers expect Kerkorian would try to structure a deal
that lets him keep a piece of MGM-UA.
   Another Kerkorian-controlled company, MGM Grand Inc., combines
two of Kerkorian's longtime interests: airplanes and Las Vegas
casino-hotels. The company, which reported a $6.2 million profit in
1988, owns the Desert Inn and Sands and runs a three-plane,
all-luxury airline between Los Angeles and New York, featuring
Boeing 727s adorned with a version of the MGM movie lion.
   Kerkorian, who was born to Armenian immigrants in Fresno,
ferried planes to Britain for the Army during World War II.
   In 1947, he started the nation's first non-scheduled air
service, linking Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In a pattern typical of
his later business dealings, he sold Trans International Airlines,
bought it back and then sold it again in 1968, eventually making
more than $100 million.
   The Eastern rumors would put Kerkorian in a situation similar to
his last flirtation with a big airline. That was in 1987, when Pan
American World Airways unions offered $230 million in wage
concessions if Kerkorian could buy the airline from parent Pan Am
Corp.
   Pan Am rejected Kerkorian's offer to pay $75 million cash and
assemble $400 million in junk bond financing and assume the
airline's $1 billion in debt.
   Kerkorian began assembling his present empire in 1968 with the
profit from the Trans International deal. He bought the Flamingo
Hotel in Las Vegas, built the International Hotel &amp; Casino and
bought 31 percent of Western Airlines and 48 percent of MGM.
   It is MGM that has served as base for most of his later dealings.
   He split the company into separate casino and movie operations,
combining the movie business with UA in a series of transactions.
Those included one with Ted Turner that, in effect, gave the
Atlanta media entrepreneur MGM's 3,000-title movie library for $1.5
billion.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney Promoting Its Fashions During Academy Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., attempting to freshen its
image, will air new commercials during the Academy Awards program
Wednesday night aimed at focusing attention on the 87-year-old
retailer's latest fashions.
   In a series of four 30-second spots, the retailer will highlight
men's and women's apparel, and other merchandise, such as jewelry
and home furnishings, Penney's advertising agency NW Ayer said.
   The ad for men's fashions features a man clad in a
European-styled suit and silk tie walking down an alley. The
voiceover says: ``People buy more men's suits, shirts, slacks and
ties at J.C. Penney than at any other department store. And, that
suits us just fine.''
   The women's clothing commercial shows a woman in an updated
version of a classically tailored oatmeal-colored suit riding on
what appears to be an old-fashioned iron-work elevator.
   As she descends, light coming through the door illuminates what
she's wearing and the following is heard: ``People buy more women's
fashions at J.C. Penney than at any other department store. Now
there's a fashion statement.''
   Jim Hradecky, the creative director of NW Ayer's Dallas office,
said the commercials are a bit different for Penney, which normally
gears advertising to sales or special events, such as the promotion
of a new line of merchandise.
   ``These are neither. They are fashion oriented,'' said Hradecky,
who wrote the commercials.
   He said the commercials, which are designed as a supplement to
the retailer's regular television ads, are significant because they
promote Penney as an authority on fashion.
   Penney has been a sponsor of the Oscar presentation ceremony in
past years. In 1988, Penney debuted one new ad during the show and
used re-edited versions of existing ones.
   In October 1987, Penney announced plans to alter its retailing
strategy.
   It has placed added emphasis on women's clothing and expanded
its apparel offerings. It also stopped selling various hard goods,
such as home electronics, in its retail stores while continuing to
provide them through its catalogs.
   Kay Baker, a Penney spokeswoman, said the commercials appearing
Wednesday night contain what she called a new ``lifestyle''
approach that the retailer had been planning to test in its ads.
   But she said Penney does not intend to abandon its historical
strategy of concentrating its ads on events and sales.
   The Academy Awards presentation, which attracts more than 25
million viewers, is used by many advertisers as a forum for airing
their latest promotions.

<TEXT>
   Takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens,
countering such size-based corporate rankings as the Fortune 500
and Business Week 1000, on Tuesday released his own list of
companies rated by shareholder friendliness.
   United Shareholders Association, a group formed by Pickens to
lobby in favor of ``shareholders' rights'' and against takeover
defenses, rated 1,000 companies based on their lack of obstacles to
takeover, price and dividend performance and degree of management
ownership.
   The group claims managers with a personal stake in a company
perform better and it claims companies without such anti-takeover
devices as poison pills and golden parachutes represent better
values than those with them.
   ``USA's Corporate 1000 ratings point out which managements are
attuned to shareholder interests. Sort of the good, the bad and the
ugly of corporate America,'' Pickens said.
   The Texas oilman, who has chased some big companies like
Phillips Petroleum Co. and Newmont Mining Corp. and is considering
running for governor, said the list wasn't intended to be a stock
tip sheet, but he is billing it as a ``consumer guide'' and
``owners manual for corporate America.''
   Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a professor at Columbia Business School,
criticized Pickens' emphasis on stock price and dividend
performance.
   ``Companies that do things to pretty up their stock prices are
not necessarily managing for the long run. They are probably
cutting into not just the fat, but also the muscle they need for
long-run competitiveness,'' she said.
   According to Pickens, the 20 best companies are: Price, Circle
K, Aon, Southwest Airlines, TCA Cable TV, Gap, Autodesk,
Systematics, Applied Biosystems, Russell, EMC, Berkshire Hathaway,
20th Century Industries, 3 Com, Ohio Mattress, Intel, GAF,
Walgreen, Wal-Mart Stores and Tyco Laboratories.
   The 20 worst, according to the list, are: Allegheny
International, Maxus Energy, USG, LTV, Hercules, Manville, Home
Group, Robertston (H.H.), National Intergroup, Asarco, Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber, Pittston, Tektronix, Andarko Petroleum, Bowater,
Caterpillar, Navistar International, Texas Air, USX and Western
Union.

   The dollar advanced broadly during a busy
session Tuesday despite efforts by central banks to check its
movement.
   Gold prices sank. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a bid of $383 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, down $7 from
Monday's late bid.
   Victor Polce, a vice president at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
traders bought dollars actively throughout the day, undeterred by
central banks selling dollars in a concerted round of intervention.
   ``I think the intervention did absolutely nothing,'' said Polce.
``Traders were saying `Give me some dollars, make my day' because
they believed they would be able to sell them higher in the
future.''
   Foreign exchange dealers in Europe said the U.S. currency
recovered quickly from concerted dollar-selling by the central
banks of West Germany and other countries. Traders estimated the
central banks sold nearly $200 million.
   The absence of the influential Bank of Japan from the markets
may have caused currency dealers to ignore what the other central
banks were doing.
   ``Traders are getting tired of the old names,'' Polce
said.``They really want to see the Bank of Japan in the market.''
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7030 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than Friday's $1.7190. Later in New York, sterling
fetched $1.6855 compared to $1.7085 on Monday.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 132.30 Japanese yen, up
0.60. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded higher at 132.48 and
at 133.105 yen later in New York.
   Most European markets were closed Friday and Monday for the
Easter holiday but Rome was open for business.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates included: 1.89525 West German marks, up from 1.8834; 1.65325
Swiss francs, up from 1.6415; 1.19525 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19305; 6.4010 French francs, up from 6.36375; and 1,388.025
Italian lire, up from 1,381.25.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Friday's
late rates included: 1.8850 West German marks, up from 1.8733;
1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6252; 6.3625 French francs, up from
6.3350; 2.1215 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1138; 1,379.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,376.10; and, 1.1925 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1895.
   Gold bullion prices sagged by around $7 an ounce in active
European trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $383 a troy ounce, down from $391.10 on Monday.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid $387.50 a troy
ounce, down from $394.75. The Zurich closing bid price was $388,
down from $395.
   Traders said the price fell sharply when the New York market
opened and began selling. They said the dollar's strength in the
face of central banks selling dollars and lower prices for crude
oil in New York helped to drive down the price of gold.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $392.64 bid, down from
$396.14.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.91 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.08. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery finished at $5.794 a troy ounce, down from Monday's
settlement of $5.946.

   Citrus and apples from the Empalme area of
Sonora, Mexico, must be treated as a precaution against exotic
fruit flies before entering the United States, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Peaches from the area are banned completely from entering the
U.S. market. The restrictions took effect on March 24 but were not
officially announced until now.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal

of Empalme.''
   Citrus fruit from Empalme must be fumigated before shipment to
the United States. Apples have to undergo a cold treatment to kill
possible pests. But Slagle said there is ``no acceptable
treatment'' for peaches.

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices plunged to a 5{-week low Tuesday as
investors, reacting to a surging dollar, moved their money out of
precious metals and into interest-bearing instruments.
   On other markets, energy futures fell sharply, reversing most of
the previous day's gains; soybeans slipped while grain futures
advanced; cattle futures were lower; and pork futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $8.10 to $9.30 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at $383.50 a troy
ounce. It was the lowest settlement price for a gold contract on
the exchange since Feb. 17, when gold finished at $380.80 an ounce
after trading that day as low as $380, a 27-month low.
   Silver futures settled 15.2 cents to 17.4 cents lower with May
at $5.848 a troy ounce.
   Gold prices typically rise and fall with inflation fears,
reflecting the metal's tendency to hold its worth even as the
dollar falls in value.
   A stronger dollar is viewed as anti-inflationary. It makes U.S.
goods more expensive overseas and makes foreign-made goods cheaper
in this country, reducing demand for U.S.-made goods and slowing
the economy's growth.
   The rapid rise of short-term interest rates during the first
quarter of this year has contributed to the dollar's strength and
drawn investment dollars into government-backed securities and
certificates of deposit.
   Several recent government reports on wholesale and retail prices
seemed to suggest that inflation was on the rise. But Tuesday's
activity in the currency and precious-metals markets indicates
confidence among investors that the Federal Reserve Board is
succeeding in stifling inflation by forcing interest rates up.
   ``I think the market's perception is that these high, real rates
of return on the dollar are going to continue and may even
increase, and I don't think that's real positive for the gold
market,'' said John Norris, the head of precious-metals trading for
Citibank in New York.
   A further drop in gold's price below the Feb. 17 low of $380 an
ounce would likely trigger an even steeper sell-off, analysts said.
   ``But I don't think that's going to happen,'' said Peter
Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New
York-based futures brokerage. ``I think there's enough support to
hold at this level and we should begin to see some European bargain
hunting.''
   Oil prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
profit-taking off of Monday's strong gains, which had pushed crude
oil to its highest price in 19 months.
   Monday's runup was linked to the massive Alaskan oil spill and
the shutdown of the Port of Valdez, the southern terminus of the
Alaska pipeline. The port was reopened on Tuesday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 69 cents
lower with May at $19.91 a barrel; heating oil was 1.31 cents to
2.54 cents lower with April at 55.04 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to 1.07 cents lower with April at 58.68 cents
a gallon.
   A rumored Soviet purchase of U.S. corn helped boost grain
futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade but soybean futures
fell for the third straight day as rain soaked the Midwest.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with May at $4.28} a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 2\ cents higher with May at $2.73} a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with May at $1.96} a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6} cents lower with May at
$7.62} a bushel.
   Cattle and hog futures retreated modestly in technically
inspired selling on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while
pork-belly futures advanced.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .38 cent lower with April at
77.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .32 cent lower
with April at 81.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to
.17 cent higher with April at 42.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .60 cent to .87 cent higher with May at 38.02 cents a
pound.

   Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani,
who led a crackdown on white-collar crime during his five-year
tenure, said Tuesday he will travel to Japan next month to offer
advice on prosecuting insider trading and other securities fraud.
   The Japanese government is currently embroiled in a stock
scandal of its own that has implicated government officials and is
putting pressure on Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Giuliani, whose office brought about 50 securities fraud
indictments in his term that ended in January, said he was
contacted by private attorneys in Japan and will lecture to
officials in Tokyo April 13-14.
   ``I think it's very, very important for the United States that
in other countries that are part of the world market that we have a
similar set of rules,'' he said. ``Otherwise we're at a competitive
disadvantage.''
   Giuliani, a possible New York mayoral candidate now in private
practice, said he will meet with more than 10 Japanese investment
firms and U.S. firms with offices there, as well as government
agencies, securities officials and law enforcement organizations.
He said he will discuss U.S. insider trading and other securities
fraud laws and cases.
   Japan, home to the world's biggest stock market, modeled its
postwar laws on securities fraud after those in the United States
but rarely enforced them. Markets in some European countries and
Hong Kong are loosely regulated, and insider trading and other
financial scandals recently hit France and Mexico.
   ``Many of them have statutes and laws, some similar to ours,
some a little different,'' Giuliani said.
   ``The major problem they're undergoing is the same problem we
were undergoing in the '40s, '50s and '60s _ not enforcing them,
not knowing how to enforce them and not having educated the
institutions on the importance of the rules,'' he said.
   The current scandal in Japan involves the sale of thousands of
shares of unlisted stock by the Recruit Co. to politicians and
other prominent people at bargain prices. The buyers reaped
windfalls when the shares were publicly traded later.
   At least 17 senior politicians, including Takeshita and former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the scandal.

   The nation's largest oil spill has cost
Alaska more than $10 million in lost revenue because of reduced
flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline, and more losses are
expected, officials said Tuesday.
   Alaska, the nation's second-largest oil producer, relies on the
industry for more than 80 percent of its revenues. State officials
said they don't expect any cash-flow problems from the spill but
are monitoring the situation.
   The 60 percent cutback in pipeline flow since Friday's tanker
spill at Valdez harbor has cost the state treasury about $2.4
million a day in lost taxes and royalty payments, said Cliff Groh,
special assistant to the state revenue commissioner.
   Alaska expects to lose less than $20 million before the pipeline
can resume full production, which may occur before the end of the
week, said David Ramseur, a spokesman for Gov. Steve Cowper.
   Cowper and the state legislature are in the final stages of
preparing next year's budget. The governor has proposed a
status-quo $2.3 billion spending plan and he is not expected to
revise it because of the pipeline slowdown.
   Low oil prices over the past year have been a bigger problem for
the state treasury. Depending on oil prices, Alaska faces a $300
million to $600 million deficit next year, and lawmakers are
considering cuts in services and new taxes.
   The oil industry also is feeling the income loss because of the
pipeline restriction.
   ``There's actually very little we can do to make it up,'' said
Paul Laird of BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., the largest producer in
Alaska's North Slope region, which feeds the pipeline.
   He said the pipeline was operating at capacity before the spill
and cannot accommodate heavier flows to recover the lost revenue.
``Clearly, we're suffering financially just like the state is,''
Laird said.
   BP America Inc., Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. are
responsible for more than 90 percent of North Slope production,
Laird said. Mobil Corp., Unocal Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and
Amerada Hess Corp. are the other North Slope producers that share
in the pipeline ownership.
   The 800-mile pipeline can move about 2 million barrels of crude
oil daily, but its flow has been reduced to 800,000 barrels a day
since Friday's tanker spill.
   The U.S. Coast Guard reopened Valdez harbor to tanker traffic
Tuesday morning, and the pipeline could be back at full production
by the end of the week, said Tom Brennan of Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co.
   When the Coast Guard closed the harbor to tanker traffic Friday,
Alyeska reduced the flow of North Slope oil to cope with limited
storage space at Valdez, Alyeska spokesman John Ratterman said.
   The harbor was shut to traffic until enough of the spill was
cleared to allow ships to avoid the slick. An ARCO tanker arrived
at the dock Tuesday, and about 10 more were waiting to fill up.
   The opening of the pipeline in 1977 helped push Alaska to number
two in U.S. oil production, running just 3 percent behind Texas in
the first two months of the year, according to the American
Petroleum Institute in Washington.
   ``There were a couple of months last year when Alaska actually
did pass Texas,'' said Ed Porter, a senior economist at the
institute. ``Texas is declining fairly rapidly and Alaska until
this year was still growing.''
   Texas production started a sharp decline in 1986, he said, and
``most people feel right now that Alaska is at or near its peak.''
   Texas produced an average of 2.026 million barrels a day in
January and February, with Alaska at 1.959 million barrels, the
institute reported.

<HEAD>Business Executives Forecast Strong Second Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Business executives are forecasting a strong
second quarter, with profit expectations for the three months
starting Saturday at their highest level since 1984, according to
survey results released Tuesday.
   ``Business executives' plans to increase prices are clearly
having at least a short-term impact on profit expectations,'' said
Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician for
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., which conducted the poll of 1,500
executives.
   ``Order books are strong, but the ability to maintain high
profit expectations throughout 1989 is questionable,'' he said in a
statement.
   Nearly half those polled said they planned to increase prices in
the second quarter.
   In the survey, conducted Feb. 8-27, the executives in
manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling were asked if they
expected an increase, decrease or no change in second-quarter
sales, profits, prices, inventories, employment and new orders.
   Expectations for higher second-quarter profits climbed to the
highest level since 1984, rising nine points to 69 on Dun &amp;
Bradstreet's index of profit expectations.
   The survey's indexes are calculated by subtracting the
percentage of respondents predicting decreases from the percentage
of those expecting increases.
   The sales-optimism index rose six points to 74 from 68 in the
first quarter, and five points from the second quarter of 1988.
   The index of companies expecting to increase prices rose to 46
from 41 in the first quarter.
   ``Inflationary pressures are now pushing prices up, after
remaining fairly consistent for the past five quarters,'' Duncan
said.
   The employment-optimism index decreased one point to 23 from the
first quarter, mostly due to a two-point drop in expectations among
wholesalers, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said.
   The index of companies' exepectations for increased inventories
rose three points to 29, a finding that Duncan said could prove a
problem later in the year if increased prices make it difficult to
move goods.
   The optimism index for new orders among manufacturers of
non-durable goods rose six points to 71, while the index for
durable goods manufacturers increased five points to 70.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet is a leading marketer of business information.

   President Bush said Tuesday he is still
seeking clarifications from Japan on building the advanced FSX jet
fighter and that efforts to nail down an agreement are ``going back
and forth a little.''
   Administration officials said the final go-ahead on the joint
project is being delayed by haggling with Japan over who will own
the technology and how many planes would be U.S.-built.
   It is possible that a Japanese-set Friday deadline for a final
decision may be missed, said the officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity. However, officials also sought to dispel the idea the
project is unraveling and said a deal was still considered likely.
   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga, who had requested a Tuesday
afternoon meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said
afterwards that no final agreement had been reached, but the two
sides ``agreed to continue to talk. That was the firm objective.''
   But Matsunaga added that no decision had been made on the timing
of new meetings. The ambassador said Seiki Nishihiro, the deputy
director general of the Japanese defense agency who had also taken
part in the discussions, was returning to Japan.
   Under the agreement, originally negotiated last year by the
Reagan administration, the new plane would be built jointly by
General Dynamics and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The plane
would be modeled on the American-made F-16 fighter.
   Bush, who disclosed last week that he had decided to go ahead
with the project, told reporters Tuesday that the United States is
pressing for more clarity in the revised agreement to be submitted
to Congress.
   ``It's going back and forth a little bit. All I want to know is
that the agreement is clear. No point in having an unclear
agreement,'' Bush said.
   ``We have a lot at stake here,'' the president added, ``a lot at
stake in terms of the common defense; we have a lot at stake in
terms of commerce; we have a lot at stake in terms of technology.
And all I'm asking is to be clear.''
   The project has encountered stiff opposition in Congress, where
critics have called it a $8 billion high-technology giveaway to
Japan. They say Tokyo should purchase American-made planes to help
offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   Even with within the administration, there have been skeptics at
high levels, including Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills. They have argued that without
careful safeguards the deal could give Japan free help in
developing an aerospace industry of its own to compete with U.S.
companies.
   Bush suggested he still wants to go ahead with the project so
long as there are necessary safeguards.
   ``The United States will keep its word, properly, insisting on
clarity in the agreement. And that's about where we stand right
now,'' Bush said. He spoke after a meeting in the Oval Office to
discuss the oil spill in Alaska.
   A U.S. negotiating group, made up of officials from the
Commerce, Defense and State departments, have been meeting all week
with Japanese officials in an effort to come up with a final
agreement.
   Matsunaga met Tuesday morning with Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger, the first official meeting between the sides
since a negotiating session last Thursday.
   But State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the FSX
fighter was discussed only briefly because the meeting was a
courtesy call planned before the controversy erupted.
   One U.S. official close to the negotiations denied Tuesday that
the agreement was unraveling, suggesting that Japanese officials
were treating the talks more as a trade negotiation than a
defense-related one _ and doing a considerable amount of
maneuvering for home consumption.
   ``I feel we'll still get a deal,'' said the official, who
insisted upon anonymity.
   ``The Japanese negotiate differently on trade. On trade
negotiation. On trade negotiations, they always go right up to the
wall _ they set a deadline and then they negotiate past it, to show
they've gone the extra mile,'' the official said.
   White House sources said that the president could move on the
agreement with an announcement in a matter of hours once the final
document has been readied.
   The Japanese say they need to have the agreement by Friday to
include the project in the budget for the new fiscal year that
begins April 1.
   Asked if that deadline would be met, Bush said: ``I don't know
whether it will be done by then, or not.''
   The Reagan administration began negotiations on the fighter
after Japan refused to buy F-16s off the shelf and indicated it
wanted to build its own jet fighter.
   The agreement reportedly will seek to protect sophisticated U.S.
computer codes that enable the plane's computer software to fly the
plane and control its sophisticated weaponry.

   A new daily tabloid will hit the homes and
newsstands of St. Louis in September, and its publisher will be a
man who has been a top executive at the city's established
newspaper, publishing magnate Ralph Ingersoll II announced Tuesday.
   The newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, will be published seven
mornings a week and compete head-on with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, a morning newspaper owned by the Pulitzer Publishing
Co.
   The Post-Dispatch has been the city's only newspaper since the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded under financial strain in October
1986.
   ``This is a completely new newspaper,'' Ingersoll said at a news
conference. ``I assure you the Sun will not just be a good
newspaper, it will be a great newspaper.''
   Asked about the slant of the editorial page, Ingersoll said the
paper would be ``a conservator of traditional values.''
   Ingersoll said he will be chairman and editor in chief of the
newspaper and will set up a residence in St. Louis to oversee the
operation initially.
   Robert M. Jelenic, executive vice president of Ingersoll
Publications, will be the president of the new company; and Thomas
M. Tallarico, 44, a senior vice president and general manager of
the Post-Dispatch since 1986, will be the publisher.
   Tallarico submitted his resignation to Post-Dispatch Publisher
Nicholas G. Penniman IV Tuesday morning, sending shock waves
through that newspaper.
   Penniman said he was stunned when Tallarico gave him the news.
Penniman said it was his view that Tallarico had taken on the job
of ``burying the Post-Dispatch.''
   ``We, of course, won't let that happen,'' Penniman said.
   Ingersoll owns the Suburban Journals, 43 non-daily newspapers
published throughout the metropolitan area. He said the Journals
and the Sun would be operated separately.
   Ingersoll said his company has invested more than $100 million
in the St. Louis area with its non-daily publications and is
committing millions more to establish the Sun. He would not divulge
specific figures on the Sun's start-up cost.
   The organization has acquired color-capable presses that can
print 128 pages an issue. The press run will be 200,000 copies,
Ingersoll said.
   The paper, to be housed in a new downtown office building, would
be able to operate successfully with less than 100,000 circulation,
he said. Ingersoll said the Sun will hire a staff of 75 to 100
reporters.
   Ingersoll said he was not concerned that many cities have become
one-newspaper communities due to lack of advertiser support for a
second paper.
   ``We'll be competitive with the Post-Dispatch _ volume one,
number one,'' Ingersoll said. ``The Sun will be profitable in the
second year of its operation, and it will continue to grow.''
   Tallarico said the Sun, unlike many other tabloids in the United
States and Europe, would not emphasize sensational news.
   St. Louis Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., who was involved in an
attempt to save the Globe-Democrat in 1984, called the announcement
``a very historic day.''
   Ingersoll Publications, a privately held company that had
revenues of more than $700 million in 1988, operates 40 daily
newspapers and more than 150 non-daily newspapers.
   Circulation of the daily newspapers exceeds more than 1.25
million. Its non-daily editions reach an additional 5 million homes.

   Some employees of strike-bound Eastern Airlines,
idled for nearly four weeks, have turned their attention to
immortalizing boss Frank Lorenzo in songs ranging from ``King of
the Raid'' to ``If I Had A Pilot.''
   They have written about 20 strike jingles, collected in a new
brochure called ``The Eastern Shuffle: Songs for the Eastern Picket
Line.'' It's published by the Labor Heritage Foundation in
Washington, and comes with a 60-minute cassette recording of
employees crooning the numbers.
   What tune did Eastern spokesman Robin Matell sing when he heard
about the songbook? ``No Comment.''
   Entries include ``King of the Raid,'' sung to the tune of ``King
of the Road'' and targeted at Lorenzo:
   ``Airline for sale or rent
   Millions I've already spent
   I own controlling shares
   Now I'm a billionaire
   And I can't wait till I acquire
   More of my airline empire
   I'm a man of greed by all means
   King of the Raid!''
   
   ``I own every worker on every plane
   I know every trick in the corporate game
   I know every company in every town
   And how to buy them out when the prices are down''
   Etc.
   
   Then there's ``If I Had a Pilot,'' to the tune of the folk
classic ``If I Had a Hammer.''
   ``If I had a pilot
   I'd be flying in the morning
   I'd be flying in the evening
   All over this land
   I don't care about the danger
   I don't care about the warnings
   All I want to do is steal the workers' wages and their pensions
   All over this land.''
   
   Further verses: ``If I had mechanics, If I had flight
attendants,'' etc.
   
   Other numbers include ``Don't Fly the Eastern Shuttle When You
Come.'' (Tune: ``She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain''); ``The
Picket Boogie'' (to the tune of ``The Hokey Pokey''); ``Give Me
That New Union Contract'' (``Old Time Religion''), ``Ten Little
Airplanes Grounded'' (``Ten Little Indians''), ``Lorenzo Don't

(``Don't Worry, Be Happy'').

<TEXT>
   Fishermen mobilized Tuesday to protect
untainted beaches and estuaries from the nation's worst oil spill,
and the Port of Valdez reopened to tankers lined up to load North
Slope crude oil.
   Cleanup officials said they had abandoned hope of controlling
the spill with mechanical skimmers or chemical dispersants and
planned instead to rely on burning the oil, which formed a long,
black bruise on the brilliant blue waters of Prince William Sound.
   Three top Bush Administration officials arrived late in the
afternoon and quickly departed for a look at the polluted area.
   President Bush had asked Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Bill Reilly
and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost to ``take a hard look at where
this disaster stands.''
   Bush said the federal government may take over the cleanup from
Exxon if the officials conclude that not enough is being done.
   Asked whether he was satisfied with Exxon's efforts, Bush said,
``They're certainly making a good beginning here, but there are
some conflicting reports on that. I don't want to prejudge that.''
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat who has been highly
critical of the cleanup, flew to Valdez and joined the officials
upon their arrival. He said he wants the federal government to
designate clearly which agency is in charge when spills occur.
   Cowper said the oil industry hasn't shown the ability to handle
tanker spills. He said there is no guarantee that things would be
better if another accident took place.
   Since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground Friday, spilling
240,000 barrels, the oil has moved more than 40 miles,
contaminating beaches and marine life as it goes.
   ``This oil spill has been 12 years in the coming,'' said Don
Cornett, an Exxon spokesman. But he claimed that given the amount
of oil transported during that period, the industry's safety record
actually is quite good.
   With assistance from the state, a fishermen's group from nearby
Cordova dispatched a few dozen boats with cleanup gear to protect
three important pink salmon hatcheries in the path of the rapidly
spreading slick.
   Beaches have been fouled by oil on at least five uninhabited
islands, including Back Island, Reef Island, Blight Island and
Naked Island, and the slick was fast approached sensitive
salmon-spawning areas on the larger Knight Island to the southwest.
   ``Frankly, we are past attempting to recover much oil,'' said
Larry Dietrick, a spokesman for the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``Our primary efforts are now in the
defense of very sensitive areas.''
   Exxon said it planned to turn loose an army of workers equipped
with rakes and shovels to clean up rugged, remote beaches already
contaminated. But Dietrick said there was no sign of that
happening, and the fishermen said they couldn't wait any longer.
   As contractors scrambled to hire workers off the street for the
backbreaking task of cleaning isolated beaches and coves, the
federal Bureau of Land Management started mobilizing five fire
crews totaling about 100 people to assist. BLM spokesman Dave
Vickery said the crews should arrive in Valdez on Wednesday.
   Cornett said workers will rake and shovel oil-soaked debris into
barrels for removal from the beaches, and that rocky beaches will
be washed down.
   The shift to manual labor came as the size of the slick
outstripped the means to contain it. Cornett said there were 12
skimmers deployed early Tuesday, but they had managed to scoop only
about 3,500 barrels from the sea's surface.
   Cornett said cleanup crews lost an excellent opportunity to use
chemical dispersants on the spill Sunday because the state
Department of Environmental Conservation and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency were hesitant to authorize use of
the chemcials.
   DEC Commission Dennis Kelso denied Tuesday that the state
delayed approval. He said Exxon told him calm water over the
weekend would have rendered the dispersants ineffective.
   Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson said tests showed that the
chemical dispersants failed to contain the spill.
   ``There's no way possible with technology that exists today that
they could have contained that slick,'' Nelson said.
   He added that reduced winds could allow the resumption of
operations to burn oil near fouled islands. ``We're very optimistic
about the burning. It's a lot faster than the mechanical
containment,'' Nelson said.
   Exxon spokesman Brian Dunphy said more dispersal chemicals were
sprayed Tuesday, although he did not know the quantity. An
environmental law firm, Trustees for Alaska, filed a Freedom of
Information Act request that the company disclose the product's
chemical components.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi conceded that the
cleanup ``is not proceeding well _ believe me, that is an
understatement. We've got a mess on our hands.''
   The spill into the once-pristine sound forced the closure of the
Port of Valdez, which forms the southern terminus of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Flow through the pipeline, which
supplies nearly one-fourth of the nation's supply of domestic crude
oil, was reduced to 800,000 barrels a day from 2.1 million.
   When the port reopened, 10 tankers led by the Arco Sag River
were waiting to enter port and load at the Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. marine terminal, Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkiewicz said.
   Wieliczkiewicz said the Sag River arrived late in the morning to
pick up 480,000 barrels. The OMI Columbia was expected to arrive
later, followed by the Arco Alaska.
   The terminal can load up to four tankers at a time at a rate of
100,000 barrels an hour.
   The huge vessels were steered into Valdez by two tugs, and each
vessel was required to have a harbor pilot on board. Traffic was
limited to daylight.
   An oil company official, who asked not to be identified,
predicted oil prices on the world market would have risen
dramatically if the port had remained closed much longer. Prices on
the spot market actually dipped slightly Tuesday after rising
sharply the day before.
   Meanwhile, several more pumps were put to work transferring oil
from the damaged tanker to a sister ship, the Exxon Baton Rouge.
Cornett said that as of early Tuesday about 200,000 barrels had
been removed. The 987-foot Exxon Valdez had approximately 1 million
barrels remaining on board after it rammed Bligh Reef about 25
miles out of Valdez.
   Cornett said salvage crews are confident the 3-year-old ship's
structural integrity is sound, and that the vessel can be refloated
and returned to drydock without any additional spills. He estimated
it would take about three more days to empty the Exxon Valdez.
   Cornett refused to comment on reports that the ship's captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, had a drinking problem. He insisted it would be
inappropriate since the matter is the subject of a half-dozen
investigations by state and federal authorities.
   Hazelwood, 42, was not on the bridge when the vessel left
shipping lanes to avoid ice, rammed a charted reef and became stuck
on Bligh Reef, according to Iarossi. The third mate, who did not
have proper certification, was in charge at the time.
   Results of drug and alcohol tests on crew members could be made
public later this week.
   Hazelwood has been arrested twice for drunken driving, once in
1984 near his home of Huntington, N.Y., and once in 1988 in Conway,
N.H., on Sept. 13, 1988, in Conway, N.H. His driver's license has
been revoked three times, including once when he refused to submit
to a Breathalyzer test.
   Iarossi told The Associated Press he was unaware of Hazelwood's
recent convictions and the loss of his driver's license. But he
went on to note that two of the incidents occurred ``before he
turned himself in'' for alcohol treatment.
   Iarossi said Exxon was not involved in the treatment. ``That was
between him and his doctor.''
   Hazelwood's mother, Margaret, acknowledged in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press that her son had a drinking
problem.
   ``I know he was rehabilitated,'' Mrs. Hazelwood said from her
home in Huntington. ``Exxon knows it.''
