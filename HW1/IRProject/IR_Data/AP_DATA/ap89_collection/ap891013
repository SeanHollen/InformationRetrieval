   Senators approved a $14.1-billion
deficit-reduction package Friday night after junking extraneous tax
breaks and spending increases and postponing a showdown on
President Bush's proposed cut in capital-gains taxes.
   The 87-7 vote sent the plan to the House, which earlier passed a
version that includes a capital-gains reduction. Negotiators from
the House and Senate are expected to try to work out a compromise
starting next week.
   The legislation is designed to push the estimated deficit for
the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, slightly below $110
billion and avoid automatic, almost across-the-board cuts in most
federal spending programs on Monday.
   With the House not in session until Monday, it appeared all but
certain that the cuts would be triggered temporarily. But the
reductions can be restored later.
   The way for final Senate action on the bill was cleared when
senators approved by voice vote an agreement to strip from the bill
hundreds of provisions prized by one member or another but which
did nothing to cut the deficit.
   Stripping the bill of pet projects ``asks sacrifice ... (and)
discipline of every senator,'' Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, said in urging approval of the agreement.
   ``The American people recognize responsibility when they see
it,'' said Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, ``and tonight they
are seeing responsibility in action.''
   Among provisions dropped from the bill: Extension of the 3
percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service, due to
expire at the end of 1990; new tax credits for low-income families;
extension of tax benefits for first-time homebuyers and workers who
receive education and legal aid from their employers; dozens of
narrowly targeted tax cuts; improvements in Medicare, Medicaid and
child-welfare programs, and overhaul of the formula for government
reimbursement of doctors.
   ``We think this is absolutely the best approach,'' Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee, said of the agreement to strip all but bare essentials
from the bill. ``We get good government in the fair-deal sense.''
   ``It is a very major step,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Finance Committee.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Howell
Heflin, D-Ala.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.; Richard Shelby, D-Ala., and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Not voting were Sens. David Boren, D-Okla.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.; Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., and Tim Wirth, D-Colo.
   At the White House, one official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said President Bush will not likely veto the bill.
   The official said that the administration was not happy with the
turn of events, but that ``the stripped down bill gets back to
budget basics.''
   Bush will continue searching for ways to get his capital-gains
proposal through Congress in other legislation, the official said.
   The essential part of the bill would raise taxes by about $5.3
billion and cut spending by $8.7 billion. But as the measure worked
its way through eight committees, it picked up hundreds of
amendments to benefit farmers, loggers, low-income families, the
poor, the sick, the oil industry and higher-income retirees.
   The bill became so laden with benefits for one group or another
that it had to include $38 billion worth of tax increases over five
years to have enough money left over to meet deficit-reduction
targets. Under the agreement, everything that did not cut the
deficit would be removed from the bill.
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on the Finance
Committee, said the agreement ``ensures that we will have another
tax bill very soon _ two or three weeks'' to which the
capital-gains reduction, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts
and any other amendment could be added.
   Echoing Bush, Republicans insisted they were not giving up the
fight to cut the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the
sale of stocks and other investments. At the White House, Bush said
he was troubled by Democratic efforts to substitute expanded
tax-deductible IRAs for the capital-gains cut, which he promised
during last year's presidential campaign.
   ``We early on took a very clear-cut position on capital gains,''
he said. ``When I became president, there was no doubt at all where
I stood on this.''
   He refused to rule out a final compromise that might include
both a capital-gains cut and liberalized IRAs.
   The Senate agreement was reached without concurrence from the
House, which already has passed a deficit-reduction plan that
includes a bitterly fought cut in taxes on capital gains. Senate
passage of its bill would require negotiators from the two houses
to work out a compromise between the stripped-down version and the
House package, which has its share of provisions that do nothing to
cut the deficit.
   The final compromise could include a capital-gains cut plus
expanded tax-deductible IRAs for all workers. Or, House and Senate
negotiators could agree to consider those issues as part of some
other tax bill later this year.
   Senate action on deficit reduction had been delayed as Democrats
_ who control the chamber by a 55-45 margin _ sought to keep a
capital-gains cut out of the bill. In the end, it appeared
Democrats had won the battle because Republicans could find no way
to overcome a rule that would have required them to get 60 votes to
add capital-gains to the legislation.
   When that became clear, Dole and Domenici offered to drop the
issue as part of an agreement that would strip away all other
provisions that would not cut the deficit, including the Democrats'
IRA provision.
   Most of the tax increase in the Senate deficit-reduction plan
would fall on corporations. Spending would be cut in scores of
programs, including Medicare reimbursements for doctors and
hospitals and lower deficiency payments for some crops. User fees
charged for a variety of activities, such as Coast Guard services,
would be raised to boost revenues.

said Kathy Bushkin.
   Before their promotions Ms. McLoughlin, 44, was a senior editor
at the magazine and Ruby, 47, was executive editor.
   Rosenblatt is resigning because the commute between the

   However, The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions
that Rosenblatt was quitting because of a conflict with the

   East Germany's Communist Party today ruled out
talks with pro-democracy activists and labeled one growing
opposition group ``enemies of the socialist order.''
   The government had promised discussions to cope with rising
unrest and to seek the causes of a refugee exodus, saying it would
talk to representatives of ``all parts of society.''
   But in an internal Communist Party position paper obtained by
The Associated Press, party leaders warned that ``open and hidden
enemies of the socialist order'' could create a mass movement at
odds with the socialist government.
   ``Any association with such opposition groups would hurt the
further development of socialism,'' the position paper said.
   The document was directed primarily at the opposition group New
Forum, which has advocated free elections, greater openness in
society and a free press.
   It said New Forum's platform was ``aimed at destroying the
leadership role of the Socialist society'' and accused the group of
being made up of ``enemies of the socialist order.''
   On Thursday, the chief ideologue of the Communist Party, Kurt
Hager, indicated the opposition movement would be excluded from any
discussions about political reform.
   Hager promised during a visit to Moscow that the East German
government will consider changes following the departure of tens of
thousands of citizens to the West and the most widespread public
demonstrations since 1953.
   But his reference to possible talks with public organizations,
church groups and other social forces did not appear to include the
opposition movement.
   He said those challenging the foundations of socialism would
have no role in the talks.
   ``If they want to question our social order, then that's not a
basis for discussions,'' said Hager, who was in Moscow for the
opening of a cultural exhibition.
   The communist government here routinely has accused the major
opposition groups of trying to undermine socialism.
   The future of hard-line leader Erich Honecker, meanwhile,
remained a subject of widespread speculation. Party sources have
said influential members of the ruling Politburo were upset over
the way the 77-year-old Honecker has responded to the unrest.
   Party sources said he had been asked to provide a report on the
``critical situation'' of the nation before the end of this week.
   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper, quoting
unidentified Communist Party sources, reported Thursday that
Honecker would be replaced on Oct. 18.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited East Berlin over
the weekend to help East Germany celebrate its 40th anniversary and
urged Honecker to undertake reforms.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans demonstrated in several cities
and demanded political and economic reform; many asked the
reform-minded Gorbachev for his help.
   Lutheran Church sources in East Berlin said late Thursday that
officials in Leipzig were preparing to give amnesty to all those
arrested in protests there since Sept. 11. The number was not
immediately known, but up to 500 people are believed still to be in
jail.
   The Politburo promised Wednesday to examine the causes of the
protests and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of young,
skilled East Germans to the West.
   Opposition leaders Thursday said they were skeptical about the
government's professed willingness to enter into real dialogue with
any social forces.
   Baerbel Bohley, an East Berlin painter and a co-founder of the
opposition group New Forum, described the Politburo statement as a
``verbal shift that does not take into account real life.''
   East German leaders have made it clear that any changes would
occur only within the framework of the existing socialist system.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
welcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said it ``should
be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve domestic and
international pressure.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf
Seiters, said Kohl was optimistic.
   ``This could be the first positive signal to the populace that
the East German leadership has given,'' Seiters said of the
Politburo statement. ``But we must wait to see what concrete
measures it carries.''
   The government in East Berlin has rejected pro-democracy reforms
like those taking place in the Soviet bloc countries of Poland and
Hungary.

   President Bush said today he will allow a
newly approved ban on flag-burning to become law without his
signature, but ``I don't think it's enough.'' He vowed to continue
pressing for a constitutional amendment.
   During an appearance in the White House briefing room, the
president said he was withholding his signature from the
congressional legislation ``to signal our belief that a
constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting
protection for the flag.''
   Bush commented on the flag legislation in a brief opening
statement before responding to questions on other issues.
   When Congress is in session, legislation can become law
automatically if the president does not act on it within 10 working
days of when it is sent to the White House. After Congress has
adjourned, a president can pocket-veto bills by refusing to sign
them.
   ``I believe the American flag is a unique and special symbol of
our nation and it should be protected from desecration, and our
administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect
the flag,'' Bush said in his statement.
   He proposed the amendment after the Supreme Court ruled last
June that flag-burning was a constitutionally protected form of
free speech.
   The court ruling brought a flood of calls for an amendment to
the Constitution, but after the initial response many members of
Congress including the Democratic leadership began looking for a
way to deal with the problem through legislation rather than
changing the Constitution.
   When asked if he were concerned about the political consequences
of vetoing flag-burning legislation in the light of his attacks on
Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush
denied that was a consideration in his decision.
   During the campaign, Bush and his supporters repeatedly attacked
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, for vetoing legislation
that would have required public schools teachers in the state to
lead pupils in daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Bush said the congressional vote was ``an overwhelming
expression on the part of the Congress to do something about the
protection of the flag. I don't think it's enough.''
   ``I can understand the rationale of those who voted for the
legislation, but in my view, it is not the ultimate answer,'' he
said.
   The House voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional action
on the bill.
   Supporting the bill were 154 Republicans and 217 Democrats,
while it was opposed by 25 Democrats and 18 Republicans.
   The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine for
anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,
burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag
of the United States.''
   The lopsided approval margin reflected the power of the flag as
a political symbol as demonstrated in last year's presidential
campaign and by the outcry over the Supreme Court's June decision
overturning a Texas flag-burning conviction.
   The court reversed the conviction of Texas flag-burner Gregory
Lee Johnson on grounds the law violated his right to freedom of
speech.
   Bush contends a constitutional amendment would settle the issue
once and for all and could not be overturned by a court. Such a
measure is set to come before the Senate next week.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., told reporters that
someone at the White House _ he did not recall the name _ told him
the president might stress his dislike of the bill while bowing to
its popularity by letting it become law without his signature.
   Soon afterward, White House sources said Bush was likely to
follow that course. He could do that by allowing the measure to sit
untouched after it reached his desk for 10 days while Congress
remained in session. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fitzwater, traveling with Bush in New York, declined to say what
the president might do. ``We'll have to have a legal review take
place'' when the bill arrives at the White House, he said.
   Congressional Democrats, declaring that constitutional
amendments should be used only as a last resort, said their bill
was so carefully worded that it probably could survive a court
challenge.
   ``It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag
rather than any action that the message might convey that is to be
punished,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks,
D-Texas.
   He said the idea was to make flag defacement illegal regardless
of whether it had anything to do with political protest and to make
the statute ``content neutral.''
   Michel scoffed at that notion, however, saying there was no way
to draw up such a bill.
   ``To those who believe we can overturn a Supreme Court decision
at this time by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words of
the farmer who, asked directions, said, `You can't get there from
here,''' Michel told the House.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he hoped the Senate
would to block the proposed constitutional amendment next week.
   ``I think the amendment would be extremely ill-advised,'' Foley
said. ``I don't believe we should rush into any action that would
amend the First Amendment without the greatest care and obviously
it would be, I think, reckless to do so, I think, at this point.''

   Armed civilians kidnapped a Swiss flight
attendant in northern Lebanon early this week and freed her today,
security sources said. Police here could not confirm the abduction.
   In Bern, Switzerland on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Clemens Birrer said the woman, whom he refused to identify, was
kidnapped by gunmen in northern Lebanon on Sunday.
   A reliable Lebanon security source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the woman as Astrid Fischer, 31, and said she
was was released in Tripoli this afternoon.
   The source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. Fischer from a house in the
village of Koubbaa, 31 miles north of Beirut, on Sunday. Birrer had
said the kidnapping occurred in Tripoli, which is 50 miles north of
Beirut.
   The source refused to identify the kidnappers but said the
woman, a flight attendant with Swissair, was ``interrogated in
connection with her activities and stay in Lebanon.''
   He refused to elaborate.
   The abduction would be the third of a Swiss national in Lebanon
in a week. The two previous kidnappings were linked to the case of
a Shiite Moslem militant serving a life sentence in Switzerland for
hijacking a jet.
   When asked about the latest reported kidnapping, Tripoli police
chief Col. Nabil Zein said today: ``I have no information at all
about this kidnapping. We have neither a notification nor a
complaint about such a kidnapping.''
   ``I read the report from Bern in the papers this morning,'' he
told The Associated Press when contacted by telephone.
   Birrer said the woman's parents asked authorities not to
publicize the case. He told reporters of the kidnapping after being
asked about unattributed news reports of it.
   ``There is no sign of a political background to this
kidnapping,'' he added.
   Switzerland asked Syria, which controls much of northern
Lebanon, to help find the woman, he said.
   In all, 19 Westerners are missing in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran are thought to be holding most of
the hostages.
   On Oct. 6, two Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez and
Emmanual Christen, were abducted in southern Lebanon. No group
claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, and no demands have
been made.
   Later that day, a PLO spokesman blamed radical Palestinian
guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal for those
abductions and linked them to a Shiite Moslem militant, Mohammed
Hariri. He is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijacking
an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.
   Lebanese police also blamed Abu Nidal's group for the Oct. 6
abductions. The Abu Nidal organization denied involvement.
   Birrer said he did not believe there was any connection between
the kidnappings Oct. 6 and that reported Thursday.
   All Swiss Red Cross personnel were withdrawn from Lebanon
following the kidnapping in November of Peter Winkler, a relief
worker in Sidon. Winkler was released a month later, and the Swiss
contingent returned after receiving assurances from all sides in
Lebanon that humanitarian workers would not be targeted for
kidnappings.

   President Bush said today he opposes allowing
Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest but held out hope
a congressional compromise could be worked out that would ``avoid a
veto on my part.''
   At a morning news conference, Bush repeatedly insisted he has
not wavered in his opposition to a provision passed by the House on
Wednesday, and earlier by the Senate, that would drop a decade-long
ban on federally funded abortions for poor women who are victims of
rape or incest.
   But Bush said House and Senate negotiators working out different
versions of the broader legislation could produce ``room for
flexibility.''
   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this. I'm not going to
change my position any,'' Bush said. ``But let's see how these
negotiations come out, and we'll start discussing that today. But I
have not changed my position.''
   Asked if he was leaving open the question of whether he would
veto the legislation as passed by the House, Bush said, ``Well,
because I'm told that the conference language may be able to avoid
a veto on my part.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said Thursday that there
might be room for a compromise if both sides could agree to a
provision permitting Medicaid abortions when the rape or incest
victim reported that act within 48 hours of its occurrence.
   Bush commented a day after Democratic leaders in Congress
conceded they could not override a Bush veto of the bill and
pleaded with him to reconsider.
   ``The president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor
women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances,'' said House
Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash.
   ``The president's position is wrong,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``It is harsh _ terribly harsh _
on the poorest, most vulnerable American women.''
   In an outcome that surprised even the victors, the House voted
216-206 to permit use of federal money to terminate pregnancies for
poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who report it
``promptly'' to authorities.
   The provision would revise current law permitting Medicaid
abortions only in cases where a woman's life was endangered by
pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion.
   It is part of a $156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health
and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been
approved by the Senate but remains subject to final agreement on
unrelated issues.
   ``Not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the
House of Representatives, Democrat and Republican, and the United
States Senate, but the American people as well,'' Foley said,
joining Mitchell at a press conference to appeal to Bush.
   ``This is a plea to the president to reconsider,'' Mitchell
said. ``The votes are not there in the House to override the veto.
Therefore, he holds it in his power.''
   Bush has been dogged by political controversy on the abortion
issue for a decade, and some anti-abortion groups have questioned
his commitment to their side.
   As a candidate for president in 1980, before becoming Ronald
Reagan's running mate, Bush took the view that there should be
three circumstances permitting abortion _ rape, incest and the
threatened life of the mother.
   He muted those views after joining Reagan's ticket. But once he
started running for president again, Bush made statements that
suggested his position was shifting again.
   In an appearance Oct. 7, 1987, at an Iowa high school, Bush told
a student who questioned him that while he opposes abortion, ``I
would make the exception ... rape, incest and the life of the
mother.''
   The provision passed by the House is narrowly drawn, permitting
funding for abortions when the victims report the rape or incest
``promptly.''
   Experts said the change might affect only a small number of
cases, but it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for
supporters of abortion rights.
   It came as abortion rights forces were benefiting from an
apparently shifting political climate on abortion since the Supreme
Court's ruling in July. That ruling allowed increased state
regulation of abortions, and abortion rights forces say it
politically energized those on their side of the issue.
   The House vote came on the same day abortion rights groups
enjoyed a symbolic victory in Florida. The state legislature, in a
special session called by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, rejected
all the governor's proposed abortion restrictions.
   ``Certainly Florida and the vote yesterday in Congress are
reflective of a new political movement,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
``The climate is changing.''

   Civil rights leaders are demanding that the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy retract implications in his new book that the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had sexual encounters with women on the
night before he was killed.
   A Memphis, Tenn., woman said in an interview published today
that she was with Abernathy and King that night, and she disputed
part of the account in Abernathy's autobiography, ``And The Walls
Came Tumbling Down.''
   In his book, published this month, King's onetime top aide says
King spent parts of the night before his death alone with two
different women and physically fought with a third.
   Abernathy wrote that he awoke from a nap in a woman's living
room after a late-night dinner to see King and the woman emerge
from a bedroom. Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu told The Commercial Appeal in
Memphis that she was host of the dinner and that she and her sister
talked with King and another aide in the living room while
Abernathy, who ``had too many'' drinks, slept on her bed.
   In an interview published today in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Abernathy rejected suggestions by some of the
civil rights leaders that two strokes and brain surgery might have
impaired his memory. ``I am most surprised anybody would think I'm
mentally incompetent,'' Abernathy said.
   Abernathy has said that he did not include passages about King's
extramarital affairs out of malice, but felt he needed to address
the issue since it had been discussed in previous biographies of
the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   ``I loved Martin Luther King more than a brother. I would never
do it to injure him,'' Abernathy said.
   A coalition of black leaders including Jesse Jackson and Andrew
Young said Thursday they objected to the controversial passages and
doubted that Abernathy wrote them. A spokesman for the book's
publisher replied that the whole book was written solely by the
Atlanta minister.
   The group's statement concluded that ``the Memphis section'' of
Abernathy's book was so out of character with Abernathy's life and
previous statements that it must have been ``put into your mouth by
others who needed a sensational story to sell books and slander the
name of your martyred brother.''
   Steve Sorrentino, a spokesman for Harper &amp; Row in New York, said
the allegations are untrue.
   ``The book is entirely Abernathy's words. There was no
co-writer, no ghost writer,'' Sorrentino said. ``He stands by
everything he says in the book. I wonder if all the people sitting
back criticizing now have read the book.
   ``The book is not a sensationalized, `put down Martin Luther
King' book,'' Sorrentino said. ``He reveres Martin Luther King and
takes two pages to address what everyone has talked about before.
He wanted to address it and be honest about it.''
   Abernathy _ appearing to promote the book Thursday in Memphis,
Tenn., where King was slain April 4, 1968 _ said he was surprised
by the uproar.
   ``I'm not Judas,'' he told reporters. ``I know who I am. I'm a
Christian minister.''
   Jesse Hill, chairman of the board of The King Center in Atlanta,
said a number of civil rights leaders including Jackson, Young,
NAACP chief Benjamin Hooks and Southern Christian Leadership
Conference President Joseph Lowery, sent Abernathy a telegram
Sunday calling on him to repudiate his writings.
   ``We take particular exception to your personal reconstruction
of Martin's last hours on this earth,'' said the telegram, read to
reporters by Hill at a news conference in front of King's tomb at
The King Center.
   ``The Ralph we know and love would not have written this
section. ... We deplore the fact that, for this account, if it is
not repudiated, will rob you of your rightful place in history.''
   Jackson issued a statement that the character of King's work
would stand ``when all the dust clears.''
   ``Dr. King cannot speak for himself,'' the statement said.
``Those of us who appreciate Dr. King's work will stand with him
through every challenge.''
   Hooks, in a statement released from NAACP headquarters in
Baltimore, said he had read the book and was ``deeply saddened and
distressed'' that Abernathy ``would succumb to the temptation to
desecrate'' King's memory.
   King Center officials said King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
president of the center, would have no statement other than to
endorse that made by Hill, the center's board chairman.
   John Hurst Adams, an African Methodist Episcopal Church bishop,
said Young, Jackson, Hooks and former King aide Bernard Lee, all of
whom were in Memphis with King on his final days, have ``sharply
different'' recollections of the events of those days.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Friday:
   I have a statement I'd like to make, and then _ some time
constraints _ be glad to answer a few questions.
   I believe that the American flag is a unique and special symbol
of our nation and it should be protected from desecration, and our
administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect
the flag because we believe that is the most _ the most lasting and
legally correct means of protection, a constitutional amendment.
   And yesterday, the House of Representatives agreed to a Senate
bill providing statutory protection for the flag, and when this
measure comes to the House, I will allow the bill to become law,
but without my signature. And I am withholding that signature to
signal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best way
to provide lasting protection for the flag.
   We will continue to work for such an amendment, and I can
understand the rationale of those who voted for this legislation,
but in my view it is not the ultimate answer, and therefore I will
not put my signature on the legislation.
   I would now be glad to take questions, all of which, I am sure
will be on the flag.
   Q. Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. President. You have said on
several occasions that you knew everything at the time of the
Panamanian coup, and you didn't feel that there were any really
problems in retrospective. At the same time, there are many reports
that you've changed the rules of procedure on handling _ on crisis
management, and that you have asked the Hill for more authority to
operate during a coup or plan a coup or whatever. Can you
straighten this out for us? And ...
   A. Let me help you out.
   Q. Obviously there were glitches, or you wouldn't have spent two
weeks trying to defend yourself _ I mean, the administration.
   A. Well, I'm not sure I agree to the last part.
   Q. You have spent two weeks trying to explain to the American
people what you did.
   A. No, this is the first chance _ shot I've had at explaining.
   Q. Not you per se, but your administration.
   A. Oh, I see. No, I _ what was the first part of the question?
   Q. That you have changed the procedures on crisis management,
and ...
   A. No, look, here's what _ it's coming back. Here is my
position. I have not seen any fact in all the reports that have
come out that would make me have done something different in terms
of use of force. And I reiterate that. Now, in terms of procedures,
I'll simply say, any time we can make improvements, so much the
better. But there has not been an intelligence gap that would have
made me act in a different way. And so _ and I repeat that.
   And there's been endless interviews and discussions and stories,
many of which are false, that come out as to what we were asked to
do or not to do. But I've seen no fact that would make me change my
view. And I've seen allegations that we had _ if when I said I
wanted Noriega to get out there, that implied use of force. I hope
I would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief to make a
blanket commitment to use of force if _ without knowing the facts
regarding some coup attempt.
   We want to see Mr. Noriega out. I'll repeat that. I've been very
heartened by the reports from various leaders in our hemisphere.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   about what Noriega should do. So _ but I don't see any serious
disconnects at all. And if we can fine tune our crisis management
system, so much the better. And I think that's what you're reading
about now.

<HEAD>Syrian Says He Flew `Into the Unknown' In Search of Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian pilot who landed his plane in
Israel said today he defected because he wanted to live in a
democracy and would refuse any offer by the Red Cross to return him
to Syria.
   Syria has denied the pilot was a defector and asked the Red
Cross to intervene.
   Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel refused to answer most political
questions at a news conference arranged by the Israeli army, but he
said Syrian pilots considered Israel's air force superior to their
own.
   He recounted how he flew across the border at high speed and as
low as 30 yards off the ground, ``going into the unknown'' in
search of freedom and a place to land.
   He said he made the decision to defect on his own for personal
reasons and had no contact with anyone in Israel before he piloted
his Soviet-built MiG-23 over the Golan Heights from Syria on
Wednesday.
   ``I decided to cross the border in electronic silence,'' he
said. ``I was not in contact with anyone. Nobody was expecting me.
   ``It was a difficult mission. I didn't know where I was going to
land. I didn't know if I would find a facility to land. I was going
into the unknown,'' the 34-year-old flier told Israeli and foreign
reporters.
   Much has been made in Israel over how Adel crossed the border
without being intercepted, although he reporedly was in Israeli air
space for seven minutes before landing.
   ``The section I was crossing was spread all over with
missiles,'' the short, wiry pilot said. ``I crossed at very low
altitude and very high speed.''
   When asked to be specific, Adel said he flew at 700 to 750 mph
and ``below 50 meters (yards), sometimes 30 meters, sometimes 40.''
   Adel, who was dressed in an olive green flight suit, spoke in
Arabic and his words were translated into English by Israeli
officers. The news conference was held at a military base near Tel
Aviv.
   The pilot said he defected in search of freedom.
   ``I wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their
views with freedom,'' he explained.
   Asked to comment on Syrian politics, he repeated his desire for
freedom and added that ``by implication you can presume my thoughts
about the political system in Syria.''
   Adel was asked whether he would see a representative of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, as Syria has requested.
   ``If the Red Cross wants to meet me and take me back to Syria, I
would refuse this,'' he said.
   Asked if he hoped to remain in Israel, he said, ``I said I
wanted to live in a democracy ... so you might conclude I want to
live here.''
   However, he said he had made no definite decisions about his
future.
   Adel would say little about the MiG-23 he piloted across the
Golan Heights to a civilian airstrip near Megiddo, 57 miles north
of Jerusalem in northern Israel. Nor would he compare it to other
Syrian air force planes.
   He also refused to discuss his family and whether he was
discriminated against because of his Sunni Moslem religion in a
country where the president, Hafez Assad, and many military leaders
belong to the minority Alawite sect.
   Adel said he received ``gentle'' treatment from the Israelis,
was asked mainly about his reasons for defecting and had not yet
been questioned about the Syrian air force.
   When asked if Syrian pilots felt they had gained superiority
over Israel, he replied: ``No one in the Syrian air force feels
that they could defeat Israel, that they are superior to Israel.''
   Adel said he was born in the Syrian town of Aleppo and was a
graduate of Syria's Air Force Academy. He said he decided ``a long
time ago'' to defect and had been planning it seriously for three
to four months.

   A fire in a bustling Chinatown neighborhood
detonated 2,000 pounds of illegally stored fireworks, destroyed one
building and injured 17 people, officials said.
   The fire, which broke out about noon in a building that had a
small grocery store on the ground floor, was controlled at 5 p.m.,
but pieces of the building continued to smolder this morning.
   Firefighters worked to finish tearing down the six-story brick
building to prevent it from collapsing.
   The blaze spread to two adjoining buildings, igniting as many as
29 explosions in fireworks stored illegally in one of the buildings
and forcing some of the 200 firefighters to evacuate, said Fire
Commissioner Leo Stapleton.
   ``I'm very distrubed about that,'' Stapleton said. ``We could
have lost a lot of firefighters there.''
   Of the 17 people injured, 13 were were treated at the scene for
minor injuries, three were treated at area hospitals and released,
and one _ a firefighter _ was hospitalized in stable condition
suffering from smoke inhalation, spokesmen said.
   The fire broke out just before noon in the compact and congested
neighborhood of Asian restaurants, bakeries, apartments and small
businesses, casting a pall of thick black and gray smoke over the
city's skyline.
   The fire appeared to have started on the ground floor of the
six-story building, where there were reports that workers might
have been using welding equipment or cutting torches, Stapleton
said. The cause remained under investigation, and preliminary
estimates put the damage at $2 million, he said.
   Damage estimates for the two other buildings were incomplete
early today.
   Within the last month city officials had ordered the stoppage of
illegal construction work at the building where the fire started,
said fire Lt. Joseph McDonnell.
   Firefighters had trouble getting adequate pressure in their
hoses, said Deputy Fire Chief Paul Christian. He said he was unsure
if more pressure might have saved the six-story building, but he
said it might have enabled firefighters to keep the flames from
spreading.
   Officials from the Boston Water and Sewer Commission said two
valves under the street had been closed, possibly by a contractor
doing work in the area.

<HEAD>Brundtland Steps Down as Norway's Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
resigned today, yielding the government to a three-party
non-socialist coalition after 3{ tough years of minority rule.
   Conservative Party Chairman Jan P. Syse, 58, will become prime
minister on Monday. Mrs. Brundtland remains until then as caretaker.
   Mrs. Brundtland's resignation followed a loss by her Labor Party
of eight parliament seats in the Sept. 11 election. The party fell
to 63 seats in the expanded 165-member Storting.
   The 50-year-old prime minister helped topple the same
Conservative-led alliance in 1986, and some analysts predict her
return to power within a year.
   Mrs. Brundtland presented her resignation to King Olav V today
and referred the monarch to Syse about a new government.
   Syse, an attorney, will polish his coalition of the
Conservative, Christian Democratic and Center Parties and assign
Cabinet posts this weekend.
   ``I can assure you the government will be ready at the right
time,'' Syse said after seeing the king.
   The new coalition controls 62 seats. It had the support of the
extreme right 22-seat Party of Progress in its threat to evict
Labor in a no-confidence vote unless Mrs. Brundtland stepped down.
   Labor's ally, the Socialist Left, has 17 seats and there is one
independent.
   Mrs. Brundtland is best known abroad as head of the U.N.
Commission on the Environment and Developement. In opposition, she
is expected to chair parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The coalition's position is tenuous. The anti-tax Progress Party
has said it won't guarantee support, since the coalition refused to
make it a partner.
   ``They won't last more than a year,'' predicted William
Lafferty, an American political scientist who has lived in Norway
for 22 years.
   Gunnar Vogt of the Institute for Social Research said Syse may
even turn to Labor to support some of his programs to avoid being
held to ransom by the extremist parties.
   ``It's anyone's guess'' whether the coalition can last until
elections in 1993, Vogt said in an interview.
   Norway has no mechanism for early elections, and if Syse can't
hold his partnership together, Mrs. Brundtland probably would move
back into the prime minister's office.
   Mrs. Brundtland was credited for helping to cut inflation in
half, turn a trade deficit into a surplus and slow consumer
spending. But she left the country with postwar record unemployment
of 5 percent.

<HEAD>US Navy Chief: Soviet Arms Control Proposals Present Undue Restrictions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS first name in penultimate graf to Sergei sted Moisev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. chief of naval operations says Soviet
arms control proposals would place undue restrictions on the Navy's
ability to protect American interests and ``deter aggression.''
   Adm. Carlisle Trost, the first chief of a U.S. military service
to visit the Soviet Union, made the comments Thursday in a speech
to the Leningrad Naval School. A text of his remarks was made
available to The Associated Press.
   The Navy's top man noted with some amusement that he was
spending today, the 214th anniversary of the founding of the U.S.
Navy, ``here in the Soviet Union, visiting ships in your fleet ...
meeting officers and men in your Navy.
   ``I think that my being here marks a milestone in the progress
that our two countries have made in just the past few years toward
improving bilateral relations and easing some of the tension that
has characterized our dialogue for the past four decades,'' Trost
said.
   But the admiral had few kind words to say about Soviet proposals
to limit U.S. naval power around the world.
   Trost mentioned proposals from the Warsaw Pact and others that
would exclude anti-submarine forces from certain security zones;
exclude all naval force activity from certain strategic straits and
high density shipping lanes; limit naval exercises; or place
restrictions on the movement of ships with nuclear-capable weapons.
   ``Any one of these would result in the inability of my Navy to
protect the global interests of the United States or to deter
aggression. Navy forces must be free to operate when and where
deterrent presence is required, and operate unimpeded by
restrictive sanctions,'' Trost said.
   Trost said he also opposed any restrictions on the use of
sea-launched cruise missiles, calling compliance with any such
limitations ``unverifiable without unacceptably intrusive
inspections.''
   The admiral contended the United States is dependent upon
overseas trade for its economic well-being, whereas ``seaborne
trade for the Soviet Union is not a matter of national survival.''
   ``When viewed from this perspective, I strongly feel that my
country's reluctance to enter into naval arms reductions is
justified by the facts and is a prudent and rational position,''
the admiral said.
   Trost also dismissed Soviet calls for limits on the 14 U.S.
aircraft carriers that ply the high seas, calling them the
``backbone'' of the Navy and a useful tool for deterring ``would-be
aggressors.''
   Trost noted that when former Soviet military chief Sergei
Akhromeyev visited the United States, he said the U.S. Navy and its
bases ``threaten the security of the Soviet Union.''
   But Trost said, ``The U.S. strategy is not intended to threaten
anyone.'' U.S. military forces ``are only a threat to someone who
would intend to threaten our interests or those of our allies,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Board Members, Athletes Quit Over Private School Racial Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two school board members resigned and seven
athletes quit an all-white private school's football team after it
forfeited a game with a school that is fielding a black player.
   ``I just felt it was time I didn't serve on (the board)
anymore,'' said Henry McClellan, a vice president at Holmes
Community College who has been a board member of the East Holmes
Academy for two years. He did not elaborate.
   The resignations and walkout by the players followed
confirmation by East Holmes Headmaster Frank Drake that the school
would not play Columbus Heritage Academy, which has the first black
player in North Central AA Conference history.
   Drake, one of the school's founders, said earlier this week that
race had nothing to do with the decision. He said the action
involved something ``private'' that he could not discuss.
   But several questioned his decision.
   ``It's a racial thing, no question about it,'' said Steve Frank,
whose son was a starting tackle and linebacker before quitting the
team Wednesday.
   Drake refused Thursday to answer additional questions about the
decision.
   A broadcaster also said Thursday in Jackson that former National
Football League player Glen Collins was banned from broadcasting a
game at East Holmes because he is black.
   Lee Adams said he and Collins were scheduled to broadcast the
Jackson Academy-East Holmes game on television on Aug. 25. Collins,
an ex-Mississippi State standout, was told he should not come,
Adams said Thursday.
   Drake denied Adams' charge. ``That was not the case,'' he said.
   Frank Janous, another East Holmes school board member, said he
sent a letter of resignation last Friday after serving on the
governing panel for more than 10 years.
   Asked why he resigned, Janous said: ``I don't want to say ... I
think you probably know.''
   Among the seven atheletes who quit were four starters in
tonight's game against Grenada Kirk Academy. East Holmes has 17
players remaining on its roster.
   ``How do you function?'' asked East Holmes coach Riley Myers.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: about now.    Q. Well, have you asked for greater authority
from the intelligence committees to act in such cases?    A. No, I have
not, but we had a very good meeting with two leaders of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Boren and Cohen, the other day, but I have not asked for that.
We may _ we may _    Q. You're satisfied with the power you have?   
A. Well, I want as broad a power as possible, and I think under the Constitution
a president has it, but I'll be working with the _ has broad powers, broader
than some in the Senate or the House might think. I may have a difference
with some on interpreting what the powers of the president might be, but
I want to work cooperatively with these committees, and it was with that
in mind that we invited Boren and Cohen here, but I've not made specific
requests of them. We might. We might do it. But we have not done it yet.
   Yeah, Terry?    Q. Mr President, Democratic leaders in Congress are
urging you not to veto legislation to remove the ban on federal financing
of abortions for the poor. House Speaker Foley says your position is harsh,
terribly harsh on the poorest, most vulnerable American women. Will you
let that legislation become law?    A. My position is well known and well
stated. And right now there is some negotiation and discussion going on.
I have not read the conference language, and so we're going to be meeting
with some of the various most interested congressional parties on this
and see what can be resolved.    I'm not looking for any conflict over
this. I'm not going to change my position any. But let's see how those
negotiations come out, and we'll start discussing that today. But I have
not changed my position.    Q. But you're leaving it open about whether
or not you would veto this?    A. Well, because I'm told, Terry, that
the conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part.    Yeah,
Lesley?    Q. Mr. President, in other words, you are willing to negotiate
or accept a compromise that in some way would allow federal funding
for abortions in cases of rape or incest.    A. No, I've already said
what I'm willing to do _ discuss the conference language.    Yeah, Owen?
   Q. Let me ask you specifically. Are you _    A. Is this a follow-up?
   Q. Yes. Are you willing to compromise?    A. I'm not willing _ I've
already told you my position.    Yeah?    Q. Let me ask you a question
about your position. Can you explain why you believe it's all right for
women who can afford an abortion on their own, that in cases where they
are raped or in cases of incest that it's permissible, but that for poor
women who cannot afford abortions, it is not permissible to help them get
abortions in cases of rape and incest?    A.Owen, the only answer I can
give you on that is to go back to the original Hyde Amendment, and to the
position that I took and will stay with. And to some, there might be a
contradiction there; to me, there is none.    Yes, John?    Q. If I may
follow, sir, I mean, it's not a question of a contradiction. It seems
that if you can pay it yourself, it's okay under those circumstances, but
the message, it seems, is that if you can't afford it yourself, tough luck.
And isn't that a moral conflict in your own position?    A. There _ no,
I don't think it's a moral conflict in my own position.    Yes, John?
   Q. Mr. President, could I return to Panama for an instant?    A. Yes.
   Q. Would you _ what message are you sending _ you say you want Noriega
out _ what message are you sending the PDF then? Would you like them to
attempt another coup, or is that out of the question?    A. Well, I don't
think anything's out of the question. I think that from what I've seen,
and the reports I've heard out of Panama, things are more unsettled than
before about the fate of Noriega. I would simply reiterate that we have
no problem with the PDF itself. I think this rather sophisticated argument
that if you say you'd like to see Noriega out, that implies a blanket open
_ open carte blanche on the use of American force. I don't want to mislead
somebody, and to me that's a _ you know _ a stupid argument that some very
erudite people make.

   President Bush, reflecting on the failed coup
against Manuel Antonio Noriega, said today he still hopes to see
Panama's leader ousted and brought to justice and added, ``I
wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner.''
   At a mid-morning news conference in the White House, Bush said
he opposes House-passed legislation providing federal funds for
abortions for poor women who are victims of incest or rape. But the
president said he hoped compromise language would make it possible
to avoid a veto of the politically charged legislation.
   On another controversial subject, Bush said he would permit
legislation banning flag burning to become law without his
signature. He said the legislation wasn't ``the ultimate answer,''
and urged a constitutional amendment to do the same thing.
   Bush signaled his desire for flexibility on other issues, as
well, including Democratic calls for expanded individual retirement
accounts and legislation to repeal catastrophic health care for the
elderly.
   But there was no give on his defense of his much-criticized
handling of the failed coup attempt in Panama two weeks ago, when
U.S. troops stationed nearby were not directed to intervene on
behalf the rebels.
   ``I would hope I would never be reckless enough as
commander-in-chief to make a commitment to force without knowing
the facts'' of a coup attempt. He said he'd seen no evidence of a
crucial gap in intelligence.
   ``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent
manner,'' he said in defending the decision not to take part in the
coup. ``So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''
   While saying he would not change his decision against using
force, Bush acknowledged complaints about poor communication and
other problems by the United States. He said they were ``well worth
looking into'' and that he was not opposed to ``fine-tuning'' his
crisis-management system.
   He hinted broadly he might seek congressional approval for
greater authority in dealing with situations like the coup in
Panama. ``We may, we may,'' he said. ``I want as broad a power as
possible and I think under the Constitution the president has it.''
   Bush continued his defense even as he was walking out of the
briefing room.
   ``I can understand instant hawks appearing from where there used
to be the feathers of a dove, because some of it is political and
some of it is the frustration they feel because this man (Noriega)
is still in office,'' he said.
   Bush also urged Congress to approve his plan for a cut in the
capital gains tax, and said he would consider signing legislation
that combined his plan with a Democratic proposal liberalizing
individual retirement accounts.
   ``The mixing of IRAs and capital gains in this debate is
troublesome to me,'' Bush said. ``Whether there is room for
compromise on that, I'd leave it to those who are negotiating.''
   Most of the attention during the question-and-answer session was
focused on Noriega.
   The Panamanian leader is under indictment in the United States
for drug trafficking, and the president said he's not willing to
have the indictment dropped in exchange for Noriega giving up power.
   He blended his call for Noriega's ouster with his defense of his
own actions two weeks ago.
   ``I am not going to give carte blanche support for an operation,
particularly when they don't ask for that support,'' he said. ``I
have to reserve that right, I have at stake the lives of American
kids.''
   Bush brushed aside critics who said he missed an opportunity to
assist in Noriega's ouster in the failed coup.
   ``I've seen no fact that would make me change my view,'' he said.
   On the flag legislation, the president said: ``I will allow the
bill to become law, but without my signature. I am withholding that
signature to signal our belief that the constitutional amendment is
the best way to provide protection for the flag.''
   Asked about attempts in Congress to repeal catastrophic health
care legislation for the elderly, Bush said he was ``letting the
congressional process hash this out.'
   Bush was asked repeatedly about the volatile abortion issue, and
said he hoped he could avoid a veto of legislation that calls for
Medicaid funding for abortions for poor women who are victims of
rape and incest.
   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' he said.
   ``My position is well known and well stated and right now there
is some negotiations and discussion going on,'' said Bush. Aides
have suggested Bush would likely veto the bill if the House version
is embraced in the Senate.
   He said he wanted to see if there is ``room for flexibility.''
   The House has passed the provision and sent it to the Senate,
which approved similar provision a year ago and is expected to do
so again. ``The conference language may be able to avoid a veto on
my part.''

<HEAD>Pope Celebrates Final Mass of Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEDAN, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pope today celebrated the final Mass
of his Indonesian tour and urged Catholics here to be bold in
proclaiming Christian values in this predominantly Moslem nation.
   The pontiff stressed themes of family and social teaching at his
final stops but also acknowledged difficulties facing the church in
Indonesia.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro gave a positive summation of
the trip, saying no obstacles had been placed before the pope and
that he spoke with ``absolute freedom.''
   But the pontiff again used guarded language when referring to
potential conflicts with the government or Moslem community.
   His last Mass here was attended by 100,000 people amid lush
coffee and palm oil plantations in North Sumatra.
   In a speech to the country's 42 bishops later in Jakarta, John
Paul urged Catholics to be bold in proclaiming their Christian
values. He acknowledged ``occasional difficulties'' facing his 5
million-member flock but reminded them that religious freedom is
protected by the constitution.
   There are 157 million Moslems in Indonesia.
   ``Do not be afraid to encourage the Catholic people to (be) an
ever more public witness to the truths and values of their faith,
in keeping with their rightful place in the society of which they
are worthy citizens,'' he told the bishops.
   Raising another delicate issue, the pope said ``You are
sometimes painfully aware that certain traditional practices and
other contemporary social influences bring about an obscuring of
fundamental principles regarding family life and the responsible
transmission of life.''
   He did not elaborate but was apparently referring to polygamy
and the government's aggressive birth control program. The church
bars artificial birth control.
   The church as well as the government here is concerned about
increasing pressure from Moslem extremists.
   The Moslem influence is reflected in two proposed laws before
parliament. One would make Islamic religious teaching mandatory in
all schools, including Catholic ones, and the other would set up
Islamic courts for marriages, wills and inheritances.
   The only trouble during the pope's stay occurred Thursday in
East Timor, when youths opposed to Indonesian rule of the former
Portuguese colony clashed with police at the end of the papal mass.
They held up banners greeting the pope in the name of an
anti-Indonesian guerrilla group.
   Navarro said John Paul watched the incident calmly and made no
mention of it afterward.
   The pope is scheduled to leave Saturday for the Indian Ocean
island nation of Mauritius. He returns to Rome on Monday.

<HEAD>Ninty-six Cents Worth of Stamps Gets Record $1.1 Million at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four 24-cent stamps printed in 1918 to
inaugurate U.S. air mail delivery fetched $1.1 million at an
auction, the highest price ever paid for a stamp collectors' item,
officials said.
   The airplane depicted on the stamps was inadvertently printed
upside down.
   The stamps, considered the finest philatelic item in the United
States, are called ``Curtiss Jenny'' because the airplane shown is
a model Curtiss JN-6, which carried the first air mail deliveries,
said Scott Trepel of Christie's auction house.
   Christie's, which handled the sale, identified the buyer at
Thursday's auction only as ``an American broadcast executive.''
   The stamps were uncanceled and included a border bearing the
four-digit number of the plate used to print the stamps.
   Another block of four Curtiss Jenny stamps that did not include
the plate number sold for $528,000.
   The original sheet bearing 100 Curtiss Jenny stamps was bought
for $24 in 1918 in a Washington, D.C. post office by a private
collector.
   The Curtiss Jenny stamps and other philatelic items sold at
Christie's were from the collection of Raymond Weill, 74, and his
brother, Roger, 78, renowned stamp dealers who have run a stamp
shop in the French Quarter of New Orleans since 1932.
   The 342 lots auctioned went for a total of $4.29 million.
   Another big seller was a block of four U.S. stamps bearing a
picture of a car that inadvertently was printed upside down.
   The stamps, issued in 1901 to commemorate the opening of the
Pan-American exposition in Buffalo, N.Y., sold for $203,500, Trepel
said.
   Among the other items sold was a telegram cover with a Pony
Express insignia, which went for $99,000. The telegram was sent in
1860 from the East Coast to San Francisco, but since the telegraph
line terminated in St. Joseph, Mo., the last leg of the journey
between Missouri and California was made by Pony Express.

   Several black General Motors Corp. workers are
challenging a settlement of a racial descrimination lawsuit against
the company, saying the payout is too small.
   Attorneys said the settlement could cost GM $3 million
immediately and up to $40 million over the next five years.
   An appeal filed Thursday with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Cincinnati says the case was poorly handled and the
settlement too small.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge John Feikens approved a
settlement of the lawsuit originally filed by four employees in
1983. It became a class action suit three years later involving
10,000 black GM workers in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.
   The black workers claimed an employee appraisal system, dropped
by the automaker after the suit was filed, resulted in lower pay
and fewer promotions for blacks between 1982 and 1986.
   GM issued a statement Thursday saying the settlement was fair.
   Godfrey Dillard, an attorney who represents a group of black GM
employees challenging the settlement, said the appeal will stop
implementation of the settlement.
   Dennis James, an attorney who negotiated the settlement for the
plaintiffs, said the appeal would cost about $1 million a year in
attorneys' fees.

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberations In Wedtech Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury began deliberating today whether
Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife extorted payoffs from the Wedtech
Corp., a defunct defense contractor.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who instructed the jurors
Thursday afternoon, told them to begin their discussions at 10:30
a.m.
   Also Thursday, the panel heard closing arguments from Garcia's
lawyer, who said the prosecution did not prove the couple's guilt.
   ``No one was paying off Bobby Garcia,'' Robert Morvillo said.
Garcia helped Wedtech get government contracts because he was a
good public official, he said.
   The lawyer described Garcia as a dedicated and honest politician
who rose from the ghetto to represent his neighborhood in
Washington.
   ``Bobby Garcia wants nothing more than to go back to the South
Bronx and serve his constituents,'' he said.
   Morvillo said the $76,000 that the government contends was
funneled by Wedtech to Mrs. Garcia's consulting firm to pay for
Garcia's political influence was for work unrelated to Wedtech.
   A $20,000 loan Garcia received from the company was ``a loan
among friends,'' he said.
   He claimed Garcia asked Mario Moreno, the former Wedtech vice
chairman, to make the loan to the congressman's sister, who passed
the money on to Mrs. Garcia, because he knew it wouldn't look right
to take a loan from a constituent.
   Congress members are not required to report loans from family
members on their financial disclosure forms, Morvillo said. He
noted that the loan was promptly repaid.
   Garcia, a 56-year-old Democrat, and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia,
are accused of conspiring to obtain $185,000 in checks and
interest-free loans, and a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs.
Garcia, from officials of the now-defunct Wedtech Corp.
   The couple was charged in a seven-count indictment with
conspiracy, extortion, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities.
If convicted of extortion, they face up to 20 years in prison.
   Their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at
Wedtech, the small South Bronx machine shop that grew into a
multimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribe
schemes. The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of
corruption.
   Morvillo attacked the credibility of Moreno, the government's
key witness.
   ``Did Mario Moreno lie in this case? Yes,'' Morvillo said. ``He
lied about everything that would incriminate these people.''
   Moreno pleaded guilty to theft- and bribe-related charges in
1987 and testified at other Wedtech trials.
   In the prosecution's rebuttal which followed Morvillo's
arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Little denied the
defense's argument that the prosecution presented a one-witness
case.
   He said 27 other witnesses and 500 documents corroborated
Moreno's testimony.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: IRA, right?    A. I'm not ruling out anything in that
regard. I am ruling in capital gains. But, I'm not suggesting that by answering
the question that way, that we go off on a _ that this is some instruction
to our side in the Senate to do something different on IRA.    Yeah? 
  Q. I want to go back to what you called your critics ``stupid argument''
about Panama.    A. That one argument is the one I _ not all the other
critics _    Q. You've said since the beginning of the year that you thought
Noriega should go.    A. Yes.    Q, And you've said so loudly and publicly.
But when push came to shove a few weeks ago, it wasn't clear that the U.S.
did very much to lend a hand.    A. Right.    Q. So the question is,
is it responsible or consistent to, on the one hand, call publicly for
Noriega's ouster, but then to do nothing?    A. Yes. Absolutely. Totally
consistent. I want to see him out of there and I want to see him brought
to justice. And that should not imply that that automatically means,
no matter what the plan is or no matter what the coup attempt is or what
the effort is, diplomatically and anything else, that we give carte blanche
support to that.    Follow-on.    Q. Some people would say you don't
have to give carte blanche support to all situations like that, but you
have to lend a hand _    A. To the support that we didn't, yeah. In other
words, what they're trying to argue _ look, let's be fair with each other.
What they're saying is _ and it's only a handful of critics _ ``You said
you wanted Noriega out. You say you have no argument with the PDF. An element
tries to get him out. And you didn't support him.''    And I'm saying,
yes, I want him out, and yes, we have no argument with the PDF. But I am
not going to give carte blanche support to an operation, particularly when
they don't ask for the support.'' And I have to reserve that right. I have
at stake the lives of American kids. And I am not going to easily thrust
them into a battle unless I feel comfortable with it, unless those
general officers in whom I have total confidence have _ feel comfortable.
   So, my argument is with the ``argument.'' My argument is with the argument
that when I say, you know, I'd like to see Noriega out, that that means
carte blanche commitment on my part of American force. I'm not going to
do that.    Yeah. These two.    Q. Mr. President, the LA Times is reporting
today that the Justice Department has given the FBI the go ahead to arrest
fugitives in foreign countries without the foreign country's consent. Now,
this reverses the Carter administration's policy. Can you tell us what
led up to this event, and perhaps what _    A. No. I'm _    Q. Noriega
has to do with that, because he's a fugitive? The FBI can go into Panama
now.    A. I'm embarrassed to say I don't know what it is your _ I'll
have to get back to you with the answer to your question.    Marlin, will
you take care of that?    MR. FITZWATER: I'm not sure that's happened.
   A. I don't know what it _ I've not seen the LA Times report, so I'll
just have to not comment until I do.    Q. Mr. President, your explanation
of why you did not back the coup seemed to imply that it would almost have
to be an American operation and an American-planned operation before you
would use American troops. Is that a misreading of what you've said? 
  A. A little bit, yeah. A little bit.    Q. Well, could you explain by
what you _ I'm only a little bit off?    A. Yeah, just a hair, because
if the circumstances under this coup plan had been different, the requests
had been different and the facts on the ground had been different in terms
of what we knew, we might well have done something different. So I _ is
that helpful?    Q I'm not sure. I have one other question on Panama,
if I may.    A. Have two, come on.

of Panama. And I know your vice president a week or so ago said Mr. Ford

by members of your campaign for vetoing a bill mandating teachers

it.    Q. Are you politically afraid, sir, to veto the flag statute if
you truly believe it's the wrong way to go?    A. No, I think it's an
expression, an overwhelming expression on the part of the Congress, to
do something about the protection of the flag. So, I'm not going to veto
it. But I don't think it's enough. So, I'm saying I'm not going to sign
it, and that's a symbol that I don't think it's enough. But I don't want

think it's enough. I don't see a parallel at all, although I read an argument
that was thrown out there on that, I don't agree with it.    Yes?   
Q. Mr. President, there is another controversial issue up on the Hill in
the last couple of weeks which is catastrophic health insurance for the
elderly. As somebody who initially supported that program, don't you think
you have more of an obligation to figure out a way out of the current
mess than to simply say you want the program to continue but that it's
up to the Congress to figure out a way to reduce the premiums that have
to be paid to keep it in force?    A. No.    Have you got a follow-up?
   Q. Well, yeah, I mean _    A. You're asking me a question, do I feel
it, and I said no.    Q. Fair enough.    A. And I don't.    Q. But if
that's the case, why not offer a suggestion about how to keep this program
from repeal and keep it financial viable at the same time?    A. Well,
we've got very able congressional leaders who don't agree on this. And
it isn't all that clear what ought to be done on it. And so, we are letting
the congressional process hash this out. And if there is something that's
unsatisfactory to us, I have no hesitancy to step in there.    Yeah, Tom,
and over here.    Q. Mr. President, you mentioned remarks of the prime
minister of Spain earlier. One of the things he said was to propose a deal,
I guess it's a new proposal of an old deal where General Noriega would
step down in exchange for the U.S. dropping criminal charges against him.
Is that a deal you can live with?    A. I didn't _ I don't recall that

isn't some grandstanding appeal. I can't drop those indictments _    Q.
What do you think _    A. _ or encourage that they be dropped. I'm not

<HEAD>Sources Say Congress Partly to Blame for Coup Failure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 5 new grafs after 5th graf, There was, with additional
comment from Bush, Sen. Cohen; edits for transition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Intelligence sources say Congress is partly to
blame for U.S. inaction during last week's failed Panamanian coup
because lawmakers precluded at least one covert action for which
President Bush sought clearance.
   And President Bush today renewed his implicit invitation for
rebels to overthrow Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega and
renewed the promise of U.S. help. ``I wouldn't mind using force if
it could be done in a prudent manner,'' Bush said at a news
conference. ``So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''
   Members of the House Intelligence Committee earlier this year
barred the Bush administration from exercising certain unspecified
options in Panama ``that might have led to a different outcome'' in
the coup, according to intelligence sources who spoke Thursday on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The reason we didn't have total information (as the coup
unfolded) was because of the action of some members of the
Intelligence Committee,'' said one source.
   There was ``interference'' and ``second-guessing'' when the
administration proposed a set of actions designed to give it better
inside knowledge of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the source said.
   At his news conference, Bush said he has made no specific
request of the Senate and House intelligence committees since the
coup for additional authority in Panama. But, he added, ``we
might'' make such a request later.
   ``I think under the Constitution a president has ... broad
powers, broader than some in the Senate or the House might think...
I want to work cooperatively with these committees.''
   Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the senior Republican on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said policymakers need to provide better
guidelines as to when U.S. personnel can become involved in a coup,
particularly when there is the possibility of assassination _
something banned under current policy.
   ``Does it follow from this prohibition that American personnel
are confined to a purely passive role of gathering intelligence?''
Cohen said in a statement.
   ``Or are there circumstances in which they could provide
information or assistance to groups seeking to overthrow
dictatorial governments and establish democracies? There appears to
be confusion surrounding this question.''
   On Thursday, the Bush administration denied Noriega's allegation
the United States paid $1 million to rebel officers to launch last
week's failed coup. The administration contends U.S. officials were
notified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did not
play a part in planning it.
   The intelligence sources said the Bush administration notified
Congress earlier this year of options involving Panama in an
intelligence ``finding,'' a document required to be given to
Congress before covert actions are undertaken.
   Some of the loudest criticism of Bush's handling of the Oct. 3
coup attempt against Noriega by PDF rebel officers has come from
members of Congress, including Senate Intelligence Committee
Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.
   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., without
mentioning names, said Thursday that there is ``plenty in the
(classified) record ... to know that some of these people are going
far beyond what they've got the ight to say about the
administration's requests in the past, what was granted and what
was denied.''
   One member of the House Intelligence Committee alluded to the
congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill
for intelligence agencies, saying Bush's cautious response to the
coup was justified in part by interference from the Democratic
Congress.
   ``Who could expect this administration or any administration, or
any intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we have
lashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them they
better not do anything?'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.
   Shuster noted that some on Capitol Hill have said Bush has
received ``everything he wanted with regard to Panama.''
   ``And yet we know there are those who have gone to the White
House and threatened them with exposure (of) classified
information, and said, `You dare not engage in covert
operations,''' Shuster said.
   Boren said on NBC television last weekend, ``Since George Bush
became president, every single word of authority that he has
requested from the Intelligence Committee and every single penny
that he has requested from the Intelligence Committee relating to
Panama, he has gotten and he has gotten with my support.''
   Noriega told reporters for The Los Angeles Times and The Boston
Globe that Panamanian investigators discovered a bank account in
the name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup
leaders, with more than $1 million.
   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,''
Noriega was quoted as saying. ``Six zeroes. It was a million dollar
account.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday in
Gulfport, Miss., ``The State Department says it's absurd, the
National Security Council says there's nothing to it and I say we
don't believe anything Noriega says.''
   But the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday reported today that
the Central Intelligence Agency played a role in planning the coup,
including advising rebel officers to seize Noriega at a meeting
U.S. officials were certain he would attend.
   Attributing the information to unidentified congressional and
administration sources, the newspaper said the CIA's advice was a
major factor in the delay of the coup by one day.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges Continued Military Might as Conservatives End Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today
said it has been ``a fantastic year for freedom'' but told her
Conservative Party that despite this, military might must not be
allowed to lag.
   She also scorned the opposition Labor Party for abandoning its
policy of unilateral disarmament, calling it a desperate move to
win votes.
   In a speech to the final session of the Conservative Party's
four-day conference, Mrs. Thatcher also gave strong support to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, whose recent decision to
boost interest rates has caused discontent within party ranks.
   ``The torch of freedom we lit in Britain all those years ago,
the symbol of our party, has shed its light across the Iron Curtain
into Eastern Europe,'' she said.
   ``What a fantastic year this has been for freedom _ 1989 will be
remembered for decades to come as the year when the people of half
our continent began to throw off their chains.''
   The prime minister turned 64 today, and as she entered the
conference hall, an organist played ``When I'm 64.''
   Despite the changes in the communist world, Mrs. Thatcher said
the potential for conflict lurked around the world.
   ``Yes, we are ready to negotiate to reduce the levels of weapons
on both sides, but only so long as it can be done without
jeopardizing our security,'' she said.
   The opposition Labor Party's call for a 25 percent cut in
defense spending, she said, would endanger that security, and she
scorned Labor's new commitment to multilateral instead of
unilateral disarmament.
   ``Labor's supposed conversion to multilateralism is no more than
a confidence trick to try to make Labor electable,'' she said.
   Turning to economics, Mrs. Thatcher said she understood that
higher interest rates worried home owners, farmers and small
businesses. ``But when the choice is between high rates now, or
persistent higher inflation later, with all the damage that would
do, the choice is clear.
   ``Inflation will come down through the use of high interest
rates as it has in the past,'' she said, and commended Lawson and
his predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, as ``the two finest chancellors
of the exchequer since the war.''
   Interest rates are now at an eight-year high of 15 percent and
will remain high in an effort to curb the 7.3 percent inflation
rate, Lawson said Thursday.
   Despite fears of an economic crisis and persistently poor poll
ratings, the traditionally loyal and well-discplined party
activists have cheered some uncompromising messages from Cabinet
ministers during the conference.
   But outside the conference hall, there have been expressions of
unease.
   ``Many people are feeling rather let down,'' delegate Peter
Brown said Thursday after Lawson announced the continued high
interest rates.
   ``They are rather upset that after 10 years of Conservative rule
we should have got into these rather difficult times,'' Brown said.
   At fringe meetings, there also were signals the Conservatives
need to find a new agenda after dominating the decade with
right-wing policies based on tight money, curbing unions, selling
off nationalized industries and building up Britain's nuclear
arsenal.
   Howe warned that the party needed to ensure that ``people
recognize us as a listening party, just as much as a crusading
one.''
   The interest rates, hitting homeowners and businesses, have
exacerbated the Conservatives' problems, midway through Mrs.
Thatcher's third term. She has been in office 11 years.
   Polls show widespread opposition to key sections of her current
political program _ a shakeup of the National Health Service, plans
to sell off to private enterprise the water and electric utilities,
and a new property tax.
   Meanwhile, the socialist Labor Party has adopted a new, more
moderate platform and is presenting the Conservatives with their
most serious challenge since 1979, when Mrs. Thatcher ousted Prime
Minister James Callaghan's Labor government.
   Labor has been in the lead in poll ratings for the past four
months and now has an average 7-point edge.

   Thousands of radical students staged
anti-U.S. protests today, burning American flags and hurling rocks
at police after fellow students broke into the U.S. ambassador's
home and went on a half-hour rampage.
   Ambassador Donald Gregg and his wife escaped unhurt from the
incident in which students, hurling homemade bombs and swinging
iron bars, smashed artwork and other objects before police dragged
them out.
   Later, about 2,000 radical students demonstrated against the
U.S. or South Korean governments on at least 11 college campuses in
Seoul, Inchon and Kwangju, police said. They said about two dozen
students were arrested.
   At Konkuk, Sogang and Kyunghee universities in Seoul, hundreds
of students hurled rocks and firebombs and fought police, who fired
tear gas. They burned American flags and effigies of President Bush
and South Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   The six students who occupied the Greggs' home gained entry by
throwing homemade bombs to distract police guards outside the
residence, police said. They then scaled the wall around the house,
throwing tear gas to keep guards away.
   The Greggs said they heard the intruders on the other side of
their locked bedroom door but managed to escape via a side door.
   After occupying part of the residence, the students blocked the
main door with chairs and sprayed the floor with paint thinner,
which they threatened to ignite if police attacked, officials said.
   Unlike the U.S. Embassy, the ambassador's residence is not
guarded by U.S. Marines. Korean police are responsible for guarding
the outside of the house.
   Embassy officials said they would review the security system.
   The students who attacked the residence were from a
self-proclaimed ``Anti-U.S. Death Squad.'' They were protesting
U.S. pressures on South Korea to open its markets and demanded that
Roh cancel his visit next week to Washington for talks with
President Bush.
   In Washington, a State Department official said Gregg was on his
way to the United States to prepare for Roh's visit.
   The attackers smashed objects and rampaged through the house in
central Seoul for about 30 minutes before riot troopers firing tear
gas forced their way inside and seized the students, police said.
   ``Punish Gregg!'' and ``We oppose U.S. trade pressure!'' the
students shouted. One was draped in a South Korean flag.
   Police said one student was slightly injured in the scuffle.
They said they were searching for four other students who helped
the six attackers into the compound.
   Gregg and his wife, Meg, said they were sleeping when they heard
an explosion near dawn. They did not see the students but heard
them on the other side of their locked bedroom door.
   Gregg dismissed the attack as the work ``of six people who broke
into our home, and I don't put a larger signifiance on it than
that.''
   In Newark, N.J., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters Thursday that Bush ``just asked if they (the Greggs) were
safe and I assured him they were.''
   Radical students have tried to use Gregg's appointment to
galvanize anti-U.S. protests, contending the former Seoul CIA
station chief was sent to South Korea to impose military rule. They
held anti-Gregg protests after he arrived in September, burning the
ambassador in effigy.
   Gregg's appointment was opposed by some U.S. senators because of
charges he misled Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra affair
as then-Vice President Bush's national security adviser. Some South
Korean opposition leaders questioned whether a former CIA official
was a suitable choice as ambassador, but the Seoul government said
it welcomed the appointment.
   South Korea's governing Democratic Justice Party condemned the
attack as a ``senseless riot,'' and the main opposition parties
also denounced it.
   South Korea's radical students are a small but vocal minority on
college campuses. They have little public support because of their
violent tactics and extremist views.
   The radicals oppose Seoul's ties with the United States,
claiming the government is a front for American rule. They have
staged a series of attacks on U.S. facilities to demand withdrawal
of the 43,000 American troops based in South Korea.
   They also want the United States to stop trying to make South
Korea drop import barriers to help reduce Washington's huge trade
debt with Seoul.
   Many South Koreans believe the U.S. trade pressure is unfair,
contending their markets are still vulnerable to competitive
foreign products.
   However, the National Assembly today adopted a resolution urging
the government to work out a gradual timetable for opening South
Korean markets.
   In a rare compromise, the governing party and three opposition
parties joined forces for the resolution, which said agricultural
markets should be opened gradually and carefully after considering
the nation's ``vulnerable agricultural structure.''

<HEAD>Blacks Plan Celebrations, Prisoners Transferred to Hometowns</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with Sisulu, others at jail near Soweto,
details. No pickup.</HEAD>

   Blacks nationwide planned huge
celebration marches as black leader Walter Sisulu and several
colleagues were flown today to jails in their hometowns in
preparation for their release.
   In Soweto outside Johannesburg, police informed Sisulu's wife,
Albertina, that restrictions on her had been lifted and said her
husband would be freed this weekend.
   Sisulu, 77, who has been jailed for 25 years, is one of eight
political prisoners whose unconditional release was approved by the
government Tuesday. He is the most prominent jailed leader of the
African National Congress guerrilla movement after Nelson Mandela.
   The release of Mandela, 71, has not been approved.
   Seven of the prisoners to be freed are ANC leaders. The other,
Jafta Masemola, belongs to a smaller black nationalist guerrilla
movement, the Pan Africanist Congress.
   Sisulu and at least four of the other prisoners were flown to
Johannesburg early today from Cape Town, where they had been
jailed, airline officials said. They were visited by lawyers later
at Diepkloof Prison, near Soweto.
   Another of the group, Raymond Mhlaba, was flown from Cape Town
to his hometow, Port Elizabeth.
   The oldest of the eight, Oscar Mpetha, 80, remained at Cape
Town's Groote Schuur Hospital, where he has been for much of his
term, but spent part of the day being fitted for a new suit. Mpetha
lives near Cape Town.
   Anti-apartheid leaders applied to magistrates to hold what they
called ``victory marches'' in 17 cities and towns across the
country Saturday to celebrate the releases, which are all expected
over the next few days.
   The New Nation, a militant anti-apartheid newspaper, said at
least 250,000 people were expected to join the marches. Its front
page today was printed in the green, black and gold colors of the
outlawed African National Congress, and it carried pictures of
seven of the prisoners under the headline ``ANC Lives.''
   Mrs. Sisulu, speaking to reporters at her home, said she would
join the planned march in Johannesburg.
   She also said she received political advice from Mandela on
Tuesday, when she and other activists met with him at his prison
quarters near Cape Town.
   Mrs. Sisulu, who had been banned from attending meetings and
making public statements since February 1988, said police came to
her home to tell her of the restrictions being lifted.
   ``I was wondering how I was going to cope at my house if my
husband was not restricted and I'm restricted,'' she said. ``I was
surprised.''
   She is co-president of the banned United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and she vowed to resume her
political activities.
   ``If I'm free, really, I must go on with my work in the
struggle,'' she said in an interview with Radio 702, an independent
Johannesburg station.
   Despite her restrictions, Mrs. Sisulu, 71, was issued a
short-term passport by the government earlier this year so she
could travel abroad with other anti-apartheid leaders. She met
President Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand and officials
of other Western governments.
   Sisulu was a close friend and colleague of Mandela and, as the
African National Congress' general secretary, was a key strategist
for the movement.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: too much.    Q. Mr. President, when you were saying
before that you wouldn't allow a carte blanche to any attempted coup in
Panama, you're reserving to yourself the right to evaluate the merits of
any potential coup. This implies, however, better communications with the
participants than you had. In fact, it appears that the United States didn't
know a good deal of the time what was going on during the crucial hours
of that Tuesday coup in Panama. What sort of urgency _ here's the question
_ what sort of urgency are you giving to improving those procedures? 
  A. We're reviewing the procedures to see, but, if there's some, can't,
if we can't do it better. But let me just reiterate: There's enough known
about this that nothing different would have happened, and I keep coming
back to that as the fundamental point. That isn't to say we can't do things
better, but you've got to look at where these _ in this particular instance
_ the people were coming from, what they _ what their objectives were.
I know what the United States' objectives are: one, Noriega brought
to justice; and, very important, a Panama under democratic rule, not deny
the people the very election that they had. And so these are our objectives.
These are the objectives of the United States. And I will look at whatever
comes up in the future with those objectives in mind.    Q. Well, just
to follow, on the day of the coup _    A. Hey, I've got a 10:00 meeting.
   Q. On the day of the coup we hear about telephone calls that aren't
returned, we hear about people who are using phone numbers that they're
_    A. Yeah.    Q. _ given for contact with the U.S. and when they call,
they do not get help. The official _    A. That's well worth looking into.
   Q. _ ( ff mike) _    A. Exactly.    Q. That's what I mean when I
suggest the urgency about it.    A. No. I think you've got a good point
there. And we will be doing everything we can to fine tune the mechanism.
Everyone knows that, when you have a combat situation, and there was
with the PDF and the coup people, it isn't all that clear. But to the degree
we can improve our communications, fine. But I don't feel _ again, I want
to just end up where I started. I don't feel, in looking at all the charges
and the allegations of this nature and having them assessed both here and
down in Panama by our leaders, that it would have led me as the president
to do something different in this particular coup.    But you raise a
very good point. When I hear something that there was a, you know, a phone
number given and nobody answers the phone, we'll find out what's the importance
_ what's the significance of that.    I really do have a 10:00.    This
is not a _    Q. How's your hand?    A. Lesley, I was hoping you'd ask.
   Q. Secretary Baker said the military a _    Q. Why did you put a ``gag
order'' on members of the administration telling them not to second-guess
how you and other members of the administration handled _    A. Listen,
we've been blessed in this administration by a good team who don't like
the game of ``who's up, who's down, who's winning, who's losing, who's
looking good, who's in, who's out.'' And I did not have to have any gag
order because all of them are singing from the same sheet of music. So
there wasn't a gag order.    Q. You didn't tell people to stop complaining?
   A. No.    Q. A week ago?    A. No.    Q. Did you get angry?   
A. And I didn't get angry. I didn't get angry.    Q. What did you _ 
  A. What I did say is I don't want to see any blame coming out of the
Oval Office, or attributed to the Oval Office, in the face of criticism.
I'm not in the blame business. Blame, if there's some to be assigned, it
comes in there, and that's where it belongs.

   A raucous party near the University of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh turned into melee when police arrived to break it
up, with students breaking windows and damaging cars, officials
said today.
   Seventeen people were arrested and charged with disorderly
conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assembly and disturbing the
peace, said Sgt. Ron Eichman.
   Some 60 police officers, university police, the Winnebago County
Sheriff's Department and the State Patrol were called to quell the
disturbance Thursday night and early today, Eichman said.
   ``Let's call it what it is, a disturbance,'' Eichman said,
adding he did not consider it a riot.
   An estimated 500 to 600 students gathered after officers arrived
shortly after 10 p.m. Thursday to check on a loud party across the
street from the university campus, Eichman said.
   Some students began marching down the street toward the
downtown, breaking car and business windows, damaging street signs
and strewing garbage, he said.
   Some officers sustained minor injuries when they were struck by
debris, he said.
   ``Two people were arrested for disturbing the peace at the
party, but we didn't get any further because it mushroomed into
something a little bigger,'' he said.

   The season's 10th tropical storm formed today after
a depression strengthened rapidly off the Mexican coast,
forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and
was moving north through the Gulf of Mexico at about 8 mph,
according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Forecasters predicted some further increase in Jerry's strength
today. They said there was about a 10 percent chance of the storm's
center passing within 65 miles of various Gulf Coast points from
Brownsville, Texas, to Gulfport, Miss. by 7 a.m. Monday.
   At noon EDT, the storm's center was located at 22.3 north
latitude and 93.4 west longitude, or about 580 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans.
   Jerry is the first tropical weather system since Hurricane Hugo
ravaged the Caribbean and South Carolina coast last month.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds
hit 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.

<HEAD>Screenwriter Zavattini Dead at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cesare Zavattini, who wrote the scripts for Vittorio
De Sica's Oscar-winning films ``Shoeshine'' and ``The Bicycle
Thief,'' died Friday at the age of 87.
   Zavattini's neorealistic writings placed him at the center of
Italian intellectual life after World War II. He wrote the scripts
for scores of Italian movies for several decades.
   Neorealism was an Italian intellectual movement whose adherents
explored the emotion and pain of the mundane elements of human life.
   Zavattini is most renowned for his work on the films of De Sica,
especially ``Shoeshine'' (1946) and ``The Bicycle Thief'' (1948),
both of which won Oscars as best foreign film.
   Both films explored the chaotic urban conditions in the
aftermath of World War II, with the story revolving around a tender
human relationship. ``Shoeshine'' portrays the friendship between
an Italian street urchin and an American soldier in occupied Italy.
   Zavattini and De Sica also collaborated on the satirical fantasy
``Miracle in Milan'' (1950) and ``Umberto D'' (1952).
   Born in the Po Valley in 1902, Zavattini started his career as
journalist, editor and writer before devoting the bulk of his
energies to screenwriting. Recently, he pursued painting, poetry
and lithography.
   Zavattini received the American Writers' Association Prize in
1976.
   Services were scheduled for Saturday in his hometown of Luzzara.

<HEAD>`Mastergate,' Political Satire by Larry Gelbart, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs on end with comment from other reviews. Philipp
is cq in 8th graf.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Obfuscation is the name of the game in
bureaucratic Washington, and Larry Gelbart is a master of mimicking
the gobbledygook that passes for communication under the Capitol
dome and in the White House.
   But his sense of theater is stretched mighty thin in
``Mastergate,'' a relentlessly one-note spoof of the Iran-Contra
hearings that opened Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center.
   ``What did the president know, and does he have any idea that he
knew it?'' Gelbart asks. It's a funny line, but the question is
never really answered in this satire that would rather play with
words than plot or character for 90 long minutes.
   ``Mastergate'' focuses on fictional congressional hearings held
by something called the Permanent Select Joint Committee. It
discovers a scheme by the Central Intelligence Agency to take over
Master Pictures, a big Hollywood film studio. Through its filming
of a Vietnam war epic called ``Tet: The Movie,'' the
government-controlled studio is funneling money to Los Oltros,
freedom-fighting guerrillas in the Central American country of
Ambigua.
   Among the public servants called to appear before the committee
are the vice president, the secretary of state and a gung-ho,
media-savvy military officer named Manley Battle, the nation's only
four-star major, who bears more than a slight resemblance to Oliver
North.
   ``Publicity is a small price to pay for security,'' testifies
Battle while his wife, knitting an American flag, sits adoringly
beside him.
   The spoofing is broad and more than a little obvious as Gelbart
attempts to dazzle with quips, doubletalk, bad puns and a few
hilarious sight gags. Check out the look a certain gray-haired,
pearl-bedecked wife of the vice president gives her husband when he
testifies. Or Maj. Battle's medals, so numerous his lawyer has to
wear some of them on his lapel.
   Designer Philipp Jung's hearing room, with a hokey backdrop of
the Founding Fathers, spreads out all over the wide stage and even
up into the auditorium where the congressional inquisitors sit.
   ``Those who forget the past are certain to be subpoenaed,''
drawls a Southern senator played with the right amount of bourbon
befuddlement by Jerome Kilty.
   Between witnesses, an intense televison newswoman, Merry Chase
for Total Network News, recaps events for the folks out in
television land. She has her own jargon, just as difficult to
decipher as the governmental chatter.
   The debasement of language is a major theme of Gelbart's play.
Everyone has been co-opted, he seems to be saying, politicians, the
public and even the press. Maybe that's why a few of the reporters
are played by mannequins.
   Within the cartoon limits of the characters, two actors stand
out _ Daniel von Bargen as the mad major, and Jeff Weiss, a
triple-threat man who plays a right-wing senator, a liberal
congressman and the departed CIA chief.
   Director Michael Engler tries hard to keep the play from droning
on like a real congressional committee meeting. There are jarring
lighting and music effects to keep theatergoers awake. And if they
get tired of looking at the stage, the audience can watch the show
on television monitors scattered throughout the theater.
   In the end, Gelbart's wordplay turns preachy with the appearance
of the dead CIA director looking like Dickens' Ghost of Christmas
Past. He warns of future scandals if the public isn't vigilant _
which is hardly surprising advice. It's a somber and uninspired
conclusion to a play that telegraphs where it's going in the first
few minutes of the evening and then keeps recycling variations of
the same jokes in an attempt to get laughs.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: When ``Mastergate'' is funny, it
is very funny. When it is not, it still stands up for a patriotic
integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across
its national stage.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: If you think the title is funny,
you'll probably enjoy ``Mastergate.'' If you find it adolescent,
which I'm afraid I do, stay home and read Mark Twain on politics.
   Linda Winer, Newsday: ``Mastergate'' ... is a one-joke extended
sketch that, unfortunately, never manages the leap to dramatic _
much less philosophical _ revelation of much we didn't already
know. Nevertheless, the joke is a very good one, performed with
deadpan delight by deft imitators.

<UNK>Giant Foot in Flowers for Monty Python Star's Funeral</UNK>
<DATELINE>MAIDSTONE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surviving members of Monty
Python's Flying Circus sent flowers in the shape of a giant foot to
Friday's funeral for comedian Graham Chapman.
   ``To Graham from the other five Pythons with all our love. P.S.
Stop us if we're getting too silly,'' said a note attached to the
flowers, modeled on the foot that dropped down with a rude noise to
end the group's television shows.
   The message recalled Chapman's appearances as a stiff-backed
colonel who barged in to end sketches that had become ``too silly.''
   Services for Chapman, who died Oct. 4 at age 48, were held at
Vinters Park crematorium, with close friends and family attending.
   ``Not many of us take the opportunity to express our convictions
in the way that Graham did and he specialized in a brand of humor
which satirized pomposity,'' said the Rev. Tony Porter, chaplain at
Maidstone Hospital where Chapman died.
   Chapman's last words to Porter were: ``The events of this last
year have renewed my faith in human nature.''
   The minister said, ``Through these words we catch a glimpse of
Graham who though vulnerable, overcame many fears.''
   Mourners at the service included Chapman's companion for many
years, David Sherlock, and his adopted son, John Tomiczek.
   Sherlock had planned to stay away from the funeral but had a
last-minute change of mind.
   ``Both Graham and I believed in caring for the living, and not
mourning after the dead. He would have understood why at first I
wasn't going to go.
   ``But I thought about it, and felt it was only right that I
should be there for his very last moment,'' Sherlock said.
   None of the surviving Pythons _ John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric
Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin _ attended, but they are
expected to participate at a memorial service at St. Paul's Church
in Covent Garden in London.

<TEXT>
   Zairean jazz guitarist and band leader
Franco, a leading force in African music who made more than 100
albums, has died at the age of 51.
   Franco, whose real name was Lokanga Ladjo Pene Luambo Makiadi,
died Thursday in a Brussels hospital after a long, undisclosed
illness.
   Franco and his brassy-sounding T.P.O.K. Jazz orchestra were best
known for integrating jazz, gospel and African rhythms. To his
millions of fans, Franco was was the king of the ``rhumba
authentique.''
   Through his music, Franco often derided both Africa's former
European rulers and the post-independence ruling classes in many
African nations.
   Franco was considered the father of Zairean jazz, laying the
groundwork for modern Central and West African music. He first
performed on stage when he was 12 and made his first record in 1954.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko declared him Grand Master of Zaire
Music in 1978. Later, however, Zairean authorities jailed him
briefly because of the provocative content of some of his songs.
   Among his most successful songs were ``Independence Cha Cha'' in
1960, about Zairean independence from Belgium, and ``Mario'' in
1985, a litany of accusations addressed to a carefree gigolo by his
rich mistress.
   He later wrote ``Beware of AIDS,'' a hit song on the Central
African pop charts in 1987 that became a battle cry against the
deadly disease.
   He had been living in Belgium since the early 1980s.
   He is survived by 17 children.
   Mobutu ordered a four-day period of mourning in Zaire, with
government flags at half-staff and official radio playing soft
music. Franco's body will be returned on Saturday.

   The American Architectural Foundation on
Friday launched a campaign to pay for restoration of a building
known as the Octagon, where President James Madison resided for six
months after British troops burned the White House in 1814.
   The three-story brick building, located on New York Avenue two
blocks west of the White House, also was the site of the signing by
Madison of the treaty that ended the War of 1812.
   The architectural foundation announced a drive to raise at least
$3.5 million between now and the organization's 50th anniversary in
1992. Of this amount, approximately $2.5 million will be devoted to
restoration of the Octagon.
   ``Restoration will be as complete and authentic as allowed by
the intended use of each space,'' said Norman L. Koonce, president
of the foundation. ``Thus, the period rooms and the exterior of the
building will be carefully researched and accurately restored,
while other spaces _ such as our exhibition galleries _ will be
improved appropriately.''
   He said all of the restoration work will be carried out by
specialists skilled in traditonal building crafts.
   The Octagon was designed by William Thornton, the first
architect of the U.S. Capitol, and completed in 1801 as a city
house for Col. John Tayloe III, a Virginia plantation owner and
friend of George Washington.
   The building is considered a premier example of Federal-period
architecture and is one of the last remaining unaltered residences
from the capital's early years.

   A man has been sentenced to 12 years in prison
for stabbing a teen-ager during a fight over a dime bottle deposit.
   Roberto Pena, convicted in August of first-degree assault, must
serve a minimum of five years without parole under the sentence
issued Tuesday by Deschutes County Circuit Judge Michael Sullivan.
   Police charged Pena with stabbing an 18-year-old man three times
during a drunken argument at a convenience store. Officers said the
two got into a fight over who would get the 10-cent deposit for two
empty soda pop cans. Both men were intoxicated, police said.
   Although seriously wounded, the victim survived.

   Higher tides than normal caused by an unusual alignment of the
sun, moon and Earth began lapping South Carolina's
hurricane-ravaged beaches today, but little erosion or flooding was
expected, forecasters said.
   The National Weather Service said high tides on the Atlantic and
Gulf coasts could be up to a foot higher than the highest tides of
the past few years.
   The pre-dawn tide in South Carolina today was 6.6 feet and tides
were expected to rise to 7.3 feet by Monday, or slightly higher if
accompanied by gentle winds, the weather service said. Normally,
tides are 5 feet to 6 feet.
   In Folly Beach, S.C., where at least 23 beachfront structures
were destroyed by Hurricane Hugo and others left teetering on
foundations, today's tides did no damage, said Mayor Bob Linville.
   ``I went down and checked where we were expecting problems,'' he
said. ``I think truthfully if the wind doesn't become a factor we
might come out of this thing.''
   On the Pacific Coast, high tide could equal the highest marks of
recent years, the service said.
   ``The threat of coastal flooding increases if a storm surge
should occur at the same times as the astronomical high tide,'' the
service said.
   Tide tables will show the expected heights. Fishermen, boaters
and residents of flood-prone areas should consult the tables and be
alert to weather forecasts, the service said.
   Higher than normal tides also will occur Nov. 12-13 and Dec.
10-12, the service said.

<TEXT>
   The leader of a community college group said
Friday that state legislatures are biased against urban colleges
and that the federal Department of Education takes no interest in
their problems.
   Dale Parnell, president of the American Association of Community
and Junior Colleges, spoke at a news conference called to release a
report on innovative programs at community colleges.
   Alfred A. DelliBovi, under secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, said at the news conference that HUD officials see
community colleges as crucial to economic growth.
   ``We see jobs as the engine of opportunity,'' DelliBovi said.
``We see jobs and payrolls as the way people are going to rebuild
America's cities and we see community colleges as a way to get jobs
or get better jobs.''
   Parnell called that ``a great challenge for community
colleges.'' However, he said, ``they are not going to do it if they
don't have the help from the decision makers.''
   Asked why the Department of Education was not represented at the
news conference, Parnell said: ``They have not taken any interest
in urban education.''
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ``has shown more interest in this
subject than anyone else in this Cabinet,'' Parnell said.
   Education Department spokesman Tom Lyon said he had no immediate
comment on Parnell's remarks, but said he would look into it.
   ``I'd say there is a bias in state legislatures against urban
colleges,'' Parnell said. ``I say that respectfully. We have
formulas that do not apply to urban colleges.''
   Parnell also was critical of Congress.
   ``This week Congress put a cap on part-time students in student
financial aid,'' he said. ``Urban colleges are filled with
part-time students. What kind of priority is it to say we are going
to limit the number of part-time students? I don't understand that
kind of priority system.''
   Ronald J. Temple, president of Wayne County Community College in
Detroit and chairman of the association's commission on urban
community colleges, said such colleges need financial support.
   ``We are not necessarily talking about substantial additional
dollars at this point,'' he said. ``I think we are talking about
conceptualizing how we as a nation are going to begin to pull
together current resources to address urban problems.''
   The association's report described projects ranging from a
senior citizens' center at a former dormitory at the Bronx
Community College in New York to a Miami community college center
that serves as a focus of the amnesty program for illegal aliens
and offers almost 200 credit courses taught bilingually.

<HEAD>Spending Still Strong Despite Slowing Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose a moderate 0.5 percent last
month, the government said Friday in a report analysts said shows
consumer spending is still fairly strong despite a slowing economy.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted
$145.2 billion last month after gaining 0.7 percent in both August
and July. The revised July figure was even stronger than the 0.5
percent first reported.
   ``It shows there's good, solid consumer spending out there,''
said economist John Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
   ``Even excluding automobiles, sales were up 0.4 percent,''
Silvia noted. ``Furniture, department and drug stores, they all
were good sales numbers and I think that's what we want to see. We
don't want to see a recession.''
   Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity and are one of a number of indicators watched by
analysts to determine whether the Federal Reserve Board's
tight-credit policies are threatening to stall out the economy or
just slow it enough to keep inflation in check.
   Retail sales have risen every month since February, except for
June, when they were unchanged. On the other hand, the
manufacturing sector of the economy has grown sluggish, due in
part, Silvia said, to slowing exports.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said the Fed should not interpret the retail sales
report as a sign of excess demand overheating the economy.
   ``To the contrary, price discounts and `everyday low prices' are
fueling the rise in consumer spending,'' Hunter said.
   He called on the Fed instead to reduce interest rates and thus
induce businesses to invest more to meet growing consumer demand.
   Durable goods sales slowed to a 0.6 percent gain in September,
Commerce said, following a strong 2 percent hike in August that was
boosted in part by a 2.2 percent gain in automobile sales.
   But the early summer sales were driven by end-of-model-year
incentives that are usually offered in September and distorted the
0.5 percent auto sales gain reported in September, analysts said.
   The 0.5 percent gain reflected higher prices in September
because dealers did not discount vehicles as they usually do,
according to economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. of
New York. Unit sales actually dropped by 400,000 vehicles during
the month, he said.
   Besides automobiles, sales of other durable goods categories
split _ furniture and other home furnishing sales gaining 1.3
percent while building materials fell 1.8 percent.
   Non-durable goods sales rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.1
percent drop in August. All categories except apparel gained _
department stores, 1.7 percent; grocery stores, 0.3 percent;
gasoline stations, 0.3 percent; restaurants and bars, 0.2 percent,
and drug stores, 1.4 percent.
   Apparel sales were down 0.5 percent after rising 0.8 percent the
previous month.
   For the three months from July through September, overall retail
sales were up 6.4 percent. Retail sales so far in 1989 were 6.1
percent above those in the first nine months of 1988.

   Fire swept through a shantytown Friday,
killing eight people, destroying 200 houses and leaving 1,000
people homeless, officials said. Authorities blamed arsonists.
   The dead were trapped in the mud-and-straw houses when the fire
engulfed the Kallayanpur slums on the northern outskirts of the
capital, a firefighter said.
   Residents said the blaze was started by students from a nearby
college who poured gasoline on the huts. The plot where the slums
are located is apparently claimed by the college, they said.
   Fire officials said ``miscreants'' started the fire, which raged
for about an hour before it was extinguished. An official said the
students also tried to block the firefighters.
   The police said no arrests have been made.

<HEAD>Independent TV Forming, Has Contract for 5,000 U.S. Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent company has been formed to break
the staid government television's monopoly, and it has gained
rights to show outside programming, including 5,000 U.S. films, a
report said Friday.
   ``There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice
for both journalists and viewers,'' Nikolai I. Lutsenko, the
president of the Nika TV company, told the weekly newspaper Nedelya.
   The company is working on its own programming in several
provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a
year, the report said.
   State-run TV has been one of the chief means through which the
Soviet Union has tried to inculcate officially approved values into
the population.
   It has become freer under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms and some programs have sparked controversy. On one program,
there was a debate on whether Vladimir I. Lenin's body should
remain in its famous mausoleum on Red Square.
   The majority of its programming, however, remains staid.
   Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the United
States to pick up the rights to show U.S. films in the Soviet Union.
   ``In Hollywood, I concluded two contracts according to which we
obtained the rights to 5,000 of the best American films,'' he said.
Official TV occasionally shows foreign films, and its coverage of
events and the cultural life of other countries has increased
dramtically in the past several years.
   Another aim of the network is to uncover local talent in the
cities where it is operating, and help them find a place on
national Soviet TV and abroad, he said.
   Nedelya's article was accompanied by a picture of Lutsenko, by
profession a scholar of Asian affairs, interviewing American singer
John Denver in Colorado.
   Nika TV plans to use official television's communications
initially but eventually is seeking its own satellite system.
   Even though it will be independent of official television,
Lutsenko said Nika TV plans will have an oversight board that will
includes parliamentarians, members of the Communist youth league,
the Union of Filmmakers and others.
   ``We are all in the same boat, and Nika TV does not plan to rock
it,'' Lutsenko said. ``We will not be out of control.''
   However, it plans to focus much of its programming on the Soviet
Union's current political and economic difficulties, he said.
   ``The pain and losses of our economy, culture, ecology _ these
are the basic themes of our programs. Ecology is the first
priority,'' he said. But there also will be entertainment, music
and sports.
   The company has branches in Leningrad, Tashkent, Perm, and Alma
Ata, and is organizing in Vladivostok, Odessa, and the Baltic
republics, the report said.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole met with
striking Pittston Co. coal miners today and announced that the
company chairman and the union president have agreed to meet with
her Saturday.
   Face-to-face negotiations are the only way to settle the
6-month-old walkout, she said.
   ``I feel frustration with the impasse,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We're
talking about communities being torn apart and in some cases
families torn apart as I've heard talking with miners this
morning.''
   The two sides have held bargaining sessions since the strike
began April 5, but in separate rooms with federal mediators
shuttling messages back and forth. Mrs. Dole said Pittston Co.
Chairman Paul Douglas and United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka had agreed to meet with her in a Labor Department office.
   About 1,700 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky are
on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc., a subsidiary of
Pittston Co.
   Mrs. Dole, who visited picket lines to listen to miners'
concerns about health benefits and job security, was careful to
point out that she was not taking sides in the strike and planned
to meet with Pittston officials later today in Lebanon, Va.
   ``I'm not a mediator,'' she said. ``I'm not here to say I have
the answer to this complex problem, but I do feel now it is time to
see if we can facilitate the bargaining process.''
   Mrs. Dole spoke to some of the 280 pickets at the entrance to a
coal preparation plant that 98 striking miners invaded and occupied
for four days in September.
   UMW strike captain Fred Wallace of Lebanon said it ``gives us a
shot in the arm to know that the secretary of labor is interested
enough to come for a first-hand view.''
   Miners told Mrs. Dole that the contract Pittston is proposing
would reduce their health benefits, threaten the stability of the
UMW pension fund and eventually break the union.
   ``They trying to destroy our union,'' said Joel Phillips, a
picket captain from Castlewood.
   The company repeatedly has denied it is trying to break the
union.
   Heather Hamilton, the 3-year-old daughter of a striking miner,
gave Mrs. Dole a bouquet of flowers and told her, ``Get a contract
for my daddy.''

   Three rare white rhinos from a zoo
in Czechoslovakia were en route Friday to the San Diego Zoo, the
official CTK news agency reported.
   ``We consider this a goodwill gesture, a contribution to the
general improvement in relations between our two countries,'' said
Vaclav Kubicek, deputy director of the Dvur Kralove Zoo. ``Money
plays no role here.''
   In 1975, Josef Vagner brought the first six white rhinos to
Czechoslovakia from Zaire, gradually creating the largest such herd
in captivity.
   It is estimated that there are no more than 17 white rhinos
living freely in Central Africa, CTK reported.
   ``Keeping the only big herd in isolation is risky and so it was
decided to share our females with San Diego,'' Kubicek said.
   ``San Diego is not only the richest zoo with perfect subtropical
climate, but the scientific potential there is excellent as well,''
Kubicek said.
   The Dvur Kralove zoo will receive gorillas from the San Diego
Zoo in exchange for the rhinos, Kubicek said.

   That striking man who had a rendezvous with a
beautiful woman in front of the Ukraine Hotel on Friday looked
familiar. A lot like Bond _ James Bond.
   It was, in fact, Sean Connery, with actress Michelle Pfeiffer _
his co-star in ``The Russia House,'' the film version of John Le
Carre's latest spy novel now being made in Moscow.
   ``Of course, the KGB has a dossier on me,'' said the 59-year-old
Scottish actor, who made a career out of playing the Soviet
intelligence agency's formidable foe. ``That's why they let me in.''
   ``My dossier in Washington is even bigger than the KGB file,''
Connery said with a smile.
   This time, Connery plays a book publisher recruited by British
intelligence after he comes into contact with a Soviet scientist
smuggling defense secrets.
   ``Spying is waiting,'' a character in Le Carre's novel says. The
same is true of movie-making, said the film's producer, Paul
Maslansky, as the actors and dozens of extras went through two
hours of take after take in a freezing drizzle in front of the
hotel.
   Maslansky said the filming at Soviet locations, which began in
Leningrad Oct. 2, costs up to $10,000 an hour, excluding the
actors' salaries. The total cost of five weeks of filming in the
Soviet Union will be $2.5 million, he said.
   Maslansky said the filming was made possible because of the
``glasnost,'' or openness, policy of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. ``Under previous leaderships, there would have been a
problem filming a Le Carre novel,'' he said.
   Instead, Maslansky said, there has been nothing but cooperation.
   Not that the story line is anti-Soviet. If ``The Russia House''
has villains, they are the old-style American bureaucrats who
refuse to shed their Cold War mentality and reflexes when faced
with new realities.
   Although the script was reviewed by the state-run film company
Mosfilm, Maslansky said there were no attempts to alter the
chronicle of the Soviet scientist's attempt to smuggle military
secrets to the West, using a woman named Katya (Pfeiffer) as a
conduit.
   ``Its really a love story set against the Soviet Union,''
Maslansky said. ``Mosfilm read the script only to make sure it
wasn't anti-Soviet or pornographic.''
   During filming, he said, curious Soviets come not to see the
stars, but to watch the film crew of Soviets and Westerners eat
food shipped in from Britain because of shortages and lack of
variety in the Soviet capital.
   ``All the food is catered from London, feeding up to 150 people
daily,'' the producer said. ``People come from all over just to
look at the food ... It's kind of sad.''
   The California-born Pfeiffer said playing a Russian woman,
accent and all, is the biggest challenge of her acting career. She
is being coached in dialect and spends as much time as possible
with Soviet members of the crew.
   ``It's the most difficult role I have ever done,'' she said,
``the first character of a completely different culture.''
   The producers expect ``The Russia House'' to be released in
1990. Its release will coincide with the publication of the novel
in Russian _ another example of glasnost.
   The book also will be serialized this year by two magazines, the
monthly Foreign Literature and the weekly Ogonyok, the producers
said.
   The British author's previous works include ``The Spy Who Came
in From the Cold'' and ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.''

   Nestled amid the oaks and cypresses that
shelter deer and alligators in Brazos Bend State Park is the
nation's newest observatory, the only one of such magnitude that
will regularly be open to the public.
   Contractors and volunteers working for the Houston Museum of
Natural Science are putting finishing touches on a $1.3 million
installation of the 10-ton, 36-inch research telescope at the
George Observatory, which opens Saturday.
   The museum, using a $770,000 grant from the Houston-based George
Foundation, bought the 20-year-old telescope, described as one of
the largest and most powerful telescopes available, from Louisiana
State University two years ago.
   Then, given a choice of about six sites by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, museum officials selected an isolated spot in
the 5,000-acre state park, about 45 miles southwest of downtown
Houston.
   Although other observatories around the nation may open their
doors to the public on occasion, advance reservations and other
restrictions are usually in effect. The George Observatory, on the
other hand, will be available for use by anyone; the only fee is
the $2 per car admission charged to enter the park.
   The current schedule will allow the public to view the stars
every Saturday night, first come, first served. About 25 people
will be allowed inside the observatory dome for half-hour periods.
   Other nights are reserved for school groups, researchers and
advanced observations.
   Museum officials say area schools have made plans for at least
8,000 children to visit the telescope.
   ``Part of the problem in science is that it's so focused on the
laboratory _ that's what kids think science is,'' Carolyn Sumners,
the museum's director of astronomy and physics, said in an
interview this week.
   ``What we're doing here is focusing on the observational
sciences _ earth science, environmental science, ecology, astronomy
_ where you can't manipulate the environment. You just observe it.
And that's the way humans are. Most of our lives, the less we mess
with the environment, the better. The more we observe it and
understand it, that's what matters.''
   ``When the public gets this, they're going to want to see the
planets,'' said Dee Graham, an engineering consultant who worked
with an identical telescope at the Kitt Peak Observatory near
Tucson, Ariz. ``Saturn is just beautiful.''
   Graham and several other workers have been tinkering this week
with the dials and gears and bearings and mirrors that comprise the
telescope, surrendered by Louisiana State because of the $30,000 to
$40,000 annual upkeep the device required.
   Houston museum officials, in the market for such a telescope,
leaped at the opportunity in the spring of 1987. Construction of
the actual observatory began in March.
   As part of the deal with Louisiana State, the Baton Rouge school
will get to use the observatory for two weeks a year.
   Besides the public access, another unusual feature of the
observatory is its location _ the highest spot in the park is just
64 feet above sea level. Most telescopes are perched high on
mountaintops to escape city lights and air pollution.
   Scientists determined that the site had the darkest, clearest
and least polluted sky in the Houston area. The Milky Way extends
from horizon to horizon and star patterns are clear, they say.
   Ms. Sumners said she hopes to have monitors installed shortly
that will capture the images seen through the telescope, allowing
even more people to take advantage of the observatory.
   ``There's nothing like this in the country,'' she said. ``That's
what this place is all about _ real science. No exhibits, no
simulation. Here the science is real.''

   The bar owner glanced from the door to
his only customer, thinking of bombs and his misfortune in choosing
a location that might become a battle zone in the government's war
with cocaine barons.
   ``It makes me sad to think people won't come here because
they're afraid they'll get hurt,'' he said. ``I get even sadder
when I realize that maybe they're right, that maybe a bomb could
blow this place to pieces at any minute.''
   The owner, who asked to be identified only as Jairo, opened the
bar five months ago in a building beside a political headquarters.
It was a good spot then, but has become a risky one since
terrorists working for the drug traffickers began bombing such
offices.
   Jairo acknowledged his problems paled beside the national
turmoil that resulted when Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate, was assassinated in August and President
Virgilio Barco declared war on the drug gangs in response.
   A retaliatory bombing campaign by the drug traffickers has
killed 11 people, wounded 162 and shattered the nerves of thousands.
   Colombians are of two minds about the war.
   One side says there would be no trafficking problem if North
American noses did not require so much cocaine, but that the blood
being shed in the war is Colombian.
   Assassins working for the drug cartels have killed 12 members of
the Supreme Court, a justice minister, an attorney general, the
president of the country's largest leftist party, a newspaper
publisher, a governor, Galan and hundreds of other people.
   Those who favor pressing the campaign say Colombia would
surrender its sovereignty to the billionaire traffickers if it
negotiated with them and granted amnesty.
   Zoraida Diaz, a 24-year-old Bogota photographer, said the armed
forces were winning because ``they've raided hundreds of the drug
traffickers' properties and have sent the Medellin bosses
underground.''
   Medellin, a northwestern city, is the base of the notorious
Medellin cartel, Colombia's biggest cocaine gang.
   No bosses of the Medellin or Cali cartels have been captured so
far, but Ms. Diaz said she would not be surprised to see a ``big
fish'' netted soon.
   ``I get the impression that the Medellin bosses are on the
run,'' she said. ``They've responded with a terrorist campaign that
hasn't won them anything except the hatred of the people.''
   Most Colombians avoid reporters. If they do talk, most want
their names withheld for fear the traffickers will come looking for
them.
   Many apper to think the anti-drug war is futile, that the
trafffickers can outlast the government with their riches, bombs
and clandestine armies.
   Futile or worthwhile, it has sown fear and disrupted life in
Bogota and other cities.
   Telephoned bomb threats cause people to rush out of stores and
offices, stay home at night and avoid certain places at all times.
   They duck when vehicles backfire. Many normally busy restaurants
and discotheques are empty.
   How long will Colombians put up with such conditions? The answer
to that may determine whether the government wins, since any
significant weakening of public support could end the struggle.
   President Barco, aware of the danger, appeals frequently to the
people. He approved television advertisements offering $250,000 for
information leading to the capture of two chiefs of the Medellin
cartel, Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha.
   The ads urge people to denounce drug traffickers ``for
yourselves, for your children, for Colombia.''
   Citizens whose patience has been swept away with the shattered
glass express irritation with the United States, which some
consider the real force behind the government's anti-drug campaign.
   A common complaint is that the United States is not doing enough
to fight drug use at home. The U.S Drug Enforcement Administration
estimates Americans consume 300 tons to 400 tons of cocaine a year.
   Many Colombians feel the war is between society's elite and the
government on one side and the drug cartels on the other, with no
stake for the ordinary people who are being blown up.
   Others, prepared for an extended struggle, worry about its
long-term effects on society.
   Despite a violent history, Colombia takes pride in its
democratic tradition. It has had comparatively few military coups
and rights are protected in a constitution dating from the 19th
century.
   Gustavo Gallon, a human rights lawyer, said Barco has endangered
civil liberties by extending his power to fight drug traffickers
and leftist guerrillas.
   He cited such decrees as one allowing the government to hold not
just drug traffickers, but any ``subversive,'' incommunicado for
seven days without formal charges.
   Gallon said there were three possible courses for the drug war:
a continued, violent standoff; a negotiated settlement or a
government victory.
   ``A government victory ... may be the worst of the three
possibilities,'' he said. ``If Colombia defeats traffickers, it
will be at an extreme cost to what is left of our democratic
institutions and basic rights.''
   A settlement is unlikely unless a scapegoat is found for the
terrorism committed by drug gangs, he said, because ``there are
some crimes, like the assassination of Sen. Galan, that the
Colombian people will never forgive.''
   Prolonged violence is the most likely, he said, and could affect
Colombians for generations.
   ``Colombians feel anxiety about the future,'' Gallon declared.
``We wonder about what effects the violence will have on our
children and grandchildren, what kind of society we will be left
with when this violence ends, if it ever ends.''

<HEAD>Denktash Meeting With Senior Official, but U.S. Insists No Policy
Change</HEAD>

   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash met
Friday with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, but
both the State Department and the Greek Cypriot government denied
any shift toward recognition of the self-declared state.
   U.S. and Greek Cypriot officials stressed the informal nature of
the meeting, held over lunch in a State Department dining room.
   ``This is simply in keeping with our desire to help resolve the
conflict,'' said one official, who asked not to be named.
   The sensitivity over the meeting is a reflection of the bitter
conflict between the Mediterranean island's Greek majority and
Turkish minority, which has defied resolution for 26 years.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Eagleburger
has known Denktash for many years and received him as head of the
Turkish Cypriot community, not as leader of the breakaway state.
   ``The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia maintains continuing contact with
Denktash and we believe his meetings in Washington are fully in
keeping with our desire to be of assistance to the intercommunal
negotiating process of Cyprus, through which we hope a lasting
peaceful solution emerges,'' she said.
   It is the first time Denktash has visited the State Department
since he declared a breakaway state in the northern part of Cyprus
six years ago.
   Only Turkey, which has provided 30,000 troops to the Turkish
Cypriots, has recognized the state.
   Denktash and Cypriot President George Vassiliou began talks in
1988 in an attempt to dissolve the partition. But the talks under
U.N. auspices have stalled, with each side blaming the other.
   Vassiliou was received by President Bush at the White House last
week, and Denktash is following in his footsteps to garner support
for the Turkish position.
   ``We feel very strongly that we've been discriminated against
too long, and we want to be heard,'' Denktash told reporters.
   The Turkish Cypriot community, about 30 percent of the island's
population, wants a federation with the Greek part of the island to
be ruled by a central council of ministers. The presidency would
rotate between Greeks and Turks, Denktash said.

   The United States should follow a policy of
``hard-nosed pragmatism'' in efforts to combat piracy of
copyrighted publications, computer software, videotapes and audio
recordings, according to a report released Friday.
   The study was prepared by a task force of 23 industry, academic
and government representatives brought together by Northwestern
University's Annenberg Washington Program.
   ``Piracy of intellectual property is costing the United States
tens of billions of dollars in lost sales and royalties,'' said
attorney Gary M. Hoffman, principal author of the report.
``Protecting intellectual property and stopping the flow of pirated
products are critical to the future of our information-based
economy.''
   The report offered examples of technological piracy including:
   _Pirates issued their own version of the Encyclopedia Britannica
in Taiwan before the legitimate edition could be published and kept
selling it despite court rulings.
   _About 1,000 video parlors in Taiwan, and many more throughout
the Third World, show U.S. and other foreign movies without paying
public-performance license fees and, in some cases, without even
buying the videocasette from its legal distributor.
   _Hundreds of thousands of decoders for receiving satellite
television transmissions have been tampered with, allowing people
to view programs carried by Home Box Office and similar networks.
   The report contended that ``facing the challenge requires
hard-nosed pragmatism, not moralizing.''
   ``Our own country pirated Europe's intellectual property a
century ago, when the United States was a young country. New,
developing countries have short-term incentives to be `free riders'
on the creativity of other nations.
   ``Permitting piracy is not, however, in the long-term interest
of countries that wish to develop their own economies and
innovative potential,'' it said. ``Free-riding deprives them of an
important incentive for creativity, innovation and
entrepreneurship.''
   Policy options the panel suggested include stiffer criminal
penalties, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws
abroad and better coordination of activities by federal agencies
dealing with intellectual property matters.
   Last May, seven nations identified by the Washington-base
Intellectual Property Alliance as ``problem countries'' due to
pervasive piracy were named to a ``priority watch list'' by U.S.
Trade Representative Carla A. Hills.
   The seven countries are Korea, Taiwan, China, India, Saudi
Arabia, Brazil and Thailand.
   Four other nations considered ``problem countries'' by the
alliance were named to the trade representative's longer ``watch
list.'' These are Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
   According to the Intellectual Property Alliance, the 11
countries together accounted for estimated piracy losses to the
U.S. companies of almost $1.4 billion in 1988.
   The Annenberg Washington Program was established in 1983 to
assess how communications technologies and current public policies
on communications affect aspects of American life including
education, medicine, law, politics, foreign policy and financial
markets.

   Radical students held anti-American
rallies and fought police in three cities Friday after compatriots
rampaged through the U.S. ambassador's residence at dawn.
   Ambassador Donald Gregg and his wife escaped through a side door
minutes after six invaders with homemade bombs, tear gas grenades
and steel pipes stormed the residence and began smashing artworks,
lamps and pottery.
   Police used tear gas to overpower the students, described by
officials as an ``anti-U.S. death squad.'' They shouted ``Drive out
the Yankees!'' while being dragged away.
   They protested U.S. pressure on South Korea to lower trade
barriers and demanded that President Roh Tae-woo cancel a visit to
Washington scheduled for next week.
   About 2,000 radical students protested or fought police later
Friday on at least 11 campuses in Seoul, Inchon and Kwangju. Police
reported two dozen arrests.
   Hundreds of protesters at Konkuk, Sogang and Kyunghee
Universities in Seoul hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police,
who responded with tear gas. The students burned American flgags
and effigies of Roh and President Bush.
   Gregg and his wife, Meg, were sleeping when the students stormed
the house. The ambassador said he did not see the students but
could hear them on the other side of the locked bedroom door.
   ``I never saw any of them,'' Gregg told a news conference. ``We
heard shouting in Korean. ... I don't know what they were
shouting.''
   He said the living room, where the damage was done, is 50 to 60
feet from the bedroom.
   Gregg said the attack would not affect U.S.-Korean relations.
``This is the act of six people who broke into our home and I don't
put a larger signifiance on it than that,'' he said.
   South Korea's governing Democratic Justice Party called the
rampage a ``senseless riot'' and leading opposition parties
denounced it.
   U.S. Embassy officials said there had been a security problem at
the residence, but would not elaborate. They said they security
procedures would be reviewed.
   Security for the residences is handled by a private firm under
contract and U.S. Marines are not posted there, the officials said.
   In Washington, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who heads the House
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said: ``Incidents of
this type represent misguided actions of only a small minority. ..
. I continue to believe that a strong U.S.-South Korean partnership
is in the interest of both nations.''
   Gregg, the fomer CIA station chief in Seoul, became ambassador
last month and radical students have been protesting since. They
claim he was sent to South Korea to impose military rule.
   Police officials, who would not let their names be used, said
the students used homemade bombs to distract police, then scaled
the wall of the residence compound and hurled tear gas grenades at
security guards who tried to stop them.
   Once inside, the raiders blocked the main door with chairs and
sprayed the floor with paint thinner, threatening to ignite it if
police attacked, and threw more of the homemade bombs at police,
the officials said.
   U.S. diplomats described the devices as ``firecracker-like noise
bombs,'' used in other attacks on U.S. diplomatic and military
facilities, which make a loud bang but cause little damage.
   At least one student was draped in the South Korean flag and all
shouted ``Punish Gregg!'' and ``We oppose U.S. trade pressure!''
   Authorities said one student was slightly injured in a scuffle
and police were seeking four others who helped the invaders enter
the compound.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the main political
opposition, said it regretted the assault, but said the United
States should note that excessive trade pressure feeds
anti-American feeling in South Korea.
   Radical students are a small but influential minority on college
campuses, but have little public support because of their violent
tactics and extreme views.

   A former Housing and Urban Development
official has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government
and has been sentenced to a year in prison.
   DuBois Gilliam changed his plea Thursday after federal
prosecutors agreed to drop four bribery counts. Together with the
conspiracy charge, conviction on those counts could have brought
him up to 13 years in prison.
   Gilliam was charged with trying to obtain more than $3 million
in HUD grants and loans for a hotel-marina project at Point Cadet
in this Gulf Coast city.
   Former Mayor Gerald Blessey and the city's former economic
development director, Reba Capers, were indicted in April on
conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Prosecutors said they improperly
spent $160,000 of a HUD grant on the waterfront project. Their
trial ended in a mistrial in September, and prosecutors promised to
bring them to trial again.
   Gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary of HUD and close
associate of Samuel Pierce, the HUD secretary during the Reagan
administration.

<HEAD>Italian Designers Offer Choice in Spring-Summer Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman who dresses Italian style for next
spring and summer can be anything she wants to be.
   The new look offered by more than 40 top Italian designers, who
presented their warm weather wears this week, is both sexy and
demure, sporty and urbane, tailored and languid, colorful and
muted, simple and ornate.
   There is less of a unified message than in past ``moda
Milanese'' seasons, allowing the fashionable woman, as Armani put
it, ``to choose something which seems to be designed for her
alone.''
   Naturally there are trends. The new style concentrates on the
upper body, with the bare midriff the newest look. Bra tops
bandeaus and bustiers, as well as an accent on see-through blouses,
spell bad news for the lingerie industry. The bra as an
undergarment virtually disappears.
   Color is another novelty on the Milan runway. After many a
season of drab shades, the designers have burst out in a bright
palette of Italian fruit ice cream tones: raspberry, kiwi,
watermelon, mango, apricot, peach, banana, blueberry and many more.
In some of the collections these shades are in muted pastels. Black
also plays a big role by night.
   Short skirts no longer make news in Italy, with the young and
old _ stout and slim alike _ showing off their legs. It is no
surprise that short skirts continue to dominate the runway. Next
season's miniskirt is not as hip-hugging as the winter version with
a preference for draping and tie skirts, like the ones worn by
South Sea island natives.
   There is little for city dwellers and working women in the new
collections with the emphasis on holiday attire: shorts, jumpsuits,
gaily printed sun dresses, pajama pants and loose shirt jackets.
   Where detailing is concerned the Milanese designers are on a
fringe binge with long silk threads adorning shawls and scarves, as
well as finding there way onto shirts, jackets, and the hemlines of
skirts.
   Gold and crystal beading dot all the collections especially for
evening. Simple chiffon gowns and camisole tops are richly
embroidered with opulent sequining, all done now in India. Gone are
the famous Italian seamstresses who used to work out of their homes
by candle light to embellish Italian couture.
   Ornate jewelry is back for the summer of 1990, with over-sized
gold bracelets, necklaces and earrings by day and night.
   Face-painting is out next season with a return for the natural
look not only in the make-up but also in the short boyish
hairstyles. Footwear is predominantly casual and flat even for
evening.
   Americans are spending more cautiously, but the Italians are
comforted by a Japanese market, which almost doubled the number of
buyers it sent to Milan.
   Beppe Modenese, the organizational mastermind behind the ``moda
Milanese,'' which swept the fashion world at the beginning of the
1980s, is confident that despite recent defections by Italian
designers to Paris _ Romeo Gigli has joined Valentino in showing
his ready-to-wear collection in Paris and Gianfranco Ferre now
designs for Dior as well as doing his own label out of Milan _
Milan will continue to be a guiding light in the 1990s.
   ``We are still the reference point for all ready to wear.
France, Germany, and even America take their cue from us,''
Modenese said.
   Highlights from the shows:
   Versace _ The sexiest, most theatrical look with super short
skirts and multicolored gold and crystal encrusted bustier tops.
   Ferre _ The most confident look with enormous scarf tie blouses
and a see-through jumpusit made of bands of silk jersey and
skin-color chiffon.
   Krizia _ The award for the longest show _ one hour and 10
minutes _ and the clumpiest shoes, 1940s platform ankle straps.
   Armani _ The longest, loosest jacket in raw silk, and the most
elegant collection.
   Jenny _ The only collection to dress working women.
   Byblos _ The easiest collection to sell, full of young and
pretty clothes.
   Biagiotti _ Always the best where cashmere is concerned.
   Missoni _ Superb quilted and knitted reversible jackets.
   Moschino _ The best sense of humor. He stitches his labels on
the outside, poking fun at himself.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Anew for Noriega Ouster, `Wouldn't Mind Force'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush issued a new call Friday for
the overthrow of Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, saying
``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent
manner.'' But he emphasized he was not offering a blanket
commitment of American troops.
   Ten days after an uprising against the Panamanian general was
crushed, Bush vigorously defended his handling of the situation,
rejecting criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike over his
refusal to provide U.S. military assistance.
   He seemed particularly disturbed by charges that he abandoned
the rebels, leaving them on their own after publicly exhorting the
Panamanian military to oust Noriega. Bush said that was ``a stupid
argument that some very erudite people make.''
   At a hurriedly called news conference, Bush also addressed
politically charged issues in Congress. He said:
   _ He opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape and incest but holds out hopes for a congressional
compromise that would ``avoid a veto on my part.'' He said he would
``see if there is room for flexibility'' when Senate and House
negotiators work out a compromise version of a bill that now would
allow such federal payments.
   _ He will permit a bill outlawing flag burning to become law
without his signature. ``I don't think it's enough,'' Bush said,
renewing his call for a constitutional amendment along the same
lines but adding that he would not veto the legislation in the
meantime.
   _ He still wants Congress to approve his plan for a cut in the
capital gains tax, and he did not rule out the possibility of
signing legislation that combined his proposal with a Democratic
version liberalizing individual retirement accounts. A few hours
later, Senate leaders agreed on a plan to strip hundreds of
special-interest provisions from a $14.1 billion deficit-reduction
bill, leaving the capital gains fight for the future.
   Asked about attempts in Congress to repeal catastrophic health
care legislation for the elderly, Bush made clear he was staying
away from that controversial topic, preferring instead to let ``the
congressional process hash this out.''
   As for a possible future coup against Noriega, Bush said, ``I
hope I would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief to
make a blanket commitment to use of force without knowing the facts
regarding some coup attempt.''
   On the other hand, the president said, ``I wouldn't mind using
force if it could be done in a prudent manner. So, in other words,
I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''
   Bush said, ``I am not going to give carte blanche support to an
operation, particularly when they don't ask for this support. And I
have to reserve that right. I have at stake the lives of American
kids and I am not going to easily thrust them into a battle unless
I feel comfortable with it and unless those general officers in
whom I have total confidence feel comfortable.''
   He rejected the idea of Noriega giving up power in return for
dismissal of drug-trafficking charges in the United States, a
possibility that a reporter suggested had been raised with the
president. ``It would send an impossible signal in this fight
against drugs,'' Bush said.
   While defending his handling of the coup attempt, Bush said the
administration was reviewing procedures to see ``if we can't do it
better.''
   In Miami, Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of the coup leader,
said the U.S. military's cautious attitude toward coup leaders had
stalled vital aid at a key moment. In particular, she said U.S.
officials were slow to react when one of the plotters tried to use
a telephone number that U.S. authorities had provided for use in an
emergency.
   Bush promised to look into her complaint. ``To the degree we can
improve our communications, fine,'' he said.
   As a result of an internal review, the administration has
decided that a crisis-management team will be automatically
convened in the White House situation room in future emergencies, a
senior official said.
   Representatives of such agencies as the Pentagon, CIA and State
Department will be summoned to coordinate the flow of information,
the official said, insisting on anonymity.
   Hinting that he may seek congressional approval for greater
authority in dealing with situations like the coup in Panama, Bush
said, ``I want as broad a power as possible and I think under the
Constitution the president has it.''
   Although some members of his administration have faulted the way
the coup was handled, Bush insisted there was no second-guessing
and ``all of them are singing from the same sheet of music.''
   He said of his staff, ``they all did a good job.''

<HEAD>Army Hospital Ordered to Spare Greyhounds in Leg-Breaking Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen greyhounds were released by an
Army hospital ordered to halt research that would have involved
breaking the dogs' hind legs.
   Letterman General Hospital agreed to release the dogs Thursday
after an animal rights group won the court order.
   The order also forces the Army to confirm whether the former
owners of the dogs had knowingly given them up for research. The
dogs were released to the Marin Humane Society and will be reunited
with former owners or offered for adoption.
   The hospital acquired the dogs for $300 each from a middleman
and had intended to use them in research on healing broken bones
because greyhounds are a docile, stoic breed that can endure pain
without turning mean.
   A hospital worker upset by the experiment alerted the Marin
Humane Society, which notified the In Defense of Animals group and
other animal-rights organizations.
   The experiment called for removing three inches of bone from a
hind leg of each dog and replacing the missing section with a new
synthetic material designed for bone replacement.
   The dogs were to be killed and the broken legs saved for testing
of the new material.

<HEAD>World's Tallest Bronze Buddha Erected on Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buddhist monks chanted and prayed Friday to
welcome the completion of a smiling bronze Buddha half the height
of the Statue of Liberty that sits cross-legged on a hill outside
Hong Kong, facing China.
   Publicity material claims the 134-foot-tall, $7.7 million statue
is the world's tallest bronze Buddha in the open air. It was made
from bronze crafted in Communist China.
   The 250-ton statue sits next to the Po Lin Monastery on the
outlying Lantao Island, a one-hour ferry ride from downtown Hong
Kong.
   ``You can definitely see it from a plane,'' said architect Peter
Ng of the Buddha, which is about half the height of the 305-foot
Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.
   In a rain-soaked ceremony, a crane placed part of the Buddha's
head on top the statue while chanting monks circled it, blessing
the guests.
   The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan, 56, the monastery's
director who has lived there since he was 3.
   ``I ate the monks' meals and have to do something for the
monastery,'' said Chi Wan. He said that after viewing Buddha
statues in China, Japan and Taiwan, he asked himself: ``If they can
do it, why can't we?
   ``Hong Kong is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind
of religious symbol,'' he said. ``Lantao is a Buddhist holy land
and I think we can build it here.''
   The Buddha sits on a base that resembles a circular altar of the
Temple of Heavenly Peace in Beijing.
   He faces northeast, overlooking the monastery and, further out,
China. But Chi Wai said there is no political relevance to the
Buddha's facing China, which takes over this British colony in
eight years.
   ``We consulted a Fung Shui expert who said the direction would
give the greatest blessing to those who donated and supported the
construction of the Buddha,'' he explained.
   The project was funded by donors in Hong Kong and China, many of
whom will have their names and pictures placed on the walls of a
memorial hall at the statue's base. About $7.1 million was raised
in Hong Kong through the sale of commemorative cards, bronze coins,
and bronze Buddha figurines. The rest was raised by Buddhists in
China.
   Sitting atop the 1,591-foot Muk Yu (Wooden Fish) Hill, the
statue consists of 222 bronze pieces made by the Nanjing Chengguang
Machinery Factory in China. They have been assembled on the island
over the past three years.
   The Buddha includes many symbols, said Chi Wai. His half-open
eyes signals he is looking after the ordinary people. His right
hand, half raised, symbolizes the easing of pain on Earth. His left
hand rests on his lap with his palm facing out, a sign of giving
away happiness.
   Chi Wai believes his Buddha has no rival.
   ``Ours is better because it is taller, looks kinder and more
peaceful,'' he said.
   Chi Wai denied the project was an attempt to attract more
tourists to the island, already filled on weekends with vacationers.
   ``A Buddhist saying goes: `When you are confused, go into a
temple or tower. Once you say a prayer you will feel the truth of
Buddhism,''' he said.
   ``It means a religious person can feel the tranquility once they
see the statue. A non-religious person can also observe this work
of art,'' he said.

<HEAD>Syria, Power Sharing Come Up Again In Lebanon Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHEHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New arguments over Christian-Moslem
power sharing and a timetable for Syrian troop withdrawal dimmed
hopes Friday that Lebanese legislators had found a formula for
ending their country's 14-year civil war.
   A meeting to put the finishing touches on a tentative agreement
was postponed repeatedly. Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign
minister, met with George Saddeh, a Christian member of the
parliamentary committee who stormed out of a meeting Thursday night.
   Edmond Rizk, a Lebanese deputy, said the two agreed ``on a
unified formula on the issues that caused the postponement.'' He
would not give details, but said the Syrian role in Lebanon was not
discussed.
   Conference sources said they expected a full meeting Saturday of
the 63 legislators, who must approve any agreement reached by the
17-member negotiating committee.
   Saddeh, who leads the right-wing Phalange Party, accused Moslems
on Thursday of making ``crippling demands.'' He did not specify the
demands, but sent a note to the press center saying ``they affect
intrinsic issues'' and ``cannot be accepted under any
circumstances.''
   According to the sources, Syrian-backed Moslem legislators
insisted on greater political concessions by the Christians, who
made their own demands about Syrian withdrawal.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, one year after the outbreak of
a sectarian civil war that has cost more than 150,000 lives.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander, has declared a
``war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out.
   Artillery battles between Aoun's forces and a Moslem alliance
led by the Syrians, which began March 8, killed more than 900
people and wounded nearly 3,000 before an Arab League cease-fire
took effect Sept. 22 and the legislators met in Taif to seek a
solution.
   Lebanese sources said Saadeh walked out Thursday night as Sunni
and Shiite Moslem lawmakers argued over the powers of the
parliament speaker, traditionally a Shiite. They said deputies held
side consultations Friday in an effort to head off further
disagreement.
   On Thursday, conference sources said the committee had reached
preliminary agreement on a ``national reconciliation charter'' and
would meet Friday to complete the document.
   Aoun declared in Beirut a few hours later that the deliberations
were irrelevant and he would continue his war on the Syrians.
   ``We cannot rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying
force,'' he declared.
   As-Safir, a leftist Beirut newspaper, said Aoun's remarks
amounted to a ``public and direct threat'' to Christian legislators
in Taif against making major political concessions without
guarantees of a swift Syrian withdrawal.
   Sources gave no details of the tentative accord, which must be
approved by all 63 legislators attending the Taif meeting. Beirut
radio stations close to the factions said it included a ``limited
and phased'' Syrian withdrawal and political reforms that reduce
the president's power.
   Under an unwritten covenant observed since independence from
France in 1943, the president is Christian the prime minister a
Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite.
   The Arab League peace plan, on which the cease-fire is based,
envisages gradual abolition of sectarianism and Syrian withdrawal
to eastern Lebanon within two years while law and order is restored
and militias disbanded.
   Christians demand complete Syrian withdrawal within two months
and Moslems want an equal share of political power, which the
Christians say they won't allow without guarantees about the
pullout.
   Lebanon's Christians were the majority in 1943 and have
dominated the government, parliament, judiciary and army. Moslems
make up 55 percent of the 4 million people and demand more power.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Recession Unless Interest Rates Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic growth in 1990 will slump to
its slowest pace in eight years with an outright recession a
distinct threat unless the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates,
the nation's top business executives forecast Friday.
   The Business Council, composed of the chief executives of 100 of
the country's largest corporations, said that the economy began to
lose steam this summer. They predicted that the sluggish period
will last through much of next year.
   The forecast said, however, that a timely assist from the Fed
could make the slowdown the ``pause that refreshes'' and lead to a
rebound in growth in 1991. That would give the country an
unprecedented nine consecutive years without a recession.
   The study, prepared by a panel of top corporate economists,
predicted that the overall economy, as measured by the gross
national product, will expand at a 2.9 percent rate this year,
identical to the Bush administration's forecast.
   For 1990, however, the Business Council said growth will slump
to an anemic 1.8 percent annual rate, the slowest pace since the
recession year of 1982.
   This prediction is significantly below the administration's
outlook for growth of 2.3 percent next year and would represent a
blow to Republican hopes for reasonably robust growth to boost
their chances in the 1990 congressional races.
   ``There are a variety of potential weaknesses in the economy
that carry the risk of a recession,'' said Lewis T. Preston,
chairman of J.P. Morgan Inc., the large New York bank. ``f I were
the Fed, I would be inclined to lean in the direction of an easier
policy. My sense is that we will need a fair amount of insurance
against trouble.''
   The administration has also been pushing the central bank to
lower interest rates as a way of making American exports more
competitive overseas. Lower interest rates in this country make
dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners and
thus lower the value of the dollar.
   However, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has given no
indication that the Fed is going to loosen credit anytime soon and
in fact the Fed is still sending signals that it is worried about
inflationary pressures.
   The government reported Friday that inflation at the wholesale
level shot up 0.9 percent in September.
   Many of the business executives, however, dismissed the
inflation report as a temporary blip that did nothing to change
their view that recession and not inflation was the bigger threat
facing the economy at the present time.
   James D. Robinson III, the chairman of American Express Co.,
said that the Fed has done a good job in holding inflation in check
following a spurt in prices earlier this year ``but now is the time
to bring interest rates down.''
   The business executives forecast that inflation will show
further moderation with the consumer price index rising at annual
rates of 4.5 percent or less over the next two years.The business
chiefs were also optimistic that U.S. exports will remain strong
over the next two years, helping to drive the merchandise trade
deficit down to $100 billion next year. The growth in exports was
based on a belief that strong growth in Europe and Japan will spur
continued demand for U.S. goods even with the rise in the value of
the dollar this year.
   The forecast was released on the opening day of the Business
Council's fall meeting at a mountain resort in Virginia.
   Despite the outlook for a significant slowdown in growth and the
fact that corporate profits have already begun to sag, the business
executives were generally optimistic about their prospects in the
coming year.
   Roger Smith, the chairman of General Motors and the head of the
Business Council, said that U.S. auto sales should be above 15
million units for the sixth consecutive year despite the
projections of ``doomsayers'' to the contrary.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, who spoke to the
executives during a closed-door session, told reporters afterward
that reports of a dispute between the administration and the Fed
had been blown out of proportion.
   He said that only ``very minor differences'' existed between the
two over such issues as interest rate policy.

   Television preacher Billy Graham is getting a
star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, a concrete honor stuck between
the stars for actress Judy Holliday and Italian opera singer
Beniamino Gigli.
   ``We are all aware of Billy Graham's great evangelistic
successes,'' Walk of Fame Chairman Johnny Grant said Thursday.
``Few realize, however, the tremendous impact he has had on the
world through radio, film and television.''
   Graham's star will be unveiled Sunday and it won't be the first
time a clergyman has been honored with a star, Grant said.
   Rev. James Cleveland, a Grammy-winning gospel singer, composer,
pianist and minister at the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Los
Angeles, received a star in 1981.
   Graham is getting the last available spot in front of the
theater, a popular tourist stop that used to be called Grauman's
Chinese Theater but is now a Mann theater. There are other spots,
however, still available on the sidewalk.
   On Wednesday the evangelist went out to look over the star's
location and sign autographs.

   Steven Soderbergh, the young director of the
surprise hit ``sex, lies and videotape,'' received the first John
Cassavetes award at the opening of the 12th Denver International
Film Festival.
   The festival began Thursday evening with the premiere of Woody
Allen's film ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' About 1,000 people turned
out.
   Soderbergh, the 26-year-old director whose film won the top
prize earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, was presented
with the first Cassavetes award, given to the individual who has
made the greatest contribution to American independent filmmaking
this year.
   The award is in honor of the late John Cassavetes, one of the
country's most well-known independent directors, who died in
February.
   ``Home Boys,'' a documentary made by Denver director Donna
Dewey, makes its premiere during the festival. The film features
interviews with leaders of the Crips and Bloods youth gangs.

   ``The Pat Sajak Show'' will be trimmed to one
hour in an effort to pick up the pace of the late-night gab fest,
CBS officials said Friday.
   Sajak's weeknight series began in January as a 90-minute program
that went head to head with NBC's one-hour ``Tonight Show'' and the
first half hour of ``Late Night With David Letterman.'' It also was
pitted against ABC's half-hour ``Nightline,'' and the syndicated,
one-hour ``Arsenio Hall Show.''
   Sajak's show was shortened ``to strengthen the format and
tighten the flow,'' said Rod Perth, CBS' vice president for
late-night programs, in a statement.
   The hour format was ``much more conducive to a livelier,
faster-paced broadcast,'' he said.
   When the change is made Oct. 30, CBS said, it will air one-hour
action-adventure programs at 12:30 a.m. Mondays through Thursdays,
and the ``CBS Late Movie'' on Fridays.

   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts' Gov.
Michael Dukakis, urged physicians Friday to step up the fight
against drug and alcohol abuse by monitoring patients for hidden
addictions.
   She told delegates at a World Psychiatric Association congress
how her own battle against an addiction to stimulants was dogged by
careless prescriptions.
   ``I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. ``I
have come to this meeting the hard way.
   ``For many years I was able, quite easily, to have prescriptions
filled for the amphetamines to which I was addicted,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was hospitalized in February for alcoholism
rehabilitation at a private center in Newport, R.I., for 31 days.
   The World Psychiatric Association, the internationally

   A man will be watching the World Series
with added interest this weekend after making a big bet with talk
show host David Letterman on the games _ his wife of 50 years.
   Maurice Shank got a call Wednesday afternoon from Letterman
during the taping of NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   ``I was on the defensive the whole time because I didn't know
what I was getting into,'' said Shank, 76, on Thursday.
   Letterman told Shank he wanted to bet on the World Series, which
starts Saturday. He asked Shank to pick a team, and Shank chose the
Oakland A's.
   Then, Letterman asked, ``If you lose, what are you prepared to
surrender?''
   ``My wife,'' Shank said.
   That wasn't quite what he meant, according to his wife, Darline.
She said her husband was starting a sentence when Letterman cut him
off.
   But the stakes aren't as high as betting his wife forever.
   If the A's beat the San Francisco Giants and Shank wins, the
couple will win a case of J&amp;B Scotch and an electric shoe-shiner.
   If Shank loses, Mrs. Shank will get a free trip to New York to
be on Letterman's show, said officials at NBC.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Mrs. Shank said. ``Our quiet little life of
raking leaves and cleaning windows, and look where we are.''

   President Bush said Friday he will not veto a
law to outlaw flag-burning even though he will continue trying to
amend the Constitution as a stronger way to accomplish the same end.
   ``I don't think it's enough,'' Bush said of the flag legislation.
   He said he will allow the newly passed bill to become law
automatically without his signature, but added he does not think
the law will withstand legal challenges.
   ``I'm withholding that signature to signal our belief that a
constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting
protection for the flag,'' Bush told reporters at a brief White
House news conference.
   A firestorm of controversy regarding the U.S. flag arose after
the Supreme Court overturned a Texas conviction last June, ruling
that protesters could legally burn the flag under constitutional
free-speech guarantees.
   Bush proposed a new constitutional amendment against flag
desecration, but Congress chose to deal with the matter through
legislation rather than changing the Constitution.
   The legislation approved by the House and Senate put the
president in a politically prickly position. In vetoing it, he
might have risked being seen as throwing out a pro-flag bird in the
hand just for the chance to push Congress on a constitutional
amendment that would be harder to get approved.
   He also found himself in a situation similar to his Democratic
presidential opponent from last year, Michael Dukakis, who vetoed
flag legislation on grounds it was unconstitutional. The
Massachusetts governor was scathingly criticized by Bush for
rejecting the legislation, which would have required public schools
teachers in the state to lead pupils in daily recitations of the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Legislation becomes law automatically if the president does not
act on it within 10 working days of when Congress sends it to the
White House, unless Congress is in recess. Then a president can
pocket-veto bills by refusing to sign them.
   Bush said his decision to let it become law was not politically
motivated.
   ``I don't want to set the clock way back and rule out the
legislation, even though I don't think it's enough,'' he said.
   Bush repeated his contention that the new federal legislation
will not survive court challenges. ``I can understand the rationale
of those who voted for this legislation, but in my view, it is not
the ultimate answer,'' he said.
   He called the flag ``a unique and special symbol of our nation
and it should be protected from desecration.''
   Bush said the congressional vote was ``an overwhelming
expression on the part of the Congress to do something about the
protection of the flag.''
   The House voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional action
on the bill.
   The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine for
anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,
burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag
of the United States.''
   The Senate is set next week to take up a constitutional
amendment measure geared toward protecting the flag.

   The government Friday issued rules states must
follow in setting up required education, job training and work
programs to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient.
   The rules implement the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills
Training program, a $3.7 billion, five-year initiative passed by
Congress last year. It was the first major welfare overhaul in more
than half a century.
   ``This final rule recognizes that parents must work toward
self-sufficiency and government must support their efforts,'' said
Eunice Thomas, acting assistant secretary of the Family Support
Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services.
   All states must have a JOBS program approved by the federal
government no later than Oct. 1, 1990.
   Twenty-five states that have begun their programs must have them
re-approved to assure they comply, said David Siegel, a Family
Support Administration spokesman.
   States, whose progam funding will be matched by the federal
government, initially will have to bring 7 percent of their
caseload in Aid to Families with Dependent Children programs under
the new plan, and by 1994 will be required to have 20 percent in
the program.
   About 3.7 million families receive AFDC, the nation's largest
cash assistance program costing about $8.5 billion a year. HHS
estimates that up to 138,000 families will be able to leave the
welfare rolls over the first five years of the JOBS program.
   The plan requires that one parent in two-parent welfare families
to work at least 16 hours a week as a condition for receiving
benefits.
   Single welfare parents with children 3 years or older must
participate in employment and training programs, and teen-age
parents who have not finished high school will be required to
return to school or work toward an equivalent degree.
   States must guarantee child care for parents who participate in
the education and training programs.
   Kathy Patterson of the American Public Welfare Association,
which represents the state human services agencies that will
implement the programs, said the rules give states more flexibility
than did the government's initial proposal.
   ``We're pleased they listened to some of the comments the states
made,'' she said.
   However, she said the association's evaluation was based only on
a briefing by officials at the department's Family Support
Administration and that some of the regulations present concerns.
One such concern is that the rules may impose an overly stringent
cap on funds for child care.

   Woody Allen, who supports mayoral candidate
David Dinkins, says recent remarks by fellow comic Jackie Mason,
who supports Dinkins' Republican opponent, were distorted by a
``foolish and pious'' media.
   At a Dinkins fund-raiser Thursday night, Allen said he found
``no malice or racism'' in comments made by Mason that were printed
in the Village Voice and elsewhere two weeks ago. Mason was forced
to resign as Rudolph Giuliani's honorary campaign chairman over the
incident.
   The Village Voice quoted Mason as saying Dinkins looked like a
model without a job and that there ``was a sick Jewish problem of
voting for a black man.'' Dinkins is black.
   Mason also reportedly referred to Dinkins as a ``fancy shvartze
with a mustache.'' Shvartze is a Yiddish term for blacks that is
generally derogatory.
   ``I think that he's in no way racially prejudiced, and that he
was just joking, and these are the same jokes that he's always
made, and that the press was pious and foolish and, you know, that
he got a raw deal,'' Allen said of Mason, star of ABC's ``Chicken
Soup.''
   ``He was just joking in the same style that he always jokes,''
Allen said. ``Shvartze'' could be pejorative, he said, but ``I
don't think it's pejorative in this case.''
   He also defended Mason's suggestion that Jews would vote for
Dinkins out of guilt. ``I don't know whether it's Jews or blacks,
but I think that people make decisions out of guilt as a
motivation.''
   Dinkins stood by as Allen spoke to reporters at the
$1,000-a-head fund-raiser at the home of Arthur Krim, chairman of
Orion Pictures. The smile left his face and he replied curtly:
``I've made all the comments I intend to make on that subject.
   ``Frankly, I would prefer to talk about crime and drugs and
housing and homelessness. And I would hope that I could somehow or
other interest the media in these issues as well,'' he said.
   Allen said he had met Mason once, for only 30 seconds. A former
stand-up comic himself, the director featured a gaggle of Borsht
belt gagmen similar to Mason in his film ``Broadway Danny Rose.''
   Another comedian, Billy Crystal, made a face when asked about
Mason's comments in a USA Today interview. ``I think Jackie's
remarks are Jackie's remarks,'' he said.
   He did say he thought Mason should have known better, and he
adapted a basic rule of stand-up comedy to apply to politics: ``If
you're going to be a spokesperson, know the room.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
defended her economic strategy Friday, but a jump in inflation to
7.6 percent took some of the gloss off a rousing speech winding up
the Conservative Party's annual conference.
   ``When the choice is between high (interest) rates now or
persistent higher inflation later, with all the damage that would
do, the choice is clear,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``Britain's economy
is strong. When inflation is beaten ... Britain will be stronger
still.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 64 on Friday, received a rapturous
ovation from the 9,000 party activists packed into conference hall
in this north England resort.
   She hailed 1989 ``as the year when the people of half our
continent began to throw off their chains,'' adding, ``We didn't
know it at the time but the torch we lit in Britain, which
transformed our country _ the torch of freedom that is now the
symbol of our party _ became a beacon that has shed its light
across the Iron Curtain into the East.''
   Delegates tapped their feet to the strains of the Beatles'
classic ``When I'm 64,'' and after the keynote speech sang ``Happy
Birthday'' and burst into the favorite Tory anthem, ``Land of Hope
and Glory.''
   They waved huge blue Tory banners and chanted ``10 more years''
as Mrs. Thatcher made her way out of the ballroom.
   Despite the razzmatazz, Mrs. Thatcher, who came to power in 1979
and won a third five-year term in 1987, ended the convention with
her party in trouble.
   Fears of an economic recession have combined with unpopular
plans for a new property tax and privatization of the water and
electricity industries to depress Tory fortunes.
   ``After 10 years in government, Margaret Thatcher is facing her
toughest test,'' commented the respected weekly, The Economist,
which usually supports the Thatcher government.
   Mrs. Thatcher made no direct reference to the Conservatives'
slumping popularity, now an average 7 points behind the socialist
Labor Party.
   But she said inflation was too high and acknowledged that
soaring interest rates _ doubled to 15 percent in the past 16
months _ were hitting businesses and millions of home-buyers.
   In London, the government announced that the annual inflation
rate has risen to 7.6 percent from 7.3 percent, which was already
among the highest in industrialized countries.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the Labor Party, surging ahead on a new, more
moderate platform, was ``seeking power at any price and they'll say
anything to get it.''
   ``Labor's real prescription for Britain is the disease half the
world is struggling to cure,'' she added, referring to reforms in
Poland and Hungary and protests against East Germany's hardline
communist rulers.
   Labor last month ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear
disarmament, and Mrs. Thatcher dismissed the action as ``no more
than a confidence trick.''
   ``It's still unilateral disarmament _ unilateral disarmament by
agreement with the Soviet Union,'' she said. ``That isn't a defense
policy to see Britain through the 1990s. Its a form of words to see
Labor through the next election.''
   She took a few cracks at critics of her rigorous tight-money
brand of conservatism, including academics and some church leaders.
   ``I went to Oxford University, but I've never let it hold me
back,'' she said of the ancient university which in 1985 voted
against giving her an honorary doctorate in protest at cuts state
grants.
   The four-day convention was overshadowed by economic problems.
Inflation, fuelled by a booming credit, began to take off again
last year.
   The government is using high interest rates as the sole means of
trying both to curb inflation and defend the value of the pound.
   Pressure is mounting from right and left _ big business, trade
unions and the Labor Party _ for Mrs. Thatcher to speed up British
entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System. It is links the currencies of most of the 12-member nations
of the European Economic Community.
   The issue has divided Mrs. Thatcher, who has set stringent
conditions for entry, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
Critics charge that the differences mean the government lacks a
coherent economic strategy.
   During the conference, there were also signs of unease that Mrs.
Thatcher's combative style is not working any more. Some top Tories
say privately they also fear that she will not be able to pull the
economy around before the next election, which must be held by
mid-1992.

   Mental retardation is rising among Soviet children
because of worsening alcoholism among parents, a newspaper said
Friday in the latest media revelation on how children suffer for
Soviet society's ills.
   One special education school in the southern Russian city of
Oryol has seen the number of retarded children it serves more than
quintuple during a period when the city's population only doubled,
the daily Sovietskaya Rossia reported.
   The newspaper attributed the rising retardation rate to the
intractable alcoholism that drives Soviets to make bootleg liquor
and drink everything from after-shave lotion to insect repellent.
   Other recent Soviet media reports have focused on baldness,
deformities and diseases in children living in polluted areas and
on the terrible toll radiation has taken on babies on the Chukotka
peninsula in the Soviet northeast.
   ``Infant mortality remains high'' in the entire Soviet Union,
Pravda reported Friday, and allergies, cancer and heart disease are
increasing because of pollution.
   More than 90 children were reported to have lost their hair this
year in towns near the shale-oil fields in the Baltic coast of
Estonia due to an ailment apparently caused by the dirty
environment. Other outbreaks of child baldness were reported in the
Ukraine.
   In Chukotka, which lies across the Bering Strait from Alaska,
nuclear tests carried out decades ago have left such a high level
of radiation that the cancer rate there is 2-3 times higher than
the national average and infant mortality can reach up to 100
deaths per 1,000 infants, the Moscow News reported this summer.
   The people of northern Russia are considered to be living in
some of the country's worst conditions, with pollution widespread
and shortages especially extreme.

   Attackers hurled firebombs into the home
of an opposition figure from neighboring Malawi on Friday and
killed seven people, police said, but the apparent target of the
attack was not in the house.
   Four of the victims were children ranging in age from two months
to eight years, police said. Five people were injured, including
the owner of the house, Mkwapatira Mhango.
   Mhango is secretary of publicity and information of the Malawi
Freedom Movement, or Mafremo, which opposes the government of
Malawi's president, Kamuzu Banda.
   He said the apparent target of the firebombing was Edward
Chirwa, Mafremo's chairman, who had been visiting Zambia and
staying with Mhango.
   ``This must have been politically motivated from Malawi,'' said
Mhango, who was hospitalized with severe burns.
   ``Dr. Chirwa was here on a private visit and not to hatch a plot
against the Malawian government,'' Mhango said. He said Chirwa
returned to Malawi a few days ago.
   An official at the Malawi High Commission, or embassy, said the
Malawi government would never countenance state terrorism. The
official refused to be identified.
   Mhango's two wives, three of their children, and a visiting
Malawian woman and her baby were killed in the attack in the
working-class suburb of Kamwala, police said.
   Mhango's four other children were hospitalized with severe
burns, nurses said. They said Mhango's condition was satisfactory.
   Police said the gang first hurled rocks through the windows of
the house and then flaming firebombs.
   The victims suffocated or died in the blaze that destroyed most
of the bungalow.
   Police spokesman Max Nkole said a motive had not been
established and no one was under arrest.
   Mhango has been living in exile in Lusaka for many years. He
distributes propaganda against Banda's government.
   Banda led the British colony of Nyasaland to independence as
Malawi in 1964. All opposition parties in his tiny southern African
nation are outlawed, an undisclosed number of opponents are in
detention, and thousands more have fled the country.
   Banda declared himself president for life in 1971, and he has
survived several assassination attempts.
   Mafremo, the Socialist League of Malawi, and the Congress for
the Second Republic are opposition movements that have sprung up
over the years and pledged to topple Banda and restore democracy.
   The last leader of Mafremo, Attati Mpakati, was assassinated by
unknown gunmen in the Zimbabwe capital of Harare in March 1983.

   Computer experts received scattered reports today of computer
viruses that had struck unsuspecting users on Friday the 13th, even
as they cautioned that fears of widespread damage were overblown.
   An institute for the blind in London was among the victims,
although it apparently was infected with a previously known virus,
not the so-called Columbus Day virus that was seen for the first
time when it was activated by computers' internal clocks at 12:01
today.
   Ross M. Greenberg, a security specialist in New York and creator
of the Flu-Shot Plus and Virex-PC anti-viral software, said at
midmorning that he had received seven reports of virus strikes
since midnight, but only one was the Columbus Day virus.
   He said 12 personal computers at Columbia University in New York
City were affected, but that the university had made backup files
and was merely inconvenienced.
   Several officials at Columbia today said they were unable to
confirm the report, and Greenberg acknowledged the information was
not first-hand.
   The other six virus reports Greenberg received were of the
so-called PLO virus, an older virus designed to erase programs
every Friday the 13th. Greenberg had said earlier that the PLO
virus was far more widespread and likely to cause more trouble
today than the new Columbus Day virus.
   In Britain, the Royal National Institution for the Blind
reported that it was struck by a virus.
   ``We found that most of our program files are gone. Every time
we try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of our
eyes,'' said Corri Barrett of the institute in London. ``It's
horrendous. Months and months of work has been wiped out here.''
   Barrett said in a BBC-TV interview that the virus might have
contaminated disks distributed to blind clients and that their
systems had been infected.
   Greenberg said the virus was almost certainly the PLO virus.
   The Columbus Day virus, also called the Datacrime virus, does
not erase files but is programmed to scramble indexing information
in IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers. It would be the
equivalent of removing a library's card catalog.
   Computer viruses, created by anonymous programmers, are pieces
of software that make copies of themselves and spread from one
machine to another through infected floppy disks, office networks
or phone links such as computer bulletin boards.
   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breeding
germ, eating away processing power and storage space or destroying
information. About 30 viruses are known to exist, not counting
strains and mutations.
   Fears of a virus could be beneficial if they get people to
``think of making backup files as readily as they think of wearing
seat belts,'' said Martha Brothers of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.
   Alex Williams, receptionist at IBM Corp.'s regional marketing
and service center in Baltimore, said he had received no reports of
a virus infection with the company's equipment or from area
customers this morning.
   ``Usually if anything like that happens, we get a message, and I
haven't seen a thing,'' Williams said.
   In Switzerland, Bernhard Schmid, head of the federal personal
computer team, said several dozen of the government's 3,500
personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus but
that experts managed to cancel and reprogram all infected programs.
He said infected programs had been found in a wide range of
administrative branches.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the Portuguese Computing
Association was informed of two viral outbreaks today, but they
were both strains that appeared previously. A leading bank and a
medium-size industrial concern were affected, Lusa said. It did not
identify the companies.
   Last November, a virus spread through a computer network shared
by colleges, research centers and the military. It took several
days to cleanse the 60,000 computers in the network affected by the
virus, which had multiplied out of control, overloading the
memories of the computer systems it invaded.
   Since March, a dozen cases of the Columbus Day virus have been
found dormant in computers when people noticed that some of their
files had swollen inexplicably. Infected programs were turned over
to experts who dismantled the virus and found out when it would be
triggered.
   ``We want to send a calming message to people that if they take
reasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than any
other,'' said Thomas P. Malarkey, deputy chief of the National
Computer Security Center.
   Said Greenberg: ``All the people I consider to be respectable in
the anti-virus community have a similar opinion to mine, that the
Datacrime virus has been blown way out of proportion by an
unknowledgeable media.''

<HEAD>Forest Service Says Marijuana Crop Size Will Remain Stable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a sharp increase in the number of
arrests and plants destroyed, the size of the marijuana crop
growing illegally in national forests will probably remain the same
for the next several years, the U.S. Forest Service said Friday.
   The report also said that ``organized networks'' of growers and
distributors now control more than half of the marijuana crop in
the national forests and the number of clandestine drug labs, most
producing methamphetamines, remains a serious problem.
   The report was released by Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and the
successful sponsor of legislation last year giving the Forest
Service increased powers to deal with drug problems in the federal
forests.
   Wyden said he would ask William Bennett, the presidential drug
policy coordinator, next week to form a ``strike force'' to
spearhead the war on the drug networks operating in the national
forests.
   ``In the 1988 drug act, we told the Forest Service `go
get'em,''' Wyden said. ``This report shows how well they've done.
But they're catching the equivalent of serfs and peasants. They
must now catch the lords who direct forest crime.''
   The Forest Service said in the report that it expected to be
``faced with a continuing drug production challenge in the national
forest system for the foreseeable future.''
   The report, recounting figures that had largely been released
previously, said:
   _Almost 415,000 marijuana plants were eradicated in the national
forests in 1988, an 84 percent increase over the 254,950 plants
destroyed in 1987.
   _Law enforcement personel made 543 arrests in 1988, up roughly
300 percent over the 135 arrests in 1987.
   _Areas in the national forests considered ``unsafe'' because of
marijuana crops that could be booby-trapped or armed growers
defending their plants fell about 50 percent, from 772,600 acres in
1987 to 388,800 acres in 1988.
   _Some 116 booby-traps were found in 1988 compared with 83 in
1987; the number of weapons seized grew from 101 to 271, and the
number of drug-related assaults dropped from 19 to 11.
   Preliminary estimates for the first nine months of 1989 suggest
that the number of arrests and plants destroyed this year will
exceed last year's totals, the Forest Service said.
   ``Our analysis of these trends suggest that despite increased
eradication and apprehension effectiveness the total volume of
cannabis produced in the national forest system may remain about
the same for the next several years,'' the Forest Service said.
   Roughly two-thirds of the cannabis sites found and half the
plants eradicated in 1988 were in the national forests of the
South, the report said.
   The Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky, because of its
nearness to urban markets in the East and the depressed local
economy, accounted for almost 25 percent of the cannabis eradicated
throughout the national forest system in 1988, the report said.

   President Bush's handling of flag legislation
he didn't want but didn't dare veto demonstrates anew his
understanding of the red, white and blue politics he used so
effectively against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential
campaign.
   Veto a bill that makes it a crime to desecrate the flag? Bush
was not about to fall into the legalistic trap that ensnared
Dukakis when he vetoed legislation to require recitation of the
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
   Then was Bush ready to sign the flag bill into law? Not exactly.
   This president, who is raising the art of compromise to new
levels, took a different tack. He suggested he didn't dislike the
legislation enough to veto it; he didn't like it enough to sign it.
   ``I will allow the bill to become law without my signature,''
said Bush, who vowed to continue pressing for a constitutional
amendment.
   It was a graphic reminder of Bush's 1988 campaign stand that he
would have found a way to require teachers to lead pupils in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   For Dukakis, there was no compromise when confronted with
legislation he believed violated the Constitution. He saw his
choice as sign or veto; his duty as veto.
   Bush rarely sees things in such stark terms, even an issue that
he pursues with as much fervor as protecting the flag.
   The bill sent to Bush would mandate up to a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine for anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces,
physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or
tramples upon any flag of the United States.''
   Many critics believe the bill will not pass review by the
Supreme Court. Bush never has publicly addressed the issue of its
constitutionality.
   It moved through Congress swiftly, completing its legislative
journey with a 317-to-34 vote Thursday in the House.
   After the Supreme Court ruled last June that flag-burning was a
constitutionally protected form of free speech, Bush was among the
first to call for amending the Constitution to permit Congress and
the states to make such behavior illegal.
   He stood before the Iwo Jima memorial, a statue depicting
Marines raising the flag on that bloody World War II battleground,
to declare his support for an amendment and his belief it was an
issue that ``transcends politics and patriotism.''
   But the politics of the moment were unmistakable.
   While congressional Democrats balked at amending the
Constitution, they had learned the lessons of the 1988 presidential
campaign.
   ``Before we amend the Constitution we should approach the
question with a statutory change,'' said House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash. The Democrats rushed to draft legislation to protect
the flag without changing the Constitution.
   Bush termed their efforts ``inadequate'' but he steered clear of
making the debate a partisan fight.
   ``I don't have disrespect for those who want to find a different
answer,'' was his response when asked to comment on the legislative
effort.
   While Foley echoed the president's statements about keeping the
debate above politics, the Democrats had to get some satisfaction
out of putting Bush in the position of opposing their flag
protection bill.
   But they had little hope Bush would react the way Dukakis did to
the Pledge of Allegiance bill passed by the Massachusetts
legislature during his first term as governor.
   Dukakis vetoed that bill because he believed it was
unconstitutional to require public school teachers to lead pupils
in daily recitation of the Pledge and he never seemed to comprehend
why people didn't agree with his view of his clear duty in that
case.
   In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination,
Bush put the issue this way:
   ``Should public school teachers be required to lead our children
in the Pledge of Allegiance? My opponent says no _ but I say yes.''
   He closed that speech by asking ``everyone in this great hall to
stand and join me'' as he recited the Pledge of Allegiance.

<TEXT>
   Blacks planned 17 rallies
across the country Saturday to celebrate the imminent release of
eight major anti-apartheid leaders, including seven jailed for a
quarter-century.
   Walter Sisulu, a leader of the African National Congress, and at
least four of his jailed colleagues were flown Friday from their
Cape Town prison to their hometown of Johannesburg, according to
airline personnel.
   The men were immediately taken to Diepkloof Prison outside the
city and near the huge Soweto township, according to various
reports.
   Another prisoner, Raymond Mhlaba, was flown from Cape Town to
his hometown, the southern city of Port Elizabeth.
   The white-run government announced Tuesday that the eight,
ranging in age from 60 to 80, would be freed unconditionally.
Officials have refused to say when or where the men will be
released. Some _ if not all _ were expected to be freed over the
weekend.
   Seven of the men are ranking African National Congress members
and Sisulu, 77, is the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed
guerrilla movement after Nelson Mandela.
   Mandela's release has not yet been approved but is widely
expected in the next few months.
   The eighth, Jafta Masemola, belongs to a smaller black
nationalist guerrilla movement, the Pan Africanist Congress.
   The decision by President F.W. de Klerk to release the activists
has generally won high praise, both in South Africa and abroad. De
Klerk, who became president in August, says he wants to end racial
discrimination and negotiate a new constitution that will bring the
black majority into the national government.
   However, almost all black political leaders have said they will
not negotiate with de Klerk until the government makes several
concessions, including the release of political prisoners.
   Anti-apartheid leaders applied to magistrates to hold ``victory
marches'' in cities and towns across the country Saturday to
celebrate the releases.
   The New Nation, a militant opposition newspaper, said at least
250,000 people were expected to take part.
   Police Friday lifted restrictions on Sisulu's wife, Albertina,
who had been banned from meetings and making public statements
since February 1988.
   Mrs. Sisulu, a prominent activist in her own right, told
reporters at her Soweto home she would join the planned march in
Johannesburg.
   Journalists and residents waited outside her house for much of
the day, and police used tear gas to disperse a group of youths
dancing in the street Friday evening.
   One young girl was injured and ABC News had one of its video
cassettes confiscated, witnesses said.
   Mrs. Sisulu said she received some political advice from Mandela
on Tuesday, when she and other activists met with him at his prison
quarters near Cape Town.
   ``Now that there are less limitations on my activities, I will
be able to push ahead with the suggestions and advice given to me
by Mandela,'' she said without elaborating.
   Mrs. Sisulu is co-president of the banned United Democratic
Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   Despite her restrictions, Mrs. Sisulu, 71, was issued a
short-term passport by the government this year. She and other
anti-apartheid leaders met President Bush, French President
Francois Mitterrand and officials of other Western governments.
   In addition to Sisulu, four of the other prisoners to be freed
were sentenced to life in prison _ along with Mandela _ at the
Rivonia treason trial in 1964. They are Ahmed Kathrada, 60; Elias
Motsoaledi, 65; Andrew Mlengi, 63; and Mhlaba, 69.
   Also to be freed are African National Congress leaders Oscar
Mpetha, 80, and Wilton Mkwayi, 67, and Masemola, 60.
   All have been imprisoned for 25 years except the ailing Mpetha,
who is nearing the end of a five-year term.
   When they are released, the seven African National Congress
members are expected to seek permission to travel to the group's
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   A leading official of the guerrilla movement said the release of
the political prisoners shows international pressure is working.
   Thabo Mbeki, the group's secretary for international affairs,
said he did not believe the release was a sign of a new spirit of
conciliation on de Klerk's part.
   ``I think it's a response to pressure,'' he said in an interview
with the BBC. ``I don't think it signifies that this regime of de
Klerk is any different from the regime of P.W. Botha except that
the pressures have become so much that it has to yield ground.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Yugoslav Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush offered encouragement Friday to
Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markovic for adopting economic and
political reforms opposed by hardliners in the Communist Party.
   The two leaders met for a half hour in the Oval Office, joined
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft, Yugoslav Federal Executive Counsel member Dzevad
Mujezinovic and Deputy Foreign Minister Milivoje Maksic.
   Markovic is seeking American backing for his country's efforts
to obtain loans from the International Monetary Fund and private
banks to ease Yugoslavia's $17 billion foreign debt and help steer
the Marxist country toward a market-oriented economy.
   Yugoslavia's economy currently is ravaged by a 1,200 percent
annual inflation rate.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
``reaffirmed his strong support for Yugoslav independence, unity
and sovereignty.'' He said the president welcomed Markovic's
``commitment to market-oriented economic reform and to building
democratic pluralism throughout Yugoslavia.''
   Fitzwater said, ``The president stressed, and Prime Minister
Markovic agreed, that implementation of an economic reform program
is essential to attracting foreign investment and Yugoslavia's
economic recovery.''
   Markovic, talking with reporters afterward, said he renewed an
invitation for Bush to visit Yugoslavia and that the president
agreed in principle to come.
   Discussing reforms, Markovic said, ``We want to establish a
completely new economic structure. It would be of primary
importance to have American banks, businesses and technology coming
in. ...''
   Markovic wants $1 billion for Yugoslavia's banking system, which
is being reformed in accordance with Western standards. U.S.
officials say the money is needed to prop up banks that have been
backing money-losing ventures that would lose government subsidies
under anticipated reforms.
   Yugoslavia is asking the 152-member World Bank for a loan of
$300 million to $350 million.

   A year-long austerity program achieved some
success in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing
prices but failed to solve serious defects in state planning, a
report published Friday shows.
   The official China Daily said food retail prices had not risen
since December, but acknowledged that huge government subsidies
were a main factor in keeping prices down.
   The State Statistical Bureau, in a survey of 28 major cities,
found that more than $270 million was spent in the first half of
the year for pork subsidies, and another $54 million for vegetables.
   The daily quoted experts as saying the growing subsidies will
cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities
to ``become very unreasonable.'' That will cut the amount of funds
available for investment.
   The austerity program was imposed last fall, when the government
cut off credit to companies outside the state plan, suspended new
building projects, cut public spending and reasserted central
controls over key industries and trade.
   Conservatives solidified their control after the June military
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. They support central
planning, are reluctant to tackle economic reforms and stress
public ownership.
   The lot of small industries and private businessmen has become
increasingly difficult.
   The austerity measures were designed in part to control economic
growth, which soared to 20.7 percent last year to 8 percent in
1990. Economists predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 percent
and retail sales will be up only 15 percent, compared to a 27.8
percent jump in 1988.
   The Customs Administration said restrictions on imports were
paying off. China recorded its first trade surplus of the year in
September, with exports exceeding imports by $345 million on total
trade of $9.19 billion.
   Inflation has almost leveled off and retail prices were up 18.5
percent in the first six months of 1989. Inflation in urban areas
was well above 30 percent last year.
   The government has yet to solve the problem of factories being
forced to turn to high-priced free markets for basic materials the
state is unable to supply.
   Production costs were up 20.2 percent in the first eight months
of the year _ an 8.9 percent increase over the same period in 1988
_ because of continued supply-demand imbalances.
   The State Planning Commission and other ministries complained
recently that many state-run factories, staggered by rising costs,
are selling their goods on the more profitable free market rather
than to the state.
   Smaller, locally run firms, which have provided the Chinese
economy with its punch in recent years, have been hit hard by the
withdrawal of credit and many are being forced out of business.
   The closures have added to the unemployment crisis in the
countryside, where small industries have provided 100 million jobs
in the past decade.
   People are reluctant to return to the land, which already faces
a labor surplus. Tens of millions have drifted into the cities to
look for construction work and menial jobs that have dried up under
the austerity plan.
   The government continues to pour large amounts of money into
large state industries, many of which are overstaffed, inefficient
and uncompetitive. The bank said total debt owed by state firms to
banks and other enterprises has reached $29.3 billion.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices tumbled today in the most
spectacular drop of the year, battered by fear of higher inflation
and word that the United Airlines takeover bid may have collapsed.
   The speed of the decline spooked traders in a startling reminder
of the worst stock panic ever almost two years ago on Oct. 19.
   By late afternoon, the widely watched Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks had plunged 115 points to the 2,645 level, by far
the biggest drop for the index this year. Other stock indices also
fell sharply.
   If the 115-point drop held until closing, it would be the fourth
biggest drop in the Dow industrials on record, in terms of points
lost. The largest was the 508-point drop of Oct. 19, 1987, the
second-largest was a 156.83-point drop a week after that, and the
third largest was a 140.58-point drop on Jan. 8, 1988.
   Brokers said the drop was triggered partly by news that a
labor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed
$6.75 billion takeover of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. UAL
is a component of the Dow Transportation index.
   Others said news from the Labor Department that wholesale prices
rose sharply in September suggested inflation was accelerating,
reducing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would act to ease
interest rates.

<HEAD>Swiss Flight Attendant Released in North Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 31-year-old Swiss flight attendant was
released Friday after being held for six days in northern Lebanon,
security sources said.
   Lebanese police said they had no information on the case. ``The
abduction was not reported to us in the first place,'' a spokesman
said.
   Reliable Lebanese security sources said the woman, Astrid
Fischer, was released in the port city of Tripoli.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Fischer
left Tripoli after her release and went to the village of Koubba.
The part-time attendant for Swissair has a house in this village in
the Syrian-controlled north.
   The security source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. Fischer in Koubba
Sunday and that she was ``interrogated in connection with her
activities and stay in Lebanon.'' He did not elaborate and refused
to identify the kidnappers.
   Reporters and photographers arriving in Koubba, 31 miles north
of Beirut, were told by unidentified armed guards ringing Ms.
Fischer's house that she did not want to be disturbed.
   The guards, who wore civilian clothes, declined to identify
themselves. They were believed to be either members of the Syrian
intelligence service or militiamen of former Lebanese president
Suleiman Franjieh _ the only paramilitary force allowed to operate
in the region.
   Franjieh, 79, president when Lebanon's civil war broke out in
1975, heads the Marada, or Giants militia, which is allied with
Syria.
   Christian and Moslem radio stations in Beirut said Franjieh was
instrumental in Ms. Fischer's release. They did not elaborate.
   In Bern, Swiss Foreign Ministry official Francois Chappuis said
Ms. Fischer's freedom was gained through contacts by Dino Sciolli,
Switzerland's ambassador to Lebanon based in Cyprus.
   Chappuis told reporters there never was any indication of a
political motive behind Fischer's abduction and no demands were
made. He refused to speculate on the motive.
   Ms. Fischer was the third Swiss national to be abducted in
Lebanon in the last week.
   Red Cross workers Elio Erriquez and Emmanual Christen, both
Swiss, were abducted in the southern provincial capital of Sidon
Oct. 6. No group has claimed responsibility or made demands for
their release.
   Including the Swiss Red Cross workers, 18 foreigners are missing
in Lebanon. They include eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.
   Most of the foreign hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem underground factions.
   Held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Police blamed the radical Palestinian Fatah-Revolutionary
Council faction led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal for
kidnapping Christen and Erriquez. The group denied involvement.

   Police on Friday found the body of a
retired French army general who was reported missing after he
failed to return home six days ago.
   The body of Jean Favreau, the 72-year-old former military
commander of Paris, was found about 6:30 p.m. under a bridge on the
Dordogne River at the village of Izon, said a spokesman for the
Gironde prefecture, southwestern France.
   Police had been searching for Favreau since he failed to return
home Saturday after leaving his wife at the railway station in
Libourne, a town 20 miles from Bordeaux.
   Favreau was last seen driving from the station in his
Mercedes-Benz, which was later spotted with two other people
inside. Police, who lost the vehicle after a brief chase, later
found the car _ burned _ about 9 miles away.
   Police speculated Favreau may have been thrown off the bridge,
but no other details were available about the cause or
circumstances of his death.
   An anonymous caller on Wednesday told the regional newspaper
Sud-Ouest that the Direct Action terrorist group had kidnapped
Favreau and demanded the release of all the gang's members in jail.
   The caller offered no proof and police discounted the claim,
saying the alleged kidnapping did not fit with the known facts.

<HEAD>House GOP Whip Says Ethics Committee Should Investigate Dickinson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Dickinson's financial dealings with
an Alabama industrialist should be investigated by the House ethics
committee, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich said Friday.
   But Gingrich, R-Ga., who led the ethics crusade that forced
Democrat Jim Wright to resign as speaker of the House, said he
won't file an ethics complaint to trigger an investigation of the
Alabama lawmaker, the senior Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee.
   ``Clearly, ... the ethics committee will look at the case and
report back,'' Gingrich said when asked if he thought Dickinson had
violated House rules by accepting a one-third interest in a
$300,000 investment venture funded by Ben Collier of Montgomery,
Ala.
   ``I would be very surprised if they didn't issue some kind of
ruling,'' he said.
   Gingrich is the target of an ethics complaint filed by Rep. Bill
Alexander, D-Ark. The complaint alleges that Gingrich may have
violated campaign finance laws, limits on outside income and a rule
preventing acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in
legislation.
   Gingrich has denied any violations.
   While the ethics committee can initiate an investigation on its
own, the filing of a formal complaint by one member of Congress
against another forces the panel of six Democrats and six
Republicans to vote on whether an investigation should be opened.
   Mike Lewis, Dickinson's press secretary, said Dickinson had no
comment on Gingrich's statements.
   Dickinson said in an interview this week that he approached
Collier in 1986 with ``what I thought was a good business
opportunity.''
   He said they formed the Montgomery Investment Club, with Collier
supplying the $300,000 and Dickinson supplying the ``contacts.''
Their agreement provided that any profits or losses would go
one-third to Dickinson and two-thirds to Collier.
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more
than $100 from an individual who has a direct interest in
legislation before Congress. Dickinson contends that rule does not
cover Collier, whose companies have done $50 million in government
defense work since 1987.
   Dickinson said he never made any money from the investment
because the $300,000 was turned over to Steven A. Streit of
Huntsville, Ala., who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud
charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Streit's assets were frozen in 1987, and Dickinson said the
investment club has received about 90 percent of the $300,000 from
a bankruptcy clerk that is serving Streit's creditors.

<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessica McClure says she's doing OK two
years after her rescue from an abandoned water well.
   ``I'm fine,'' the 3{-year-old said in an extremely brief phone
interview Thursday night.
   Jessica and her parents, Chip and Cissy, are doing nothing to
mark the anniversary of her rescue Oct. 16, when dozens of
volunteers helped her out of a well in her aunt's back yard. The
toddler cried and softly sang a nursery rhyme while she was wedged
22 feet underground for 58 hours.
   Like the McClure family, Midland plans no commemorations _ no
parades, no speeches.
   About the closest thing to a celebration will be the handing out
of the Midland Community Spirit Award to recognize a city that
responded to a person or group in need, Mayor Carroll Thomas said.
   But the award probably won't be given Oct. 16, Thomas said,
because he and about eight other judges are still looking at the
70-odd entries.
   He said the award, which was publicized in August in a ``Dear
Abby'' column, will be given soon, but set no date.
   Meanwhile, Jessica walks just fine, her father said, although
her right little toe and the tip of her right big toe were
amputated after the rescue.
   ``She has no memory of the incident whatsoever,'' he said.
   Jessica gets one or two cards a day, he said.
   When Jessica was hospitalized after the rescue, she was received
truckloads of cards and gifts of stuffed animals. Someone donated
the McClures a phone answering machine, and they were getting 100
to 200 calls a day.
   ``I really appreciated the outpouring of affection,'' said
McClure, who, with his wife, was 18 at the time of the accident.
``But, truthfully, it was a big hassle.''
   Jessica is curious, bright and talks well, McClure said, adding
that she doesn't suffer from nightmares or claustrophobia.
   The McClures seemed overwhelmed by the publicity at first, but
the strain did not threaten to split them apart.
   ``If this did anything, it strengthened our marriage,'' McClure
said.

<HEAD>Assassination Conviction Thrown Out, Drifter Seeks Return to Normalcy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drifter who won an appeal against his
conviction for the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme said Friday
he doesn't want to change his identity and prefers to return to the
easygoing life he had before his arrest.
   The 10 months of imprisonment for his interrogation, trial and
appeal had left him unchanged, said Christer Pettersson, a day
after his July conviction was thrown out.
   ``I am what I am, and I think I'm going to be the same,'' said
Pettersson, an admitted alcohol and amphetamine abuser who has been
in and out of jail or mental institutions for years.
   Pettersson, 42, said he turned down offers of police protection
and help to change his appearance and identity, saying he did not
feel threatened by people who still believed he was Palme's killer.
   ``I have already started living as before. Police had plans for
me to go away for a few weeks. But I must face the world at some
point anyway,'' he told a crowded news conference in the office of
his attorney, Arne Liljeros.
   ``What can I do? Can I live in some other part of the world? No,
I don't think so,'' he said.
   The appellate court on Thursday found the evidence against
Pettersson insufficient. His release left police with no suspects,
no new witnesses and no apparent leads to unravel the mystery of
Palme's shooting Feb. 28, 1986, while he walked with his wife on a
Stockholm street.
   ``The investigation of the Palme murder will continue,'' said
state prosecutor Axel Morath.
   The small team of detectives still on the case were focusing
efforts on finding the missing murder weapon, a .357-caliber Magnum
pistol, or any other forensic evidence, said a senior police
official.
   Palme dominated Swedish politics for nearly two decades and was
an international figure for socialist causes and nuclear
disarmament. His slaying shocked this nation unaccustomed to street
violence or political assassination.
   Palme was shot from close range while he and his wife, Lisbeth
walked home from a movie.
   Pettersson, who was sentenced by the District Court to life
imprisonment, has maintained his innocence. He spent his first
night of freedom playing cards and drinking with a neighbor.
   Pettersson has received help from the Swedish welfare state
through an ``early retirement'' program, often used to support
drunks or other people considered unemployable.
   Talkative and joking, Pettersson fielded questions in Swedish
and English. He said he held no rancor toward Mrs. Palme, whose
testimony was the key to the prosection's case against him.
   Though he said he would like to meet Mrs. Palme, he admitted it
would be unlikely. ``But if it would happen, I would like to hug
her. I share her loss and do not think she is lying.''
   Mrs. Palme testified that she saw Pettersson when she looked up
from her dying husband and was ``100 percent'' certain he was the
gunman.
   Legal experts said that unequivocal statement would prohibit her
from testifying against anyone else accused of the crime. Another
half-dozen witnesses who claimed to have seen Pettersson stalking
Palme on the night of the crime also would be disqualified in any
future case, they said.
   Mrs. Palme made no immediate public comment on Pettersson's
release.

   Only days after reports that knobheaded giants
from space invaded a Russian town, Elvis has been spotted in
Leningrad.
   Maxim Leonidov, a Soviet impersonator of the late rock 'n roll
king, is starring in a new musical that weaves Elvis Presley's
music through the story of his life.
   The official news agency Tass, which gave the world the alien
invasion of Voronezh, made a bold assessment Friday of the American
star's popularity in the Soviet Union.
   ``For many years, Presley's music was labeled `anti-artistic'
and `immoral' in the Soviet Union,'' it said. ``Illegal or not, the
King still reigned.''
   Tass said Elvis seems to come back to life in the Leningrad
production, and is ``incredibly famous, bitter about chances missed
and immersed in the personal tragedy that cut his life short at
42'' in 1977.
   The show is based on a play by Regina Loesner of West Germany
and is being presented by the Leningrad rock studio Secret.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-two Moscow managers are in the United
States to pick up a few tips on capitalism in trip that would have
been taboo just three years ago.
   Four senior construction executives said Friday the eight-week
trip is part of their own version of perestroika, a bid to
modernize and restructure Moscow's infrastructure.
   The four are guests of KPMG Peat Marwick, a New York-based
management and consulting firm.
   ``This training is very important,'' said Andrei Stroyev, 42,
head of Mosinzhstroy, the Moscow agency responsible for
infrastructure construction and rehabilitation. It also serves as a
general contractor in Moscow, a city of about 8 million residents.
   ``I'm absolutely sure that this visit is the most important part
of the whole training process,'' Stroyev said Friday during a news
conference here.
   The executives are busy touring construction sites and observing
management and design practices in Pittsburgh, San Francisco,
Atlanta, Miami, New York City and neighboring areas.
   The trip is paid for with money already earned by Perestroika
Joint Venture, a partnership Stroyev formed with the Atlanta-based
Worsham Group Inc., a development firm building office and living
space in Moscow for foreigners.
   Stroyev is chairman of the partnership, which came into
existence after Soviet officials passed a law in 1987 allowing
Soviet agencies to form joint ventures with foreign companies.
   The partnership began four construction projects in Moscow this
year, and has received six year's rent in cash from their clients,
he said.
   ``The reason why we chose this direction is actually there is
really a serious shortage of office space, shortage of hotels and
apartments, in Moscow for foreign communities,'' Stroyev said.
   ``This gives us the possibility to invest some hard currency to
speed up the process of construction and then to get back very good
return on the investments.''
   The joint venture also is hoping to put together deals that
would send Moscow construction crews to work on projects in other
countries, he said.
   The management training program began in June and July with a
two-month series of lectures on U.S. business and culture. The 22
Soviet executives visiting the U.S. this month will be followed by
25 other Mosinzhstroy managers in November.
   About 150 others, lower level managers, will visit the U.S. and
other foreign nations next year.
   The four Pittsburgh visitors _ Yefim Sloutski, 50, Georgy
Sinitzki, 54, Vladimir P. Samoilov, 62, and Valentin G. Lerner, 53,
all of Moscow _ are tunnel experts who supervise departments of
about 2,500 employees each. Mosinzhstroy has about 35,000 employess.

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's largest bank
said Friday that some bankers feel betrayed by high-handed tactics
they contend the Bush administration is using to push its Third
World debt-reduction strategy.
   Citicorp Chairman John Reed said the debt initiative unveiled in
March by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady had generated enormous
tension in the banking industry, in part because banks weren't
consulted before the plan was put in place.
   ``With no warning and no obvious reason, all of a sudden the
banks are being asked to shoulder serious economic burdens,'' Reed
said.
   ``For those (bankers) who are walking around feeling there is an
element of betrayal and high-handed action and lack of consultation
and so forth, there is tons of evidence to support that.''
   Reed, who spoke to reporters at the fall meeting of the Business
Council, did not say that he fully agreed with those feelings.
Instead, he said he preferred a more benign interpretation of the
administration's actions.
   ``Depending on the way you look at the coin, on the one hand you
could feel betrayal and a change of signals and on the other hand
you could look and see what is going on as a necessary
pre-condition to get this (debt crisis) behind us,'' he said.
   There have been reports of shouting matches between bankers and
administration officials, and a senior Treasury official warned
last week that if commercial banks fail to lend more money to
Mexico the consequences for the banks could be ``very painful.''
   The Brady plan calls on banks to forgive part of their Third
World loans and to make new loans.
   Many bankers predict that because the plan envisions substantial
write-offs of old debt, the banks will turn their backs on the
Third World and refuse to provide the new loans needed to keep
developing countries afloat.
   Treasury undersecretary David Mulford, the chief architect of
the administration's debt strategy, briefed the Business Council on
the proposal Friday.
   Afterward, in a session with reporters, Mulford said it was a
``fact of life that the debt strategy is a very difficult problem''
for the banks as well as the debtor countries.
   ``Since not everybody can have everything that they want, then
obviously everybody will have some degree of unhappiness,'' he said.
   Mulford denied that he or others in the administration were
putting pressure on the banks to go along with debt reduction. But
he said that for banks willing to write off a portion of their old
debt, the Brady plan does offer various guarantees through
international lending agencies that the remaining debt will be
repaid.
   Mulford said that negotiations with Mexico, the first country to
benefit from the Brady plan, were ``on track'' for completion later
this year and that talks were also going forward with other
countries, including Venezuela.
   Reed said he believed that the Mexican negotiations would result
in enough banks coming forward with new money to make the plan work
but that it would not be known for sure until Nov. 1, the deadline

   Merab Kostava, a prominent Soviet Georgian
dissident, was killed in an auto accident early Friday, the
unofficial news agency Express-Khronika reported.
   A fellow activist said Soviet authorities had threatened
Kostava's life.
   Kostava was riding with two other Georgian pro-independence
activists on a deserted wet road when the accident occurred and he
was killed, the news agency said. Tamara Chkheidze, who was
driving, and Zurab Chavchavadze, were hospitalized with serious
injuries, it said.
   No further details were available immediately.
   Zviad Gamsakhurdia, considered the dean of dissidents in the
southern Soviet republic, said Kostava had received death threats
during the summer and last week.
   ``A week ago, we were warned by one KGB man that we shall be
killed in the nearest future, Merab Kostava and I,'' Gamsakhurdia
said in a telephone interview from Tbilisi, capital of the Black
Sea republic.
   Gamsakhurdia said he also was told last summer that all leaders
of Georgian independence movement would be killed by Oct. 15.
   The threats came from ``the military staff and the military
intelligence service,'' Gamsakhurdia said, adding that he and other
dissidents were so concerned that they hired private guards for
their homes.
   During the summer, Gamsakhurdia said a grenade exploded outside
his home.
   News of Kostava's death came after business hours and Soviet
officials could not be reached for comment.
   Nationalist fervor has run high in Georgia since spring, when 20
people were killed by Soviet soldiers sent in to halt the unrest. A
recent report by a Georgian commission implicated Defense Minister
Dmitri T. Yazov and former KGB chief Victor M. Chebrikov in the
plan to send the soldiers.
   Gamsakhurdia said an impromptu gathering Friday night in
downtown Tbilisi was turning into a memorial for Kostava.
   Kostava, aged 59 or 60, was first arrested on political charges
in 1956, according to a brief obituary carried by Express-Khronika.
   He served several terms in prison camps and internal exile for
political activities, and ``even in the camps he continued his
human rights work,'' the obituary said. Kostava was released in
spring 1987 in a widespread amnesty for political prisoners.
   ``Until his last days, Merab Kostava remained one of the leaders
of the Georgian human rights movement,'' said Express-Khronika, a
former underground network now permitted to operate openly.
   Kostava was a member of the Georgian Helsinki Watch group and a
leader of the Holy Ilya Society, a religious-nationalist group
prominent in the agitation for Georgian independence.
   Georgia, a sunny, mountainous republic in the Caucasus region,
became part of the Soviet Union in 1920. Only a handful of
pro-independence dissidents were active a year ago, but the
movement has gained strength since spring.
   Thousands gathered in Tbilisi on Wednesday night to call for
independence, protest the military draft and urge an election
boycott.

<HEAD>Israel Seeks To Bar PLO Members And Limit Pre-Negotiations Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Israel is trying to exclude PLO members from
Mideast negotiations and to limit any talks with Palestinians to
the mechanics of conducting elections on the West Bank and Gaza,
diplomatic sources said Friday.
   The sources commented as Secretary of State James A. Baker III
pressed an effort to arrange a three-way meeting in Washington. Its
main purpose would be to select Palestinians for talks with Israel
about elections in the territories.
   Baker talked by telephone again on Thursday with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and has had several
conversations with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. The U.S.
campaign was put on hold, at least so far as Jerusalem is
concerned, for the Sabbath and the celebration of the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot, which began Friday evening.
   With Baker making little apparent progress, Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, insisted he had set no
time limit on his effort. ``There is no date certain, there is no
deadline,'' she told reporters.
   Ms. Tutwiler and other U.S. officials declined to provide any
details of Baker's conversations with Abdel-Meguid and with Arens.
``I am not authorized,'' she said.
   But Baker is known to have presented the foreign ministers a
week ago with a five-point proposal that includes Israel holding
talks with Palestinians only if it is ``satisfied'' with the
composition of the delegation.
   Still, Arens is insisting that all members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, whose covenant calls for the dismantling
of Israel as a Jewish state, be barred. Palestinians who are
sympathetic to PLO positions would be eligible, however.
   The meeting Baker is promoting is designed to blend Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for elections with a 10-point
formula by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This is proving to be
very difficult.
   Mubarak, after consulting with the PLO, wants the delegation to
include two Palestinians who were deported from the West Bank and
Gaza during a 22-month rebellion against Israeli control.
   Shamir and Arens, both members of the Likud coalition, are
opposed to the proposition, as well as to Mubarak's demand that
Israel agree in advance it will surrender territory as part of an
overall settlement.
   Arens is also insisting that Israel's talks with the
Palestinians be limited to making arrangements for the elections
and not serve as a forum for negotiating Palestinian demands.
   Baker, on the other hand, would permit the Palestinians to raise
whatever concerns they might have about the election plan.
   Shamir's proposals provides for the elected Palestinians to
negotiate with Israel arrangements for five years of limited
self-rule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall
settlement.

   President Bush denied Friday that he was
angered over internal second-guessing about the failed Panamanian
coup.
   There have been reports the President told his staff to stop
leaking post-mortem criticisms to reporters.
   Bush, saying that he's changed from the days when his
frustrations gave him ulcers, denied any ``gag order,'' saying he
only wanted to avoid any appearance he was criticizing his team.
   ``They all did a good job,'' he said at a news conference.
   But the president immediately indicated there might have been
something that riled him a bit.
   ``Normally I might get a little more tense. I wouldn't blow up,
I don't think. And that's why I had ulcers 20 years ago, because I
didn't, I kept it all inside. But I learned now to get out there
and do your best, get the best information that you can and have
confidence in good people,'' Bush said.
   Many members of Congress criticized Bush for not coming to the
aid of dissident Panamanian military officers who tried to
overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Oct. 3.
   Privately, administration officials have said they were things
that could have been handled differently, and that problems such as
information flow hampered quick decision making. Bush has denied
that was the case, but officials have said that procedures are
under review.
   Other criticisms included statements that a key cable was
garbled regarding whether the insurgents would turn Noriega over to
the United States and that there had been insufficient attention to
communication links with the coup leaders.
   ``There wasn't a gag order ... and I didn't get angry. What I
did say is, I don't want to see any blame coming out of the Oval
Office or attributed to the Oval Office in the face of criticism,''
he told a news conference.
   ``I haven't lost any confidence in our top people that are
handling these matters,'' Bush said.
   Bush had a bleeding ulcer when he was in the oil business in his
early 30s. His doctor told him, ``You try to do too much and you
worry too much,'' Bush wrote in his autobiography, ``Looking
Forward.''
   ``All my life I'd worked at channelling my emotions, trying not
to let anger or frustration influence my thinking. But I'd never
given much thought to channelling my energies. That would change,
however,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Former Pierce Aide Used Office for Charity Drive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former top aide at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development used her office to raise money for a charity
and targeted her appeal to consultants who did business with the
agency, documents in her files indicate.
   Deborah Gore Dean's files show that when she sought donations
for a Red Cross event in 1984 she listed her HUD telephone number
on her letters and asked that responses be phoned in to her
secretary.
   A HUD attorney who discussed the issue Friday on the condition
of anonymity said Dean's action appeared to violate agency
standards prohibiting the use of an office for private gain as well
as rules against the misuse of government workers.
   One of Dean's lawyers, however, disputed those assertions.
   ``There is absolutely no evidence that Deborah Dean gained
anything from her service on behalf of a nationally recognized
charity,'' attorney Charles Leeper said. ``And I'm certainly
unaware of any regulation that makes the use of a secretary's time
unlawful and the files reflect that (the secretary) spent an
immaterial amount of her time on behalf of this charitable
organization.''
   The fund-raising letters for a New Year's Eve ball were sent to
a number of developers and consultants who did HUD-related work,
including former agency officials Joseph Strauss and R. Carter
Sanders, former Interior Secretary James Watt and Washington
attorney David Barrett, whose law partners include at least two
former HUD officials. Also solicited was Edward Wiedenfeld, an
adviser to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign who is a partner in
several HUD developments.
   Copies of the letters in Dean's files show that while she listed
her home address on the letters and used blank stationery she gave
her HUD phone number and said those wishing to attend should
contact Sherrill Nettles, her secretary.
   Dean was a member of Young Friends of Red Cross, which sponsored
the ball.
   Her files were released recently under the Freedom of
Information Act. Her efforts on behalf of the Red Cross were first
reported Thursday by The Boston Herald.
   Dean, who has refused to testify before a congressional inquiry,
is a central figure in its investigation of allegations of
influence peddling, fraud and mismanagement at HUD during the
Reagan administration and the tenure of her boss, former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce. He, too, has refused to testify, as has
Dean's predecessor as Pierce's executive assistant, Lance Wilson.
   Dean is the second former HUD official whose charity work has
been questioned. Former HUD Assistant Secretary Thomas Demery was
sharply criticized in a HUD audit for attending several
fund-raisers _ attended by HUD developers and consultants _ for a
charity he helped establish.
   The Justice Department declined to prosecute Demery in
connection with the charity work, which HUD's inspector general
said appeared to present a conflict of interest because many of the
donors or their clients received lucrative subsidies from the
housing agency.

<HEAD>Justice Gets Another Delay in Fernandez Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Friday obtained at
least another month's delay in the Iran-Contra trial of former CIA
agent Joseph F. Fernandez while it ponders how to deal with secrecy
issues in the case.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond granted the
department's request for a month's time to consider whether it
wanted to appeal its ruling that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
couldn't intervene on secrecy issues in the Fernandez case.
   The delay until Nov. 13 gives Thornburgh more time to consider
how to deal with the politically touchy secrecy issues surrounding
the Fernandez case.
   A three-judge panel of the court ruled Sept. 29 that Thornburgh
could not appeal secrecy rulings made by the trial judge because
such intervention would undermine the independence of Iran-Contra
prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh.
   The court held that Thornburgh's only recourse was to file an
affidavit under the Classified Information Procedures Act blocking
the release of information the trial judge ruled could be disclosed
in court by Fernandez's defense lawyers. Such an action would
likely result in dismissal of the charges.
   The Justice Department has said such an affidavit would be filed
only ``as a last resort.''
   The Justice Department had until Friday to notify the 4th
Circuit of whether it wanted a rehearing of the case by the full
court in Richmond.
   In the request for an extension of the filing deadline,
Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said the court's
ruling ``was of substantial importance to the attorney general and
the Department of Justice in addressing national security matters
arising in the context of cases prosecuted by independent counsel.''
   ``Accordingly, it is necessary for the Department of Justice to
consider what, if any, further measures are appropriate in light of
the decision,'' Dennis said.
   Fernandez, the former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is
accused of lying to CIA superiors and to a presidential commission
that investigated the Iran-Contra affair about his role in setting
up an airstrip for the clandestine arms-supply network for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   He was originally set to go to trial in July in U.S. Distict
Court in Alexandria, Va.
   But the Justice Department halted the trial by appealing rulings
by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton that the locations of several
CIA stations in Central America could be disclosed by Fernandez as
part of his defense.
   The 4th Circuit stayed the trial while it considered the Justice
Department's appeal. But the panel ruled that only the independent
counsel could file appeals of trial court rulings under the secrecy
law.
   With such power, the attorney general ``could control the
prosecution directly by breaking off proceedings and appealing at
will,'' the court said.
   ``The specter of such successive appeals might hamper the
prosecution, making it difficult for independent counsel to
coordinate and discharge his statutory obligations,'' the judges
ruled.

   Stock prices tumbled and the Dow Jones
industrial average plummeted 197 points today in the most
spectacular drop since the 1987 crash, battered by fear of
inflation and word the United Airlines buyout may have collapsed.
   The speed of the Friday the 13th decline, which came just four
days after the Dow set a record high, spooked traders in a
startling reminder of the worst stock panic ever almost two years
ago on Oct. 19.
   At the closing bell, the unofficial tally of the widely watched
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks had plunged to around
2,562.50, by far the biggest drop for the index this year and
second only to the crash of 1987, in terms of points lost.
Thursday's close was 2,759,84.
   ``It's total emotional and psychological chaos,'' said Eugene
Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
``People are dumping everything. ... A great deal of money is being
lost.''
   When the Dow dropped 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, closing at
1,738.74, it represented a loss of 22.6 percent of the index's
value in one day. Today's drop was about 7 percent.
   Other stock indices also fell sharply today. The New York Stock
Exchange's composite index tumbled 11.43 to 185.55. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index was down 16.56 at 378.45.
Bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe haven for
their money in the credit markets.
   Big Board volume totaled 251.17 million shares, the heaviest
total since 254.87 million were traded Jan. 27.
   Just Monday, the index closed at an all-time high of 2,791.41.
That had been the fifth straight trading day to post a record high
close.
   The second-largest Dow plunge on record, until today, was a
156.83-point drop on Oct. 26, 1987, which brought the average to
1,793,93. The third largest was a 140.58-point drop on Jan. 8,
1988, when the Dow industrials closed at 1,911.31.
   Brokers said today's drop was triggered partly by news that a
labor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed
$6.75 billion takeover of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. UAL
is a component of the Dow Transportation index.
   Others pointed to troubles in the junk bond market, where a
heavy supply of new issues coupled with investor skittishness has
severely crimped investors' appetite for the high-risk issues.
   The UAL news, combined with recent worries about the junk bond
market, ``seemed to trigger a selling panic,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. She said
that program selling accelerated the drop.
   Still others said news from the Labor Department that wholesale
prices rose sharply in September suggested inflation was heating up
again, reducing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would act
to ease interest rates.
   At 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow was off about 23 points. But an
overwhelming tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100
points in little more than an hour.
   The drop is eerily reminiscent of a 108-point Dow drop on a
Friday exactly two years ago, which proved to be a harbinger of the
century's second stock market disaster. When trading resumed the
following Monday _ Oct. 19, 1987 _ the Dow plunged a whopping 508
points.
   Zagorski said she did not expect the events of 1987 to be
repeated. ``It's not going to go down too much further from these
levels,'' she said shortly before the market closed.
   The worst drop so far this year occurred on March 17, when the
Dow lost about 48 points.

<TEXT>
   The Georges Pompidou Center, closed for two weeks
because of a janitors' strike, will reopen this weekend but only
after it has been thoroughly cleaned, the museum director said
Friday.
   The cultural complex, a hulking metal structure with giant blue
and white pipes running along its facade, has been forced to turn
away thousands of visitors as mountains of refuse and garbage piled
up inside and out.
   The cleaning personnel, who work for four companies, went on
strike Sept. 30 demanding higher wages and representation by a
single body.
   Museum director Helene Arhweiler said in a statement that the
entire center was to be ``disinfected'' before opening its doors to
the public, but she ``strongly urged'' visitors to help keep it
clean.
   She said the strike was not ``completely settled'' and that the
agreement reached late Thursday with the strikers provided for
``minimum service.''
   She said the decision to disinfect the center was made after the
head of hygiene of the city of Paris called the sanitary conditions
``not at all satisfactory.''
   The center normally draws 25,000 people daily to a wide variety
of activities but was built originally to handle 5,000 visitors
daily.

   President Bush sought ``room for flexibility''
Friday to avoid vetoing a bill that allows more Medicaid abortions,
but both sides of the politically explosive issue offered little
hope for compromise.
   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' Bush said at a
news conference. ``I'm not going to change my position any. But
let's see how those negotiations come out.''
   White House officials met with Capitol Hill Republicans in an
attempt to find a way out for the president, a top GOP
congressional aide said.
   But with abortion-rights forces claiming the political momentum
was on their side, anti-abortion leaders turned up the heat on the
president by demanding a veto of the measure permitting federally
financed abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest.
   ``The movement will expect a presidential veto, and if he
doesn't veto it, they're going to have a real mess on their
hands,'' said Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council
and a former domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House.
   ``This is a time of testing for the White House,'' Bauer said.
``People will be watching quite carefully to see if the White House
lessens its commitment on the abortion issue, and if there is any
sign it is shifting, there will be an incredible political
firestorm for the Republicans.''
   Neither side in Congress publicly offered a compromise.
Democrats acknowledged they didn't have the votes to override a
veto.
   Bush said he had not wavered in his opposition to a provision
passed by the House on Wednesday and earlier by the Senate that
would drop a decade-long ban on federally funded abortions for poor
women who are victims of rape or incest.
   But he stopped short of repeating his veto threat, saying there
was ``negotiation and discussion'' under way that could lead to a
compromise that would avert a veto.
   Abortion-rights forces contend that public opinion polls show
increasing numbers of voters support broader abortion rights, and
that a Bush veto would be politically costly for the president and
lawmakers who voted with him.
   Asked if he was leaving open the possibility he would not veto
the measure, Bush said, ``Well, because I'm told ... that the
conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part.
   ``We'll see what we can do in terms of the conference committee
to see if there is room for flexibility,'' Bush said.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of the abortion-rights forces,
called Bush's remarks ``unintelligible politically'' and said his
side is unwilling to compromise.
   ``There are no negotiations going on with those of us who
asserted the right to choose and won last week. There is no
compromise on the table,'' AuCoin said in a telephone interview
from Oregon.
   The legislation is part of a broader fiscal 1990 spending bill
for the departments of labor and health and human services.
   The measure was sent back to the Senate for agreement on a
separate provision, but the House language on abortion was
identical to that already approved by the Senate.
   It would expand current law that permits Medicaid abortions only
in cases where the life of the mother is endangered. The new
provision would still prevent Medicaid funding of abortions in most
cases, but would allow it in cases of rape and incest if the victim
``promptly'' reported it.
   Although Bush referred to possible change in ``conference
language,'' the bill has already been reported by House and Senate
conferees and goes back to the Senate, which could send it directly
to Bush.
   Most House members had already returned to their districts, as
the House held only a pro-forma session Friday.
   An aide to the Senate Democratic leadership, declining to be
identified, said there were no talks under way involving Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who a day earlier pleaded
with Bush not to veto the measure.
   On the other side of the issue, spokesmen for Rep. Christopher
Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of the House Pro-life Caucus, and Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., long the sponsor of the abortion restriction
legislation, said they had no compromise in mind.
   Doug Johnson, lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee,
the leading anti-abortion group, said he didn't believe ``there's
any way to avoid a veto of this bill.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel suggested Thursday that
specifying a time limit for reporting by the victim might be a
compromise, but Johnson said that was unacceptable.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Bush was searching for a way
to weaken his opposition in light of a changing political climate
since last summer's Supreme Court ruling in the Missouri case that
made increased state regulation of abortion possible.
   ``Since the Webster case, George Bush has backed out of
intervening in most abortion cases before the Supreme Court,'' she
said. ``I believe he will back out of this veto.''

<HEAD>Japanese Socialists Deny Pachinko Payoffs</HEAD>
<UNK>By TETSUO JIMBO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Socialist Party said on Friday that
no such thing as a pachinko scandal existed.
   Socialist legislators stand accused of accepting bribes from
pinball parlor owners to lighten up on regulations restricting the
light-up industry.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party raised the allegation in
Parliament Wednesday following reports in the Shukan Bunshun
magazine suggesting that money from Japanese-style pinball, called
pachinko, had infiltrated politics.
   ``I would like to express regret for causing concern among the
people in the so-called pachinko scandal,'' Tsuruo Yamaguchi,
secretary-general of the Socialist Party, told a news conference.
   ``But we would like to clarify that no such thing as the
pachinko scandal exists and it is no more than an illusion created
by Shukan Bunshun.''
   Yamaguchi acknowledged nine party lawmakers received $55,000 in
donations from the pachinko association, but said the donations
were legal and no member tilted toward the industry.
   ``Our investigation found no trace of wrongdoing,'' he added.
   Receiving donations from industry is common and legal in Japan
as long as recipients do no favors in return.
   The Socialist Party said it investigated claims that several of
its legislators used their influence to water down bills regulating
the pachinko business in exchange for donations ranging from $1,400
to $3,500.
   Yamaguchi also said the party is still investigating news
reports that a Socialist legislator received donations from a
pro-North Korea organization called the Association of Korean
Residents in Japan.
   Receiving donations from foreigners and foreign organizations
violates the Political Fund Control Law. Most of the 700,000
Koreans in Japan are not Japanese citizens, and are divided into

   Terry Waite's relatives said Friday they still
hold hope the Anglican Church envoy will be freed, and vigils were
held at several cathedrals to mark Sunday, which will be his
1,000th day as a hostage in Lebanon.
   ``I really do think that he is still alive, I feel he is,'' said
Waite's mother, Lena Waite. ``He would hate to be shut up like that
but I am sure he will come through all right.''
   His cousin, John Waite, said that as time goes on it becomes
more difficult to believe Waite is alive.
   However, John Waite added: ``He is such a nice, genuine guy I
cannot imagine even a desperado wanting to do him any harm.''
   The Church Army, the Church of England's evangelical branch,
organized prayer vigils at the cathedrals of Winchester, Bristol,
Liverpool, Rochester and London's Southwark.
   Waite was in Lebanon trying to negotiate freedom for other
Western hostages when he disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987.
   He is among 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. They include eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss and Italian
and an Irishman.
   Most of the foreign hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem underground factions.
   Held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, addressing the Conservative
Party conference in Blackpool, recalled the plight of Waite and the
two other British hostages.
   ``We think of Terry Waite, Brian Keenan, John McCarthy and of
their families and friends who endure so much.
   ``Any government which has influence over those who hold
hostages should be ready as a matter of course to use that
influence to bring about their release,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``A country cannot support terrorism and still expect to be
treated as a member of the international community. To take
hostages is to exclude yourself from the civilized world.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. arms negotiator Edward L. Rowny
briefed Solidarity lawmakers Friday on disarmament talks with the
Soviet Union and met with Lech Walesa, leader of the independent
union.
   Walesa said he told Rowny after their meeting ``it would be good
for all of us if we changed several tanks to bread.''
   Discussions of East-West weapons levels, the U.S. approach to
talks with the Soviets and other defense topics were an added sign
change in Poland, the only Warsaw Pact nation with a non-Communist
government.
   ``We feel it very important that people understand our points of
view and ... that we seek their support,'' Rowny said.
   The American arms negotiator, whose father was born in Poland,
arrived Tuesday for official meetings and a lecture at Jagellonian
University in Krakow, where he studied in 1936.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist, has
promised allegiance to the Soviet-led military alliance, but Rowny
envisaged a growing role for Poland in the Warsaw Pact as a ``voice
in changes and reductions to come.''
   ``We see a greater influence in the Warsaw Pact of the Poles
than there used to be and we think that's good and encourage that,
and look for even more progress in the future,'' he said.
   ``We think that the government is playing a very prudent role
and is able to have a voice ... is able to do things within the
Warsaw Pact that it didn't think it could in the past, and has
enough freedom of action.''
   Rowny said the Soviets accept U.S. efforts to aid political and
economic reform in Poland.
   ``There is certainly no prohibition or inhibition that we can
see to U.S. assistance to Poland, politically or economically,'' he
said. ``There is no increase in tensions between ourselves and the
Soviets because of our frank and candid announcements that we are
going to help the Poles.''

<TEXT>
   Hard-liner Erich Honecker on Friday rejected talks
with the East German opposition, but officials of his regime
announced they had freed pro-democracy activists from jail and
would let hundreds more refugees go West.
   For the first time, a high-ranking East German official spoke
openly when asked about a possible resignation by the 77-year-old
Honecker.
   A spokeswoman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office in Bonn said
an East German diplomat told the government late Friday that East
German refugees at the West Germany Embassy in Warsaw would be
afforded passage to West Germany.
   The spokeswoman, who confirmed an East Berlin report, said it
was not clear when the more than 600 refugees in Warsaw would be
transported out of Poland. She spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   West Germany's ZDF TV network reported from Warsaw that buses
were arranged for the refugees, but no firm plans were announced
for their departure.
   In East Berlin, the state news agency ADN announced that all but
11 of the estimated 1,000 protesters jailed after pro-democracy
demonstrations last week and on Monday were released. It said 11
people charged with violent acts during the demonstrations remained
in jail and would face trial.
   Dietmar Keller, the second-ranking official in the East German
Culture Ministry, told reporters in Wolfenbuettel, West Germany:
``As for Erich Honecker's resignation, Erich Honecker must make
that decision all alone.''
   He said any decision would require a meeting of the party
Central Committee and ``I don't know if a meeting is planned or
already called.''
   Honecker himself, recuperating from recent gallbladder surgery,
said Friday after meeting with leaders of political parties allied
with the Communists: ``We don't need suggestions for the
improvement of socialism that are really intended to cause its
demise,''
   It was his toughest statement yet on opposition movements, which
have grown in strength at time of unrest at home and flight to the
West by tens of thousands of young skilled workers.
   A Communist Party position paper called opposition groups
``enemies of the socialist order.''
   East German opposition leader Werner Fischer said in a telephone
interview with West Germany's ARD television the Communist Party
``is only open to reforms as long as its own power is assured.''
   Honecker's political future remained the subject of speculation.
Some reports have said he is about to be removed from office.
   Die Welt, a newspaper based in Bonn, quoted West German Interior
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying East Germany was ``in a
pre-revolutionary state.''
   As of Friday, Honecker's picture had not appeared in the
Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland for three days, but
state TV did show footage of him greeting the political delegation
Friday.
   Wolfgang Seiffert, a former adviser to Honecker who defected to
West Germany, said in West Berlin ``the majority of the Politburo
blames Honecker for the current crisis.''
   In his remarks Friday, Honecker urged East Germans to work
together for ``continuity and renewal, through deep-seated change
and reform,'' an apparent response to the public demand. He made
clear, however, that ``the leading role of the party'' would remain
intact.
   Echoing an earlier Politburo statement about the flight to the
West, he said: ``It must concern us all when our citizens, for
whatever reasons, turn their backs on their country. Open dialogue
is necessary to make Socialism more and more attractive.''
   Growing discontent has forced the leadership to adopt a more
conciliatory line. Ranking officials have indicated there could be
changes in the rigidly controlled media, but sharp attacks continue
to be aimed at opposition groups.
   The party position paper said ``open and hidden enemies of the
socialist order'' could create a mass movement at odds with the
government.

<HEAD>Former Reagan Administration Official Won HUD Grant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Reagan administration official won
approval of a multimillion-dollar project _ a month before the
application was filed _ after appealing directly to HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, a House subcommittee was told Friday.
   Former General Services Administrator Gerald Carmen said that
since its approval in early 1987, the Arlington, Texas, project has
returned $800,000 in profits to him through up-front tax credits
without risking any of his own money.
   ``I'm a little surprised at the way it went and I find myself a
little uncomfortable at the position I'm in now,'' Carmen told the
employment and housing panel of the House Government Operations
Committee.
   ``Frankly, it embarasses me.''
   Carmen said he saw the 316-unit Pebble Creek Moderate
Rehabilitation Program project as an opportunity to both ``make
money and do some good'' by providing rent-subsidized housing for
poor people.
   The onetime Manchester, N.H., businessman, Carmen got to know
Pierce during the transition between the Carter and Reagan
administrations in late 1980 and early 1981.
   Carmen was a member of Reagan's transition team for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Pierce
subsequently was named to head the agency.
   Carmen was appointed by Reagan to head the General Services
Administration, which is responsible for building or leasing most
government offices and acting as a supply officer for much of the
federal bureaucracy.
   He held the GSA post until 1984, when Reagan named him U.S.
ambassador to United Nations agencies in Geneva, Switzerland. About
six months after resigning in 1986, Carmen said he learned of the
Texas project.
   Carmen said Arlington housing officials were unaware of the
potential for a rehabilitation grant until after he tried to
persuade them to submit an application.
   ``I made it plain at that discussion there were no guarantees at
all,'' he said.
   Carmen said he met with Pierce in Pierce's office for about 15
minutes in late January 1987, telling him that the city of
Arlington would be submitting an application and that he hoped it
would get proper consideration.
   ``I recall that I did not ask him for a decision and he did not
give me one,'' he said, adding that he talked with no one else in
Pierce's office about the project.
   Carmen said he didn't know of the project's approval by HUD
until late April, when the Arlington Public Housing Authority was
notified.
   The subcommittee, however, revealed a March 4 memo from
then-Federal Housing Administrator Thomas Demery to Deborah Gore
Dean, Pierce's executive assistant, on funding decisions that
included a handwritten message adding the 316 Pebble Creek units.
   ``This is the first time I've seen this,'' Carmen told the
subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   Carmen declined to agree with an assertion by Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y., that his meeting with Pierce was the sole factor behind the
favorable action on Pebble Creek.
   ``I don't want to concede that, although I do concede that's the
way it looks,'' Carmen said. ``That's what thousands of people do
in Washington ... making sure that things don't slip between the
cracks.''
   Lantos then unveiled a memo from Ms. Dean to Pierce dated April
7 _ two weeks before the city submitted a formal application _
stating ``... and Carmen are set.''
   Lantos said the combination of the memos and Carmen's testimony
contradicts an assertion by Pierce before the subcommittee last
spring that he took no part in HUD funding decisions.
   The subcommittee has subpoenaed Pierce to testify before the
panel again later this month and in November. In his last
appearance in September, Pierce took his Fifth Amendment rights on
self-incrimination and refused to answer questions.
   Pebble Creek was developed as a limited partnership between
Carmen and Joshua Muss, a law partner of Carmen's daughter.
   Carmen and Muss used HUD guaranteed mortgages to borrow $8.2
million _ $4 million for buying a run-down apartment complex and $4
million to upgrade it _ and sharing in $2.4 million in up-front tax
credits plus $1.8 million in annual HUD rent subsidies.
   The project surfaced in an audit by HUD's inspector general in
April as an example of underwriters escalating the value of
projects in co-insuring their mortgages with FHA.

   Riding a parade float has its price _
even if you're Miss Nevada. In this town it'll cost at least $20.
   Nevada Day parade organizers told Miss Nevada, Brenda Anne
Linscott, that she would have to pay $20 to appear on the Lions
Club parade float _ just like other crown holders and people
participating in the 125th birthday celebration.
   But Ed Blanchard, the Nevada Day Committee parade chairman, said
Thursday there is a list of bigwigs who don't have to fork over $20
and Miss Linscott apparently isn't on the list.
   Linda Roberto, business manager for Miss Nevada, insisted Miss
Linscott should be on that dignitary list because she's the state's
official hostess.
   But Blanchard and the Nevada Day parade organizers refused to
budge.
   ``She's not getting anything free,'' said Blanchard.
   That's when the Gov. Bob Miller stepped in.
   Larry Henry, Miller's spokesman, said the governor would pay the
$20 fee for Miss Linscott.
   Miss Linscott said she wasn't aware of the dispute and prefers
to let her business manager handle money matters.

   Four-time International Whistle-Off Grand
Champion Roy Thoreson thinks he blew it this year.
   The Canadian whistling wonder and the only person to win the
contest more than once was coaxed into being on the judge's
committee for this weekend's 12th annual event.
   ``They'd just as soon I didn't compete,'' Thoreson, 58, said of
contest organizers. ``I agreed to it, but I kind of wish I was
competing.
   ``I guess they want to make way for some other people to win.
But I'll be back. I'll take a couple of years off and come back in
1991.''
   Thoreson, who began blowing melodic tunes along with his mother
and with radio shows when he was six years old, is among hundreds
of dedicated whistlers who can't imagine not putting lips together
to make music.
   ``I practiced for 40 years, from the time I was six until I was
46, before I entered my first contest,'' said Thoreson of Calgary,
Alberta. ``With all that work behind me, I'm not going to quit
now.''
   The railroad brakeman, who whistles contemporary and classical
tunes, is among 60 competitors, performers and judges scheduled to
attend this weekend's whistle-off.
   ``It's great for the voice and lungs,'' said organizer Dana
Andrus. ``And besides, you can't be unhappy if you're whistling.''
   Ms. Andrus said whistling is enjoying a resurgence after its
heyday in the 1940s when the networks had staff whistlers and
entertainers such as Bing Crosby often puckered up before the
microphone.
   Sponsored by the International Association of Whistlers, this
year's contest has six categories and also will name a Grand
Champion whistler by adding up the best scores in events entered.

<HEAD>Bolar's Nitrofurantoin Targeted by FDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday
it plans to withdraw Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.'s approval to sell a
generic drug used to treat urinary tract infections and it wants
the company to withdraw the product from drugstores.
   In a letter to the company, the FDA said tests on samples of
Bolar's drug and the brand-name drug ``strongly suggest that
Norwich-Eaton's Macrodantin product was substituted for Bolar's
product'' in tests required for FDA approval.
   The FDA is also moving to change its listing of Bolar's version
of Macrodantin, generically called nitrofurantoin, to indicate to
physicians that the agency does not consider the product to be
therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name drug.
   At the FDA's request, Bolar last weekend agreed to recall its
nitrofurantoin from wholesalers. However, the FDA said in the
letter it wants the company to withdraw the product from pharmacy
shelves as well.
   Officials of the Copiague, N.Y.-based company had left for the
day and could not be reached for comment.
   The FDA is investigating other product-switching allegations
against Bolar, including one involving the company's version of the
high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide. A federal criminal investigation
is also under way into the matter.
   The FDA does not have the authority to remove a drug from the
market. If a company does not comply with a recall request, the
agency can only force a recall in court.

   A Justice Department ruling that authorizes
the FBI to arrest U.S. fugitives overseas without the permission of
foreign countries drew quick signals of displeasure Friday from the
State Department.
   ``This is a very narrow legal opinion based on consideration
only of domestic United States law,'' said Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   ``It did not take into account international law, nor did it
weigh the president's constitutional responsibility to carry out
the foreign policy of the United States.''
   In a brief exchange with reporters Baker added: ``This procedure
will not be used absent a full interagency discussion of all the
foreign policy'' implications.
   The White House issued a statement echoing Baker's remarks and
saying, ``There will be no arrests abroad that have not been
considered through that interagency process.''
   Earlier, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the legal opinion
by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel did not
necessarily mean President Bush would authorize such arrests to
take place.
   ``It is important to isolate the above question of whether
domestic legal authority might exist from the question of whether
the president will, in fact, authorize the use of that authority,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``In any given case, the president must weigh his responsibility
for managing both foreign affairs and law enforcement,'' said
Tutwiler, who noted that Baker only ``learned of it this morning''
in news accounts.
   Bush, too, had not been informed of the Justice Department's
ruling, said an administration source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The president was caught off guard when asked about the ruling
following its disclosure in Friday editions of the Los Angeles
Times.
   ``I'm embarrassed to say I don't know what it is. I'll have to
get back to you with your question,'' the president told reporters.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said that ``people at
the White House and other parts of the government have been
informed through the process in drawing up this opinion.''
   Asked why Bush and Baker did not know about the opinion, Runkel
said: ``Their lawyers did.''
   ``Our job is to provide legal advice and that's what we've
done,'' he said.
   The opinion changing a 9-year-old Justice Department policy on
the FBI's arrest powers overseas was issued June 21 by Assistant
Attorney General William Barr.
   The FBI said it had taken no action under the ruling, nor would
any such arrests be made without an interagency review.
   The bureau said it requested the opinion to clarify its
authority to arrest a number of fugitives at large overseas who are
being sought on such charges as hijacking, hostage taking and other
terrorist acts.
   ``This advice, along with many other factors, will be considered
in the devlopment of any plan to apprehend fugitives abroad,'' the
FBI said in a statement.
   Asked if the opinion sanctioned kidnapping, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh said: ``We don't see it that way.''
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee's constitutional rights subcommittee,
said he would hold hearings on the policy, which he said ``would
make us an international brigand, an international outlaw.''
   Ms. Tutwiler's comments signaled that the State Department would
seek to influence any presidential decision to allow the FBI to
circumvent a foreign country's extradition procedures to make such
an arrest.
   One of the diplomatic concerns is that the arrest of a U.S.
fugitive in foreign territory without the country's permission
could provoke a reciprocal action.
   The ruling could conceivably be used by the FBI to arrest
Panamaniam strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega and bring him to trial in
Florida on drug trafficking charges.
   Barr's finding reversed a policy dating back to the Carter
administration that specifically prohibited the FBI from
circumventing extradition procedures in a foreign country.
   The 1980 policy was issued in response to an FBI proposal to
kidnap fugitive financier Robert L. Vesco from the Bahamas. Vesco,
who is still at large, is accused of milking hundreds of millions
of dollars from mutual funds before fleeing the country in 1973.
   Federal laws enacted by Congress in 1984 and 1986 gave U.S.
authorities jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involving
American citizens overseas, including airplane hijackings and
killings carried out to coerce a government.
   But those laws did not confer on U.S. law enforcement agencies
the power to make arrests in other countries without the permission
of foreign governments.
   The FBI went to great lengths in 1987 to lure convicted hijacker
Fawaz Younis to a yacht in international waters off Cyprus to
arrest him for leading a 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner
carrying several U.S. citizens.
   Younis, a Lebanese, was recently sentenced to 30 years
imprisonment for the hijacking, which began in Beirut.

<HEAD>U.N. Solution Proposed for Breaking Cambodia Deadlock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House subcommittee on
Asian and Pacific affairs on Friday proposed a major role for the
United Nations to halt bloodshed in Cambodia and break the deadlock
over proposals for a political settlement.
   The current reluctance of Vietnam and other countries to
compromise on an overall solution for the Southeast Asian country
points to ``a period over the next several months in which each
side tests itself on the battlefield,'' said the chairman, Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-NY.
   He also opposed normalizing U.S. relations with Vietnam so long
as Hanoi remains uncompromising about Cambodia _ but said
Washington ``should be prepared to normalize, and begin a new
chapter, if and when Vietnam is prepared to cooperate in the search
for settlement of the Cambodian problem.''
   Solarz presented his Cambodian settlement formula in an
appearance before the Washington Foreign Correspondents
Association. It would be based on ``a U.N.-supervised interim
administration perhaps along the lines of the U.N.-supervised
administration in Namibia,'' the South-West African territory now
in transition from South African rule to independence.
   The threat of revived civil war in Cambodia resulted from
failure of an international conference in Paris last August to
agree on an overall political solution.
   Withdrawal a month later of Vietnamese forces that occupied
Cambodia for 11 years has triggered moves for a return to power by
the communist Khmer Rouge, blamed for more than a million Cambodian
deaths during their 1975-78 rule. Solarz termed a Khmer Rouge
return ``politically and morally unacceptable'' to the United
States.
   A Cambodian solution under the U.N. flag ``would respond to the
various concerns'' that deadlocked the Paris conference, Solarz
said. ``It could be more politically acceptable than any formula on
the table so far.

   The National Science Board approved a $4.41
million award Friday for the design of a radio telescope that is to
be ``the most advanced'' in the world.
   The award for design work was granted to Associated Universities
Inc., an organization that operates the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory at Green Bank, W. Va.
   Expected to cost about $75 million and have a 300-foot dish, the
new telescope ``would be the most advanced radio telescope in the
world,'' the board's announcement said. It will replace a
25-year-old instrument that collapsed last November at Green Bank.
   Design studies for the new instrument are expected to take about
a year and the telescope is expected to become operational about
1995.
   The National Science Board is the policy-making body of the
National Science Foundation.

<HEAD>Suspect Says He Killed SAfrican Runner's Father After Sexual Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old man arrested in
the slaying of the father of Olympic runner Zola Budd told a
magistrate he did so after Frank Budd tried to sexually assault
him. He was denied bail Friday.
   Chris Barnard, arrested hours after Budd's body was found Sept.
22, acknowledged the shooting to Magistrate H. Ladman during
cross-examination Thursday when he sought bail, the independent
South Africa Press Association and other local news media said.
   Barnard, however, has yet to enter a formal plea. SAPA said he
was to be tried for murder.
   Barnard, who has admitted to 11 previous convictions on various
charges, said he had moved into Budd's farm near Bloemfontein two
days before the shooting to do construction work.
   Ms. Budd, 23, had been estranged from her 59-year-old father for
several years and did not attend his funeral in accordance with a
directive in his will.
   She said after his death that her father was a homosexual and
that this was a factor in her parents' separation in 1984 and
subsequent divorce.
   Because of her father's British ancestry, Ms. Budd was able to
obtain a British passport and compete in 1984 Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles. South Africans are barred from the Olympics and most
international competition because of the government's racial
segregation policies.
   In the 3,000-meter run in Los Angeles, Ms. Budd collided with
U.S. star Mary Decker, and the American was unable to continue.
Budd finished seventh to a chorus of boos.
   She later set several world distance records while living and
training in Britain, but returned to South Africa in May 1988,
complaining of mental exhaustion because of harassment from
anti-apartheid activists. She says she will race in South Africa
but make no attempt to return to international competition.

   A 27-year-old man was arrested Friday on suspicion
of kidnapping and murdering a girl in central Japan, police said.
   Police officials identified the man as Yuji Urayama, a former
owner of a coffee shop.
   Police said 8-year-old Misako Kobayashi was kidnapped Wednesday
near the town of Nagoya. She was found dead Friday on a hill near a
road where Urayama was arrested Thursday on charges of violating a
traffic law, police said.
   Misako, the daughter of Sei Kobayashi, 41, a carpenter,
disappeared Wednesday afternoon while heading home from a nearby
shop.
   Two hours later, a man telephoned and demanded $69,500 in
ransom, police officials said. In more than a dozen phone calls,
the man agreed that $34,750 would be enough and designated places
to receive the ransom from the father, the officials said. However,
the man did not appear.
   Police detained Urayama Thursday after chasing his car, which
ran a red light, the officials said.
   According to police figures, there have been 166 kidnap cases
involving ransom since the end of World War II, and the girl was
the 31st known victim to be killed in such a case.
   Most recently, Tsutomu Miyazaki, a 26-year-old print shop
worker, was arrested in August on charges of kidnapping and killing
four girls, ages 4 to 7, over the past year in a Tokyo suburb.

<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Jerry and unusually high tides threatened the
Gulf Coast Friday as showers and thunderstorms fell from Florida to
Texas.
   Rain also fell along the northern Pacific Coast, and
high-temperature records up to 76 years old were set or tied in
five cities across the country.
   Jerry, which formed in the southwest Gulf of Mexico, was about
520 miles south-southwest of New Orleans and heading north at 10
mph Friday evening.
   ``At the moment, Louisiana appears to be in the greatest danger,
but the storm could turn over the weekend,'' said hurricane
forecaster Gilbert Clark.
   The storm's possible effect and unusually strong tides prompted
a coastal flood watch for the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over Florida's Atlantic Coast,
and from the Florida Panhandle to the Texas Gulf Coast. Morning
rain was heavy in Florida. In Daytona Beach, 1\ inch of rain fell
in just two hours, causing local flooding.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in Evansville,
Ind., where a 91-degree reading exceeded the old mark made in 1928
by 1 degree, Paducah, Ky. (89 degrees, 88 in 1975), and Greer, S.C.
(85, 84 in 1970). Records were tied in Miami (90, 1986) and North
Platte, Neb. (89, 1913).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees in Bozeman, Mont., to 98 degrees in Gila Bend, Ariz. The
low for the Lower 48 states was 13 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.

<TEXT>
   A Dutch university is recruiting
volunteers for a program commissioned by the U.S. government to
test the skills of drivers under the influence of marijuana, a
researcher said Friday.
   The two-year Limburg University project will be conducted on a
closed-off section of highway and will be the first to involve the
actual use of automobiles by drivers who have smoked the drug,
researcher Han de Gier said.
   He said the purpose of the research, commissioned by the U.S.
Department of Transportation, is to determine as realistically as
possible how marijuana affects a driver's skill and behavior.
   Marijuana is not believed to be addictive but has been blamed
for loss of concentration, lower reaction speed and even brain
damage and hallucinations in some users.
   Its effects on drivers have been investigated only under
laboratory conditions, De Gier said in an interview.
   De Gier said most of those tests had shown a negative effect on
performance.
   Motorists who smoke marijuana often drink alcohol as well,
making it difficult to pinpoint the specific cause of an accident,
he said.
   No figures on drug-related auto accidents were available from
the Dutch government.
   Volunteers in the program, to be supervised by health
authorities and the prosecutor's office, will be closely screened
and known drug dealers will be barred, the university said.
   ``We'll need to be sure subjects use marijuana regularly, at
least once a month,'' an announcement said. ``A certain amount of
driving experience will also be required.''
   De Gier denied the choice of Holland as a site was related to
the country's liberal attitudes toward drug use.
   Possession of up to 50 grams (1.75 ounces) of hashish or
marijuana is a minor offense in Holland, punishable by a
seldom-imposed maximum fine of 50 guilders ($18). Both drigs are
available in hundreds of coffee houses in Amsterdam alone.
   Dutch law forbids driving under the influence of any substance
that could impair a driver's skills, but specifically mentions only
alcohol.
   According to Limburg University figures, 10 to 15 percent of all
citizens under age 18 have smoked marijuana at least once and 5
percent are regular users.
   In the United States, up to one-fourth of high school and
college students smoke marijuana regularly, the university
announcement said.
   Marijuana is derived from the cannabis plant. Hashish, which
contains the same active chemicals in a more concentrated form, is
made from cannabis resin.

   Rebels made their third major attack
on a civilian target this week, killing 24 people, the national
news agency AIM reported Friday.
   Troops of the leftist government killed three members of the
Mozambique National Resistance during the guerrilla raid Wednesday
on the southern village of Macaretane, AIM said.
   Seven civilians were also wounded during the raid, AIM said,
citing a report on state radio.
   The agency said 35 people were killed Tuesday when rebels set
fire to a bus near Chibuto, about 125 miles north of Maputo, the
capital on the Indian Ocean near the country's southern tip.
   Rebels also killed 13 people in an attack Monday on the village
of Nwachikolwane, about 90 miles north of Maputo, AIM said.
   The rebels, who have been accused of widespread atrocities, have
been fighting since 1977.
   Hit-and-run rebel attacks have devastated the economy of the
southeast African nation, one of the world's poorest. Nearly half
Mozambique's 15 million people need some form of food assistance.

<HEAD>Defecting Syrian Pilot Says He Flew to Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Syrian pilot who defected to Israel
said Friday he was willing to chance flying his Soviet-built MiG-23
fighter over Israel's border missile batteries for a chance at
freedom.
   Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel told a news conference arranged by the
Israeli army that he sometimes flew at just under 100 feet as he
crossed into Israel at high speed over the Golan Heights last
Wednesday.
   ``It was a difficult mission. I didn't know where I was going to
land. I didn't know if I would find a facility to land. I was going
into the unknown,'' the 34-year-old flyer said.
   ``The section I was crossing was spread all over with missiles.''
   Adel said he flew at 700 to 750 mph and ``below 50 meters,
sometimes 30 meters, sometimes 40.''
   A meter equals 3.3 feet.
   The dark-haired pilot chain-smoked during the news conference at
a military base near Tel Aviv. He wore an olive-green Syrian flight
suit. Adel spoke in Arabic, with Israeli officers translating his
words into English. No tape recorders or cameras were allowed.
   Much criticism has been expressed in Israel over Adel's ability
to fly into Israel without being intercepted.
   Asked about this, Adel said his own warning system indicated he
was ``observed,'' though he said earlier he switched off his
electronic gear to fly in silence.
   He said the thought of being intercepted ``entered my mind'' but
added: ``I feel that a country which has confidence cannot be
afraid of one single airplane and would take time to evaluate the
meaning of what's going on before taking action.''
   Syria has claimed Adel did not defect but landed in Israel
because his plane had technical problems. It asked the
International Committee of the Red Cross to help return the pilot
and aircraft.
   But Adel said he did not want to return home.
   ``If the Red Cross wants to meet me and take me back to Syria, I
would refuse this,'' he said.
   Adel refused to answer most questions on politics but said
Syria's pilots considered Israel's air force better than their own.
   ``No one in the Syrian air force feels that they could defeat
Israel, that they are superior to Israel,'' he said.
   The pilot said he had no contacts with Israelis before he landed
at Megiddo, 57 miles north of Jerusalem. ``Nobody was expecting
me,'' he said.
   He said he decided to flee Syria because of ``my own personal
feelings.''
   ``I wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their
views with freedom,'' he said. ``I am going to open a new chapter
by coming to Israel.''
   Asked for his views on Syria's politics, he repeated his desire
for freedom and added that ``by implication, you can presume my
thoughts about the political system in Syria.''
   Adel also was asked if he wanted to stay in Israel.
   ``I said I wanted to live in a democracy ... so you might
conclude I want to live here,'' he replied. But he added he was
uncertain what his plans were.
   The pilot said his treatment by Israelis has been ``gentle.'' He
said he was questioned mainly about his reason for defecting and
not yet about Syria's air force.
   Adel said little about his MiG-23 and refused to compare it with
other Syrian aircraft.
   He refused to answer questions about his family, saying only he
was born in Aleppo, northern Syria, and graduated from Syria's air
academy. It has been reported he is a bachelor and a Sunni Moslem.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Killed, At Least Four Wounded In Clashes With Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot and killed two young Palestinians
in separate incidents Friday in the occupied West Bank, the army
reported.
   A third Palestinian was seriously wounded by gunfire when he
drove his car into an Israeli man and a soldier in the occupied
Gaza Strip, the army said.
   At least three other Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops in the occupied lands, according to army and Arab reports.
   The confrontations came as Jews in Israel began the week-long
celebration of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the
Israelites' wandering in the desert after their biblical exodus
from Egypt. It is celebrated by building huts to symbolize life in
the wilderness.
   The deaths brought to 593 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops or civilians during the 22-month-old uprising in the
occupied lands. Another 128 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty
Israelis also have died in the violence.
   In the West Bank town of Kalkiya, 30 miles northwest of
Jerusalem, border police fatally shot Azni Ediab, 18, after he
tried to attack them with an ax, the army said. It said police
arrested another youth and placed the town under curfew.
   The second fatal shooting occurred at Beit Jala, six miles south
of Jerusalem, when soldiers encountered masked youths trying to
incite residents to violence, the army said.
   ``The soldiers ordered them to stop and fired into the air when
they tried to escape,'' said an army spokesman, who cannot be
identified under military rules. ``The troops then shot at their
legs and one youth was killed.''
   In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli civilian suffered serious injuries
and a soldier minor injuries when a Palestinian ran them down in
his car, the army spokesman said. Both were taken to hospitals in
Israel, he said.
   The spokesman said an army officer and a soldier who witnessed
the incident in Gaza City fired on the car and wounded the driver,
identified by hospital officials as Jamal Mahmoud Abdel Adi, 23, of
the Shati refugee camp.
   The army would not release the names of the Israeli civilian and
soldier and gave no explanation of why it believed the act was
intentional.
   Also in Gaza City, the army sealed the houses of two youths
detained in July and accused of being members of an underground
``popular committee'' that kidnapped and tortured Gazans to enforce
directives in the Palestinian uprising, Arab journalists said.
   A 3-year-old boy from Shati, Attiyah el-Ghurani, remained in
critical condition at the Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel after
suffering a shattered skull Thursday, the army said.
   Officials at Shifa hospital in Gaza said Thursday the injury was
caused by a rubber bullet fired by Israeli soldiers. An army
spokeswoman said initial investigations indicated troops did not
fire in the area.

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Friday that up to to 50 Marines would be deployed along the
U.S.-Mexico border to help the Border Patrol detect illegal alien
trying to enter the country.
   The INS said it had reached an agreement under which the Marines
will provide training in intelligence gathering techniques and help
the Border Patrol operate observation posts that will be equipped
with electronic detection equipment.
   The Marines will not be empowered to pursue or arrest any
illegal aliens, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
   The Marines lack authority to enter private property, so their
activity will be restricted to federal property. Austin declined to
say where the Marines are being deployed, but it appeared they
would be concentrated in Arizona and California.
   Both states have extensive stretches federal and state land
along the Southern Border. There is little public land along the
Texas and New Mexico portions of the border.

<HEAD>Mayor Says He Will Not Violate Prayer Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Emory Folmar said Friday he will
abide by a judge's order to stop praying at high school football
games at a city-owned stadium, but he promised to fight the
prohibition in court.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina on Thursday imposed a 10-day
restraining order against Folmar and other city officials until a
hearing in a lawsuit filed by a civil liberties group.
   On Aug. 24, Folmar defied an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling that public prayers before high school football games are
unconstitutional.
   Folmar and Montgomery County Commission Chairman W.F. Joseph Jr.
stood on the 50-yard line at the city's Cramton Bowl and prayed
aloud prior to the prep season's first game as protesters blared
air horns and waved signs against the prayer.
   The mayor, however, said he will not violate Dubina's order,
which came on a lawsuit filed by the Civil Liberties Union of
Alabama against Folmar, Joseph, the city and the Montgomery County
Board of Education. Joseph also is covered by the order.
   But Folmar said he believes the federal appeals court ruling in
January, which affected Georgia, Alabama and Florida, does not
apply when events are held on city property.
   ``This temporary restraining order does apply to me and as a
constitutional officer I will not pray until I can get a new court
order in place,'' Folmar said. He said private funds, not city or
education funds, would be used to battle the lawsuit.
   In May, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the appeals court
decision. The high court restricted pregame prayers where the
promotion of religion at a school-sanctioned event violates the
constitutional separation of church and state.
   Olivia Turner, executive director of the Civil Liberties Union,
said the August invocation by Folmar and Joseph clearly violated
the appeals court ruling.
   Dubina will schedule a hearing on the civil liberties group's
request for a permanent order against such prayers within 10 days.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will discuss
crime fighting tactics with Soviet officials and the American legal
system with law students during a six-day trip to the Soviet Union.
   In what is being billed as the first official visit to the
Soviet Union by a U.S. attorney general, Thornburgh and a group of
aides leave Saturday for Moscow.
   The attorney general said his discussions with Soviet legal
authorities would include ``joint law enforcmeent concerns in the
fields of drugs and organized crime.''
   ``It is my hope that through this visit we can establish a
continuing dialogue between U.S. and Soviet legal officials on
matters of common concern and interest,'' Thornburgh said in a
statement issued on the eve of his departure.
   ``We have been asked to discuss with Soviet officials such
issues as human rights, the role of the judiciary and commercial
and regulatory law, including environmental law,'' said Thornburgh.
   The attorney general also plans to meet at the U.S. Embassy with
Soviet dissidents and human rights activists, said spokesman David
Runkel.
   Soviet emigration is also expected to be a topic of discussion
between Thornburgh and Soviet officials. The department has
expressed a desire to move the processing of Soviet refugees by
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials from Rome to
Moscow.
   Such discussions would be held against the backdrop of increased
emigration and the Bush administration's decision to reduce the
number of Soviet refugees entering this country.
   On Oct. 18, Thornburgh plans to address law students at Moscow
State University about the American legal system, Runkel said. ``He
is going to talk about our basic legal system and the values that
underpin it.''
   Runkel said it was still uncertain whether Thornburgh would meet
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, a graduate of the Moscow
State University law school.
   The attorney general will meet with members of the Supreme
Soviet, which is scheduled this fall to consider criminal-law
reform legislation, Runkel said.
   ``There is a great desire on the part of Soviet officials to
learn about how we deal with certain problems and issues,'' Runkel
said.
   Besides legal reform, the Soviets are interested in discussing
ways of enforcing environmental regulations. The delegation will
include Assistant Attorney General Dick Stewart, head of the
Justice Department division that enforces environmental laws.

resources for the Nicaraguan resistance to return to their
country,'' Francisc Vendrell told a news conference after a visit
to the camps of the guerrillas, known as Contras.
   ``The United States is also willing to help the functioning of
the commission.''
   Vendrell represents U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on the International Commission for Support and
Verification. He said he had been in touch with State Department
representatives.
   The commission was created after Central American presidents
signed an agreement on Aug. 7 calling for voluntary repatriation or
resettlement of the U.S.-supported Contras by Dec. 8 in exchange
for democratization in Nicaragua.
   Enrique Bermudez, the Contras' military leader, said he was
willing to negotiate the voluntary repatriation of rebel fighters
and their families.
   However, Bermudez said he still doesn't trust Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government, which offered an amnesty to Contras
who choose to participate in political life there. Campaigning for
Nicaragua's presidential elections next Feb. 25 is getting into
full swing now.
   ``We demand from the Sandinistas all the fundamental human
rights before we return to Nicaragua,'' Bermudez told The
Associated Press in an interview.
   ``We don't believe the promises of the Sandinistas, who have
always misled our people, but we are willing to negotiate our
reincorporation into the political, economic and social life of
Nicaragua.''
   He accompanied the commission on its trip to the camps in
eastern Honduras near the Nicaraguan border, where about 12,000
Contra fighters and 42,000 family members have been living since
the United States halted military support to the Contra movement in
February 1988.
   Congress renewed non-lethal aid to the Contras this year on
condition it be used for disbandment if an agreement could be
reached.
   ``We are involved in a truly pacifying process in Central
America,'' said Hugo De Zela, who represents Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares of the Organization of American States.
   Vendrell, De Zela and other observers visited the Contra camp at
Yamales, 120 miles east of Tegucigalpa, on Thursday, and met with
the Contra leadership.
   The observers said they could not give details about the
discussions, including a departure date.
   It was the commission members' fourth meeting with the Contras
and their second visit to Honduras. They will also visit the
Miskito Indian resistance based in eastern Honduras and visit
Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Shots Fired at Black Family in South Boston Housing Project</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until Wednesday, the 1{-year-long effort to move
minority families into South Boston's tough, predominantly white
housing projects seemed to be on the right track. Just last week,
city officials reached a housing settlement with the NAACP.
   But when nine shots were fired at a black family's apartment in
one of the projects, the optimism surrounding federally mandated
housing desegration in Boston evaporated.
   Police cars converged on the Old Colony housing project, and
officers guarded the apartment of Mary Bullock, 39, and her family.
   For many residents, the incident brought back memories of the
violence that resulted from court-ordered busing in the 1970s. For
city officials, it was an alarming setback.
   In a news conference outside the Bullock apartment Friday, Mayor
Raymond Flynn said everything was being done to find those
responsible for ``this senseless shooting.'' Flynn, a lifelong
South Boston resident, said those responsible ``will pay a heavy
price.''
   No one was hurt in the incident Wednesday evening at the
third-floor apartment shared by Bullock, her husband, four children
and grandson.
   Two bullets pierced the steel door to the apartment. One
narrowly missed her 11-year-old stepson, Warren Honeycutt.
   An hour before the shooting, daughter Crystal Bullock, 17, told
police, she bumped into a white girl at a nearby convenience store.
The white girl made a racial comment and threatened to return with
others, the teen-ager said.
   Five or six teen-agers carrying baseball bats showed up within a
few minutes, and Crystal Bullock and a friend fled, she said.
   She said two other teen-agers on a motorcycle tried to run them
down as they ran to her family's apartment and that someone threw a
brick at the home after they were inside.
   Police Detective William Johnston said Friday that authorities
were close to making an arrest.
   Mary Bullock said Thursday the family would move out of the
project, but Flynn said Friday that they had decided to stay. The
family would not speak to reporters Friday, and asked the police to
keep the press away.
   The Bullocks are one of only 11 black families among 821
families at Old Colony, according to the Boston Housing Authority.
There are 29 black families among 954 families at the neighboring
Mary Ellen McCormack project.
   The shooting came a week after the city settled out of court
with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
over discrimination in minority housing.
   The agreement will provide about $3 million in damages to around
1,500 minority families who were denied housing or steered away
from the city's mostly white housing projects.
   Flynn told reporters that most South Boston residents were
outraged by the shooting and should not be stereotyped as bigots,
but some Old Colony residents were not as reassuring.
   Richard Noll, an 11-year-old white who lives in the project,
called Warren Honeycutt ``one of my best friends.'' But he said
some of his neighbors feel differently about blacks.
   ``A lot of people hate them,'' Noll said Friday. ``I don't. I
like them.''
   A 16-year-old boy who only gave his name as Matty and said he'd
lived in a project apartment for a year complained that some of the
black families in the project ``can be really loud and make a lot
of noise.''
   ``If white people moved into Roxbury, we'd be dead within a
year,'' he said, referring to the predominantly black neighborhood.
   Another project resident, 42-year-old Nancy Green, was more
sympathetic.
   ``I was surprised,'' she said. ``It was a shooting that
shouldn't have happened.''

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS graf 23: ``The evidence,'' with reason for concluding
Packer guilty. ``ALferd'' CQ.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prospector Alferd Packer was guilty of
murder and ate his victims, too, an expert concluded in a Friday
the 13th report on the most celebrated instance of cannibalism in
American history.
   ``Packer was as guilty as sin and his sins were all mortal
ones,'' said James E. Starrs, a professor of law and forensic
science who led a summer expedition of archeology, anthropology,
pathology and firearms experts to Lake City, Colo,. to uproot the
scarred remains of Packer's five fellow prospectors.
   They studied the bones for 30 days.
   His purpose, Starrs said at a news conference, was to show how
much can be learned through forensic science, a field he says is
underutilized in criminal investigations.
   But he also did it, he said, because ``I am an iconoclast and
this was a great icon to clast.''
   Over the years, Packer became an icon of folk history.
   At an annual feast of bad taste at the University of Colorado in
Boulder, he is toasted. His bust has been displayed in the state
capitol. In 1901, a lively newspaper campaign led authorities to
parole him 15 years after he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   Spreading the Packer legend has been a remark attributed to
Judge Melville Gerry upon sentencing Packer:
   ``They was sivin Dimmicrats in Hinsdale County, and ye eat five
of them, God damn ye!''
   Starrs said his scientific sleuthing established that Gerry
never said it, that the quotation was made up by a bartender.
   Packer, a Union Army veteran, was convicted of murder in 1883
and of five charges of manslaughter three years later when the
first conviction was overturned on a technicality.
   He was accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1874 and
then staying alive by eating their flesh while stranded in the snow
during a murderous winter in the Colorado Rockies.
   His story was that one of the gold seekers, hunger-crazed
Shannon Wilson Bell, came at him with a hatchet when he returned
empty handed from a five-day sortie in search of wildlife.
   He said Bell had killed and cannibalized the others. He said he
shot Bell in self-defense, finished him off with the hatchet and
then survived the winter on his companions' flesh.
   But the bones showed contradictory evidence, Starrs said.
   ``It is plain as a pikestaff that Packer was the one who was on
the attack, not Bell,'' Starrs said.
   Wounds on the bones of three of the victims ``were caused by a
hatchet-like instrument at a time when these persons were defending
themselves from the attack of an aggressor,'' he said.
   He said the marks suggested the victims had raised their arms to
fend off blows.
   Starrs said the evidence that Packer's story is false, and thus
that Packer is guilty, is that the angle of the blade marks on the
bones from which the flesh had been taken _ including the bones
believed to be Bell's _ indicated that the cuts were all made by
the same person.
   However, Starrs acknowledged that his findings had their limits.
He said, for example, he could not be sure which set of bones was
Bell's.
   Anthropologist Walter H. Birkby of the Arizona State Museum, who
scrutinized the bones for 26 days, said he couldn't share Starrs'
conclusions.
   ``It could possibly be the right scenario, but scientifically we
cannot substantiate it,'' Birkby said.
   Last summer, Birkby went further, saying his study of the
remains actually supported Packer's story.
   Starrs, however, entertained no doubts.
   Packer, he said, ``was having his flesh filets morning, noon and
night'' even though he could have lived by killing rabbits. He said
the fresh evidence ``convicts him beyond any shadow of a doubt.''
   Starrs said Packer was a fiend, ``base ... brutish ...
barbaric.''
   The experts also tried to settle forever the fiendish question
of how Packer spelled his first name.
   ``A-l-f-e-r-d,'' said Duane J. Dillon, a criminal investigator
from Martinez, Calif.
   His evidence was elementary: on court records, military records
and parole papers, the name appears conventionally, ``Alfred,'' but
whenever Packer signed a document he used the spelling, ``Alferd.''

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake rocked the volcanic island of
Oshima near Tokyo early Saturday and caused buildings to sway in
Tokyo, but no immediate sign of eruptions or reports of damage or
casualties followed.
   The quake struck at 6:20 a.m. It had a preliminary reading of
5.9 on the Richter scale on Oshima, nearly 75 miles south of the
Japanese capital, and in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, according
to the Central Meteorological Agency
   Meteorologists said the quake was centered 25 miles below the
ocean surface near Oshima.
   A Metropolitan Police Department official said police received
no reports of damage or injury.
   Mt. Mihara, an active volcano on Oshima, erupted in November
1986, spewing molten rock high into the air and forcing more than
11,000 people to evacuate. No direct casualties resulted, though
one person died later of a heart attack.
   A milder eruption occurred a year later. Oshima is part of an
island chain considered to be one of the most volcanically active
in the world.
   The open-ended Richter scale ia a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage
and one of magnitude 6, severe damage.

<TEXT>
   A man once charged with strangling
his wife lost temporary custody of his two young daughters Friday
when a judge ruled him an unfit father.
   Circuit Judge Brandt Chase Downey III said Jeffrey Crouch
refuses to deal with a drug and alcohol problem and cited the
``lingering thoughts'' that would remain in his daughters' minds
over whether Crouch really killed their mother.
   Crouch left a courtroom in tears, denying he killed his wife and
vowing to appeal the custody decision.
   ``Somebody took my wife and now they took my daughters away. I
will appeal, and I will get my daughters back,'' he said. ``Why
should I live the rest of my life without my daughters?''
   Crouch, 33, spent 17 months in jail on a first-degree murder
charge in the January 1987 strangulation of his wife, Jean Helen
Crouch. Her body was found on a remote beach after a night out with
her husband.
   The murder charge was dismissed in June 1988 by a judge who
ruled police detectives had coerced a taped confession from Crouch
and the confession could not be used as evidence against him.
   No one else has been arrested in the case. Crouch claims he last
saw his wife alive the night of Jan. 27, 1987, when the two left
their daughters with a baby sitter and went to a nightclub. He said
she disappeared when he went to get her coat.
   Temporary custody of Jessica Lee Crouch, 4, and Juline Anna
Crouch, 7, was awarded to their mother's sister, Judith Riha of
Plymouth, Mass. She was appointed their guardian shortly after the
1987 strangulation.
   The question of permanent custody of the children is to be
decided later.
   ``It is the opinion of this court that Crouch's drug and alcohol
abuse, his inability to be truthful, his denial of any problems in
the parenting area and in the drug abuse area and thus his lack of
addressing these problems through counseling are clear and
convincing proof that he is an unfit parent at this time,'' said
Circuit Judge Brandt Chase Downey III.
   ``The stigma of a confession and the lingering thoughts that
Crouch might have killed Helen would be ever-present in the girls'
mind and thus prohibit them from ever trusting him or even getting
close to him,'' Downey said.
   Crouch began a legal battle for his daughters after his release
from jail.
   Downey prohibited unsupervised visits between Crouch and the
girls in Florida but allowed supervised visits in Massachusetts.
   Crouch and the judge said the older girl expressed mixed
feelings of wanting to return to her father but not wanting to
leave her aunt.
   ``She was very much pulled and torn, kind of like I was,''
Downey said.

<HEAD>IAPA: Moral Pressure Little Help in Fighting Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slayings of two Colombian newpaper
officials demonstrate a shift in the challenge to press freedom in
Latin America, said participants in the annual convention of the
Inter American Press Association.
   Just as government-imposed restrictions on press freedoms are
easing in countries like Chile and Paraguay, international drug
traffickers are intensifying a bloody war against journalists.
   One nation, Panama, was characterized as having the world's
first ``narco-military'' leader in Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``Routinely our problems have been with governments that have
restricted press freedoms and jailed journalists,'' said Edward
Seaton, the new president of IAPA.
   ``Now the worst problems we face are caused by forces
independent of government, narcotics traffickers and insurgents,
who go after journalists and censor by terror,'' said Seaton,
editor-in-chief of The Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury and officer in the
Seaton Media Group.
   Seaton said journalists' main weapon in the fight for press
freedoms is moral pressure. The IAPA, which met this week in this
northern Mexican city, is a leading free-press advocate.
   ``Governments sometimes respond,'' he said. The drug cartels
haven't, however.
   Cartels Tuesday gunned down two officials of the daily Colombian
newspaper El Espectador in Medellin. The newspaper has crusaded
against drug trafficking; its main Bogota office was recently
bombed.
   Also shot to death the same day in Medellin was the director of
the magazine Cronista Democrata. Police there could not confirm if
his slaying was linked to drug traffickers.
   Nine Colombian journalists have been slain the past six months,
said Luis Gariel Cano, El Espectador's owner. Just one day before
the attacks, Cano pleaded with IAPA members to find a way ``to
combat this tremendous scourge.''
   Jorge Hernandez of the daily newspaper El Colombiano of Medellin
told members: ``I want to confess that, yes, we're afraid. We're
scared to death.''
   Journalists here expressed fear that traffickers would begin
terrorizing journalists in Ecuador and Bolivia.
   ``I feel that in just a short time something will happen,'' said
Alfonso Canelas of the daily Los Tiempos of Cochabamba, Bolivia.
   ``Panama is living the darkest moment in its history ... Liberty
of expression does not exist,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, executive
director of the daily La Prensa newspaper of Panama City.
   La Prensa, along with every other major independent Panamanian
news medium, has been shut down by Noriega, who was called ``the
world's first narco-military'' leader by Eisenmann.
   Noriega's crackdown on the press began after the U.S. government
accused him of being an international drug dealer and escalated
after Noriega held elections that were widely denounced as
fraudulent.
   Eduardo Ulibarri, vice president of the IAPA press freedom
commission, speculated that narcotics traffickers in Colombia timed
this week's attacks to coincide with the IAPA meeting.
   ``They're trying to produce even more public impact,'' said
Ulibarri, of the daily Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion.
   The IAPA said in its final report that although ``some advances
are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of
press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as
long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest
form of censorship: death by assassination.''
   Chilean and Paraguayan journalists are seeing signs of restored
press freedoms for the first time since longtime dictators Augusto
Pinochet and Alfredo Stroessner imposed severe restrictions.
   Hernan Buchi and Patricio Aylwin, the two leading candidates in
Chile's Dec. 14 elections _ the first since Pinochet's 1973
military coup _ have been recognized by the IAPA for their struggle
to re-establish press freedoms.
   New President Andres Rodriguez of Paraguay has ``taken the
necessary steps to reinstate freedom to Paraguayan journalism,''
said Aldo Zuccolillo of the daily ABC Color of Asuncion, closed
under former President Alfredo Stroessner's regime.
   And there is ``a window of hope'' for improved freedom of
expression in Nicaragua after next year's elections, said Ulibarri.
   The IAPA noted that new Argentine President Carlos Menem has
begun privatizing state television stations and making other moves
to advance press freedom.
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari chose his address
to the IAPA meeting to announce the government would privatize the
state newsprint monopoly. The company has been used in the past to
harass independent newspapers by not providing them with newsprint.
   The Salinas administration also this year has arrested a former
Federal Security Police director and accused him in the slaying
five years ago of a well-known Mexico City journalist.
   Government press restrictions have worsened in some countries,
including Cuba, Nicaragua and Hait, said Ulibarri.
   ``In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the
hemisphere, repression of journalists ... is worse than ever,'' the
IAPA said in a statement.
   In Colombia, Peru, Guatemala and El Salvador, the press is
caught in the crossfire between the government and either drug
cartels or rebels, Ulibarri said. In Guatemala, the government of
President Vinicio Cerezo wants to protect the press, but the
structures of terrorism instituted by former military governments
are deeply rooted, Ulibarri said.

<HEAD>64 Dead in Guerrilla Attacks A Month Before Elections</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wave of leftist rebel attacks and clashes
with security forces in highland and coastal areas this week has
left more than 64 people dead, including three mayors, authorities
said Friday.
   The government says the Maoist Shining Path rebels are
attempting to sabotage municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12 by
assassinating officials and attacking government facilities.
   This week's attacks coincided with a meeting of the Group of
Eight Latin American presidents, which took place Wednesday and
Thursday in Ica, 185 miles southeast of Lima.
   Rebel attacks left 35 people dead, including 17 guerrillas,
since Thursday, authorities said. With a total of 64 dead, this is
the heaviest week of violence since the army reported killing more
than 200 rebels in a series of encounters in July.
   In the latest incident, the government said in a communique
issued through the official news agency Andina that 14 Shining Path
guerrillas were killed and a policeman was wounded in a battle
Friday near Antauta, 590 miles southeast of Lima.
   The mayor of Tingo Maria, a jungle city 240 miles northeast of
Lima, was fatally shot by guerrillas Thursday as he walked near his
home, according to a government spokesman.
   Rebels also assassinated the mayor of Jauja, 120 miles east of
Lima Thursday. On Tuesday, rebels killed the mayor of Ananea, 610
miles southeast of Lima, in addition to the town's police chief and
nine policemen.
   The assassinations bring to at least 56 the number of mayors
killed in political violence in the last five years. Twenty-seven
of them died this year.
   Police said other Shining Path rebels toppled two power pylons
in the central highlands Thursday night, causing a total blackout
in and around the Huancayo, a city 140 miles east of Lima.
   During the blackout, rebels using dynamite bombs attacked an
army barracks, two police posts, government offices, banks, schools
and the local newspaper El Correo. One child was killed in one of
40 blasts reported by police, and two policemen were attacked and
killed.
   Rebels also blew up seven power pylons near Huaraz, 190 miles
north of Lima in the Andes, knocking out power to a region with
more than 100,000 inhabitants, according to police.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in 1980 in the
mountains near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, and now
operates in most of the highlands, the coca-producing jungles in
the northeast and in some areas of Peru's coastline.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
violence since 1980, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

   Gov. Bill Clements continued eating a hamburger in
a restaurant as it was held up by a gunman who fired two shots
before running outside and shooting a fleeing witness in the leg.
   Mike Toomey, the governor's chief of staff, said Clements was
not fazed _ or injured _ in the holdup Thursday night.
   ``The governor is out in front at the counter eating and he said
he heard this guy (yelling) and he said that he just continued
eating his hamburger,'' Toomey said.
   ``He said the guy left and he kept eating his hamburger, and
then he left,'' Toomey said.
   Police on Friday continued their search for the robber, who was
armed with a small-caliber pistol.
   Keith Gresham, 33, one of at least nine customers in the
restaurant, was shot in the calf as he ran for help, police said.
He was treated at a hospital and released.
   Police Detective C.W. Wachholz said the robber forced a worker
at Goff's Hamburgers to empty the cash register and hand over a
pistol from beneath the counter.
   The robber started to run out the door, turned and fired two
shots into the restaurant, hitting glass above the front door, then
shot the witness outside, police said.
   Clements' bodyguard was not with him. Toomey said it is not
unusual for the governor to go out in public alone.

   A correspondent for the newspaper El

saying he had been threatened with arrest by Panamanian authorities.
   Antonio Cano, 32, who lives in Mexico and has covered Panama for

called him at his hotel to criticize a story he had written about
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as chief of the Defense Forces is
the real power in the country.
   The story was a profile on the general with some references to

   Government officials were not available for comment on the

   Cano said he called Spanish Embassy officials, who took him to

   Cavallaro died Thursday at Mount Carmel East Hospital, where he
had been hospitalized since Oct. 5, said hospital spokeswoman Betty
Staley.
   John Moore, a former booking agent for Cavallaro, described
Cavallaro as a ``poet of the piano. He had a sheer love of making
people happy with his piano playing.''
   As a youngster, Cavallaro was trained in classical music and
played concerts in the United States and abroad.
   From 1933 to 1937, he was billed simply as Carmen, and he led a
five-piece combo at a St. Louis hotel in 1939.
   In the 1940s, he played in top hotels in Detroit, New York,
Chicago and other cities. A change to a swing band failed in the
mid-40s.
   In the late 1940s, Cavallaro had a Sunday afternoon radio show
called ``The Schaeffer Parade.''
   Cavallaro, who composed such songs as ``Wanda,'' ``While the
Nightwind Sings'' and ``Masquerade Waltz,'' won acclaim for
imitating Eddy Duchin's piano style in the soundtrack of ``The Eddy
Duchin Story.'' Tyrone Power portrayed Duchin.
   Cavallaro had lived in Columbus for the past 15 years, where he
remained active by giving concerts.
   He is survived by his wife, Donna, four sons and two daughters.

   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that
Richard W. Miller is not a flight risk and ordered a judge to set
bail for the former FBI agent whose 1986 espionage conviction was
overturned this year.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a detention order
issued by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon after Miller's
conviction was overturned. Miller has been in federal custody since
his 1984 arrest.
   Miller, in a federal prison in Minnesota, reacted with ``very
guarded optimism'' because of past disappointments in the case,
defense attorney Joel Levine said in Los Angeles. ``He's very
anxious to get out,'' Levine said.
   Levine expects Miller to be transferred back to California for a
bail hearing soon now that the case has been returned to federal
court in Los Angeles.
   The appeals court said the government has failed to prove Miller
is a risk to flee. The order returns the case to Kenyon to impose
``appropriate release conditions.''
   Miller is the only FBI agent convicted of espionage. The 20-year
FBI veteran was convicted of delivering secret U.S. documents to
his lover, Svetlana Ogorodnikov, a Russian emigre who pleaded
guilty with her husband, Nikolay, to espionage.
   The Ogorodnikovs are serving federal prison terms.
   A jury deadlocked in Miller's first trial, but a second jury
found him guilty and Kenyon sentenced him to two life prison terms
plus 50 years.
   The appeals court overturned the conviction in April on grounds
that Kenyon erred in admitting lie detector evidence in the second
trial in 1985-86.
   The court ordered a new trial for Miller, and the government
appealed. In July, lawyers for Miller sought to have him freed on
bail pending the appeal, but Kenyon ruled he was a flight risk and
denied bail.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down the government
appeal in August, and prosecutors have not indicated whether they
will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or try Miller again.
   During Miller's two trials, the prosecution depicted him as a
bitter man who was reprimanded for ineptitude. They said he was
easily recruited in the summer of 1984 by Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her
husband.
   Miller went into an FBI office on Sept. 27, 1984, and revealed
his relationship with Mrs. Ogorodnikov. He claimed he was trying to
redeem his career by infiltrating the KGB.
   Prosecutors charged that Miller and Mrs. Ogorodnikov planned to
travel to Vienna to meet with Soviet intelligence agents.
   FBI agents grilled Miller for four days as Mrs. Ogorodnikov
frantically called his Lynwood home and FBI offices in Los Angeles
and Santa Ana to try to locate him. Miller arrested Oct. 2, 1984.

   Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the nation's
largest advertising agencies, pleaded innocent Friday to charges it
paid nearly $1 million in bribes to Jamaican officials for the
island's lucrative tourism campaign.
   Two of the company's executives and a former executive also
pleaded innocent Friday in U.S. District Court.
   Two Jamaicans charged with accepting the bribes, former Minister
of Tourism Eric Anthony Abrahams and Arnold Foote Jr., were not in
court.
   Arrest warrants were issued for the two, but have not been
served, said U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy Jr. The U.S. government
will begin extradition proceedings against them because they
haven't surrendered voluntarily, he said.
   Jamaica's attorney general, Carl Rattray, told the Greenwich
Time newspaper in a telephone interview Friday that he saw no
barriers to extraditing Abrahams and Foote.
   ``Usually we cooperate as much as possible,'' Rattray said. ``I
don't think there would be a problem.''
   Abrahams' lawyer Abe Dabdoub has denied that Abrahams received
kickbacks for awarding the tourism board's account to Young &amp;
Rubicam.
   The case was poorly investigated ``with malice in mind,''
Dabdoub said. Abrahams held the post from 1981-84. He is now a
tourism consultant for several Caribbean countries, including Haiti.
   Foote, now president of the Advertising Agencies Association of
Jamaica, says he was never a government official or adviser, and
denies that illegal payments were made.
   Young &amp; Rubicam faces up to $7.5 million in fines if it is
convicted. Young &amp; Rubicam still holds the Jamaica account, which
won praise for its theme ``Come Back to Jamaica,'' and has
vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
   ``We will be pressing for an early trial date, so we can present
our evidence and get this matter resolved,'' said Young &amp; Rubicam
in a statement. ``We expect to be found innocent.''
   The New York-based agency, along with Executive Vice President
Arthur R. Klein and former Vice President Thomas Spangenberg, were
indicted last week on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Steven M. McKenna, a
company senior vice president, was charged with perjury.
   The Jamaicans were both charged with racketeering.
   The case is believed to the first attempt to use the
Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organizations Act against an
advertising agency.
   The indictment alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam paid $900,000 in
bribes to Foote and Abrahams over 5{ years starting in 1981. In
return, the indictment alleged, Young &amp; Rubicam got the Jamaican
Tourist Board's ad account, which prosecutors say generated $3.75
million in commissions for the agency.
   The government alleged that the payments were funneled to
Abrahams through a sham advertising agency set up by Foote that had
secret bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.
   The indictment said Foote should be considered a public official
because he ``acted in an official capacity'' on behalf of Abrahams
as an advisor to the Jamaican government on tourism matters,
including the selection of an advertising agency for the Jamaica
Tourist Board.
   Young &amp; Rubicam, which called the charges ``without substance or
merit,'' acknowledges it made payments to Ad Ventures, a company
controlled by Foote. The agency says Ad Ventures provided various
services for the Jamaican account, and maintains it had no reason
to believe that Foote could be considered a public official under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   ``Young and Rubicam made very simple, conventional, legitimate
business arrangements in Jamaica. There is absolutely nothing wrong
with it,'' Thomas D. Barr, the agency's lawyer, said after the
arraignments Friday.
   The government's entire case, built during a three-year
investigation, depends on its characterization of Foote as a public
official, which the company will challenge, he said.
   The Jamaica investigation stemmed from an unrelated probe of
illegal tax shelters. Best-selling novelist Robin Moore, author of
``The French Connection'' and ``The Green Berets,'' pleaded guilty
here to tax charges in the tax probe, and cooperated with federal
investigators when they turned their attention to the Jamaica
dealings.
   Moore, whose business dealings in Jamaica date back 40 years, is
described in the indictment as a middleman who helped steer the
Jamaica account to Young &amp; Rubicam and then helped pass money
between the agency and Foote.
   Twardy said Moore profited from the dealings but will not be
charged.
   U.S. Magistrate F. Owen Egan set bond at $10,000 for the three
executives and told them they must notify the court before
traveling outside the United States. The case has been assigned to
U.S. District Judge Peter C. Dorsey.

<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization
opposes a reported U.S. plan to bring about Israeli-Palestinian
talks as the first step toward a peace settlement, a senior PLO
official said Friday.
   Yasser Abd-Rabbo, a member of the PLO's 15-man Executive
Committee, said he's against talks that don't include the PLO.
   ``This plan is not acceptable to us at all because it is the PLO
that appoints its own representatives to any negotiations,'' he
told Egypt's state Middle East News Agency.
   U.S. and Israeli proposals ``have only one aim and that is to
waste time,'' Abd-Rabbo said after arriving in Cairo for meetings
with Egyptian officials.
   Israel Radio said the plan proposed by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III would have Egypt consult with the Palestinians on the
composition of their delegation and would have Israel agree to the
dialogue only if it is satisfied with the choice of the Palestinian
negotiators.
   The Israeli plan Abd-Rabbo referred to was in May by Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for Palestinian elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza sector who would negotiate with
Israel on interim autonomy. Talks on the final status of the
territories would be held later.
   Abd-Rabbo is the chief PLO delegate to PLO talks with the United
States in Tunis, capital of Tunisia. The talks began in December
after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's existence. Four rounds have been held so far.
   Baker's five-point plan has not been officially disclosed. But
officials in Washington and Jerusalem said it sought to reconcile
Israeli and Egyptian views on a proposed Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue. Baker suggested he and the foreign ministers of Egypt and
Israel meet in Washington in two weeks for talks.
   Baker advanced his plan after Israel's decision-making inner
Cabinet rejected last Friday an Egyptian proposal for an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo. Israel objected mainly to
Cairo's suggestion that the Palestinian delegation include members
from outside the occupied territories, possibly activists deported
by Israel. Jerusalem saw it as a ploy to bring the PLO to the
negotiating table.
   The PLO's Central Council is to meet Sunday in Baghdad, Iraq, to
review all peace ideas of past months and is expected to issue a
policy statement. The council is an intermediary between the
Executive Committee and the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said
Friday that he may declare a state of emergency to prevent a
walkout at a U.S.-based banana and real estate company from
becoming a nationwide strike.
   ``We will act with responsibility. We could declare a state of
emergency in the country because the interests of Honduras are
first,'' Azcona said.
   About 11,000 workers at Castle &amp; Cooke have been on strike since
Oct. 3.
   The Workers Confederation and the National Farmworkers
Organization, which together have 500,000 members, said Friday they
will join the strike Monday.
   ``I won't stand for any type of threats. The problem was not
created by the government,'' Azcona said at a news conference.
``Honduras would not put up with a general strike for even a week.
Because of this, we could declare a national state of emergency or
assume other positions.''
   Castle &amp; Cooke, based in San Francisco, has operated in Honduras
since the turn of the century and sells about 60 percent of the
nation's banana exports. Honduras exports 50 million 100-pound
boxes annually.
   The company, among other things, also has extensive land
holdings in Southern California and Hawaii.
   The labor dispute began Sept. 18 when Castle &amp; Cooke sold one of
its plants to independent packers and transferred the workers
without giving them salary increases. The union rejected the
action, saying Honduran law stipulates that pay raises accompany
transfers.
   Azcona on Monday ordered the workers back on the job and the
company not to take punitive measures.
   The strike continued, however, and negotiations Friday at the
presidential palace were unsuccessful.
   Castle &amp; Cooke is losing $250,000 daily during the strike,
according to the government.

<TEXT>
   The minister of government and
justice in the Cabinet controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
resigned without explanation Friday as the regime prepared to purge
``disloyal'' public employees.
   Meanwhile, the opposition said it was willing to talk about new
elections if Noriega steps down as chief of the Defense Forces, a
condition the government rejected in unsuccessful negotiations in
August.
   Justice ministry spokesman Luis Romero Villalobos said an
official explanation for the resignation of Minister Olmedo Miranda
would be given later.
   Miranda was appointed Sept. 3, two days after provisional
President Francisco Rodriguez took office. The provisional
government was created when Noriega annulled the May 7 elections,
which independent observers said the opposition won by a landslide.
   The public payroll includes nearly 140,000 people and one-third
may be fired in the next few weeks. Earlier this week, the
government announced tough measures that, among other things, make
it easy for the government to dismiss employees considered disloyal.
   Official reports said many public employees celebrated on Oct. 3
when rebels tried to overthrow Noriega, who commands the Panamanian
Defense Forces and runs the country.
   ``Every public employee must watch out for traitors that are
infiltrated,'' Noriega told supporters two days after the botched
coup. ``We are going to make a list.''
   New laws also have frozen pay, suspended Christmas bonuses and
forbidden political activity by professional and business
associations. The government said the intent was ``preserving
national sovereignty and defending the economy'' in the face of
``aggression by the United States.''
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega since he was
indicted in Florida in February 1988 on federal charges of drug
trafficking and money laundering. He denies the charges.
   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara said Friday that the
opposition would be ``willing to hold talks on many grounds'' about
new elections.
   ``If Gen. Noriega is willing to leave, we would be willing to
consider what kind of elections could be held,'' said Endara.
   He was the opposition presidential candidate in the May
elections and international observers said he beat the government
candidate by a 3-1 margin.

   The Bush administration said Friday it
continues to believe there is no fundamental right to abortion but
told the Supreme Court state restrictions on abortions for minors
may be upheld on narrower grounds.
   The Justice Department submitted a ``friend-of-the-court'' legal
brief in defense of a Minnesota law requiring some girls to tell
both parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion.
   The administration may be taking a somewhat more moderate
position than the Reagan administration did when it urged the
justices to overturn their 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which
legalized abortions nationwide.
   But women's rights activists promptly denounced Bush and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``This is another last-minute attack on women's lives from the
Bush administration,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund
for the Feminist Majority. ``Obviously the president and the
attorney general are ignoring the massive public outcry to keep
abortion legal. Congress has received the message recently. But
where's George?''
   The National Right to Life Committee, on the other hand, said
the brief was ``excellent.''
   The Justice Department said, ``We continue to believe that Roe
was wrongly decided and should be overruled. There is, in view of
the nation's history and traditions, no fundmamental right to
abortion.''
   But Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr and other department
lawyers said Minnesota's parental notification regulations
withstand attack on narrower grounds.
   ``There is utterly no support for the proposition that a minor
has a fundamental right to keep her parents in the dark about her
welfare,'' the department's brief said.
   ``A state may reasonably conclude that a minor's parents are, as
a general matter, better suited to make these critical decisions
than a minor and her physician, or a minor and her physician in
conjunction with a judge,'' the department said.
   The brief also attacked a crucial underpinning of Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor's analysis of abortion regulations.
   O'Connor, the high court's pivotal member on abortion, has
stopped short of voting to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Instead, she has
often endorsed state abortion restrictions on grounds they do not
pose ``an undue burden'' to the fundamental right created by the
1973 ruling.
   The Justice Department brief said, ``The undue burden analysis
begs the question at issue: whether there is a fundamental right at
stake that requires'' courts to view with heightened skepticism any
regulation limiting access to abortions.
   ``We do not believe, upon full reflection, that the undue burden
inquiry can legitimately substitute for a standard of review,'' the
department lawyers said. ``The analysis cannot assist in
distinguishing between fundamental rights and other liberty
interests.''
   O'Connor cast the deciding vote July 3, when the high court
upheld Missouri regulations limiting access to abortion. That 5-4
ruling permitted the Roe vs. Wade decision to stand but gave states
new power to limit a woman's right to have an abortion.
   The justices have three cases, including the one from Minnesota,
on their docket this term.
   They are reviewing an Ohio law, similar to the Minnesota
statute, that requires doctors to notify one parent of unmarried,
minor girls before performing abortions.
   The third case, from Illinois, will test whether states can
impose strict new licensing requirements on abortion clinics that
could force them to become what one judge said was ``the functional
equivalent of small hospitals.''
   The court will hear arguments in the three cases in November and
December and is expected to decide them by July.

   NBC's Jane Pauley said Friday she is
looking forward to a future at NBC News beyond her role as
co-anchor of the morning ``Today'' show.
   But in a speech to 300 woman managers, the popular TV
personality did not say what type of work she would do in the news
division.
   ``My horizons have expanded,'' Pauley said at a luncheon address
to women executives in Stamford. ``It's no longer Jane Pauley,
`Today' show. Now it's Jane Pauley, NBC News. Imagine the
possibilities.
   ``For the first time in 4,750 days, I'm thinking beyond today.
I'm looking toward tomorrow,'' said Pauley, who declined to answer
reporters' questions afterward.
   Pauley, who turns 39 in two weeks and celebrated her 13th
anniversary with ``Today'' on Wednesday, alluded several times in
the 20-minute speech to her impending career change.
   Her next move has been the subject of speculation since
``Sunrise'' anchor Deborah Norville joined the ``Today'' show.
Norville, 31, was given a $1 million salary in swapping duties with
``Today'' news anchor John Palmer in August.
   Pauley, who makes $1.2 million per year, has two years on her
NBC News contract, and she told the Washington Post earlier this
week that she intends to stay with the network, although she will
probably leave ``Today'' by the end of the year.
   Pauley has said there is no friction between herself and
Norville, nor with co-anchor Bryant Gumbel, although she told the
Post it ``was a real blow'' to hear that Norville and Palmer had
switched jobs.
   NBC's latest statement, issued Wednesday, said, ``Conversations
about specifics are concluding now and we expect to announce our
mutual plans shortly.''

<TEXT>
   A lifeguard who pleaded guilty to raping
an 11-year-old girl at a YMCA is free after serving only one day of
a three-day sentence.
   Derrick Anthony Parker pleaded guilty in August to second-degree
rape, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He had
been accused of raping the girl in an equipment room at the
Bethesda YMCA.
   ``I'm appalled,'' Gloria Goldfaden, executive director of the
Maryland chapter of the National Committee Against Child Abuse,
said after Parker's release. ``This is not justice.''
   State sentencing guidelines for Parker, who had no previous
record, were four to nine years. In a presentencing report, a
probation officer recommended 18 months in jail.
   But Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge William Cave on Oct. 6
sentenced Parker, 21, to five years in prison with all but three
days suspended. Cave also placed Parker on three years supervised
probation, ordered him to perform 1,000 hours of community service
and told him to have no unsupervised contact with young girls.
   Parker, a Washington resident, was released from the county jail
after spending only one day in jail. Inmates typically serve
one-third of their sentence.
   Cave said it was it one of the most difficult sentences he ever
had to hand down. But he said giving Parker a long prison term
``wouldn't benefit him and may conceivably have a disastrous
effect.''
   ``Incarceration will not restore that which was taken from
her,'' he said. ``Incarceration will not in my opinion, deter other
people from (committing rape) because they do not think of that at
the time.''
   Before announcing the sentence, Cave said, ``I'm not unmindful
that this sounds like a lack of concern or consideration on behalf
of (the victim). I certainly don't mean it to be that way.''
   Parker's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Lois Coon, said at
the sentencing that Parker had expressed ``true remorse'' for what
happened.
   Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Taylor asked Cave to
sentence Parker within the state guidelines, four to nine years.
She said the victim, a sixth-grader who told police she had a crush
on Parker, was not expecting to have sex when she went into the
room with him in October 1988.
   ``Before she knew it, it was happening,'' Taylor argued.
   Parker was arrested in January after authorities at the girl's
school learned about the incident and called the police.

   Other books have detailed extramarital affairs
involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but the Rev. Ralph David
Abernathy's autobiography was written from the inside.
   Unlike the other books' authors, Abernathy is neither a
historian nor a journalist, but a former confidante of King. And
the book's publication has opened a rift in what was King's inner
circle more than two decades ago.
   ``The other people in the movement have not written (such) books
at all; none of us have described what's alleged here,'' former
King aide John Lewis said Friday.
   In ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' Abernathy said King
``had a weakness for women.'' He wrote that King spent part of the
last night of his life in Memphis, Tenn., with two women, then
fought with a third who'd been looking for him.
   Civil rights leaders, including King aides Andrew Young Jesse
Jackson and Lewis, denounced the book Thursday, calling on
Abernathy to repudiate it and expressing doubt he'd written ``the
Memphis section.''
   On Friday, about two dozen people, including Alabama black
leaders, gathered at King's first church in Montgomery, Ala., to
call for a boycott of the book.
   ``Martin Luther King is like Christ. You've got your Judases,''
Joe Reed, head of the Alabama Democratic Party's black caucus, said
at Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church.
   Other King historians, including Pulitzer Prize-winners Taylor
Branch and David Garrow, have written King had a predilection for
women.
   In ``Parting the Waters: America in the King Years,'' Branch
wrote how King's inner circle _ including Abernathy, Young and
others _ was defined by an adjustment each made to King's private
life.
   ``These were people who tolerated or even applauded King's demon
delights as a humanizing revelation that bonded them even closer to
him and his public purpose,'' Branch wrote. ``They objected to
King's mistresses no more than to the scores of concubines who had
soothed King David.''
   Garrow also dealt with the subject in ``Bearing the Cross:
Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.''
   ``They were not participants,'' said Lewis, now a Democratic
congressman from Atlanta. ``But this is not only a participant, but
a close friend, a leader within the movement.''
   The Rev. Otis Moss Jr., pastor of Cleveland's Olivet
Institutional Baptist Church and a friend of Abernathy, told him in
a letter that he should have higher standards than others who've
written about King.
   Moss said that while Garrow and others may focus on King's sex
life, ``you and I must forever focus on his spiritual genius.''
   The letter was released Friday by Jesse Hill, an insurance
executive who is chairman of the board of The King Center in
Atlanta and who spoke for Young, Jackson, Lewis and others in
denouncing the book Thursday.
   Lewis said he was ``hurt that someone so close to Dr. King and
so critical to our struggle for civil rights would attempt to
discredit Dr. King and our movement in this way.''
   Lewis also said he objects to ``the specific stories'' _
Abernathy's woman-by-woman account of King's last night. ``Taylor
Branch doesn't go into the gory detail,'' he said.
   ``I'm for not distorting the truth,'' Lewis said. ``Whether this
is true or not true shouldn't take anything away from the
leadership the man provided this nation.''
   A prominent black Alabama attorney, J.L. Chestnut, complained
Thursday that Abernathy ``should not be throwing stones about other
people,'' in light of reports about his own past.
   According to Branch's book, a flamboyant Montgomery, Ala., man
armed with a hatchet once chased Abernathy and complained the
minister had been sleeping with his wife since she was 15.
Abernathy refused to sign a complaint against the man.
   ``Some years later,'' Branch wrote, ``King confided to a
colleague that he not only had known of Abernathy's extramarital
liaisons in Montgomery, but had joined in some of them himself.''
   Abernathy has not returned repeated calls from The Associated
Press seeking elaboration on his book and comment on reaction to
it. Representatives of Harper &amp; Row, the book's publisher, have
said the words are his own.
   Abernathy spoke with reporters in Memphis on Thursday, where he
was promoting the book. He told them he was no betrayer of King and
that he resents accusations that strokes and brain surgery have
left his mind impaired.
   ``I'm not Judas,'' he said. ``I know who I am. I'm a Christian
minister. ... I am most surprised anybody would think I'm mentally
incompetent.''

<HEAD>Two White Police Officers Indicted on Charges They Hit Black Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white police officers were indicted Friday on
battery and other charges for allegedly hitting two black
teen-agers, then forcing them out of a squad car in a white
neighborhood where they were beaten by residents. The August
incident and another in which a black man was shot to death by
police sparked allegations of police racism and prompted City
Council hearings on police brutality.
   But Cook County's chief prosecutor on Friday cautioned against
concluding the officers were racist.
   ``Why must it be put in a racial context?'' State's Attorney
Cecil Partee said at a news conference announcing the indictments.
``That's part of the problem in Chicago today. Everything is being
put in a racial context.''
   The officers _ Kathleen Moore, 31, and James Serio, 35 _ were
each charged with two counts of official misconduct, a felony, and
one count of misdemeanor battery. They will be suspended without
pay, said police spokesman Patrick Camden.
   Serio and Moore allegedly picked the 14-year-old boys up for a
curfew violation outside of Comiskey Park shortly after an Aug. 15
White Sox game.
   The standard procedure in curfew violations is to take the
offender home. But, according to prosecutors, the officers instead
drove the boys to a white neighborhood not far from the ballpark.
   Moore hit the boys before forcing them out of the patrol car,
prosecutors said.
   The boys were then beaten by a group of residents who were later
charged with aggravated battery and ethnic intimidation, said
state's attorney spokesman Dan McCullough.
   Each misconduct charge carries a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $10,000 fine. The battery count is punishable by up
to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Although Moore is the officer accused of hitting the boys, Serio
also faces the charge because he ``could have intervened and did
not,'' said McCullough.
   Arraignment was set for Nov. 9. The officers will not be
arrested before then because they are not considered at risk to
leave the jurisdiction, he said.
   In the second case of alleged brutality, 24-year-old Leonard
Bannister was shot to death on a South Side street by a police
officer.
   Police maintain that Bannister was shot while trying to grab the
officer's gun. But other witnesses have said that was not the case.
The man's family has filed a $5 million civil rights lawsuit
against the officer.

   Jenifer Graham, who refused to dissect a frog
in her high school biology class because it violated her beliefs,
is the subject of a television dramatization aimed at her fellow
students.
   ``Frog Girl: The Jenifer Graham Story,'' will be broadcast
Tuesday afternoon in the ``CBS Schoolbreak Special,'' a one-hour
show that details Miss Graham's refusal to compromise her belief
that all life is sacred.
   The show, starring Ellen Dunning as Jenifer and Kerrie Keane as
her mother Patricia, has a script by Harry and Renee Longstreet
that keeps its focus on the story and avoids the issue-of-the-week
feel that many such shows carry.
   The show was directed by Harry Longstreet and camerawork was by
Don Fauntleroy, whose wife, actress Lesley-Anne Down, was so taken
by a reading of the script that she volunteered for a bit part.
   ``I respect other people's beliefs, I just want mine respected
too,'' said Miss Graham in a recent interview. She is now 18 and a
freshman at California State University, San Bernardino with an
undeclared major.
   In the spring of 1987, her biology teacher and principal at
Victor Valley High School, and its governing board, refused a
request from Miss Graham and her attorneys to perform some
alternate work instead of dissecting a frog that had been raised
and killed specifically for lab science.
   ``I was trying to make it obvious that I would do just as much
work, if not more,'' she said. ``I felt like I was talking to a
wall. I was compared to a kid who didn't want to sit next to a
black person in typing class and someone who didn't want to run in
PE.''
   All of that just one month after starting school as a transfer
student from Nebraska, where she and her mother reached a
compromise with teachers when she refused a lab dissection in 7th
grade.
   There was initially no room for compromise at Victor Valley High
School, located in the high desert community of Victorville, 70
miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Miss Graham said she suffered depression and her grades dropped
while she received international attention in the spring of 1987 as
the ``Frog Girl'' _ a term she loathes.
   ``Different schools act differently,'' said Miss Graham. ``But
look at the good it (the controversy) did. It passed a bill for the
whole state of California.'' She was referring to the ``Students
Rights Bill,'' which permits students morally opposed to dissection
to refrain from it in return for equivalent work.
   But the bill took effect Jan. 1 of this year _ too late to help
Miss Graham, who was stuck with a ``C'' on her transcript for the
biology class, down from an ``A.''
   A lawsuit was dismissed in August of 1988 when a federal judge
accepted the high school's offer of substituting photographs of a
frog which had died a natural death.
   But Miss Graham objected, saying she was dissatisfied with how
the school would guarantee the frog was not killed. An appeal
continues.
   Although she said she ``never lost a single friend'' over the
controversy, she is happy to resume anonymity as a college student.
``No one even recognizes me, and I don't mind a bit, to tell you
the truth.''
   Since her exposure to the power of media, she said she has
gained an interest in marketing and advertising.
   ``There are not many people who have the courage to do as she
did, and stand by her convictions,'' said Miss Down, who briefly
appears in the show as a witness before a legislative committee
considering the Students Rights Bill.
   ``It's hard enough to do when you are a grownup, but when you
are a kid, that makes you something pretty special,'' Miss Down
said. ``The lesson this teaches young people is invaluable.''

<HEAD>A New York ``Street Scene'' Takes Shape in London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside a North London rehearsal hall lurk the
tempestuous passions of a New York tenement.
   ``Dere's been a moider,'' one actor cries in his best Noo Yawk
mimicry, while another gets advice on the correct way to say
``shirt torn'': ``It's not very articulate. It's like `shirddorn,'
'' says dialogue coach Charmian Hoare. The moment is the tragic
second-act climax of Kurt Weill's 1947 ``Street Scene,'' the German
composer's look at sultry summertime life in the Big Apple slums.
The show, which has had a checkered history, is readying its
professional London debut with an Anglo-American creative team.
   ``This is totally unique; I've never done anything like it,''
said American soprano Kristine Ciesinksi. She sings the role of the
doomed Anna Maurrant, the wife whose adultery leads to her
``moider,'' or murder.
   Internationally known English bass Richard Van Allan sings the
part of her vengeful husband, Frank, and Janis Kelly, a Scot, is
their daughter, Rose.
   Both Ciesinski and Kelly appeared in the production's British
premiere at the Scottish Opera in Glasgow last May. That was the
first professional British production of a work whose exposure here
has been limited to school stagings and a one-night charity benefit.
   Now, restaged and somewhat recast after Glasgow, ``Street
Scene'' joins London's English National Opera repertory for an Oct.
17 opening. Briton David Pountney, the ENO's director of
productions, again directs. American conductor Carl Davis is new to
the venture in London.
   Weill became famous for his collaboration with the playwright
Bertolt Brecht on such works as ``The Threepenny Opera.'' With his
wife, the singer Lotte Lenya, he emigrated to the United States in
1935. He died in 1950.
   ``Street Scene'' reunites conductor Davis with a show he first
saw in its Broadway premiere, when he was 11. He went on to be a
repetiteur (coach) on its 1959 revival at the New York City Opera,
where the show is once again in the repertory this autumn.
   ``In a way, this is a funny full circle,'' Davis said of his
current assignment. He said Peter Jonas, ENO's artistic director,
telephoned and suggested the idea. ``I said, `This is madness, but
I'd love to, for nostalgia.'''
   ``Street Scene'' has traditionally confounded purists with its
blend of operatic bravura and populist Broadway savvy.
   The show has a knockout dance number, ``Moon-faced,
starry-eyed,'' right out of Broadway's golden age. But its choral
passages and arias recall the lyricism of another hybrid, George
Gershwin's 1935 ``Porgy and Bess.''
   And despite its lowlife setting, ``Street Scene'' has more
sentiment than did Weill's earlier hard-edged collaborations with
Brecht, ``Mahagonny'' which was recently restaged in Los Angeles,
and ``The Threepenny Opera,'' due on Broadway in November, starring
pop singer Sting.
   Audiences initially found ``Street Scene'' perplexing.
   ``It was very unconventional,'' explained Davis, who has a
separate career composing and conducting music for film classics
such as Abel Gance's ``Napoleon'' and Charlie Chaplin's ``City
Lights.''
   ``At the same time, it had elements that made it attractive for
an opera company _ long developed passages for legitimate opera
voices for which all of the formulas of Broadway musicals are swept
aside.''
   ``Street Scene'' is only the second ENO production of a work
that originated on Broadway. It will play in repertory with such
operatic warhorses as Verdi's ``A Masked Ball'' and Puccini's
``Madam Butterfly.''
   Is it opera or musical? Pountney says it doesn't matter.
   ``Opera has been so many different things in its life from what
Monteverdi wrote to what Mozart wrote to what Wagner wrote,'' said
the Cambridge-educated director.
   ``To me, anything which combines theater and music might as well
be called opera as anything else.''
   Ciesinski said the show combined ``humor, tragedy, Broadway
dancing, blues, jazz, operatic singing _ all of them built up so it
flows along very naturally.'' Ciesinksi, who is married to British
baritone Norman Bailey, is making her London debut with ``Street
Scene.'' She returns to ENO next year to sing two heavyweight
roles: Strauss's Salome and Verdi's Lady Macbeth.
   ``That's more my normal meat and potatoes, so this is sort of
unusual: to create something very natural and moving _ not a crazy,
bitchy lady,'' she said.
   And although she also sings Salome in Baltimore in December, she
is pleased to be based in Europe: ``Being an opera singer is more
of a way of life here; in America, I can't even get a credit card.''

   Federal deposit insurance did not protect
everyone in the savings and loan debacle. Some 22,000 mostly
elderly depositors at Lincoln Savings in Southern California lost
$200 million, possibly forever. Lincoln officials say they did
nothing wrong in urging purchase of risky junk bonds in their
parent company, a real estate developer. But regulators call their
marketing misleading, and others partly blame U.S. senators'
intervention on behalf of a campaign contributor. Angry bondholders
blame simple greed.

   Youssef Davoudian, 66 years old and
fighting cancer, moved from West Germany to California for
expensive, specialized treatment in an attempt to save his life.
   He put all his savings in a local savings bank, Lincoln Savings
and Loan _ the one with a profile of Abe Lincoln on the doorknobs.
He told the tellers it was for his cancer treatments, and the
tellers told him the money was as safe as it could be.
   But they didn't tell him the whole story. What he thought was a
secure, insured account turned out to be a risky junk bond in a
high-flying Arizona real estate developer, now bankrupt. Davoudian
lost $50,000 _ almost all he had.
   Stuck in a foreign country without insurance and so broke he had
to sell his car, Davoudian wonders how he'll pay for his next
treatments, how he'll survive.
   ``I guess I'll do what other poor people in America do, whatever
that is,'' Davoudian said. ``Now I know they cheated me 100
percent. But who can help me?''
   His is a cry repeated across Southern California these days,
where the speculative tactics of the now-failed Lincoln Savings,
its Arizona-based parent company and its chairman have left more
than 22,000 depositors, two-thirds of them elderly, short $200
million in life savings.
   Some can't afford nursing homes now. Some have lost their own
homes. Some even blame heart attacks and thoughts of suicide on
Lincoln.
   Albert Boszak, 69, lost $110,000 and can't pay for his wife's
surgery. Pat Gorman lost $50,000 and had to take in a boarder to
make ends meet. Sam Epstein, 77, saw $42,000, set aside for his
grandchildren's education, wiped out.
   Duk Yun, 65, saved $195,000 from his cleaning business. It's all
gone.
   ``I have always told my children that this adopted country of
mine was made of honest and blessed people,'' the Korean native
said. ``Now it seems I have inadvertently lied to my children.''
   What makes the plight of Yun and the others unique is that they
are, in a sense, among the first ordinary, everyday victims of the
nation's S&amp;L crisis. Except for stockholders or other investors in
S&amp;Ls themselves, federal deposit insurance has protected most
depositors from the widespread debacles and, in some cases,
outright fraud.
   ``This one (Lincoln) was more heartless than the rest. Others
just robbed the entire public at large,'' said Ronald Rus, an
attorney representing some of the 22,000, including a blind woman
who took a bus to the bank and was sold the bonds.
   The investors say they thought they were putting their money in
safe certificates of deposit at Lincoln Savings, a 29-branch thrift
where deposits were insured by the federal government.
   Instead of insured CDs, what they really bought were
high-yielding subordinated debentures _ ``junk bonds'' _ in
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., a
Phoenix-based real estate developer run by Charles Keating Jr.
   In April, American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection
and suspended interest payments on the bonds, now in default.
Federal regulators then took control of Lincoln, which they say may
prove to be the biggest S&amp;L failure ever, costing the government
$2.5 billion.
   Regulators said CD holders were protected by deposit insurance;
bondholders were on their own.
   Since the bondholders are at the end of the line in bankruptcy
court, experts say their paper is virtually worthless.
   Keating and other American Continental officers declined comment
for this story because of pending lawsuits over the losses. In the
past Keating has denied doing anything wrong. He blamed federal
regulators for what he called harassment.
   The House Banking Committee wants to know more and voted last
week to subpoena Keating, along with federal and California state
thrift regulators, to testify at hearings on Lincoln's problems.
   In an interview, American Continental spokesman Brad Boland said
the firm's ``whole goal is to reorganize and pay off the
bondholders.''
   Back in the heady, rapid-growth days, Lincoln lobbies were
filled with signs touting the bonds, which paid about 2 percentage
points above CDs and were sold in denominations as little as $1,000.
   Lincoln tellers tried to steer customers to the bonds,
bondholders say. Sales calls were placed to Lincoln depositors
shortly before large CDs were up for renewal.
   The bonds weren't insured, underwritten by a brokerage house or
even traded on an open market like other junk bonds.
   They were supposed to be sold only by American Continental
employees stationed at Lincoln branches, but some investors say
Lincoln tellers sold them the bonds. Interest could be deposited
right into Lincoln savings accounts.
   ``They said this is our mother company and it's as good as
Lincoln Savings, and it's got billions of dollars in assets,'' said
Achille DeSio, who deposited his $25,000 lump-sum pension in the
bonds.
   ``They never told me it was not insured. I've been very prudent
all my life. I don't risk money.''
   DeSio said he wasn't given a prospectus _ which does say the
bonds were uninsured _ until weeks after the sale.
   But bondholders who did ask specifically if the bonds were
covered by federal deposit insurance say they never were told,
``No.''
   ``They said Lincoln Savings backed the bonds. They said the bank
would have to fail, and the bank is insured by the government,''
said Harold Rosenberg, a Van Nuys attorney who invested $100,000.
   Lincoln and American Continental shared the same red, white and
blue logo, and bondholders said Lincoln went out of its way to show
the savings bank and ACC were one and the same. American
Continental representatives sometimes went behind the counter to
help cash checks when lines grew long.
   Some customers were allowed to transfer CDs that had not yet
matured to the bonds _ without the penalty for early withdrawal.
Some even said Lincoln tellers offered to come to their house to
pick up a check for the bonds.
   ``There was such a commingling of efforts that you didn't know
where Lincoln ended and American Continental started,'' said
Rosenberg.
   Bondholders and attorneys say they believe Lincoln targeted the
elderly.
   ``It was simply a case of a greedy man who thought he could
defraud and deceive the elderly,'' said Leah Kane, a bondholder who
has organized a group of 200 at Leisure World, a giant retirement
community outside Los Angeles.
   ``Scams come into Leisure World and we hear about them all the
time,'' she said. ``Scams don't usually come in through the banks.''

   Stock prices were mixed today as the market
absorbed the news of a jump in the producer price index.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 11 to 7 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 351 up, 555
down and 536 unchanged.
   But the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.48 to
2,763.32 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.13 million shares in the
first half hour of trading.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September,
abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months.
   In theory at least, the news seemed to dampen hopes for any
action soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   However, analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been
widely expected in the financial world.
   Economists also said they believed that much of the increase
stemmed from temporary influences that didn't necessarily portend
more bad news on inflation in the months ahead.
   Among actively traded blue chips, McDonald's rose [ to 30; Exxon
gained \ to 46|; Philip Morris dropped \ to 44[, and USX was down \
at 37[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .02 to 196.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .33 at 395.34.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.52 to
2,759.84, bringing its loss over the last three trading days to
31.57 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 535 up, 894 down and 518 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 160.12 million shares, against 164.07
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School said today it would replace a plaque honoring indicted
junk-bond financier Michael Milken that was stolen from its alumni
``hall of fame.''
   The photograph of the 1979 Wharton graduate, who was indicted in
March on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud, was reported missing
Tuesday. Campus police said they believe the photograph was stolen
during the weekend.
   Wharton spokeswoman Denise Portner said today the school will
replace the plaque ``as soon as possible.''
   Milken in June as head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s ``junk''
bond division, where he was credited with revolutionizing the
market for the high-yield debt securities used widely during the
1980s takeover boom.
   Wharton advisory board co-chairman George Walker said he thought
the plaque was stolen by students.
   ``I certainly imagine that there are some students who would be
happy to have a picture of Michael Milken hanging on their wall,''
Walker said.
   Other alumni honored at Wharton include entrepreneur Donald
Trump, media magnate Walter Annenberg and Supreme Court Justice
William Brennan.
   Drexel is the Wall Street firm that in September pleaded guilty
to six counts of securities-law violations and agreed to pay a
record $650 million in fines and penalties.
   A broader indictment against Milken, his brother, Lowell, and
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader Bruce L. Newberg is
expected to be filed by the government soon. The three have pleaded
innocent and a March trial is scheduled.

   Stock prices showed little change today as the

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 459 up, 658 down and

   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of

   In theory at least, the news seemed to dampen hopes for any
action soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   However, analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been
widely expected in the financial world.

<HEAD>AMR Reportedly Looking for Help from Pilots, Bass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp. remained silent today on a $7 billion
proposed buyout by New York developer Donald Trump amid reports the
parent of American Airlines is seeking help from unions and
billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Meanwhile in Washington, a hearing is scheduled Monday before
the House Public Works and Transportation Committee on legislation
proposed this week that would give the government more authority to
review airline buyouts.
   In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR was
up $3.625 a share to $102.375, still well below the $120 per share
offered by Trump, but the second straight day of an increase.
   On Thursday, AMR rose $1.625 to close at $98.75 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands. On Wednesday, the price had fallen $4.25 a
share.
   Financial analysts have said the stock will continue to trade
far below the level of Trump's offer until there is a significant
move by either side.
   The New York Times reported today that AMR Chairman Robert L.
Crandall met with American's pilots union about a possible
employee-management buyout designed to fend off Trump's offer. The
buyout would include significant participation by the pilots union
and the unions representing Machinists and flight attendants at
American, the Times said.
   Pilots union officials did not return calls seeking comment. The
other two unions previously have said they have discussed possible
responses to the Trump offer.
   The Times, quoting an unidentified Wall Street source, said the
AMR buyout would be similar to a pending pilot-management bid for
UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
   Previous reports have said the pilots at American were asked
prior to Trump's bid to study a possible buyout.
   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that aides
to Bass had indicated the secretive investor might be willing to
help AMR fend off Trump. Bass officials refused to comment on the
report.
   AMR, parent of the nation's largest and most profitable airline,
has remained silent on Trump's offer since it was revealed Oct. 5,
saying it will respond ``in due course.'' The next scheduled
meeting of the board of directors is Oct. 18.
   Trump officials said Thursday there ``is nothing new to
report.'' On Wednesday, Trump attorney Jack Nusbaum said there had
been no contact between the two sides. Trump's offer is set to
expire Oct. 20.
   AMR, while refusing to discuss its own proposed takeover, said
Thursday it had asked the Department of Transportation ``to make
fundamental changes'' in the air service agreement between the
United States and Britain before allowing British Airways PLC to
participate in a leveraged buyout of UAL.
   Under the proposed $6.75 billion buyout, British Airways would
end up with 15 percent of Chicago-based UAL, while employees would
own 75 percent and management 10 percent.
   British Airways shareholders voted in London today to approve
the airline's 15 percent stake in UAL, which would cost it $750
million.
   AMR said the UAL deal ``represents a unilateral opening of U.S.
aviation markets.''
   AMR spokesman Al Becker said the company believes the U.S.
government should require Britain to ease access to its markets for
U.S. carriers.
   Becker said American has been stymied in its efforts to launch
Chicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because ``the British
government is one of the most restrictive in the world'' in
allowing foreign carriers access to its markets.

<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices moved slightly higher in
early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, today while corn and
soybean futures firmed after opening lower in reaction to the
Agriculture Department's latest crop report.
   The government's new crop estimates for corn and soybeans came
in higher than expected at 7.45 billion bushels and 1.93 billion
bushels respectively.
   The 1989 wheat-crop estimate of 2.04 billion bushels was below
expectations, as was the government's projection that U.S. wheat
stocks would total 443 million bushels next May 31, the end of the
current marketing year, compared with 698 million bushels at the
end of the 1988-89 marketing year.
   ``If there was a surprise in the report, it was probably in the
wheat,'' said Walter Spilka, grain market analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``Those wheat stocks are
fairly tight.''
   The corn market's losses were limited by buying linked to the
USDA's announcement late Thursday of a sale of 100,000 metric tons
of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.08{ a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.34 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with December at $1.40{
a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2\ cents lower with November
at $5.51{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .30 cent higher with October at
73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .58 cent higher
with October at 83.47 cents a pound; live hoggs were .22 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with October at 48.80 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .60 cent to 1.05 cents higher with February at 50.65
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures were
higher, led by gains of 2 cents, the permitted daily limit, in the
pork-belly market.

<HEAD>Mortgage-Backed Securities High Fliers This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top-performing fixed-income investments for
the first nine months of the year were mortgage-backed securities,
Salomon Brothers Inc. says, but these tricky investments aren't for
everyone.
   Mortgage-backed securities are bond-like investments derived
from the monthly payments made on home mortgages.
   These securities offer high yields and are considered extremely
safe, but they have disadvantages. Among them are an uncertain rate
of repayment of an investor's money and an inexact maturity date.
   That's because homeowners don't always make mortgage payments at
a predictable rate, especially if the mortgages have an adjustable
rate pegged to market interest rates.
   When interest rates rise, homeowners may slow down payments;
when they fall, they may speed them up or refinance, meaning a
security tied to their mortgages could be paid off sooner than the
projected maturity.
   ``You get your money back early when you don't want it early and
you get it back late when you don't want it back late,'' said
Michael Stein, a financial planner at the Chicago investment
adviser Brownson Rehmus &amp; Foxworth.
   When a security pays off sooner than expected, the investor is
forced to come up with a new place to put the money that will earn
a competitive rate of interest. That may be impossible when
interest rates are declining.
   Mortgage-backed securities were introduced by the Government
National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, in 1970. Ginnie Mae,
like its cousins Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ``buys'' mortgage
portfolios from savings and loans, which gives the thrifts more
money to loan out. In turn, Ginnie Mae repackages these mortgages
and sells them to investors.
   Here's how it works: When Mrs. Jones makes a monthly mortgage
payment to Anytown Savings and Loan, the cash is funneled by the
thrift to Ginnie Mae. This semi-autonomous government agency then
passes along the cash _ after taking a cut _ to the buyer of the
mortgage-backed security.
   According to Salomon, the total return of mortgage-backed
securities _ interest payments plus any price appreciation _
outdistanced all other fixed-income investments such as corporate
and Treasury bonds from January to September, despite an increase
in mortgage issues coming to the market.
   The main reason the increased supply failed to depress the price
of these securities was that investment houses are tailoring these
investments to the needs of particular investors, said Salomon
analyst Judy Otterman.
   ``The ability to move these securities to new buyers was key,''
she said.
   The chief type of repackaged mortgage-backed security is called
a collateralized mortgage obligation, or CMO.
   CMOs also are backed by the cash flow from a pool of mortgages.
But unlike traditional mortgage-backed securities, the CMO pool is
much larger and is divided into different payment ``streams,'' with
a separate security tied to each of these cash flows from the
mortgages.
   CMOs are structured so that they have a fixed coupon like a
bond, meaning they make stable interest payments to the investor.
By contrast, interest payments on traditional mortgage-backed
securities are not as predictable.
   CMOs also are structured according to various maturities, so an
investor may buy one according to how long he wants to lock up his
money and where he thinks interest rates are headed. All of them
have maturities shorter than the 30 years of a Ginnie Mae.
   The repayment of a CMO investor's principal still is affected by
the rate of payments made on the underlying mortgages, but the
volatility isn't as great as with traditional mortgage-backed
securities because the mortgage pool is much larger.
   Mortgage-backed securities are bought primarily by institutional
investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, but
increasingly they are attracting individual investors, particularly
for tax-sheltered retirement or pension accounts, according to the
investment firm Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman.
   One reason mortgage-backed securities are not more attractive to
individuals is their cost. Most are packaged in units of $25,000,
although on the secondary market issues that have been around
awhile and already repaid some of their principal may be bought for
half that much, said Brian Hays, a senior vice president at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   An easier and cheaper way for individual investors to get into
the mortgage-backed market is through mutual funds that specialize
in them.
   Brian Mattes, a spokesman for mutual-fund operator Vanguard
Group, said Vanguard's mortgage-backed fund has been a popular
place to put money from Individual Retirement Accounts, but its
high yield may attract other investors.
   Vanguard's mortgage-backed fund has yielded 9.30 percent in
recent days, while its Treasury bond fund yielded 8.06 percent.
This additional yield may make up for the potential of a decline in
an investor's holding due to early payments made on the underlying
mortgages, Mattes said.

<HEAD>Intel Third Quarter Net Income Down Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Semiconductor maker Intel Corp.
Friday reported its profit in the third quarter dropped to about
half of the year-ago amount, depressed by a one-time charge related
to the end of a joint venture.
   The computer chip maker reported that net income for the third
quarter ended Sept. 30 was $72 million, or 38 cents per share,
compared to $143 million, or 78 cents per share, for the same three
months last year.
   Revenue totaled $771 million for the third quarter, down
slightly from $785 million a year ago.
   The Silicon Valley company said in a news release that the net
income figures ``reflect a previously announced $35 million charge
against pre-tax income for anticipated costs'' associated with
Intel's plans to end a computer systems venture with Siemens AG.
The charge reduced earnings per share by 12 cents for the quarter.
   For the first nine months of the year, Intel, based in Santa
Clara, Calif., said it earned $268 million, or $1.43 a share, down
about 27 percent from $367 million, or $2.05 a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue came to $2.2 billion through September of this year,
compared to $2.1 billion through the first nine months of 1988.

<HEAD>Pulitzer Posts 2.6 Percent Profit Pickup Despite Virtually Flat Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Publishing Co. Friday posted a 2.6
percent increase in its profit for the third quarter, which the
media company said reflected cost-cutting and debt reduction
efforts.
   Revenue edged up just 0.2 percent for the quarter, which ended
Sept. 30, and would have declined slightly if not not for one-time
gains related to the company's conversion from independent
newspaper carriers to a contract delivery system in St. Louis.
   Pulitzer's net income came to $3.21 million, or 31 cents a
share, compared to $3.13 million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988's
third quarter.
   Revenue for the quarter amounted to $94.61 million, up from
$94.41 million for the same period a year ago.
   ``Despite a soft advertising market in the publishing and
broadcasting industries during the third quarter, we continued to
benefit from our debt reduction and cost-control efforts,''
Chairman Joseph Pulitzer Jr. said in a news release.
   He said the company decreased its net interest expense by
$503,000 in the quarter as compared to the same period a year
earlier.
   For the first nine months of this year, Pulitzer reported
after-tax earnings of$13.18 million, or $1.26 a share, up nearly 10
percent from $11.99 million, or $1.15 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue through three quarters of 1989 was $292 million, a gain
of about 2.5 percent from the prior year's $285 million.
   Pulitzer publishes two metropolitan daily newspapers, the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch and the Arizona Daily Star in Tuscon, Ariz.,
and newspapers and shoppers in the Chicago area.
   The company also owns television stations in seven states and
two radio stations in Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices shot up 0.9 percent in
September, fueled by a sharp rise in energy costs, the government
said today.
   The climb last month in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index wiped out consecutive price declines of 0.4 percent in August
and July and 0.1 percent in June.
   The September reversal brought the annual wholesale inflation
rate for the first nine months of the year to 5.1 percent and
marked a return to the high inflation of the early part of the year.
   Although wholesale inflation is not nearly as bad as feared
after prices advanced at a 10.1 percent annual rate in the first
quarter, it is still significantly higher than the 4.0 percent rate
posted in all of 1988.
   Contributing to the big September jump was a statistical glitch
in the measurement of auto prices, which were skewed because
manufacturers offered their end-of-the-model-year price incentives
earlier in the summer than usual.
   When month-to-month increases were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations, auto prices rose 3.8 percent in September. When
seasonal adjustments are factored out, auto prices actually
declined 0.5 percent.
   ``We were due for a big rebound ... after several months of
declines,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``... I
would not be particularly alarmed about this one-month spike up
given the seasonal effect in autos and the spike in energy, which
will probably be a one-time event.''
   The stock market at first showed little reaction to the news as
well as to a separate report showing stronger-than-expected retail
sales last month. But by noon, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks fell 19.88 points to 2739.96. Traders interpreted
the reports as a sign the Federal Reserve would not soon lower
interest rates.
   According to a Labor Department analyst, roughly 0.8 percentage
points of the 0.9 percent monthly rise in the inflation index was
attributable to motor vehicles and energy.
   Energy prices, which had fallen in June, July and August, shot
up 6.5 percent last month. Fuel oil rose 16.3 percent; gasoline,
10.6 percent, and natural gas, 3.4 percent.
   In good news, the department said food prices dropped 0.6
percent. Vegetables were down 16.1 percent; turkeys, 4.9 percent;
pasta, 4.4 percent; and beef, 4.0 percent. Prices for pork, fish,
fruit and rice also fell.
   Excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories,
prices rose 0.7 percent in September following a 0.5 percent
increase in August.
   The cost of home furnishings, health products, magazines, floor
coverings, tobacco and alcoholic beverages all rose.
   In another economic report today, the Commerce Department said
retail sales rose 0.5 percent in September, the seventh consecutive
month without a decline. Overall sales increased to a seasonally
adjusted $145.2 billion last month following a 0.7 percent gain in
August and a revised 0.7 percent rise in July.
   The 0.9 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index left
it at 113.5, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing
$100 in 1982 would have cost $113.50 last month. In advance, many
economists were predicting a 0.7 percent or 0.8 percent rise.
   The return of wholesale inflation in September was likely to
dampen financial market speculation that the Federal Reserve Board
would soon lower interest rates.
   Traders had been hoping the central bank would cut rates to curb
the rise in the value of the dollar, which is hurting U.S. chances
to improve its trade deficit.
   However, in a speech at a conference in Washington on Thursday
night, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson said, ``We have to focus
our attention in monetary policy on domestic inflationary
implications.''
   The inflation news was not particularly encouraging in September
measures of prices earlier in the production process. Intermediate
goods rose 0.4 percent after three successive drops and crude goods
jumped 1.1 percent. Examples of the three processing stages _
finished, intermediate and crude _ are bread, flour and wheat.
   The Federal Reserve in recent months has been walking a
tightrope, hoping to keep interest rates high enough to dampen
inflationary pressures but low enough to avoid a recession, said
Washington economic consultant Michael K. Evans.
   The Fed fought inflationary pressures through this spring by
driving short-term interest rates up. Then, after signs of economic
softness emerged, the central bank eased a bit in June and July.
But it has since held steady as a string of economic reports
portrayed a resilient economy.
   Last week, in the first broad look at economic activity in
September, the Labor Department reported manufacturing lost 103,000
jobs _ the biggest drop in seven years _ as the unemployment rate
edged up from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent.
   Many analysts took the report as a sign of renewed weakness,
possibly giving the Fed room to lower interest rates further. But
Evans said the Fed is still concerned that inflation is too high.
   ``The Fed is going to say `If there are signs of softness,
that's too bad. Our first priority is to beat back inflation,''' he
said.

<HEAD>Citrus Crop Estimates Down Due to Cold Snap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold snap that damaged tender orange and
grapefruit blooms last winter may set back the citrus industry's
recovery from tree-killing freezes in the mid 1980s, agriculture
officials said.
   State forecasters Thursday estimated Florida will harvest 130
million boxes of oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit this
season. It would be the smallest orange crop in three years and the
smallest grapefruit crop in five years.
   The drop is attributed to a three-day dip in temperatures that
hurt blooms last February but did not damage fruit on the trees.
   ``The good news is that the trees themselves were not damaged by
the cold,'' said Harry Whittaker, citrus statistician with the
Florida Agricultural Statistics Service in Orlando. ``So if we get
through this winter, we should have a good crop next year.''
   During the season that ended in July, Florida harvested 146.6
million boxes of oranges and 54.8 million boxes of grapefruit worth
an estimated $1.41 billion. A record $1.44 billion citrus crop was
harvested the previous season.
   The joint state and federal crop reporting service uses a
combination of surveys and computer models to make the crop
forecasts.
   Major freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed about 200,000 acres of
trees, most in Central Florida.
   ``I personally thought it would be a few more boxes, but it's a
good estimate on both oranges and grapefruit,'' said Bill
Youngblood, an Orange County citrus grower and processor. ``It's
good for prices, particularly on grapefruit.''
   Although smaller crops generally increase prices, a record
orange crop in Brazil estimated at 300 million boxes could keep
domestic juice prices down, officials said. More than 90 percent of
Florida's orange crop is converted to juice.
   John Jackson, citrus specialist with the Lake County
Agricultural Extension Service, said the orange forecast was at
least 20 million boxes smaller than he was anticipating.
   ``I wouldn't second-guess them,'' Jackson told The Orlando
Sentinel. ``Based on their track record and their computer models,
they're generally pretty accurate.''
   The smaller orange crop means that the state should produce
about 149.8 million gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice,
down from 175 million gallons in 1988-1989, according to estimates
by the Lakeland-based Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest
growers' organization.
   ``If we escape this season with no serious freezes in the citrus
belt, the 1990-91 crop should be the best we've had in many
years,'' said Bobby McKown, Mutual's executive vice president.
   The Florida Department of Citrus, a state agency that promotes
the industry with money collected from grower fees, also may have
to cut its $72.4 million budget as a result of the smaller crop,
said spokeswoman Cathy Clay.
   ``We're a little disappointed in the crop sizes, but we have
every confidence that the industry is still on the road to recovery
from the earlier freezes,'' Ms. Clay said.
   A box of oranges weighs 90 pounds, and a box of grapefruit is 85
pounds.

   Senate leaders today agreed on a plan to strip
hundreds of special-interest provisions from a $14.1 billion
deficit-reduction bill, leaving partisan fights over a capital
gains tax cut and other controversial issues for the future.
   Republican and Democratic leaders were attempting to sell the
agreement to their respective members, which if successful would
ease the way for completion of the budget-cutting bill later in the
day.
   ``We think this is absolutely the best approach,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said the deal would allow the Senate to pass ``a
stripped-down bill, I mean really stripped.''
   Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
finance panel, said, ``This ensures we will have another tax bill
very soon _ two or three weeks.''
   He said a capital gains tax cut, a Democratic plan to expand
Individual Retirement Accounts and other proposals could be
attached to that tax measure.
   Across-the-board spending cuts on government programs totaling
$16 billion will take effect Monday unless the Senate finishes its
deficit-reduction bill, the House and Senate agree to a compromise
version and President Bush signs it into law.
   The House previously passed its own $11 billion deficit-cutting
bill loaded with special-interest provisions of its own.
   With House members out of town until next week, it seems
unlikely that a compromise bill can be completed until then. If the
automatic cuts take effect, they can be rolled back by Congress
later.
   Earlier today, Bush told reporters that while ``mixing capital
gains and IRAs in this debate is troublesome to me,'' he would let
Republicans on Capitol Hill find the solution to a dispute that has
slowed work on a $14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill.
   Asked if he was ruling out accepting broader IRAs, he said, ``I
am not ruling out anything in that regard. I am ruling in capital
gains.''
   The leaders worked out the deal as the Senate headed into a
second day of debate on the budget-cutting measure, which has drawn
criticism from members of both parties for being loaded with
provisions for special interests that do little to shrink the
deficit.
   Republicans, with support from some Democrats, have been
threatening to offer an amendment reducing the capital gains tax, a
top priority of Bush. But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters Thursday ``without a doubt'' he would
prevent the GOP from getting the 60 votes it needs.
   ``We're going to offer it every chance we have,'' including
putting it on the deficit-reduction bill, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., told reporters.
   The budget-cutting legislation, aimed at whittling the deficit
to below $110 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, took
its share of abuse Thursday from lawmakers who said it was stocked
with unnecessary items.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., whose
panel sent the legislation to the Senate floor Thursday on a 9-7
vote, said the 1,376-page measure would be only 100 pages long if
extraneous provisions were removed from it.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., hefted the bill, which he said
weighed 12 pounds, 15 ounces.
   ``I don't think there's a single senator who has more or less a
general idea about what is in this legislation,'' he complained.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, cited some language he said had little
to do with reducing the federal budget shortfall: ``strike
`eggplants' and substitute, `eggplants, kiwi fruits, nectarines and
plums,''' he read.
   The first amendment the Senate approved Thursday boosted
hospital spending by $40 million.
   The legislation would raise $5.3 billion in mostly minor new tax
increases, including a doubling of the current $3 tax charged to
departing international airline passengers and a new tax on
chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone. It also makes
permanent the 3 percent tax on long-distance and local telephone
service that otherwise would expire next year.
   The measure raises $50 million by requiring boat owners to
purchase decals and $239 million by forcing airlines to pay for
using airports in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
   It would save $3.1 billion under Medicare by reducing payments
to hospitals, freezing reimbursement rates for doctors and limiting
increases in other medical costs.
   The bill takes credit for nearly $1.8 billion in savings merely
by moving the money-losing Postal Service off-budget, and $420
million more by postponing some agriculture payments until a later
fiscal year.
   Other provisions have little to do with eliminating budgetary
red ink. Federal child care efforts are beefed up and a Commission
on Child Disability is established.

   Share prices closed modestly lower Friday, pulled
down by a report of higher inflation and a sharp drop on Wall
Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most
closely watched market barometer, settled well off the day's high
at 2,233.9, down 3.9 points or 0.17 percent.
   The index finished the week 1.9 percent off its week-earlier
close of 2,277.5.
   Wall Street's sharp drop, reportedly on a wave of program
selling, helped spark the retreat of buying interest, which dealers
said was already shaken by a report of unexpectedly high British
retail inflation.
   Retail prices were up 7.6 percent in September compared with a
year ago, and vs. 7.3 percent in August, the government reported.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 0.3 points higher at
1,818.0. Volume was 457.7 million shares traded, up slightly from
Thursday's equally modest 437.4 million shares.
   The Financial Times 500 index closed at 1,240.40, down 1.57.

   Stock prices slumped again today as the market
absorbed the news of a jump in the producer price index.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 23.16 points to
2,736.68 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 377 up,
1,040 down and 472 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a
series of declines through the summer months.
   At first, the market took the news with little evident concern.
Analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been widely
expected in the financial world.
   Economists also said they believed that much of the increase
stemmed from temporary influences that didn't necessarily portend
more bad news on inflation in the months ahead.
   However, the figures still were taken as a message that the
Federal Reserve wouldn't be very likely to take any steps soon to
relax its credit policy.
   That concern was reinforced by a separate report of an
unexpectedly strong 0.5 percent gain in retail sales last month.
   Aristech Chemical climbed 4] to 21} in active trading. The
company said it received a $25-a-share takeover proposal from a
group including investor Jon M. Huntsman.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1 at
43]; International Business Machines, down } at 106~; Eastman
Kodak, down | at 46], and Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1} at 127}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.65 to 195.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.66 at 393.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 117.46 million shares with two

<HEAD>Exhort Japan to Reverse `Strong Feeling of Inequality' on Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills urged Japan
Friday to scrap what she called discriminatory, anti-competitive
trade practices and said Tokyo must work with Washington to
overcome U.S. frustration with the Japanese.
   ``Anti-competitive practices, whether official or private, run
counter to the world we seek, and to the world that brought Japan
its prosperity,'' Mrs. Hills told reporters at the Japan National
Press Club.
   ``There is a strong feeling of inequality _ where the American
market is open but markets overseas are closed, where the overseas
investor buys stocks, bonds, businesses (in America), but Americans
cannot do so overseas,'' she said. ``We must work together to bring
down that feeling of frustration.''
   Mrs. Hills arrived in Tokyo from South Korea Thursday for a
four-day visit and met later with Construction Minister Shozo
Harada.
   On Friday, Mrs. Hills told Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that she
hopes for a ``quiet, friendly resolution'' to trade problems
between the two countries, Foreign Ministry officials said.
   She told the Japanese leader she hoped Japan would implement by
November measures to liberalize its construction market, and
increase imports of American satellites, supercomputers and
forestry products.
   Kaifu said he was working hard to get Japan to import more U.S.
products and noted that Japanese imports from the United States
last year rose $10 billion over 1987, ministry officials said.
   In her speech Mrs. Hills criticized Japan for what she described
as unfair business practices such as Japanese firms' alleged habit
of buying only from Japanese suppliers, and discrimination against
foreign investors.
   She said she was happy that a joint venture between McDonalds
Japan and an American toy retailer to set up shop in this country
was likely to be approved by the Japanese government within two
years, but added, ``even two years is a long time compared to no
wait at all when a foreign investor wishes to open a large store in
the United States.''
   The tough-talking ex-attorney also criticized a practice called
``patent flooding'' in which certain firms apply for so many
patents that competitors cannot easily market rival products.
   Asked about a public opinion poll conducted in the United States
earlier this month by the Gallup Organization that showed more
Americans thought Japan's economic strength was a greater threat to
the United States than the Soviet military, Mrs. Hills said, ``I
don't see Japanese economic power as a threat. It's a wonderful
accomplishment. But I see the destruction of the world trading
system as a threat.''

<TEXT>
   The National Broadcasting Co. has
expressed an interest in joining Qintex Australia Ltd. in a bid for
the historic MGM-UA Communications Co. film and TV studio.
   But MGM-UA spokeswoman Mary Stevens Hardy and Qintex spokesman
Dan Saks declined comment Friday on whether MGM-UA and Qintex,
whose $1.5 billion merger collapsed Monday, were renegotiating the
deal.
   However, a source close to the transaction, who asked not to be
identified, said no formal talks had taken place and that if
contacts had taken place, they were extremely tentative.
   NBC spokesman Joseph Rutledge said Qintex had approached NBC
with a proposal to become a participant in their bid for MGM-UA and
``we were interested.''
   Rutledge wouldn't say how much NBC had been asked to chip in,
nor would he disclose plans to cope with federal rules that
restrict the major networks' role in owning or distributing
programming to local TV stations.
   NBC owns the NBC Television Network and NBC's chairman and chief
executive, Robert C. Wright, has been a vocal opponent of the
so-called financial interest and syndication rules, calling them an
outmoded restriction on the networks.
   Qintex first bid for MGM-UA last spring in a complicated deal
that would have resulted in it paying about $600 million for some
assets.
   Three weeks ago, media magnate Rupert Murdoch stepped in with a
last-minute, $1.4 billion bid for the entire company, but Qintex
topped that by bidding $25 a share, or $1.5 billion.
   MGM-UA's principal shareholder, Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk
Kerkorian, accepted and the deal was to have become final Dec. 15.
But the agreement collapsed Monday after MGM-UA charged Qintex with
failing to deliver a $50 million letter of credit, a nonrefundable
down payment.
   MGM-UA has filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles against
Qintex seeking at least $50 million in damages.

<HEAD>Soybeans Drop to New 23-Month Lows, Grain Markets Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bearish crop report and forecasts for a weekend
of good harvesting weather triggered a late plunge in soybean
futures prices to new 23-month lows Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower, following the soybean market
down as the trading day ended.
   The Agriculture Department's new crop estimates for corn and
soybeans were higher than expected at 7.45 billion bushels and 1.93
billion bushels respectively in a report released after Thursday's
close.
   A higher-than-expected wheat-crop estimate of 2.04 billion
bushels held traders' attention for most of the day, supporting the
wheat futures and keeping the corn and soybean markets from falling.
   But when some of the big players started selling soybeans near
the close, others rushed to join them and soybeans for November
delivery fell rapidly below $5.50 a bushel to the market's lowest
close since at least Nov. 11, 1987.
   Although the crop report didn't precipitate a major decline in
the soybean market at the opening, ``a combination of that and
other seasonal factors led to some pressure in the second half to
the session,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   At the close, soybeans were 2 cents to 9} cents lower with the
November contract at $5.45 a bushel; wheat futures were 5 cents
lower to { cent higher with December at $4.06} a bushel; corn
futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.34\
a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with December at $1.40\
a bushel.

   Common Cause today asked the Senate Ethics
Committee to investigate the activities of five senators who
intervened on behalf of a California savings institution after
receiving large campaign contributions from its owner.
   At the same time, the group called on the Justice Department to
determine whether Charles H. Keating Jr. and the savings and loan
association he heads violated federal election laws.
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
eventually collapsed and was seized by the government in April.
Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to
protect the institution's depositors.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a self-styled
citizen's lobby, called for ethics committee investigations of five
senators who met with regulators in April 1987 at the request of
Keating, chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent.
   The five are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   McCain and DeConcini today pledged their full cooperation with
any probe. McCain, in letters to the ethics panel and Justice
Department, added, ``I am fully confident that I engaged in no
unethical conduct.''
   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said the senator met with
regulators only to urge them to bring their lengthy examination of
Lincoln to a conclusion, not to influence its outcome.
   The other senators' offices did not respond immediately to
requests for comment.
   Common Cause, along with Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., requested
the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the
downfall of former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Wright was also accused of intervening with regulators on behalf
of S&amp;L owners, but Wertheimer said, ``I think we have a different
case, different circumstances.''
   After three years of examinations and audits, regulators seized
Lincoln on April 14. Last month, they filed a $1.1 billion civil
lawsuit charging Keating, his family and associates with fraud and
racketeering. Among the allegations are that Keating diverted money
from Lincoln to fund his personal, political and charitable
convictions.
   All five senators received campaign contributions from Keating.
Riegle, now chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned his
a year later and DeConcini last month.
   Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should appoint a
special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the
Code of Ethics for Government Service that prohibits members of
Congress from accepting ``favors or benefits under circumstances
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the
performance of governmental duties.''
   In a letter today, he asked Gerald E. McDowell, chief of the
Justice Department's public integrity section, to determine whether
Keating's contribution to the senators violated federal election
laws or other statutes.
   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee, in preparation for four
public hearings on the case, voted Thursday to subpoena Keating.
   ``We already know that in Lincoln we have on our hands a case
that will cost the savings an loan insurance fund at least $2
billion,'' House banking panel chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez said
in a statement. ``This committee ... is required to determine what
went wrong within the regulatory agencies.''
   Also subpoenaed Thursday by the House panel were L. William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; M. Danny
Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision; William
Crawford, California savings and loan commissioner, and other
officials.
   The hearings are expected to focus on why Wall, as the nation's
top S&amp;L regulator, delayed action from mid-1987 until April on a
recommendation from field examiners that the government take
control of Lincoln.
   The panel, on a 41-0 vote, approved the subpoenas, legal orders
to appear before the committee or produce documents. Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., voted ``present,'' explaining later that he
believed the committee was unfairly creating the impression that
those receiving subpoenas are guilty.
   The banking committee hearings are scheduled for Tuesday and for
Oct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.
   Keating, tentatively scheduled to testify at the last of the
hearings, issued a statement through a spokesman in Washington
saying he had not decided whether to appear voluntarily.
   ``He wants to cooperate with the committee to the maximum extent
possible but in light of the number and complexity of the legal
proceedings in which he is involved, he wants to reflect on this
decision,'' said the spokesman, Leonard Bickwit.
   Gonzalez, D-Texas, noted that Seidman requested subpoenas ``so
that the agency's testimony may be complete and the necessary
documents provided without incurring additional legal risks.''
California regulators made a similar request, he said.
   Gonzalez said the committee did not intend to ``cause
unnecessary problems'' for the lawsuits surrounding Lincoln and
American Continental, but said ``there is no question about the
paramount rights of the legislative branch in this area.''
   Also subpoenaed was Edwin J. Gray, Wall's predecessor, who met
in April 1987 with four senators regarding Keating's complaints he
was being unfairly targeted by regulators. Riegle did not meet with
Gray, but attended a second meeting with officials from the
agency's San Francisco office.

   Stock prices took a sudden nosedive late today,
driving the Dow Jones industrial average down to a loss of 100
points with less than an hour to go before the closing bell.
   At 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow was off just 23 points, but in an hour
the average had plunged 115 points amid news that a
labor-management group failed to secure financing for its buyout of
UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 353 up, 1,138 down
and 429 unchanged.
   The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most
of the session until the group planning to buy UAL said it had run
into trouble arranging financing.
   That quickly cast a pall over shares of UAL and other companies
that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals.
   Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve
among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the
market for high-yielding ``junk'' bonds.
   Earlier, the Labor Department reported that the producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly
reversing a series of declines through the summer months.
   The figures were taken as a message that the Federal Reserve
wouldn't be very likely to take any steps soon to relax its credit
policy.
   That concern was reinforced by a separate report of an
unexpectedly strong 0.5 percent gain in retail sales last month.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.78 to 193.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 2.78 at 392.23.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 143 million shares with an hour
to go.

   Stock prices plunged in a dramatic late selloff
today as news of a failed takeover deal rocked an already slumping
market.
   Shortly before the close, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was down about 180 points, having tumbled below the
2,600 level.
   The market began its precipitous slide after a labor-management
group planning to acquire UAL Corp. said it couldn't get the bank
financing it needed.
   That came as a fresh blow to traders who had already grown
increasingly worried about strains in the market for debt-financed
takeovers and buyouts.

   The American Airlines Political Action
Committee has contributed more than $19,000 this year to the
campaigns of 21 members of a House committee expected to vote
Monday on legislation to forestall Donald Trump's proposed $7.5
billion takeover of the carrier.
   Federal Election Commission records for the first six months of
1989 show that the PAC that represents American Airlines has given
money to the campaigns of nearly two-thirds of the 34 members of
the House aviation subcommittee.
   Chairman James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., has received $5,000 and the
panel's ranking Republican, Rep. William F. Clinger Jr. of
Pennsylvania, has received $350.
   The two, along with Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of
the Public Works and Transportation Committee, ranking Republican
John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, and Rep. Peter A. DeFazio,
D-Ore., are sponsors of airline takeover legislation moving quickly
through the House that would benefit American.
   Anderson, Hammerschmidt and DeFazio have also received American
Airlines PAC contributions this year. The PAC has given members of
the full committee a total of $22,350 in the first six months of
the year.
   Democratic Rep. Pete Geren of Texas, recently elected to fill
the seat vacated by House Speaker Jim Wright, is seeking an
assignment to the panel. He has received $10,000.
   Five members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation
Committee have also received $8,000 this year from the PAC. The
panel has already approved legislation similar to the measure in
the House subcommittee.
   A PAC, separate from the corporation, is funded by voluntary
contributions from company officers, directors, managers and
shareholders.
   Spokesmen for the airline did not immediately return phone calls
Friday to answer questions on the subject.
   The House bill introduced Wednesday would give the
Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any acquisition
of 15 percent or more of the stock of a major air carrier's voting
stock.
   The bill would cover Trump's offer to buy American Airlines'
parent company AMR Corp., which the company is resisting, and the
proposed purchase of UAL Corp., parent of United Air Lines.
   The Senate version, approved in committee last week, sets the
acquisition threshhold at 25 percent of an airline's stock and
gives DOT 90 days to block a takeover.
   An amendment is being drafted that would make the bill
retroactive to Oct. 1, to cover AMR and possibly UAL.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote after it completes work on
legislation to reduce the budget deficit, officials said. The House
aviation subcommittee has scheduled a hearing, followed by a vote,
on Monday, with the Transportation Committee expected to act
Tuesday.
   Sponsors of the House bill had sought a Transportation Committee
vote on their legislation the day after its introduction, but
agreed to allow a hearing in the aviation subcommittee after
several Republicans objected to such a fast-track approach.
   ``This is not a knee-jerk reaction strictly to the American
bid,'' Oberstar spokesman Jim Berard said about the House bill.
   But Oberstar is moving quickly because of the American and
United takeover attempts, Berard said.
   American and United are the largest carriers in the country in
an industry dominated by just a half-dozen airlines, and Oberstar
wants to be sure passenger safety is not compromised by a buyer's
heavy debt, Berard said.
   ``The airlines know he's honest, know where he's coming from,''
Berard said. ``He'll be fair with the airlines, he's not going to
bash them unnecessarily. When public safety is in question he'll
ask the tough questions.''
   Oberstar also received $3,300 from the PAC in 1987-88.
   According to FEC records, the American Airlines PAC in 1987 and
1988 contributed to the campaigns of all but two members of the
House aviation subcommittee, and all but about a dozen of the full
transportation committee.
   The PAC gave $32,150 to House Transportation Committee members
and $11,166 to members of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.

   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks for the first 10 days of the 1990 model year tumbled 12.2
percent compared with the same period last year, mainly because of
declines in General Motors Corp. sales, the companies reported
Friday.
   For Oct. 1-10, GM car sales were off 24.2 percent and its truck
sales were off 28.7 percent from early October of 1988.
   The eight U.S.-based manufacturers said they sold vehicles at an
average daily rate of 30,626, compared with a rate of 34,867 during
the same time last year.
   Car sales for all makers were down 13.1 percent in early October
while truck sales were off 10.4 percent.
   Ford Motor Co.'s early-October car and truck sales were down 0.3
percent and Chrysler Corp.'s sales were off 2.3 percent.
   There had been speculation that fourth-quarter sales this year
would be significantly softer than during the third quarter. In
early October last year, sales were relatively soft compared with
earlier periods and with what proved to be the average annual sales
rate.
   Part of the reason for predictions of a soft fourth quarter was
the expectation that consumers would flock to showrooms to pick up
1989 models to beat the price 990 models.
   It was difficult to determine Friday whether that was a factor
in the decline in sales. There still are 1989 models for sale, some
with attractive rebates and low-interest financing deals.
   Chrysler on Friday announced the average price for its 1990 cars
would be 5 percent more than for 1989 versions. Earlier, Ford
announced an average increase of 4.9 percent, and GM said its 1990
prices would be 3.4 percent higher.
   For the calendar year so far, domestic cars and trucks are
selling at an average daily rate of 38,236, compared with a rate of
38,773 through Oct. 10 last year, a decline of 1.4 percent.
   Car sales for the year are running 2.5 percent behind last
year's pace while truck sales are 0.6 percent ahead.

   Chrysler Corp. on Friday said its
1990 cars would cost an average of 5 percent more than in 1989.
   It was the same increase as Chrysler's pre-introduction prices
announced earlier and the largest price increase among the Big
Three.
   Earlier, Ford Motor Co. announced a 4.9 percent increase and
General Motors Corp. an increase of 3.4 percent.
   Chrysler, like GM and Ford, said about half the price increase
was due to government requirements for air bags or automatic seat
belts for front-seat passengers.
   All of Chrysler's U.S. built cars are equipped with
driver's-side air bags as standard equipment. Chrysler said air
bags accounted for 3 percentage points in the increase.
   ``This modest increase reflects our intention to be price
competitive,'' said Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald.
   Base prices for the No. 3 automaker's 1990 cars range from
$6,995 for the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon hatchback to $25,495
for the Chrysler Imperial.

<HEAD>Plaque Honoring Junk-Bond Financier Michael Milken Stolen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School plans to replace a photograph of indicted junk-bond
financier Michael Milken that was stolen from the school's alumni
Hall of Fame.
   ``We have no idea of how or why it was taken, and no one has
claimed responsibility for taking it,'' Wharton spokeswoman
Margaret Barry said Friday.
   Security guards discovered Tuesday that the photograph,
described as a plaque in the campus newspaper, The Daily
Pennsylvanian, was missing.
   ``It is a photograph in a frame and it will be replaced as soon
as possible,'' she said. ``Mr. Milken was chosen by Wharton
students several years ago to be honored on the wall.''
   Wharton spokeswoman Denise Portner said the school will replace
the photograph ``as soon as possible.''
   Wharton students choose alumni to be honored for outstanding
achievements and contributions to society.
   Among the 17 alumni honored by having their photographs on a
wall of the school are entrepreneur Donald Trump, media magnate
Walter Annenberg, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, CBS
founder William Paley, John Sculley of Apple computers, Robert
Crandall of American Airlines, and beer tycoon August Busch III.
   Milken was indicted in March on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud in connection with his activities with the Wall Street
investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., where he headed the
junk bond division. He has pleaded innocent.
   Milken resigned from Drexel in June after the firm pleaded
guilty to six counts of securities-law violations and agreed to pay
a record $650 million in fines and penalties.
   The trial of Milken and two co-defendents is scheduled to begin
in March.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for first period of October 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 238 selling days so far this year,
compared with 239 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Overall Banking Health Masks Problems In Northeast, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The banking industry's overall profitably is
masking weakness in the Northeast, where real estate loans are
causing increasing problems, industry analyst Alex Sheshunoff said
Friday.
   ``Real estate is often the industry's Achilles' heel,'' he said.
   Sheshunoff singled out New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut
as trouble spots.
   ``I don't think that New England is about to become known as
`Little Texas,''' he said, ``but you're starting to see a replay of
what happened in Texas in some markets in the Northeast.''
   Banking problems have been centered in Texas and the Southwest,
where failures have set records each of the last two years.
Sheshunoff said the worst has passed in that region.
   ``The level of non-performing loans and the return to
profitability indicate that this region is beginning to bottom
out,'' Sheshunoff said. ``We anticipate that the regional economy
and its banks will be climbing back, but not bouncing back.''
   During the first half of the year, three states reported overall
losses: Arizona, $132.3 million; Texas, $98.7 million; and
Louisiana, $31.5 million.''
   Nationally, earnings were $14.1 billion, with 90 percent of the
nation's banks making a profit, Sheshunoff said.
   But those earnings ``do not reflect some underlying problems,
particularly in Northeastern states,'' he said.
   ``Particularly worrisome is the fact that real estate loans have
constituted the fastest growing segment of bank lending not only in
this quarter, but for the past five years,'' Sheshunoff said.
   ``Unfortunately, some of this real estate lending financed
speculative excesses which will take time to be absorbed, often at
significantly reduced prices with resulting loan losses.''
   Just Thursday, two large New York banks reported combined losses
of $1.1 billion in the third quarter. A large portion of the losses
came from increased reserves for loans to Third World nations.
   Included in those losses was $300 million set aside by Chemical
Banking Co. to cover possible losses on non-performing loans _
those three months past due _ at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a
Chemical subsidiary.
   ``In every major bank on the East Coast, there is now somebody
taking a much harder look at their real estate loans and seeing if
they need to increase their reserves,'' said Sheshunoff.
   Sheshunoff said 57.7 percent of all non-performing loans in
Massachusetts were on real estate, 46 percent in Connecticut and
15.4 percent in New York.
   Overall, New York had the largest amount of non-performing loans
at $22.2 billion, reflecting the large concentration of loans to
Third World banks in the money center banks.
   Maine had the largest increase during the first half of the
year, as non-performing loans increased 61.3 percent, followed by
New Hampshire at 56.5 percent and Massachusetts at 44.3 percent.
   ``We're just starting to see some of the effects of the
speculative excesses that have occurred in those regional real
estate markets,'' Sheshunoff said by telephone from his Austin
office. ``In Texas, it's the aftermath; in the Northeast, it's been
really building for the last five years.''

   If you're looking skyward to see whether
American Airlines has Donald Trump's name on it yet or KLM owns
part of Northwest, you may miss those Saab-Fords, GM-Jaguars or
Renault-Volvos barreling down the road.
   Like their transportation counterparts in the air, the
automakers of the world are reaching out to each other to form
strategic relationships that reflect increasingly brutal
competition on the ground.
   These alliances are coming against a backdrop of trouble in the
U.S. car market, by far the most lucrative for any major automaker.
   There are signs that Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. all could report third-quarter losses on North
American automotive operations because of slow sales and costly
incentives aimed at luring buyers. If so, it would be the worst
showing by the Big Three since the 1982 recession.
   Problems in the American market have spilled over to Europe,
where several major automakers are struggling because they aren't
selling as many cars in the United States.
   Aggravating matters for them is the impending relaxation of
trade barriers in the 12-nation Common Market in 1992. This will
make it much easier, for example, to buy a Fiat in France, a
Renault in Italy or a Rover in Spain. That means the makers of
those cars face more competition from their neighbors.
   Moreover, competition from the aggressive Japanese is hurting
both American and European carmakers. Nissan Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. already have well-established
assembly operations in the United States, a response to Detroit's
efforts years ago to restrict foreign imports.
   Toyota said this past week it plans to double vehicle-building
capacity in the United States within the next five years. Toyota
and other Japanese carmakers are now moving quickly to establish
plants in Europe before 1992.
   These developments have forced many automakers to reassess their
ability to sell vehicles all over the world. For the weaker
competitors, that has meant forging alliances with stronger rivals
or each other.
   This past week, Renault of France and AB Volvo of Sweden
disclosed they have begun talks aimed at exploring a possible
merger or collaboration in truck or car manufucturing. Both
companies have been finding it increasingly difficult to sell cars
in the United States.
   Earlier in the week, Britain's money-losing Jaguar PLC said it
was mulling whether to sell a minority stake to GM and was
discussing possible joint manufacturing and marketing ventures with
the biggest U.S. automaker.
   Jaguar's move was partly a defensive response to unwelcome
overtures by Ford, which had earlier expressed interest in buying
all or part of the luxury carmaker and had received U.S. antitrust
clearance to purchase up to 15 percent.
   Ford also has expressed interest in buying all or part of Saab,
the Swedish carmaker that has been suffering weak sales in the
United States but has significant truckmaking operations in Europe.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Signs of higher inflation and the collapse of a big buyout for
airline giant UAL Corp. sent the stock market plummeting in the
worst day since the Oct. 19, 1987 collapse almost exactly two years
earlier.
   _MGM-UA Communications Co. scrapped its agreement to be acquired
by Qintex Australia Ltd. for $1.5 billion because of financing
problems. The collapse of that deal opened the way for resumption
of takeover talks with other possible interested buyers of one of
the largest American entertainment concerns.
   _Despite little or no movement to resolve a Machinists union
strike at Boeing Co., the aerospace giant received an order
potentially worth $5 billion from Northwest Airlines. The order was
considered a blow to Boeing's European rival Airbus Industrie,
which had hoped for a longstanding relationship with Northwest
after securing a $3.2 billion order from the carrier three years
ago.

   Mesa Airlines Inc. of Farmington is
interested in buying Wichita, Kan.-based Air Midwest, a move that
would link Mesa's flights with routes flown by its recently
acquired Milwaukee-based subsidiary.
   Gary Risley, Mesa's vice president for corporate affairs, said
Friday that Mesa sent a letter Oct. 12 to Robert Priddy, president
and chief executive officer of Air Midwest, ``and requested the
opportunity to enter into an exclusive agreement with him leading
to 100 percent acquisition of Air Midwest stock.''
   Mesa's negotiating suggestion of $6.34 per share of Air Midwest
stock, based on the market price at the time the letter was sent,
calculates to slightly more than $24 million.
   Air Midwest's over-the-counter stock dipped from $8.38 a share
on June 30 to $4.75 a share on Thursday. Mesa's over-the-counter
stock closed at $7.75 a share on Thursday.
   Priddy, who owns more than 13 percent of Air Midwest stock, or
about 509,000 shares, sent a letter Friday to Mesa saying Air
Midwest is considering a variety of alternatives and is willing to
meet.
   Air Midwest has 42 airplanes and serves 39 cities in Kansas,
Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Arkansas, Alabama,
Kentucky, Illinois and Tennessee.
   Air Midwest was hit hard by the recent bankruptcy reorganization
of Braniff Airlines. The smaller carrier provided connector flights
to Braniff's hub in Kansas City and about one-half its revenues
were from ties with Braniff.
   During the second quarter this year, the latest period for which
figures are available, Air Midwest earned $1.6 million, nearly four
times the earnings for the same quarter in 1988.
   Mesa has 16 airplanes serving 25 cities in New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, Arizona and Texas.
   Mesa's subsidiary, Skyway Airlines of Milwaukee, has six
airplanes serving 15 cities in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan
and Wisconsin. Mesa acquired Skyway in April.
   Mesa on Aug. 4 reported net income of $101,546, or 6 cents a
share, on revenue of more than $5.8 million for its third fiscal
quarter that ended June 30.
   Risley said acquisition of Air Midwest would give Mesa flights
that travel from the Southwest through the Midwest.
   Mesa earlier this week rejected a merger proposed by a smaller
carrier, Stateswest Airlines in Phoenix.
   Air Midwest's board rejected Resort Air's $31 million buyout
offer of $8 a share on June 29.

   A plunge in General Motors Corp. car and light
truck sales led an 11.9 percent decline in early-October vehicle
sales by domestic automakers compared with last year, the companies
said Friday.
   It was the first sales period of the 1990 model year and the
first in what analysts have said would be a soft three-month period.
   The eight major companies making vehicles in North America said
their cars and light trucks sold at an average rate of 30,734 a day
during the Oct. 1-10 period this year, compared with 34,867 during
the same time last year.
   The decline was led by a 24.2 percent fall in GM's car sales and
a 28.7 percent decline in the company's truck sales. Overall, the
industry leader's car and truck sales were off 25.6 percent for the
period.
   Ford Motor Co.'s total vehicle sales were down 0.3 percent in
early October and Chrysler Corp.'s were off 2.3 percent.
   GM's sales dive may have been spurred by its program of
rewarding dealers who cleared out stocks of 1989 vehicles before
Sept. 30, the end of the 1989 model year.
   ``We had a strong, strong, strong month of September and also I
think there is a lull here in some of the buying,'' GM spokesman
Terry Sullivan said. ``One cannot judge a year on 10 days.''
   For the year to date, GM's car sales were down 6.2 percent while
truck sales were up 2.4 percent. At Ford, year-to-date car sales
were up 0.1 percent and truck sales were down 2 percent, while at
Chrysler, car sales were off 11.1 percent and truck sales were up
0.2 percent.
   For months, as word of 1990 model price increases spread,
analysts and others have been saying sales in the fourth quarter of
this year would be considerably softer than during the third
quarter, when incentives helped.
   That ``payback'' may be coming true, said analyst Tom Webb of
the National Automobile Dealers Association.
   ``Sixty to 75 percent (of the early October sales) should have
been '90s,'' he said.
   Webb said he wanted to see how sales go later in the month
before saying whether the payback was under way.
   GM said its cars sold at an average daily rate of 8,538 during
the early October period this year, compared with a rate of 11,273
during the same period last year. Its early-October truck sales
were reported at an average daily rate of 3,654 compared with a
rate of 5,126 last year.
   Ford said it sold an average of 7,169 cars a day during the
period this year, compared with 7,301 during the same time last
year, for a 1.8 percent decline. Truck sales, meantime, rose to an
average daily rate of 4,299 for the period this year, up 2.4
percent from the 4,197 truck-a-day rate in early October last year.
   Chrysler's car sales were off 7.5 percent in early October,
falling to a daily average of 2,840 this year compared with a rate
of 3,071 last year. Truck sales at Chrysler were up 4.3 percent,
rising to a daily rate of 2,515 during the period this year,
compared with 2,412 last year.

   The stock market's sudden drop Friday afternoon
sent financial workers out onto Wall Street in a daze, assessing
the damage and already worrying about next week.
   ``It's not fun, it's not fun,'' mumbled a middle-aged man in a
trench coat as he emerged from the New York Stock Exchange after
the final bell. ``People were taking a little bit of a beating in
there.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 190.58 points to
2,569.26 _ its second biggest point drop ever, exceeded only by the
508-point loss recorded on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.
   The man in the trench coat, who would not give his name,
predicted more of the same following the weekend: ``I think they're
gonna run on Monday.''
   Memories of 1987 dominated conversation.
   ``I thought it was all over two years ago,'' said a stock
exchange floor reporter named Anthony. ``But I never thought it
would happen again. I figured only on Friday the 13th would this
happen.''
   Another man on a street corner shook his head and said to a
friend, ``I'm trying to figure out whether I got my head handed to
me. I just don't know.''
   But stockbroker Bernard Klein was defiantly optimistic: ``This
is not going to be like Black Monday. The market is going to stick
on Monday, absolutely. What we had today was just panic selling.''
   Jeff Schure, an options trader, wasn't so sure.
   ``This just shows that the upward movement wasn't on stable
ground,'' Schure said. ``Most people took hit today. One guy I know
went down for $150,000.''
   Said options trader Larry Mendelson: ``Monday's going to be a
scary day. People have all weekend to think about this. It was
grim.''

   The biggest wave of selling since the crash of
1987 swept through the stock market today, sending prices plunging
on the news that a big buyout deal for UAL Corp. had fallen through.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials nosedived 190.58 points,
or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. That marked its second biggest point
drop ever, exceeded only by the 508-point loss recorded on Black
Monday Oct. 19, 1987.
   Just four days ago the average hit a record closing high of
2,791.41.
   The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most
of the session until the group planning to buy UAL said it had been
unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had
planned.
   That quickly cast a pall over shares of UAL and other companies
that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals.
   Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve
among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the
market for high-yielding ``junk'' bonds.
   Earlier, the Labor Department reported that the producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly
reversing a series of declines through the summer months.
   The UAL news ``was the trigger for the whole thing,'' said
Newton Zinder, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Also, it's October,'' Zinder added. ``Memories of 1987 are
still very vivid.''
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 251.17 million
shares, up from 160.12 million in the previous session and the
heaviest total since 254.87 million were traded on Jan. 27.
   The NYSE's composite index tumbled 11.43 to 185.55. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down 16.56 at
378.45.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has boosted its ownership
share of Jaguar PLC to 5 percent on its way to acquiring 15 percent
of the British luxury carmaker, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said
Friday.
   The Federal Trade Commission said last week it would have no
objection to Ford acquiring 15 percent of Jaguar, the maximum
allowed by the end of 1990, according to Jaguar by-laws.
   Jaguar has said Ford's move is unwelcome. General Motors Corp.
and Jaguar have said they were involved in discussions that could
result in GM holding a stake in Jaguar.
   Ford held 1 percent of Jaguar stock before its announcement last
month of its intentions to acquire the 15-percent share of Jaguar.

   Currency dealers pounded down the dollar Friday
in hectic selling incited by the worst stock plunge since the crash
two years ago.
   Harried traders reported an atmosphere of alarm suddenly
engulfed the currency markets late in the afternoon as stock prices
skidded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``It just seemed everybody wanted to sell dollars. It was just a
mass panic,'' said Thomas Palladino, an assistant vice president at
the New York office of the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank.
   The intensity of the stock market selloff was especially
unnerving because it occurred almost two years to the day after the
worst Wall Street crash ever. ``There was an eerie sense of deja
vu,'' said Kevin Laurie, manager of treasury operations at the Bank
of Boston in New York. ``The dollar reacted to it pretty
violently.''
   The widely watched Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the largest drop since the crash
on Oct. 19, 1987. Other stock indices also fell sharply.
   Dollar sales bred additional selling as the dollar sank below
thresholds that professional traders had designated as ``stop
loss'' levels. In stop-loss maneuvers, traders sell to guard
against possibly losing more money in case a market slide continues.
   The drop in the dollar was exaggerated by the diminished trading
volume that is typical for Friday afternoons.
   On Fridays, banks stop dealing directly with one another earlier
than on other days of the week, which reduces liquidity in the
market. Price movements have a greater impact when liquidity is low.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to lose additional ground
against other major currencies in Asian trading over the weekend.
   Initially on Friday, two economic reports had encouraged some
dollar buying. A 0.9 percent surge in the U.S. Producer Price Index
during September and a rise of 0.5 percent in retail sales
indicated that interest rates would not decline anytime soon.
   The early enthusiasm for dollars was dampened somewhat, however,
by unconfirmed reports that central banks had sold dollars to keep
the currency in check.
   By the time trading was done for the day in New York, the dollar
stood at 142.05 yen, down from 144.15 yen on Thursday. The loss of
about 2 yen was unusually large.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 144.00 Japanese yen from
144.60 yen at Thursday's close and in London, it edged up to 144.10
yen.
   The British pound benefited from the dollar's decline. A pound
fetched $1.5820 late in New York vs. $1.5527 Thursday. In earlier
London dealings, the pound rose to $1.5625 from $1.5520 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.9075;
1.6420 Swiss francs, down from 1.6735; 6.34375 French francs, down
from 6.4670; 1,376.00 Italian lire, down from 1,399.25; and,
1.17385 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday's
rates included: 1.9025 West German marks, down from 1.9068; 1.6720
Swiss francs, up from 1.6715; 6.4562 French francs, down from
6.4650; 2.1465 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1510; 1,396.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,397.50; and, 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1737.
   Gold prices registered little reaction to the slump in stocks
and the dollar.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.30 a troy ounce, 10 cents lower than
Thursday's settlement. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid for gold of $364.80 an ounce, compared with Thursday's
late bid of $363.
   In London, the metal rose to a late bid price of $364.25 a troy
ounce from $362.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a bid of $363.70 from $363.10 late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 49 cents to a close of $363.69 from
$363.20 at Thursday's close.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid of $5.12 a troy ounce, up
from late Thursday's bid of $5.10. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery settled at $5.079 a troy ounce, down from $5.090
on Thursday.

   Petroleum futures prices finished mixed Friday,
with wholesale home heating oil retreating after a rally the
previous session.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures gained.
   The contract for November delivery of No.2 heating oil pulled
back by 0.30 cent to 60.87 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, erasing a portion of Thursday's 1.36-cents
surge. Other contract months also declined.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline went up
0.58 cent to 56.15 cents a gallon, more than making up for
Thursday's drop of 0.16 cent. Contracts for later delivery also
settled higher.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, added 42 cents to settle at $20.89 per
42-gallon barrel after rising 22 cents on Thursday. Contracts
calling for delivery December through February sported more modest
gains.

<TEXT>
   A sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a
rebound in wholesale price inflation in September, wiping out three
rare monthly declines this summer, the government said Friday.
   The 0.9 percent increase in the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index, measuring inflation one stop short of the retail
level, represented a return to the high inflation rates experienced
in the first five months of the year.
   Analysts were not overly concerned, however. They noted that
nearly all of the gain in the index can be attributed to two
special factors: an unusually large and probably one-time rise in
oil costs and a shift in seasonal patterns that made a modest drop
in auto prices look like a large increase.
   ``If you take out the seasonals for autos and the energy blip,
which I think is just a rebound from (declines) we had this summer,
it suggests inflation's just not that bad,'' said economist John
Silvia of Kemper Financial Services Inc.
   Nevertheless, stock prices fell in early trading after the data
was interpreted as an indication the Federal Reserve Board will not
lower interest rates soon.
   ``These figures are appropriate for Friday the 13th and seem
destined to strike terror into the hearts of financial markets,''
said economist Gordon Richards of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   The market also was reacting to a Commerce Department report
showing a stronger-than-expected 0.5 percent increase in retail
sales last month, the seventh consecutive rise.
   Later in the day, the market fell sharply on news that a
labor-management group had failed to secure financing for a
proposed $6.75 billion takeover of UAL Corp., parent of United
Airlines. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled
190.58 points to 2,569.26, the steepest drop since the 1987 crash.
   In a balancing act, the central bank is trying to keep interest
rates high enough to control inflationary pressures but low enough
to avoid a recession. The gain in retail sales indicated some
bouyancy in the economy, dashing traders' hope for Fed easing.
Those hopes had been kindled last week by a Labor Department report
showing manufacturers lost 103,000 jobs in September.
   The Business Council, composed of 100 top business leaders
gathering for a conference in the resort town of Hot Springs, Va.,
predicted Friday that the economy will continue to soften in 1990
and may even topple into a recession unless the Fed cuts interest
rates.
   The climb last month in wholesale prices wiped out consecutive
declines of 0.4 percent in August and July and 0.1 percent in June.
That brought the annual wholesale inflation rate for the first nine
months of the year to 5.1 percent, compared with 4.0 percent in all
of 1988.
   Contributing to the big September jump was a fluke in the
measurement of auto prices, which were skewed because manufacturers
offered their end-of-the-model-year price incentives earlier in the
summer than usual.
   When month-to-month increases were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations, auto prices rose 3.8 percent in September. When
seasonal adjustments are factored out, auto prices actually
declined 0.5 percent.
   Energy prices, which had fallen in June, July and August, shot
up 6.5 percent last month. Fuel oil prices rose 16.3 percent;
gasoline, 10.6 percent, and natural gas, 3.4 percent.
   ``That's an exceptionally high increase, which will not be
repeated, but that doesn't mean energy prices are coming down,''
said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.
   In good news, the department said food prices dropped 0.6
percent following a 0.3 percent gain a month earlier. Vegetable
prices were down 16.1 percent; turkeys, 4.9 percent; pasta, 4.4
percent, and beef, 4.0 percent. Prices for pork, fish, fruit and
rice also fell.
   Excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories,
prices rose 0.7 percent in September following a 0.5 percent
increase in August. The cost of home furnishings, health products,
magazines, floor coverings, tobacco and alcoholic beverages all
rose last month.
   The 0.9 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index for
finished goods left it at 113.5, meaning that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $113.50
last month.
   Two measures of prices earlier in the production process also
rose. Intermediate goods increased 0.4 percent after three
successive drops and crude goods jumped 1.1 percent, partly
offsetting a 1.0 percent decline in August. Examples of the three
processing stages _ finished, intermediate and crude _ are bread,
flour and wheat.

   The lobbying group Common Cause asked the
Justice Department and a Senate panel Friday to investigate the
intervention of five senators in the regulation of what's expected
to become the nation's costliest S&amp;L collapse.
   Common Cause, along with Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., requested
the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the
resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, asked the Senate
Ethics Committee to determine whether Sens. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., John
Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., violated ethics
rules when they met with regulators in April 1987 concerning
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.
   All five had received substantial campaign contributions from
Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American
Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent.
   At the same time, the group called on the Justice Department to
determine whether Keating and Lincoln violated federal election
laws in their efforts to influence the senators.
   ``The joint intervention ... into a case involving alleged
violations by a specific company ... appears to be an extraordinary
action,'' Wertheimer said.
   Lincoln, which is insolvent, was seized by federal regulators on
April 14 after more than two years of audits and examinations.
Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to
protect the institution's depositors.
   Last month, the government filed a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit
charging Keating, his family and associates with fraud and
racketeering. Among the allegations are that Keating diverted money
from Lincoln to fund his personal, political and charitable
convictions.
   Leonard Bickwit, an attorney representing Keating's company,
defended the millionaire's right to contribute to and seek help
from the senators.
   ``Mr. Keating and the organizations he's been in association
with had every right to make these contributions, which were within
the limits of the law. He also has the right to seek the support of
his representatives on matters of importance to him and he ought
not to be more restricted in that regard than others who have not
contributed,'' Bickwit said, reading a prepared statement.
   According to Common Cause, Keating contributed $850,000 to three
private organizations founded or controlled by Cranston and $47,000
to Cranston's campaigns; $200,000 to a political committee
controlled by Glenn as well as a $34,000 campaign contribution;
campaign contributions of $112,000 and free jet flights valued at
$13,433 to McCain and his family; $76,100 to Riegle's campaign and
$55,000 to DeConcini's election effort.
   Riegle returned the contribution in March 1988, DeConcini last
month. McCain reimbursed American Continental for the jet flights
but has not given back the $112,000.
   The five senators all issued statements pledging their
cooperation with any probe. McCain, in letters to the ethics panel
and Justice Department, added, ``I am fully confident that I
engaged in no unethical conduct.''
   Cranston said he met with regulators to urge them to bring their
lengthy examination of Lincoln to a conclusion, not to influence
its outcome. ``I did not violate any ethics rules or standards,''
he said.
   Riegle said he attended the meeting only at the request of
McCain and DeConcini and said his conduct was ``entirely proper.''
   Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should appoint a
special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the
Code of Ethics for Government Service that prohibits members of
Congress from accepting ``favors or benefits under circumstances
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the
performance of governmental duties.''
   In a letter, he asked Gerald E. McDowell, chief of the Justice
Department's public integrity section, to determine whether
Keating's contribution to the senators violated federal election
laws or other statutes.
   In the case against Wright, the former speaker also was accused
of intervening with regulators on behalf of S&amp;L owners. But
Wertheimer said, ``I think we have a different case, different
circumstances.''
   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee, in preparation for four
public hearings on the case beginning next week, voted Thursday to
subpoena Keating and regulators who oversaw his institution.
   The hearings are expected to focus on why M. Danny Wall, as the
nation's top S&amp;L regulator, delayed action from mid-1987 until
April on a recommendation from field examiners that the government
take control of Lincoln.

<HEAD>Stock-Index Futures Plummet; Orange Juice Futures Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tumbling stock prices triggered temporary trading halts for
stock-index futures Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in a
drop that mirrored a near-record selloff on Wall Street.
   In other markets, orange juice futures plunged on word that
Brazilian producers planned to cut their export price; crude oil
futures jumped higher; soybean futures slumped while grain futures
were mixed; livestock and meat futures advanced; and precious
metals inched lower.
   The first 30-minute index futures trading halt came about 2 p.m.
CDT after the Merc's contract for December delivery of stocks
tracked by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 12 points from
Thursday's close to 346.85.
   A 12-point drop in the index corresponds to a 100-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   When trading resumed, the market soon plunged to 328.85, 30
points below Thursday's close, triggering a second 30-minute pause
in trading below that price at about 2:45 p.m., traders said. The
second halt extended through the market's 3:15 p.m. closing.
   The so-called ``circuit breaker'' trading halts program was
enacted after the 1987 stock market crash to provide a series of
coordinated market breaks aimed at discouraging panic selling.
   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange also would have been
temporarily halted once the Dow industrials fell 250 points. That
average finished down 190.58 at 2,569.26, the second worst daily
drop after the 508-point decline in the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday
crash.
   Robert Ray, a stock-index trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago, said the futures market plunged on news that a group
seeking to buy UAL Corp. had been unable to obtain financing, which
triggered new doubts about the market for high-yielding, high-risk
junk bonds.
   Institutional investors use stock-index futures to hedge against
losses in the stock market, sometimes employing computer-driven
program trading strategies that can cause wild swings in prices on
both markets.
   In orange juice, futures prices tumbled on the New York Cotton
Exchange amid talk that Brazilian producers planned to cut their
export price from $1.60 to about $1.37 a pound.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 1.5 cents to
4.95 cents lower with the contract for delivery in November at
$1.321 a pound.
   The unconfirmed reports of a Brazilian price cut followed an
Agriculture Department report Thursday estimating the 1989-90
Florida orange crop at 130 million boxes compared to 146.6 million
boxes harvested in the crop year that ended in July.
   Brazil, the world's largest processor of frozen concentrated
orange juice, is expected to produce at least 255 million boxes of
oranges this year, up from 195 million last year.
   Industry analysts had been expecting the Brazilians to drop
their prices in an effort to move more of their product onto the
world market, said Celeste Georgakis, an analyst in New York with
Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   Rumors that OPEC members Nigeria and Saudi Arabia planned to cut
their crude-oil production sent crude futures surging to near $21 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before profit-taking
trimmed the gains.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 42
cents higher with November at $20.89 a barrel; heating oil was .30
cent lower to .10 cent higher with November at 60.87 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .58 cent to .85 cent higher with
November at 56.15 cents a gallon.
   A bearish crop report and forecasts for a weekend of good
harvesting weather triggered a late plunge in soybean futures
prices to new 23-month lows Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Grain futures closed mostly lower.
   Soybeans settled 3 cents to 9\ cents lower with November at
$5.44\ a bushel, the market's lowest close since Nov. 6, 1987;
wheat futures were 5 cents lower to } cent higher with December at
$4.06} a bushel; corn futures were 1} cents lower to 1 cent higher
with December at $2.34 a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower
with December at $1.40\ a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures rallied strongly for the third
straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, boosted by higher
cash markets and buying linked to a plan to donate U.S. pork
bellies to Poland.
   Hog and cattle futures ended mostly higher on strong cash
markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent to .50 cent higher with
October at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .33 cent higher with October at 83.42 cents a pound; live hogs
were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 48.87 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .57 cent to 1.48 cent higher with
February at 51.20 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures edged lower in listless trading on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures settled 10 cents lower across the board with
October at $363.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.1 cents to 1.3 cents
lower with December at $5.14 a troy ounce.

   Banking regulators Friday ordered financially
troubled CenTrust Bank to cease dividend payments to shareholders
and halt any stock repurchases.
   The decision by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision angered
the chairman of the Miami-based institution who said a proposed
$150 million sale of nearly all its branches would restore
financial stability.
   ``We regret the issuance of the directive, which came as a total
surprise to us,'' said David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive
officer at CenTrust, which grew since 1983 into the largest thrift
in the Southeast.
   CenTrust is seeking federal approval to sell 63 of its 71
branches _ and all the accounts in the branches _ to Great Western
Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif. The branches have more than $2.4
billion in deposits.
   CenTrust would be left with eight Dade County branches holding
about $800 million in deposits.
   ``If the regulators would approve the transaction, they would
allow us to solve our problems and, we would hope, continue to pay
our dividends,'' said Paul in a news release. ``We will use our
best efforts to try to convince our regulators that the suspension
of dividends is not in their best interest or those of the
institution. We hope they will reverse their decision.''
   CenTrust has two classes of preferred stock, both of which were
affected by the dividend ruling.
   Both stocks closed down $3.50 to $4.75 on over-the-counter
trading Friday.
   With losses of about $16 million for the first half of this
year, CenTrust has come under pressure from regulators to improve
performance and streamline operations.
   CenTrust has shrunk from more than $10 billion in assets to
about $9 billion in recent months. The institution also has been
criticized for a host of high-risk or unusual investments.
   Paul, who took over the insolvent Dade Federal Savings in 1983,
was ordered by regulators to sell a collection of paintings
purchased with CenTrust funds.

<HEAD>Philippines President Aquino to Attend Store Festivities in Dallas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino will
attend a reception and dinner in Dallas next month on behalf of a
$100 million promotion of Philippine merchandise by J.C. Penney Co.
Inc., a spokesman for the retailer said Friday.
   Spokesman Harvey McCormick said he couldn't confirm, however, if
Mrs. Aquino would visit a J.C. Penney store. Her visit to Dallas on
Nov. 10 comes three years after Britain's Prince Charles and
Princess Diana visited a suburban Washington J.C. Penney on Nov.
11, 1985, for ``The Best of Britain'' promotion.
   McCormick said Mrs. Aquino's visit would be the first time a
head of state has attended a company function. She will be in
Dallas Nov. 10-11, the same time as President George Bush, but
McCormick said he didn't know whether Bush would attend the J.C.
Penney events with Mrs. Aquino.
   The Penney ``Festival of the Philippines'' presentation of
merchandise, special events, and cultural exhibits, with a retail
value of nearly 100 million dollars, will be the largest promotion
of the Philippines ever outside the 7,100-island nation, the
company said. The promotion will be held in May.
   ``They invited Mrs. Aquino to drop by Dallas on the course of
her state visit here, so that they could show her what J.C.
Penney's is all about,'' said Philippines Embassy spokesman Adolfo
Paglinawan. ``And it may even include a visit to the J.C. Penney
store at the Preston Mall.''
   Paglinawan said the impact of J.C. Penney's orders, which he
said have a value of $30 million to $50 million, will be felt
immediately in his country.
   To meet the company's orders, factories will have to ``beef up
production,'' resulting in a ``direct infusion of dollars'' and an
anticipated increase in labor.
   ``Most of the products (being ordered) would actually benefit
the low income groups, because they are the ones that engage in the
manufacturing activities,'' he said.
   Paglinawan said Mrs. Aquino's visit is ``consistent with her
desire to really promote the expansion of trade and investments
with the Americans.''
   David F. Miller, vice chairman and chief operating officer of
J.C. Penney stores and catalogue, said in announcing the promotion
that the Philippines has a tradition of quality and fine
craftmanship had has been a growing apparel and home-furnishings
source for the company for several years.
   The promotion will include clothing, accessories and home
furnishings. It is the company's fourth international promotion.
Others have featured Italy, Great Britain and India.
   Mrs. Aquino also will be meeting with executives of oil
exploration companies during her visit to Dallas, Paglinawan said.

<HEAD>Junk Bonds Plunge As Fears Widen Over Possible Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Junk bond prices plunged Friday as financing
problems for a major airline buyout widened fears over a possible
collapse of the slumping $200 billion market of the high-yield
securities.
   News that bidders had failed to raise financing for the planned
$6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, also
spread panic that billions of dollars in other planned
debt-financed deals would have to be scrapped.
   ``No one thinks this is the bottom,'' said a high-yield bond
trader at a major Wall Street firm who asked not to be named.
   The decline Friday came in what already has been the worst
shakeout ever in the junk bond market, which boomed in the 1980s on
a wave of highly leveraged takeovers financed by the high-risk
securities.
   The junk bond market decline began in September when Campeau
Corp. had to get a $250 million loan to meet its junk bond
obligations. Since then, Ohio Mattress Co. scrapped a $475 million
issue and Ramada Inc. postponed indefinitely a $400 million issue.
   Prices of junk bonds _ so named because of their low credit
ratings _ dropped for the 17th straight day Friday. Traders said
the afternoon plunge was triggered by the 190-point drop on the New
York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones industrials average, the worst this
year, which had been sparked by news of the UAL financing failure.
   Junk bond issues were down on average about 1{ points to 2
points, or as much as $20 for every $1,000 in face amount. RJR
Holdings Capital Corp. bonds, considered a ``quality'' issue,
plummeted 3 points. R.H. Macy &amp; Co. bonds plunged 2 points.
   Western Union bonds droppped a whopping 15 points, in part
because of reports of a possible bankruptcy filing. Quantum
Chemicals, considered a less attractive issue, fell from 5 points
to 7 points, traders said.
   ``There's an eerie silence in the junk bond market. There's no
trading taking place,'' said John Lonski, senior economist at
Moody's Investors Service, a major credit rating agency.
   ``We face the problem of an eventual selloff where a number of
junk bond holders will just want to get out and assume significant
losses in the process,'' he said.
   Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult,
because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is,
between dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond
_ instead of in bidding on an open exchange.
   That same characteristic also can heighten big selloffs by
making it more difficult to find buyers when the market is weak or
falling.
   Very few junk bonds are listed on the American and New York
Stock exchanges and tallies on overall market volume are not
available daily.
   Failure of the UAL deal heightened fears because while part of
the financing was expected to come from junk bonds, traditional
bank financing was to play a major role.
   ``If banks backed off that it's not a good sign for the rest of
the market,'' Lonski said.
   About $11 billion in new junk bond offerings from companies
including Continental Airlines, Blockbuster Entertainment, Grand
Union and CNW Corp.'s Chicago &amp; North Western railroad are
scheduled to occur by the end of the year.

   Executives of the country's largest
corporations were generally at a loss to explain Friday's huge drop
in the stock market although some suggested that it could be a good
thing if it cools speculative fever.
   The market plunge was an unwelcome intrusion on the annual
meeting of the Business Council, the chief executive officers of
the nation's 100 largest corporations.
   Many of them learned of the sudden plunge while out on the golf
course at the posh mountain resort where the conference is held.
   Executives swapped details of how their own stock had faired,
but few were willing to give snap judgements about what went wrong.
They said they had heard only sketchy details about the overall
decline.
   They also were not willing to forecast what direction the market
might take when it reopens on Monday.
   Howard P. Allen, head of Southern California Edison Co., said
that he did not buy the explanation, offered widely on Wall Street,
that the market drop was fueled entirely by the failure of the
buyout deal for United Airlines.
   ``I think that there has to be something more fundamental that
caused the crash,'' he said.
   Asked if he was concerned about the huge sell-off, John
McGillicuddy, head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., said, ``Anytime
you have the market drop by 197 points, if you aren't concerned,
there's something wrong with you.''
   The drop in the Dow Jones average was actually 190.58 at the
close of trading.
   Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp., said the market plunge
could turn out to be a good thing if it ``leads to a flight to
quality'' stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeover
possibilities.
   John Akers, the head of IBM Corp., noted Friday's decline was
``nowhere near as violent'' as the 508-point drop which occurred on
Oct. 19, 1987.
   But Akers said he was concerned that the rash of company
takeovers had left many corporations so deeply in debt that they
could be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase.

   Stock-index futures trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange was halted twice Friday as tumbling stock
prices triggered ``circuit breakers'' designed to prevent a rapid,
computer-driven collapse.
   It was the first time the market had fallen far enough to
trigger 30-minute halts in trading since the circuit breakers were
installed a year after the stock market's October 1987 collapse.
   The program was enacted to provide a series of market breaks in
hopes that pauses in trading would discourage panic selling.
   But some critics of the program argued that the circuit breakers
could have the opposite effect, contributing to a frenzied rush to
sell.
   The first 30-minute halt occurred about 2 p.m. CDT after the
Merc's contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had fallen 12 points from Thursday's
close to 346.85.
   A 12-point drop in the index corresponds to a 100-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   At that point, traders were not allowed to execute any more sell
orders at lower prices until trading resumed at 2:30 p.m. CDT.
   When trading resumed, the market traded back and forth for about
10 minutes, then plunged to 328.85, 30 points below Thursday's
close, triggering a second 30-minute pause in trading below that
price at about 2:45 p.m., traders said.
   The second trading halt extended through the market's 3:15 p.m.
closing time.
   A less-dramatic circuit breaker was triggered on March 17, when
the S&amp;P 500 futures opened with a 5-point loss, triggering a
10-minute halt to selling followed by a two-minute halt to all
trading, said Merc spokeswoman Iris Poliski. On that day, the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 48 points.
   Robert Ray, a stock-index trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago, said the market plunged on news that a group seeking to
buy UAL Corp. had been unable to obtain financing, which triggered
new doubts about the market for high-yielding, high-risk junk bonds.
   Institutional investors use stock-index futures to hedge against
losses in the stock market, sometimes employing computer-driven
program trading strategies that can cause wild swings in prices on
both markets.
   Ray said he sympathized with program traders who tried to cut
their losses when the Dow started sliding toward what would become
a loss of nearly 191 points on the day.
   ``From the program trading end I can't blame those guys,'' Ray
said. ``At one point I don't think they could tell where the
markets were.''
   The Chicago Merc, the world's largest market for S&amp;P 500
futures, installed the trading limits last year as part of a
coordinated effort with the New York Stock Exchange to prevent
another market collapse like the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average that occurred on Oct. 19, 1987.
   Under the coordinated program between the Merc and the NYSE, the
next trigger point would have come had the Dow Jones industrial
average fallen 250 points from Thursday's close. The Dow never
dipped that low on Friday, but if it had the procedures called for
a one-hour halt in all stock trading on the NYSE. A decline of
another 150 points on the same day would have triggered an
additional two-hour delay.

<HEAD>Trump's Effort To Buy AMR Clouded By Stock Market Drop</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's proposed $7 billion buyout of AMR
Corp., already surrounded by skepticism, was placed in further
doubt Friday by a stock market drop blamed in part on problems in
another airline buyout, analysts said.
   ``This seems to poison the atmosphere, at the very least, for
airline buyouts involving a lot of debt,'' said one industry
analyst who asked not to be named.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks fell 190.58 points
after a management-pilot group said it could not obtain financing
for a $6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
   Trump has proposed a $120-per-share buyout of Fort Worth-based
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, but the company has not
responded beyond a promise that it will consider the offer,
although it prefers to remain independent.
   Trump has said he will include $1 billion of equity in his
offer, but has provided no other financing details, leading to
skepticism over his ability to complete the deal.
   AMR's stock price slippped to $98.62{ Friday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, before trading halted in
the mad sell-off during the last hour of business. Trading was
stopped because of an imbalance of orders for AMR, with many more
sellers than buyers.
   Although the close was down just 12{ cents from Thursday, it
represented a $4.62{ drop during the day. AMR had climbed to
$103.25 before its slide began in early afternoon.
   The close was also the stock's lowest price since Trump's offer
was disclosed Oct. 5. Analysts expect the stock to continue to
trade far below the level of Trump's offer until there is a
significant move by either side.
   AMR officials would not comment on Friday's market developments;
Trump officials in New York did not return telephone calls.
   Analysts said Trump will have to lower his price if he expects
to pull off the deal.
   ``If you look at history's precedents, those situations that
were in an arbitrage environment were materially altered (by market
swings) on the downside,'' said airline analyst Kevin Burke in
Charlotte, N.C.

   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, advanced 11.69 to close at 1,196.37.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.41 percent as the
discount dropped 52 basis points to 7.19 percent. Yields on
six-month bills slid to 7.63 percent as the discount retreated 39
basis points to 7.26 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.64
percent as the discount tumbled 37 basis points to 7.15 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   Striking Boeing Co. production workers announced
plans Friday for a march on company headquarters, while the
aerospace manufacturer prepared to make its fifth plane delivery
since the walkout began.
   No date has been set for a resumption of contract negotiations,
which ended Oct. 2, two days before the strike started. Industry
analysts said the strike almost certainly would last another week
and possibly two months or more.
   The 57,800 Boeing employees represented by the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were enjoying
donations of pizza, supermarket food and other support. They also
were being advised on ways to prepare for financial, marital and
other pressures.
   Linda Lanham of Machinists District Lodge 751, representing
43,300 Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area, said legislators,
members of Congress and state and national labor leaders were being
invited to a rally at the union hall and a march to Boeing's
corporate headquarters Oct. 21.
   She said she hoped at least 2,000 people would participate.
   Meanwhile, Boeing was preparing to deliver the fifth plane since
the strike began Oct. 4, a 747-400 for China Air of Taiwan, said
chief corporate spokesman Harold Carr. The planes were already
assembled before the walkout, and non-striking employees have been
putting the finishing touches on them. The company says it has
about three dozen more planes that might be prepared for delivery
while the workers are on strike.
   Boeing said Friday that Martinair Holland has ordered four more
wide-body 767-300ER jetliners, worth approximately $326 million.
   So far this month, Boeing has received orders and options for
106 planes worth approximately $7.5 billion. For the year, Boeing
has received firm orders for 792 planes worth about $42.3 billion,
an industry record.
   Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities in New York said that nobody
had expected a strike to last less than two weeks, ``so after this
(weekend) the real strike begins, so to speak.''
   Talks could resume in the next week, ``and in the next two weeks
I think you might see some tangible motion,'' Demisch said.
   ``I've said one to two months all along, and I don't see any
reason to change that,'' said William Whitlow of Dain Bosworth in
Seattle.
   Boeing's three-year offer included wage hikes of 4 percent, 3
percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this year
and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause almost matching
inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some
benefits. The unions are seeking bigger wage increases, less
reliance on bonuses, and an end to mandatory overtime.
   By late Friday no union members in the region were known to be
facing eviction or other financial crises, but enough were worried
to keep five people almost constantly on the phone in the union's
local welfare office, said Lou Kiefer, a specialist from IAM
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
   Similar services were being offered to union members in Wichita,
Kan., Portland, Ore., and lesser Boeing job sites in Montana,
Hawaii, California, Utah and other states.
   Kiefer said creditors generally were agreeing to accept reduced
or delayed payments during the duration of the strike.
   ``When they get a creditor that's uncooperative, they call us
and in some cases we call the creditor,'' he said.
   ``We tell them we'll take some pickets off the line and bring
them over to the loan company,'' Kiefer said. ``We haven't had one
hold out on us yet.''
   Under federal law the strikers are being offered five options
for paying to retain some health, accident, death and disability
insurance coverage, said Kiefer and Al Wydick, another health and
welfare specialist.
   Without any advance word, a local pizza company sent delivery
trucks with hot pizzas for pickets at a number of plant gates,
Lanham said.
   Pat Newberry, owner of two McDonalds outlets, loaned a 10-gallon
cooler and is donating six gallons of orange-drink mix and 600
disposable cups a week, she said.
   Lee Frazier and Rob Miller are letting the union select $50
worth of free goods from each of their three groceries every
Wednesday, she said.
   Steve Witt of the QFC supermarket in Kent arranged for the union
to get ``tons of produce and tons of bakery items,'' Bowman said.

<TEXT>
   In response to the trading frenzy in the stock
market Friday, The Associated Press adjusted computer filters that
normally check the accuracy of trades reported by the exchanges.
   AP's computers, which process the financial markets tables
published by most newspapers, are programmed to spot questionable
trade reports and keep them out of AP's database until they are
checked.
   But many of the trades Friday dropped so sharply they would have
triggered false alarms, which would have delayed preparation of
stock market tables.
   Normally, AP's computers are set to question trades that vary by
more than 3 percent. In the wake of Friday's selloff, the gate was
widened to accept any trades that changed by up to 50 percent.
   Adjusting the filters allowed AP's computers to better keep pace
with Friday's heavy trading, but it also allowed some transaction
reports that were reported erroneously by the exchanges to creep
into AP's tables.
   Some high and low prices were affected. Closing prices were not.
   Before processing the weekly tables published in weekend
editions, AP staffers manually reviewed the data and removed trades
that were clearly reported incorrectly.

   Wall Street closed out its weekly business
Friday night reverberating with the echoes of the crash of 1987.
   In a setting fraught with parallels to the pre-weekend selloff
that served as prelude to Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987, stock
prices took a precipitous drop in the last hour of trading Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the day down
190.58 at 2,569.26, for a point loss exceeded in market history
only by the 508-point debacle it suffered on Black Monday.
   The average's 216.26 drop for the week ranked third in the
record books, behind declines of 235.48 and 295.98 Oct. 12-16 and
Oct. 19-23 two years ago.
   Yet many Wall Street officials, brokers and investors went home
for the weekend hopeful that history wasn't repeating itself.
   ``The whole situation is significantly different this time,''
said Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the organization that oversees the
over-the-counter market.
   ``The circumstances are not comparable and the psychology is
much stronger now,'' declared Kenneth Liebler, president of the
American Stock Exchange.
   In 1987, the market seemed to be under assault from every
direction. Interest rates were high and rising, the dollar was
under pressure in foreign exchange, recession fears were mounting
and, as everyone could plainly see later on, stock prices by any
traditional measure were ``too high.''
   This time, many analysts insist, none of those problems are
present. The trouble, they say, lies in a single sore spot for the
market _ credit worries and excessive speculation in corporate
buyouts, real and rumored, financed with borrowed money.
   The news that opened the floodgates on Friday, by nearly
unanimous agreement, was the disclosure by a labor-management group
that it couldn't get the bank loans needed to carry off its buyout
plan for UAL Corp.
   That was the latest in a series of events in recent weeks that
have shaken confidence in the market for ``junk'' bonds to finance
takeovers, and prompted conjecture that the buyout boom of the
1980s on Wall Street might be approaching its end.
   If it is true that the market has just one identifiable foe to
contend with, the most important question left to be answered is
whether Wall Street can limit the effects of the struggle to those
stocks that have been involved in takeover deals and speculation.
   That wasn't the way things looked on Friday, when the big blue
chips untouched by the taint of takeovers suffered along with the
so-called ``whisper'' stocks.
   Monday shapes up as ``a heavy day, perhaps a volatile day,''
Hardiman acknowledged. ``But it could be on either side.''
   Asked specifically about the buyout problem, he said, ``To the
extent that people have seen this coming, I think it can be
contained.''
   Most broader measures of stock price trends ended the past week
with losses not quite as severe as the Dow's.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 11.42 to
185.56; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 16.35 to 467.29, and the Amex market value index was down
16.56 at 378.45.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 161.95 million shares a day,
against 170.99 million the week before.
   The sudden slide on Friday appeared to some observers to have
accelerated what was already being billed as the ``de-leveraging''
of corporate America, the wringing out of what many see as
excessive use of debt in restructuring businesses of many
descriptions.
   ``Since junk bonds were an important source of financing for the
takeover boom, difficulty in raising this form of financing dilutes
a positive underpinning for the market,'' said Martin Sass,
chairman of the investment management firm M.D. Sass Investors
Services, in a commentary written before Friday's drop.
   But ``from a longer term standpoint, weakness in the junk bond
market has positive implications because it will result in more
soundly financed and conceived corporate mergers, and help stem the
sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality.''
   Concluded Hardiman: ``The markets have a way of correcting these
things. Sometimes it's painful.''

   The stock market plunge does not signal an
economic downturn, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Friday.
   Brady was the only high administration official to comment on
the loss of more than 190 points in the Dow-Jones industrial
average.
   President Bush refused to answer reporters' shouted questions as
he boarded a helicopter at the White House to fly to his Camp David
retreat in Maryland.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden,
who took office earlier this week, spent most of the afternoon and
early evening taking calls from members of Congress and others.
Shortly before 7:30 p.m. his spokeswoman Mary McCue said there
would be ``nothing tonight'' by way of comment from Breeden.
   Also, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board said the central
bank would have no comment.
   But Brady said, ``Today's decline ... should be viewed in the
context of a 591-point rise since Jan. 1, 1989. It's important to
recognize that today's stock market decline doesn't signal any
fundamental change in the condition of the economy.
   ``The economy remains well balanced and the outlook is for
continued moderate growth.''

<TEXT>
   Several air courier companies have sued the U.S.
Postal Service, claiming its low price for some overseas packages
creates unfair and illegal competition.
   In a suit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the
companies allege the government's $10.75 rate for express delivery
overseas of packages weighing eight ounces or less ``results in
unfair and illegal competition between the Postal Service and
private enterprise carriers.''
   The Postal Service cut its rate for that category in April from
$18 to $8.75 per package, which it described as a ``special
introductory rate.'' In June, it established a ``permanent'' rate
of $10.75. Private couriers usually charge about $20 for the same
service.
   In their suit, the companies ask the court to enjoin the Postal
Service from offering the $10.75 rate or any price that isn't
``fair and equitable.'' They contend that the government's rate is
below cost and that the Postal Service failed to get approval for
it from the Postal Rate Commission.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, defending the Postal
Service pricing, said the rates ``benefit the American householder
and smaller businesses who don't qualify for the volume discounts
offered to major corporations by these international couriers.''
   The companies filing the suit are DHL Airways Inc.,
Dworkin-Cosell Interair Courier Services Inc., Federal Express
Corp., Intertrade Courier International Inc., TNT Skypak Inc. and
UPS Air Forwarding Inc. Two industry associations _ Air Courier
Conference of America and International Express Carriers Conference
_ also participated.

   Warner Bros. said Friday it filed suit seeking
$1 billion in damages from Sony Corp. and others over Sony's
courtship of film producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters to run
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   Guber and Peters, who produced the megahit ``Batman'' and other
films for Warner, have been trying to get out of a recently signed
five-year exclusive agreement to make films for Warner Bros.
   In a suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, Warner accused
Sony of inducing the two executives to breach their agreement so
they could take top jobs at Columbia.
   Late Friday, Sony's U.S. arm, Sony USA Inc.; Guber and Peters
and their company announced they had jointly filed a lawsuit
against Warner Bros. in connection with Sony's proposed acquisition
of Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.
   The statement failed to say where the suit was filed, and a
spokesman was unavailable to elaborate on it.
   Sony, the Japanese electronics and recorded music giant,
announced Sept. 27 that it had agreed to buy Columbia for about
$3.4 billion.
   A tender offer for Columbia's shares is to expire Nov. 6, but
Sony said it intends to name Guber and Peters co-chairmen of the
company once it is acquired. In addition, Sony also has begun a
tender offer to buy their production company, Guber-Peters
Entertainment, for $200 million.
   Earlier this week, Sony's U.S. arm, Sony USA Inc., said it has
waived a condition in its agreement to buy Guber-Peters
Entertainment that would have allowed it o terminate the agreement
if the executives were unable to obtain waivers from their
contracts with Warner.
   ``We became satisfied that the contracts represented no
impediment to the acquisition,'' Sony spokesman Jason Farrow said
Friday.
   In addition to $1 billion in damages, the Warner suit seeks
punitive damages and an injunction preventing Guber and Peters from
breaching their commitments to Warner.
   Steven J. Ross, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Warner
Bros.' parent Time-Warner Inc. said, ``We regret that Sony has
attempted to enter the U.S. motion picture industry by illegally
and willfully raiding key talent under exclusive contract to a
competitor.
   ``This conduct cannot, must not and will not be condoned,'' he
said.
   Also named as defendants in the Warner suit are Sony USA, Guber,
Peters, their company and two Sony executives, Walter Yetnikoff and
Michael Schulhof.
   Calls placed to spokesmen for Guber, Peters, Yetnikoff and
Schulhof and the company were not returned or went unanswered.
   Among other movies that Guber and Peters were involved with for
Warner have been ``The Color Purple'' and ``The Witches of
Eastwick.''
   Warner executives say the two men are involved in about 50
projects for Warner, including sequels to ``Batman'' and movie
adaptations of the books ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Bright
Shining Lie.''

   The biggest selloff since the crash of 1987
rocked the stock market Friday, driving prices into a free-fall
decline following news that a big buyout deal for UAL Corp. had
fallen through.
   The sudden slide came almost exactly two years after a similar
Friday-afternoon rout that preceded Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987.
   But many Wall Streeters insisted it was far too soon to declare
that another collapse was in the making.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190.58 points,
or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. That marked its second biggest point
drop ever, exceeded only by the 508-point loss recorded on Black
Monday.
   On Monday of this week the average stood at a record closing
high of 2,791.41.
   The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most
of Friday's session until the group planning to buy UAL said it had
been unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had
planned.
   That quickly cast a pall over shares of UAL and other companies
that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals.
   Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve
among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the
market for high-yielding ``junk'' bonds.
   Earlier, the Labor Department reported that the producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly
reversing a series of declines through the summer months.
   The UAL news ``was the trigger for the whole thing,'' said
Newton Zinder, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Also,
it's October. Memories of 1987 are still very vivid.''
   But ``this time it's different,'' asserted Jim Craig, portfolio
manager of the Janus Fund and the Janus Venture Fund, two
Denver-based mutual funds, who said he was a heavy buyer of
selected stocks late Friday.
   ``Interest rates have been on the decline, and
non-takeover-related stocks are not overvalued,'' Craig said.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 251.17 million
shares, up from 160.12 million in the previous session and the
heaviest total since 254.87 million were traded on Jan. 27.
   UAL shares were down 5{ at 279} when trading in them was halted
in the New York markets after the news of the buyout problem broke.
A dealer at one brokerage firm said the shares were being quoted in
London in a range of 230 to 240.
   Among other stocks involved in plans or speculation about
possible buyout deals or other corporate transactions, Paramount
Communications fell 7] to 55~; Delta Air Lines 7} to 69\; Warner
Communications 5[ to 61{, and USX 4] to 33.
   As the crunch hit, however, blue-chip issues not involved in any
takeover talk also took a drubbing. International Business Machines
fell 6[ to 101{; General Electric 3{ to 54]; Procter &amp; Gamble 8} to
120}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 2} to 40, and DuPont 7{ to 113.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $189.57 billion, or 5.44
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 11.42 to 185.56.
   Declining issues swamped advances by about 11 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 153 up,
1,600 down and 228 unchanged. Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed
issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 288.43 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 25.72 to 379.68, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 21.74 at 333.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 14.90 to 467.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 378.45, down 16.56.

   A failing airline buyout knocked the stock
market off its record-setting pace with a sudden dive that erased
more than 190 points from the Dow Jones industrial average and
conjured memories of the 1987 crash.
   Nearly $200 billion was wiped out from the paper value of stocks
as more than 250 million shares changed hands on Friday.
   Over 100 million shares were traded in the last hour following
an announcement that the employee-led, highly leveraged buyout of
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. had come unglued.
   The widely watched Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the biggest point drop since the
crash of 1987.

   Junk bond prices plunged as financing problems
for a major airline buyout widened fears over a possible collapse
of the slumping $200 billion market of the high-yield securities.
   News that bidders had failed to raise financing for the planned
$6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp. also spread panic Friday that
billions of dollars in other planned debt-financed deals would have

   The pilot-management group attempting to buy UAL
Corp. said it could not get financing for its $6.75 billion deal.
   The group issued a statement Friday that banks managing the
financing for the proposed $300 a share acquisition of the company
indicated they had not received sufficient commitments to complete
the buyout at that price.
   But the group _ which also includes British Airways PLC _ stated
it expected to revise the proposal and continue its attempts to buy

   A sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a
rebound in wholesale price inflation in September, wiping out three
rare monthly declines this summer, the government said.
   The 0.9 percent increase Friday in the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index, measuring inflation one stop short of the
retail level, represented a return to the high inflation rates
experienced in the first five months of the year.
   In another economic report, the Commerce Department said retail
sales rose a stronger-than-expected 0.5 percent last month, the

   A plunge in General Motors Corp. car and light

   Economic growth in 1990 will slump to
its slowest pace in eight years with an outright recession a
distinct threat unless the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates,
the nation's top business executives forecast.
   The Business Council, composed of the chief executives of 100 of
the country's largest corporations, said Friday the economy began
to lose steam this summer. They predicted the sluggish period would
last through much of next year.

   The biggest selloff since the crash of 1987 rocked the stock
market Friday, driving prices into a free-fall decline following
news that a big buyout deal for UAL Corp. had fallen through. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190.58 points, or 6.91
percent, to 2,569.26.
   Currency dealers pounded down the dollar in hectic selling
incited by the stock plunge.
   Bond prices rocketed higher in heavy trading afternoon as
investors fled the panicky stock market.
   Tumbling stock prices triggered temporary trading halts for
stock-index futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in a drop
that mirrored a near-record selloff on Wall Street; orange juice
futures plunged; and crude oil futures jumped higher.

<HEAD>Lang Completes Deal for Ms., Sassy Magazines; Plans to Publish Ad-Free
Ms.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magazine investor Dale W. Lang said Friday he
had completed his previously-disclosed plans to acquire control of
Ms. and Sassy magazines, and said he plans to begin publishing Ms.
without advertising.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but officials familiar
with the transaction said it gives Lang a 70 percent interest in
Matilda Publications, the company that has run both magazines for
the past year.
   The remaining 30 percent interest is held by Citicorp Venture
Capital Partners.
   Ms., which has been an advocate for women's causes, has not been
profitable in its 17 years of publication and has often been at
odds with advertisers, Lang said.
   ``We understand the advertising community's difficulty with
buying advertising in an advocacy magazine, but it's a major
problem in growing the magazine to profitability,'' he said.
   ``In order to serve the reader, Ms. must be published without
external pressures,'' he said, explaining the decision to quit
taking advertising.
   Ms. is currently a monthly magazine with a circulation of
550,000.
   Sassy, launched in March 1988 with a rate base of 250,000, has
grown since to a circulation of 450,000. It is aimed at teenage
girls.

<HEAD>Remarkable Parallels Exist Between Friday's Drop and 1987 Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spooky deja vu pervaded the financial markets as
a wave of panic selling swept Wall Street and evoked unsettling
parallels with the stock crash of October 1987.
   The collapse two years ago, which rocked the financial markets
and wiped out around $500 billion in wealth, haunted the memories
of stock traders Friday as the market sustained another body blow.
   ``Nobody believes in witchcraft, but we're seeing the same type
of phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago,'' said
Michael Evans, a private economist in Washington, and president of
Evans Economics Inc. ``Obviously, people are going to lose some
money.''
   Friday's drop was of a similar magnitude to the market's slide
on Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, three days before Black Monday. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled around 190 points, or 6.9
percent, compared with its 108-point, 4-percent, slide on Oct. 16.
   The events surrounding the two market breaks show remarkable
similarities that go well beyond size and the fact that they
happened at the same time of year. At both times, for example, the
United States was agonizing over its monetary policy and interest
rates overseas were headed higher.
   In the fall of 1987 it was then-Treasury Secretary James Baker
and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg wrangling over
exchange-rate policy. In recent weeks, the Federal Reserve and the
Treasury have been squabbling over how to drive down the dollar _
which has defied efforts by the big industrial powers to reduce its
value.
   Closer to home, it's deja vu as the administration wrestles
again with the intractable budget deficit and inflationary
pressures.
   This time, a dispute over the capital-gains tax cut pushed by
President Bush has delayed Senate debate on a related $14 billion
deficit-cutting bill. Unless that legislation is passed by Monday,
automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs _ expected to
total about $16 billion _ will take effect.
   And inflation is rearing its head. The government reported
Friday that a sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a rebound
in wholesale price inflation in September, wiping out three rare
monthly declines this summer.
   The congressional morass surrounding the capital gains issue is
reminiscent of the battle two years ago over interest deductions
for borrowing for corporate takeovers.
   Mergers and acquisitions, a hot issue in late 1987 and red-hot
now, played a key role in both situations. Back then, the markets
fretted that Congress would hem in leveraged buyouts with
restrictions. Now, the ability of their organizers to finance the
takeovers is being questioned and has the market spooked.
   That fear mushroomed into the catalyst for Friday's plunge, as
the pilot-management group proposed to take over UAL Corp. for
$6.75 billion admitted that it couldn't secure the needed financing.
   On both Fridays, computer-driven program trading exacerbated the
panic and swelled the selling wave. But it was much more of a
factor on Oct. 16, 1987 than Friday _ when the UAL announcement and
anxiety over the market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds threw
the market into a nose dive.

   Panic stock selling isn't likely to jolt the
economy much beyond Wall Street, but if the losses deepen the
effect could become more profound, economists and investors say.
   ``I'll sleep just as good tonight as I did last night,'' said G.
B. Mann, a 78-year-old retiree from Dallas with a portfolio of more
than $1 million, after a panic selloff Friday that sent the Dow
Jones Industrial average to its second steepest single-day point
loss ever, down 190.58 to 2,569.26.
   He estimated Friday's market break cost him $10,000.
   The one-day loss would likely have little immediate effect on
most households. But if the selling spilled into future sessions,
some economists worried that consumer spending could plunge and the
health of small businesses could be affected.
   For the most part, investors, especially long-time ones with
experience with the market's ups and downs, seemed unperturbed.
   ``It really will not have a major effect on my lifestyle,'' said
Ernest Harden, who has a computer software and consulting business
in Jacksonville, Fla. and puts his market holdings at $400,000.
   ``At this point I'm not deeply concerned. Since I'm a long-term
investor, I'm not going to get excited. I'll ride it through,'' he
said.
   Thomas O'Hara, executive director of the National Association of
Investors Corp., the country's largest group representing small
investors, said he saw little panic among traders in the aftermath
of Friday's losses.
   ``An awful lot of our investors have been here before,'' O'Hara
said in an interview in Minneapolis where his group was holding a
convention.
   ``Among the new investors, you'll find some people who are
definitely disappointed, but most of our members weren't planning
on selling their stocks tomorrow,'' he said.
   ``If it stops here, the impact will be small,'' said Robert
Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University. ``As far
as the behavior of households, the impact would be trivial. Even
the huge crash of October '87 had a discernible impact but not an
enormous effect on household behavior and consumption.''
   But he and others worried that if the market slump continued,
small businesses trying to raise capital might find that harder,
and sustained stock market losses could eventually take a bite out
of housing, car and durable goods sales.
   ``Things can mushroom,'' Eisner said. ``I would hope things can
be stopped quickly.''
   Since Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow average dropped a record 508
points, small investor portfolios have risen 26.8 percent,
according to Money Magazine's Small Investor Index, an average
annual return of 12.7 percent.
   ``To me the sad part is that more people will be scared away. It
has a bad effect on the people who just joined the market or were
thinking of joining it, and we need those people,'' said O'Hara.
   Avner Arbel, a Cornell University stock market expert, said in
an interview this week that his biggest worry is the impact of
market losses on small companies, which make up about one-third of
the business market.
   He said their stocks are priced relatively high, their earnings
are extremely volatile, and their growth in sales and profits is
generally poor.
   ``Small companies really represent the financial future of this
country,'' Arbel said. ``Traditionally, that's the sector of the
economy where growth and innovation come from. Weakness in the
sector is equivalent to weakness in our youth. It's highly
significant for the future.''
   In an even more pessimistic assessment, Ravi Batra, professor of
international economics at Southern Methodist University and author
of ``The Great Depression of 1990,'' said the market plunge could
augur ``the coming Great Depression.''
   ``There's an extremely high concentration of debt. There are too
many poor people and too many rich people. The ocean of debt is
very vast.''

   The plunge in stock prices left Wall Street
workers dazed, grim and debating whether another crash is coming
Monday.
   One man stood on a street corner across from the New York Stock
Exchange Friday, shook his head and said to a friend, ``I'm trying
to figure out whether I got my head handed to me.''
   Some financial workers went to drown their sorrows at Houlihan's
bar, around the corner from the exchange.
   One trader put down his beer, spread his hands two feet apart
and said: ``I've got a hole in my underwear this big.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 190.58
points Friday. Nearly $200 billion was wiped out from the paper
value of stocks as more than 250 million shares changed hands.
   Almost exactly two years ago, on Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, the Dow
Jones average dropped 108 points. That Monday _ Black Monday, Oct.
19, 1987 _ it plummeted 508 points.
   Some predicted a similar crash next week.
   ``There's going to be a huge selloff on Monday,'' said another
Houlihan's patron, John Durand, a bank stocks trader.
   ``I thought it was all over two years ago. But I never thought
it would happen again,'' said Anthony, a stock exchange floor
reporter who would not give his last name, as he left the building
after Friday's closing bell.
   ``I need a drink,'' he added.
   But stockbroker Bernard Klein was defiantly optimistic: ``This
is not going to be like Black Monday. The market is going to stick
on Monday, absolutely. What we had today was just panic selling.''
   Thomas Flanagan and Greg LaBorde, retail stockbrokers having an
after-work drink at the South Street Seaport near Wall Street, said
Friday's drop actually stirred up business.
   ``I got many, many buy orders at the close,'' LaBorde said. The
market drop creates bargains for investors who like to buy when
prices are low.
   LaBorde dismissed comparisons with the 1987 disaster.
   ``There were a lot more problems with the economy back then,''
he said.
   ``This time, it's nothing really,'' agreed Flanagan. ``It's just
an adjustment.''
   He added: ``We're bullish.''
   Options traders Larry Mendelson and Jeff Schure were not.
   Interviewed as they left their offices across the street from
the stock exchange, Mendelson said: ``Monday's going to be a scary
day. People have all weekend to think about this.''
   Schure added: ``Most people took hits today. One guy I know went
down for $150,000.''
   Many financial workers pointed to the failed leveraged buyout of
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. as the trigger for the plunge in
Friday's prices.
   But another patron of the South Street Seaport, Al, a bond traer
who would not give his last name, said he thought the UAL deal was
merely a symptom of a deeper illness.
   ``The country is not in the euphoric financial state everyone
says it is,'' he said. ``We've got a huge deficit and the thrift
industry is falling apart.
   ``The stock market is like a house of cards,'' he added. ``I see
more of this happening on Monday.''
