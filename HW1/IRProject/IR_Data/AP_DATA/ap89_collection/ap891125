<HEAD>Women Promise to Lift Curse From Family; Instead Make Off With $10,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women who told a man they were removing
an evil curse placed upon him and his family made off with his
$9,500 life savings plus $500 he borrowed from his daughter,
authorities said.
   The women took the $10,000 from Guadenecio Ruiz Soliven and
promised to bless it, but disappeared sometime late Wednesday,
police Detective Lt. William Gaida said Thursday.
   Soliven told authorities the scam began Monday when a
middle-aged woman stopped him on the street and told him he was
troubled by evil spirits but that she could help him.
   ``She told me a relative wanted to do something to make me get
sick and die,'' said Soliven who moved to Los Angeles from the
Philippines last March. ``She told me I could have a spiritual
healing to drive off the evil spirts. It would cure me and all my
family.''
   He said he followed the woman to a house where she and a second
woman chanted and rubbed raw eggs on him.
   The women asked for $10,000 to combat the spirits, Soliven said.
He said he took the $9,500 he had in the bank out in three separate
withdrawals over two days and borrowed another $500 from his
daughter.
   ``It was my whole life savings,'' he said. ``But they told me if
I didn't have full trust in them, the power of the ritual would be
lost.''
   The women put the money in a handkerchief to bless it, Soliven
said. When he returned to the house late Wednesday, the women were
gone.
   In the Philippines, Soliven said, black magic is powerful.
   ``People cast spells on others,'' he said. ``I've seen people
with my own eyes who suffer without any cause, and I was afraid of
this.''

   A 10-year-old boy playing Russian roulette
with his father's gun died Friday after putting the revolver to his
head and pulling the trigger as four friends urged him to put the
weapon away, authorities said.
   The boy, identified as John Thomas, loaded the .38-caliber
revolver while his mother was at the grocery store, officials said.
   The other youngsters at the Thomas home told authorities that
nothing happened the first time John pulled the trigger, but that
it went off the second time.
   The friends urged John to put the gun away, police said.
   ``All of them seemed to recognize the danger, except him,'' said
police Lt. Ronald Harvey. ``They said it was dangerous, it was
stupid and the gun could possibly go off.''
   John was pronounced dead at Children's Hospital National Medical
Center. He was the son of John and Mary Thomas.

   Justice goofed, but a near-frantic woman found
a judge who was sensitive to her holiday plight, despite his tough
reputation.
   State Judge J. Taylor Phillips said he found the woman in tears
as she was going from courthouse door to courthouse door trying to
find one open.
   The Florida woman, who had driven from Jacksonville, Fla., had
been ordered to be in Phillips' court ``without fail'' Friday
morning or risk being held in contempt, he said.
   But the person who wrote the summons was in error. The
courthouse was closed Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
   By chance, Phillips had come in to his office to catch up on
some work.
   The judge said the woman, whom he did not identify, told him she
was arrested in Macon a few weeks earlier on a minor marijuana
possession charge. Phillips, who has a reputation as being a tough
judge in drug cases, said he would fine her the usual $250.
   ``Well, you've got to accommodate folks,'' the judge said.
``Life's not meant to just stomp folks down. The longer I live, the
more convinced I am of that.''

   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford isn't concerned that
Soviet President Mikahail Gorbachev outranks her in a new poll of
Phoenix-area residents _ as long as he doesn't run next year.
   ``The Governor said it doesn't make any difference as long as
he's not in the primary or the general election in 1990,'' press
secretary Vada Manager said Friday after a poll showed Gorbachev
and U.S. President George Bush ahead of Mrs. Mofford and every
other state official in the survey.
   Bush got approval ratings from 62 percent of survey respondents,
while Gorbachev got a favorable appraisal from 56 percent.
   The telephone survey of Maricopa County residents conducted this
month by the Behavior Research Center showed 44 percent of the
respondents believed Mrs. Mofford was doing a good or excellent job.
   The survey was based on 609 interviews with adult heads of
household. Pollsters said it had a margin of error of plus or minus
4 percent.

   Archbishop Roger Mahony plans to fly to
war-torn El Salvador this weekend to deliver 20 tons of medical
supplies, food and a $100,000 check to the Archdiocese of San
Salvador.
   Mahony, whose archdiocese has been swollen with Central American
refugees, said Friday at a warehouse where the supplies were
stockpiled that the relief effort showed the bond his diocese has
with the people of El Salvador.
   The archbishop was joined by actors Mike Farrell, Martin Sheen,
singer Jackson Browne and officials of the Operation California-USA
relief organization.
   Mahony was to deliver the $500,000 worth of goods and the
$100,000 check to San Salvador Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas at El
Salvador's international airport today and then return to Los
Angeles.
   Mahony, who has called for suspension of military aid to El
Salvador, also criticized human rights abuses in the nation where
six Jesuit priests were slain last week, allegedly by men wearing
army uniforms.
   ``I have to ask myself how 80,000 people have been killed, human
rights are totally disregarded and no one is ever responsible,'' he
said. ``What the church is doing is supporting the people. They're
feeding them, giving them medical aid and giving them hope.''

President Dan Quayle will play a more prominent role in response to
popular demand, the authors said.
   The first Bush comic book by Maine cartoonists Jeffrey Pert and
Thomas Wilson featured the Bushes traveling through Vacationland,
as Maine calls itself, and becoming hopelessly lost.
   The latest spoof, ``George and Barbara's Christmas Crisis,'' to

biggest Christmas tree in Maine and finding themselves in
competition with a heartless timber company.
   ``We listened to what people told us,'' Wilson said. ``We put

   Rock fans gave special thanks and some
paid more than $600 for tickets to watch former Beatle Paul
McCartney perform at a Thanksgiving concert.
   ``A man like this, you have to think of him as an old master,''
said fan Teddy Chavez, 37. ``He's like Rembrandt, Van Gogh. That's
what Paul McCartney is to modern music.''
   The concert before 15,000 people Thursday was part of a
five-night gig that marked the first time McCarney has played in
North America in 13 years.
   ``I'm 42 years old and I have been waiting 25 years for this
moment,'' said fan Donna Contreras. ``This is the epitome of my
life. Unfortunately, everything is downhill from here.''
   McCartney opened the concert with ``Figure of Eight'' from his
newest album. He followed that with ``Flowers in the Dirt,''
``Jet'' and ``Band on the Run.'' After that, Beatle songs took
center stage.

   Sardi's, the legenday Broadway theater district
restaurant, may once again be owned by Vincent Sardi.
   The new owner, Sardi's Inc., and its president, Ivan Bloch,
failed to make the monthly purchase payments to Sardi, and Judge
Burton Sherman ruled Friday that Sardi can foreclose on the note he
holds.
   Sardi sold the restaurant to Bloch and his group in 1986 for
$6.2 million with $1 million cash down.
   After one default in April, the debt was restructured. In July,
Bloch's group failed to make a required monthly payment of
$136,262.38 and Sardi sued.
   The judge said Bloch had accused Sardi of trying to grab the
restaurant back because this theater season has the potential to be
Broadway's best in years.
   But Sardi is ``not under any legal obligation to renegotiate the
terms of the note with the defendant,'' Sherman said.
   Bloch's lawyer, Howard Rubin, said he had not discussed the
ruling with his client.
   Open since 1922, Sardi's is a favorite hangout for Broadway
stars and star-gazers. Located in the heart of the theater
district, the restaurant's walls are adorned with caricatures of
stage greats.

<HEAD>Longtime Hughes Executive Hyland Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence A. ``Pat'' Hyland, the former
head of Hughes Aircraft Co. whose inventions helped pioneer radar
technology and aircraft communications, died Friday. He was 92.
   Hyland died at Antelope Valley Hospital, where he had been
admitted Tuesday following a heart attack, Hughes spokesman Bill
Herrman said.
   Hyland served as vice president and chief executive officer at
Hughes from 1954 to 1976. He was named the aerospace firm's
president and chairman of the board after founder Howard Hughes
died in 1976.
   Throughout, however, Hyland ran the company. He retired in 1984,
assuming the title of chairman emeritus, and continued to work out
of his office several times a week.
   Under Hyland's tenure, Hughes grew from a modest producer of
airborne fire control systems to the nation's largest defense
electronics company and a leading builder of communications
satellites.
   Hyland held an early patent that contributed to the development
of radio detection and imaging, or radar, which bounces radio
signals off distant objects to determine their location.
   Hyland was born in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Aug.
26, 1897, and came with his family to the United States at the age
of 2.
   He served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during
World War I, receiving five battle stars for his service with the
Second Division in France He joined the U.S. Navy, where he worked
as a chief radioman between 1920 and 1926 and helped demonstrate a
blind landing system for aircraft.
   In 1926 he joined the Naval Research Laboratory as a radio
engineer and, in 1932, demonstrated the reflection of radio waves
from aircraft.
   Hyland held other patents that enabled aircraft to communicate
with each other and with the ground via radio and to determine
their altitude during blind landings. Many of his developments were
adopted in standard aircraft electronics systems.
   Hyland founded Radio Research Co. in Washington, D.C. in 1932,
heading the firm until it merged into Bendix Corp. five years
later. During a 17-year tenure with Bendix he became vice president
in charge of engineering before leaving to join Hughes.
   Hyland is survived by his wife, Muriel, and a daughter.

   Members of Drunk Drivers Against
Driving Drunk say they hope their painful experiences will
encourage others not to flirt with the dangerous pastime of
drinking and driving.
   ``We're like blood brothers,'' said member Larry Carlisle.
``We've been to the pits and now we've been able to get our lives
back together again and we want to be able to go out into the
community and tell them and explain to them why (drunken drivers)
have to be controlled. I think somebody who's been through it three
times has got a pretty good insight into it.''
   DDADD, made up of about a dozen people, including advisers, was
formed three years ago by people who had been sent to the Western
Massachusetts Correctional Center for multiple drunken driving
offenses, group coordinator Roz Canter said. However, the group is
not affiliated with the center, which was created to house the
increased number of people sent to jail when Massachusetts
toughened its drunken driving laws.
   DDADD members speak at programs for drunken driving offenders
about ``how we got there and the things that brought us to our
knees,'' Carlisle said. He said the group does not include anyone
who was involved in a fatal crash.
   ``My story was that I had a 32-year history of abuse of drugs
and alcohol and I reached a point where I was convicted of three
DUI's in the course of 18 months,'' he said.
   The loss of his home, friends and possessions coupled with a
barrage of counseling helped him admit to having a problem,
Carlisle said.
   ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``I drove many many times under the
influence of alcohol but fortunately I never hurt any one. I
cracked up cars.''
   The 51-year-old tool-and-die maker said he got away with driving
drunk for more than two decades, but tougher driving laws promoted
by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis sent him to the correctional center.
``It's the best thing that Dukakis did,'' he said.
   Despite its masculine sounding acronym, there are women in DDADD
and Carlisle said the name wasn't meant as a challenge to the
well-known MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   DDADD was formally incorporated in August under the name Former
Drunk Drivers Against Driving Drunk, Canter said.
   Anne Russell, assistant director of public affairs at the
national headquarters of MADD, in Hurst, Texas, said the concept of
former drunken drivers voluntarily engaging in educational efforts
appeared to be new.
   Ellen Nepomuceno of the local chapter of MADD said she thought
the appearance of DDADD was a good thing.
   ``They are taking responsibility now for their choices,'' she
said.
   ``The hardest part for the victim is that (drunken drivers)
never really say that they're sorry. But I think to hear a group of
people that has been driving drunk and are now really saying that
they're sorry for what they've done. ... I think it's a big step.''
   Canter said the group has kept a low profile.
   ``Basically what they do, they don't point the finger at people,
they just share their own personal experiences of what happened to
them to try to encourage other people to not have to go through the
things they went through,'' Canter said.

<TEXT>
   The quake of '89 rattled the director of an
organization dedicated to preserving the little shacks that housed
refugees from the earthquake and fire of '06.
   Jane Cryan, who founded the Society for the Preservation and
Appreciation of San Francisco Refugee Shacks, has decided to pull
up stakes and leave quake-prone California.
   ``This little society, born of the quake, has died of another,''
said Cryan, who founded the organization after she unknowingly
bought a refugee shack in the early 1980s.
   Cryan, 47, said the Oct. 17 earthquake that hit Northern
California ``threw me for a loop.''
   ``I have decided to begin life anew in my home state of
Wisconsin and am returning to my ancestral town of Oshkosh,'' said
Cryan, who also lost her job as an administrative assistant shortly
after the quake.
   ``San Francisco will undoubtedly undergo seismic upgrades that
will obliterate the shacks,'' she said. ``I couldn't bear to be
around to see it.''
   More than 60 of the 5,610 redwood cottages known to exist are
still standing, said Cryan. The cottages, some as small as 10 by 14
feet, were designed by Army engineers and built with federal funds
and donations in public parks and squares. There were 11 shack
camps around the city.
   The families were given the cottages when they moved the
structures to private land.
   There was no Richter scale when the quake hit on April 18, 1906,
but the magnitude was later figured to be 8.3. The quake and the
fire that followed killed somewhere from 700 to 2,000 people.
   Last month's temblor measured 7.1 and killed 67 people, more
than half of them on a freeway that collapsed in Oakland.
   The shacks were put into service after the 1906 quake and fire
while 25,000 people were still living in canvas Army tents in parks
around San Francisco.
   After living in the shack cities, more than 5,000 families
resettled and took their shacks with them, dragging them away with
horses. The structures ended up scattered all over the city.
   Cryan was living in one of the old cottages and didn't even know
it.
   ``Someone told me the house was a refugee cottage and I checked
it out,'' she said. ``That was about three months after I moved in.
It was three of them joined together. I got it recognized as a
landmark.''
   Cryan has accumulated shack doors, windows and other memorabilia
through the years.
   She's ``passing the society's torch'' to her friend Jo Falcon,
who is storing the items that include an architectural model of a
shack town of 22 cottages.
   Cryan says the shacks were ``the original modular housing.''
   ``They feel like homes, they make you feel safe and cozy, even
though they're small.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Appeal Dismissal of Iran-Contra Case Against CIA Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are asking a federal appeals court
to revive the criminal case against a former CIA station chief in
Central America who was caught up in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va.,
dismissed criminal charges against Joseph Fernandez on Friday,
ruling Fernandez could not get a fair trial because the Justice
Department barred use of classified materials considered important
to the defense.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's office quickly filed a
notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
Prosecutors said the ruling places Fernandez outside the law.
   ``We believe that all citizens _ including high-ranking
government officials involved in covert operations _ should be
accountable to the law,'' said associate independent counsel
Laurence Shtasel, who is prosecuting the Fernandez case.
   Prosecutors are appealing both the judge's ruling Friday and his
July decision to reject proposed substitutions for the secrets.
   Fernandez assisted former White House aide Oliver North's secret
Contra resupply effort during a congressional ban on U.S. military
aid to the Contras. The effort in Central America was financed
partly by diverted profits from secret arms sales to Iran.
   Fernandez was charged with two counts of obstruction of justice
and two counts of making false statements.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday barred courtroom
use of classified materials Fernandez said would prove his case.
The secrets _ said by the judge to be ``essential to this
defendant'' _ concern CIA stations and programs in Central America.
   Fernandez has claimed some activities to help North were
intertwined with U.S.-assisted plans by Costa Rica against possible
invasion by Nicaragua. Fernandez says, for example, that he did not
lie when he told the CIA inspector general an airstrip built by the
North network was initiated by the Costa Rican government.
   Fernandez said after Hilton's ruling Friday that he feared CIA
operatives performing ``legitimate duties'' could be subjected to a
``politically motivated prosecution.''
   ``That is a chilling message to people who put their lives on
the line every day,'' he said.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors have said much of the classified
information the government is protecting constitutes ``fictional
secrets'' which have been revealed publicly before.
   But Fernandez said the secrets would compromise national
security and added that its disclosure would have compromised
intelligence sources.
   Thornburgh suggested an agreement could be reached with Walsh to
allow a trial for Fernandez.
   ``I continue to believe that this case can be tried without
compromising the defendant's right to a fair trial or the national
security of this country,'' he said in a statement Friday. ``The
independent counsel and I agree that the district court's earlier
rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the release of
classified material constituted reversible error.''

<HEAD>Bush, Thatcher Discuss Upcoming US-Soviet Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is assuring British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher that Europe's stability will be foremost
in his mind when he meets next week with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher met for 4{ hours Friday at the
presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., to discuss a range of
topics, in particular the West's relations with Eastern European
nations that are moving towards democracy and independence from the
Soviet Union.
   ``The two leaders agreed on the need for European stability as
NATO faces the changes in Eastern Europe,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   The meeting came the week before Bush flies to the Mediterranean
for a two-day summit meeting with Gorbachev, although officials say
Mrs. Thatcher's visit was scheduled before that summit was arranged.
   The prime minister told a press conference she does not expect
``great or unusual pronouncements from this (Bush-Gorbachev)
meeting.''
   ``I don't think there will be a great deal of difficulty or
sudden surprises about this meeting,'' she said.
   As to nervousness from some quarters that Gorbachev's support
for East block reform efforts might foreshadow a diminished role
for NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``NATO is
absolutely vital'' to Europe's continued defense.
   Fitzwater described Bush and Mrs. Thatcher as ``in very close
accord in their examination of all the issues discussed today,''
which included the possible topics for Bush's Dec. 2-3 shipboard
meeting with Gorbachev off the coast of Malta.
   That included support for glasnost and perestroika, the new
Soviet openness and economic restructuring that have led to changes
within the borders of Soviet allies, he said.
   ``They both emphasized the pursuit of democracy as the first
step in the reform process,'' said Fitzwater.
   As he greeted Mrs. Thatcher at Camp David, Bush said he wanted
to get her views ``on the rapid changes in Eastern Europe and the
strength of the alliance and everything else.''
   Mrs. Thatcher in her news conference later described their talks
as ``very relaxed, very valuable.''
   Bush has sought to assure Western allies the United States would
not act unilaterally on matters of concern to Europe, such as the
role of NATO, promising them ``no surprises'' in his talks with
Gorbachev.
   Bush said in an interview with foreign journalists released
Friday that he is ``prepared to think anew'' about reducing U.S.
troop levels abroad in light of East-bloc rapid changes but won't
act unilaterally.
   Bush will meet with President Francois Mitterrand of France on
Dec. 16 in the Caribbean to discuss the summit and other issues.
French officials said the meeting would be held on the island of
St. Martin.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters she and the president did not
differ on the NATO question.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher met as Czechoslovakia's entire hardline
Communist Party leadership resigned in the wake of massive
pro-democracy protests, and Karel Urbanek, a former party leader of
the Czech republic, was elected to replace the party leader.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters she hoped to see Czechoslovakia
become a democracy. ``But the wish is not the deed and it does take
quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place.
And they must be genuine structures not just a facade,'' she said.

<HEAD>Group Unwraps Hazards in Holiday Gift Toys</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A consumer group is warning that stores
nationwide this holiday season are offering toys that violate
federal safety standards and pose a choking hazard for young
children.
   ``On this, the biggest shopping day of the year, parents should
not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are safe,'' said
Lucinda Sikes, consumer director for U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, on Friday, the start of the holiday shopping season.
   Inadequate funding and staffing for state and federal
enforcement agencies to monitor dangerous toys are one reason the
group founded by Ralph Nader blamed for the availability of the
items.
   Sikes said there are particular dangers ``for children who still
tend to put things in their mouths.''
   ``Shoppers should carefully examine toys for small parts that
break off or are detachable,'' Sikes cautioned.
   The warnings came as PIRG released its first national survey of
unsafe toys.
   Efforts to reach several toy manufacturers whose products are
named in the survey were unsuccessful.
   A spokesman for the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission
said the agency would collect and test samples of the toys and
``take appropriate action'' if needed.
   The survey, titled ``Small Parts, Big Hazards: Unsafe Toys in
the United States,'' was conducted in October and November in 105
stores in the District of Columbia, California, Connecticut,
Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Virginia.
   The report focused on small parts that are regulated by the CPSC
and which ``continue to be the leading cause of toy-related deaths
to young children,'' the group said.
   Thirty-four children died in toy-related incidents between
January 1988 and September 1989, according to CPSC figures cited in
the report.
   The report called for ``mandatory, descriptive age labeling
legislation,'' saying many toys are inappropriately labeled.
   Currently toy makers voluntarily include age labeling on toys.
However, toys intended for children under age three must meet
federal standards for small parts.
   A toy or a toy part that fits into a truncated cylinder with a
diameter of 1.25 inches and a depth ranging from 1 to 2.25 inches
fails the CPSC small parts test. The cylinder is designed to
replicate a child's windpipe, said Ken Giles, spokesman for the
CPSC.
   The toys cited were recommended for children ages 9 months to
six years or included no age label. Those recommended for children
under age three that do not meet the small parts requirements
violate government standards, Giles said.
   He said the Oregon PIRG had notified the CPSC about 12 toys it
found in stores in the state that may pose a small parts hazard.
The national survey is modeled after one conducted annually by the
Oregon group since 1986.
   Giles said the agency would collect and test samples of the 12
toys and ``take appropriate action.''
   ``We will do the same for the larger list as soon as we get
it,'' he added.

<HEAD>Darman Plan Puts Agencies on the Spot for Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House budget director Richard Darman
wants to use a novel budget review process to help the Bush
administration meet its deficit reduction goals.
   Darman, head of the Office of Management and Budget, has told
administration officials that OMB will use a two-track approach to
reviewing their budgets this year that will force them to compete
with other high-priority programs for a limited pool of extra money.
   Darman's strategy, revealed this week in a letter to agency
heads, leaves federal budget officers scrambling for ways to
convince the White House to overturn proposed OMB cuts in their
spending requests for the 1991 fiscal year.
   Many budget officers planned to be at their desks through this
weekend to meet a Monday deadline for submitting their appeals of
OMB decisions on their budgets.
   The administration is racing to meet a Jan. 8 deadline for
submitting its new budget to Congress, the first full budget
submission President Bush will get to make. Last February, he
submitted various revisions to the budget left by former President
Ronald Reagan.
   Federal agencies submitted their initial requests to OMB on
Sept. 1. Last Monday, they got the news on what reduced funding
levels OMB will be recommending.
   The OMB proposals were accompanied by a letter from Darman
explaining a new appeal process the agencies must follow in trying
to overturn budget office decisions.
   Previously, ``an agency would recommend a very big increase,''
Darman said in an interview taped Friday on the ``Evans &amp; Novak''
for broadcast on the Cable News Network. OMB ``would say, no, no,
that's too much, and then the fight would be within that range. And
there was a tendency for presidents to come along and split the
difference, so you would always be leveling up.
   ``What this is saying is, if anybody has ideas for meritorious
investment, as they see it, fine. Let's have them compete against
all other such good ideas, and in the end we'll take the best
ideas,'' said Darman.
   Part of the process is similar to previous years. Agencies will
be able to negotiate with OMB over the proposed spending
reductions. But if an agency decides to carry its appeal to the
White House, Darman has added a new twist.
   The appeal will automatically toss the program onto a second
budget track in which the increased spending will be competing with
other programs that are bidding for higher spending.
   In his letter, first revealed in Friday's Washington Post,
Darman said the agencies seeking increases ``will have to compete
with each other ... for resources that are in a limited pool.''
   Darman assured Cabinet secretaries that ``you will have an
opportunity to present your views directly to the president prior
to his decision.''
   But agency budget officials said Darman's strategy puts the
budget office in a strong negotiating position to defend its
recommended cuts.
   For one thing, the amount of time Bush will have to devote to
budget appeal hearings will be limited by other issues the
president must address, such as the upcoming Soviet summit. Given
the Jan. 8 deadline for submitting a budget to Congress, all
spending decisions will have to be made by mid-December.
   ``There will be limited opportunities for even making
presentations to the president, given his travel schedule,'' said
one budget officer, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   In a meeting with reporters earlier in the week, Darman stressed
the administration is facing a big challenge in meeting a goal to
reduced the deficit to $64 billion.
   That deficit target is for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins
next Oct. 1. The administration reached agreement with Congress
this week on $14.6 billion in deficit cuts aimed at meeting this
year's overall Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $100 billion.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is beginning a
trip to Europe today that will include discussions of fast-moving
events in Eastern Europe with NATO defense ministers at a meeting
in Brussels.
   Cheney is traveling first to the Netherlands, where he will meet
with the Dutch prime minister and visit an American military unit
before proceeding to Belgium for the annual NATO Defense Planning
Committee meeting Nov. 28-29.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the NATO agenda includes discussion of issues such
as cost-sharing, arms control and defense planning and the ongoing
negotiations to reduce conventional forces in Europe.
   But, the official added, ``Overwhelming the agenda is what's
going on in Eastern Europe. ... Our European friends feel the same
excitement we do.''
   Despite the rapid moves Soviet Bloc countries are making towards
democracy, the official said Cheney's overall message is to
``reaffirm the need for NATO.''
   He added the United States has pledged to maintain its financial
commitment to NATO through 1990. This comes as the Pentagon is
drawing up plans that would slash planned increases in U.S. defense
spending by $180 billion in the 1992-1994 budget years.

<HEAD>Secretary Derwinski Delays Agent Orange Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans' Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski
says he won't decide before March whether to grant disability
payments to Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski said Friday he won't make his decision until the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta releases the results of a
study begun in 1985. The study is expected in March.
   After a Nov. 3 advisory committee meeting, Derwinski had
promised a decision in a few weeks.
   CDC epidemiologists in 1985 launched a major study of the health
records of thousands of veterans to see if they were at increased
risk of five types of cancer: lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and
nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer.
   The advisory committee said after reviewing more than 30 studies
that it could not find a statistically significant relationship
between a rare cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and exposure to the
chemicals used in the defoliant Agent Orange.
   In May, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the
department had been too strict in denying disability benefits on
the grounds there was no proof that those chemicals caused the
illnesses cited by some 34,000 veterans.
   Instead, the judge said the department need only find
statistically significant associations between exposure and
illness. Derwinski decided not to appeal the decision.
   Derwinski said in a statement Friday that several committee
members had said the CDC study could weigh heavily in their
recommendations.
   ``I am as determined now to resolve this issue as I was when I
decided not to appeal the court decision, but it is logical to wait
for a few extra months for the results of the CDC cancer study,''
he said.
   Agent Orange, used in Vietnam to strip vegetation cover used by
guerrillas, has been blamed by veterans' groups for many disorders,
particularly cancer, because it was contaminated with dioxins, a
byproduct of its manufacture.
   Some of the 75 dioxin compounds are among the most powerful
causes of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, but it has
never been proven they can cause cancer in humans.
   Exposure to dioxin in high concentrations is known to cause
chloracne, a skin disorder, and recent work has led some scientists
to suspect dioxin may also cause birth defects.
   In 1986, Congress required the Veterans Administration to give
hospital care to any veteran exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam
unless the VA found some other cause for his disability.

<HEAD>Casino Owner Betting on Program to Help Compulsive Gamblers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like the addict who admits he has a problem, a
casino operator has conceded that compulsive gambling is a disease
and some of its patrons and employees are infected.
   So far, Harrah's Corp. stands alone in Nevada in its public
confession that the state's No. 1 industry and its biggest taxpayer
is more than recreational fun for up to six million Americans.
   ``We didn't know if it existed,'' said William Sherman, Harrah's
general counsel and chairman of an employee task force that studied
compulsive gambling for more than a year before recommending the
company help addicts.
   Last month, Harrah's posted signs in its five Nevada casinos
telling people how to get help for gambling problems. The company
also agreed to pay one year's costs to operate a hotline to take
those calls.
   ``Our role in the problem gambling issue is not to change
anyone's behavior, but simply to provide help for people who might
have a gambling problem,'' said Harrah's President Phil Satre.
   As many as 12 percent of Nevada casino employees are compulsive
gamblers, according to some estimates. Seven percent to 9 percent
of Nevadans share the problem, compared to 2 percent to 5 percent
of the general U.S. population.
   To those who find it dicey for a casino owner to be helping
people overcome a disease that seems to boost business, Satre
responds that treatment could diminish employee absenteeism, petty
theft and misconduct.
   Casinos would be better off without addicted gamblers who are
trouble because they can run up huge debts and sometimes become
angry or abusive when on a losing streak, he said.
   ``Helping employees and guests with this problem is both the
right thing to do and also a very good businesses decision, not
only for Harrah's but for the entire gaming industry,'' Satre said.
   Atlantic City, N.J., casinos have had such hotlines in place
since gaming began in 1978, and spend $300,000 a year to help
compulsive gamblers. In Nevada, casinos have all but ignored
gambling addicts since betting was legalized 58 years ago.
   For the state, which receives more than half its annual revenues
from casino taxes, declaring gambling a problem would be akin to
admitting some of the golden eggs laid by the gaming goose are
really fool's gold, said Jerry Higgins, executive director of the
Gaming Industry Association.
   ``For now, I think most of the casinos are watching the Harrah's
program to see what kind of effect it has,'' he said.
   Casinos paid $73.6 million into the state treasury on earnings
of $1.21 billion in the July-September quarter, according to the
state Gaming Control Board.
   Dian Edwards, volunteer executive director of the Nevada Council
on Compulsive Gambling, which runs the Las Vegas-based hotline,
said most Nevada casino operators are like the addicted gambler who
denies he has a problem.
   ``We just need to do a lot more education because there's still
this Wild West mentality out there that gambling's just fun,'' she
said.
   Ms. Edwards said the month-old hotline gets three to five calls
daily.
   Most calls come from friends and family of addicted gamblers,
she said. The ones from bettors don't last long.
   ``There's a real problem of denial involved in this just like
for alcohol and drug addicts,'' said Ms. Edwards, a mental health
therapist.
   Only one certified hospital exists in Nevada to help compulsive
gamblers, she said, and insurance companies don't recognize the
problem as a disease like alcoholism or drug addiction.
   ``We're just in the beginning stages of addressing this
problem,'' she said.
   Ms. Edwards said publicity about Pete Rose, the Cincinnati Reds
manager suspended for life from baseball for betting on the game,
has helped gained legitimacy for people treating compulsive
gambling.
   According to various studies, the typical gambler is male betwen
the ages of 20 and 40, lives with his spouse and has at least a
high school education.
   ``I can walk through a casino and tell you who the compulsive
gamblers are,'' she added. ``They're mesmerized by the machines.
They're in love with them. They can't take their eyes off them.
It's frightening.''

   A foster mother of 10 children was killed in
a gun battle between her son and four men that erupted over a
soured drug deal, police said.
   The foster children in the care of Elsie Jackson, 59, were
herded into a basement by relatives during the fight early Friday
and were not hurt. Mrs. Jackson's son, Darryl Ross, and another man
were injured, witnesses and police said.
   According to witnesses, the men broke into Mrs. Jackson's home
and confronted Ross during a family Thanksgiving party in the city
in northeastern Ohio.
   Ross, 25, and Moses Williams, 36, apparently shot each other,
the Stark County Sheriff's Department said.
   Williams will be charged with murder, said chief sheriff's
deputy Bruce Umpleby. Three other men will be charged with
complicity to aggravated burglary, he said.
   Mrs. Jackson was shot in the chest when she tried to persuade
Williams to leave the house, deputies said.
   Mrs. Jackson's daughter, Veronica Early, said the foster
children, ages 9 months to 16 years, were sleeping upstairs when
the shooting began. They awoke and came downstairs but were rushed
by relatives to safety in the basement, Ms. Early said.
   The children were placed in other foster homes by the county
Department of Human Services, the agency said.

died of cancer at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.
   Lenihan died Thursday at the age of 75.
   She joined the Navy in 1943, when WAVES, which stood for Women
Appointed for Voluntary Service, was still new.
   While serving as a newly commissioned ensign, Lenihan, who had
majored in Latin at the College of St. Elizabeth in Morristown,
N.J., wrote the motto for the coat of arms for WAVES officers:
``Honoris Est Nobis Navare Navales,'' which means ``It is an honor

   Lenihan, a native of Monroe, N.Y., spent most of her career in
Washington, although she also was stationed in Newport, R.I., and
in London.
   Her military decorations include the Legion of Merit.

<TEXT>
   The five Discovery astronauts
worked under a shroud of secrecy today while testing the shuttle's
control systems in preparation for a Sunday landing in the Mojave
Desert.
   A news blackout ordered by the military has prevented NASA from
talking about its classified mission, but sources said the crew's
main goal was to deploy a spy satellite.
   Discovery is scheduled to land Sunday at 7:02 p.m. PST at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. It will be the third after-dark
landing in 32 shuttle flights.
   While the Johnson Space Center has been mum about all aspects of
the mission since Thursday, it is assumed that the commander and
pilot Friday tested the shuttle's flight control systems and
steered thrusters to make sure they are ready for the trip back
home _ a fiery, hourlong dive through the Earth's atmosphere.
   Besides deploying a spy satellite, the Discovery astronauts
reportedly have been conducting experiments for the Strategic
Defense Initiative missile defense system. Neither NASA nor the
Pentagon would discuss the release of the satellite or other
mission objectives.
   The last official status report _ issued Thursday night by
Mission Control in Houston _ stated that the ``crew is doing well
and the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily.''
   Sources close to the project said the astronauts had
accomplished their main goal of deploying a 2{-ton, $300 million
satellite capable of monitoring military and diplomatic
communications in the Soviet Union, the Middle East, Africa and
Europe.
   The Discovery mission is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated
solely to military research.
   Discovery is commanded by Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory.
The crew includes Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and three
mission specialists: Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

<TEXT>
   Karel Urbanek, an obscure, unknown
bureaucrat picked Friday as the new Communist Party chief,
represents the party's best hope of restoring the authority it has
lost in two decades of hard-line policy.
   News that his predecessor, Milos Jakes, had resigned brought a
throng of people into the streets of Prague in a spontaneous
explosion of joy.
   Reaction to the choice of Urbanek, however, was reserved.
   Urbanek, 48, joined the old 13-man Politburo 13 months ago.
   Since then, according to a senior Western diplomat, Urbanek has
spent much of his time traveling in the provinces and apparently
has gained support from regional party chiefs.
   His most recent responsibilities as head of a new council for
the party in the Czech republic should have given him clear insight
into the state of the economy and the party's standing in Bohemia
and his native Moravia.
   Urbanek's greatest asset is his relative obscurity. Under
Communist Party custom, the general secretary must come from
Politburo ranks.
   Of the 13 men available, Urbanek was one of the few not directly
associated with the unpopular hard-line policies in place since
1968, and thus has a chance to restore the party's flagging
standing.
   The official CTK news agency said Urbanek was elected general
secretary in a secret ballot of the Central Committee, with 136
votes for and seven against. It was not known if there were any
abstentions.
   What little is known of Urbanek suggests that in the past he has
been an orthodox Communist.
   In an article in the party weekly Tribuna in March, Urbanek took
the standard line of acknowledging shortcomings in the present
system but excluding independent groups from dialogue.
   He wrote that prominent dissidents ``are not concerned with
democracy, freedom and the environment, with dialogue in the realm
of Socialism, but with a return to capitalism with all the
consequences this would have for our country.
   ``It is therefore impossible to give in to them,'' he wrote.
   Born March 22, 1941, at Bojkovice in south Moravia to a peasant
family, Urbanek joined the Communist Party in 1963, studied at an
industrial school and joined Czechoslovak railways as a station
master in his hometown in 1970.
   In 1973, he became part of the regional Communist Party
committee in south Moravia while studying part-time at the party's
institute in Prague.
   By 1982, he had risen to head the Communist Party in Brno, the
capital of Moravia and Czechoslovakia's third-largest city.
   In March 1988, he made it onto the influential Central Committee
apparatus.
   Seven months later, he vaulted on to the ruling party Politburo
in a reshuffle that saw four other men named to the ruling body.
   At the same time, he was made head of the newly created
Committee for Party Work in the Czech Republic, which until then
had not had its own Communist Party organization _ something that
existed in Slovakia since 1969. He also was named head of a Central
Committee commission for the political system in Czechoslovakia.
   Other details of his personal life were not known.

   The skipper of the Exxon Valdez will
try to get his case dismissed by claiming immunity from prosecution
and seeking to have the results of a sobriety test thrown out of
court.
   Joseph Hazelwood is expected to return to Alaska for a hearing
on the motions in the Anchorage Superior Court that begins Monday
and could last up to two weeks. His trial is set for Jan. 22.
   The 43-year-old mariner from Huntington, N.Y., was fired by
Exxon soon after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a Prince William
Sound reef March 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   The worst oil spill in U.S. history blackened pristine shores,
killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted
lucrative fishing seasons. Exxon said it spent more than $1 billion
on oil spill claims and cleanup work, and state officials say the
cleanup still is not finished.
   Hazelwood faces misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil, and three felony counts of criminal mischief. If convicted of
the three felonies, he faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years
in prison and $100,000 in fines.
   The case was moved from Valdez to Anchorage because of concerns
publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an
impartial jury in Valdez. The southcentral Alaska port town relies
heavily on the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial
fishing interests.
   Defense motions include claims that Hazelwood received immunity
from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and oil
spill the morning it happened. A law designed to encourage
self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills
provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend.
They say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against
Hazelwood grew from his report to the Coast Guard that the Exxon
Valdez was aground and leaking oil.
   State lawyers have pointed out that it would have been hard for
the massive oil spill to go undiscovered.
   Another defense motion asserts that the sobriety test Hazelwood
failed about 10 hours after the ship struck Bligh Reef was
administered improperly, and that the results cannot be used as
evidence.
   Defense lawyers say the sample was obtained so long after the
grounding that it did not provide a sound measure of Hazelwood's
condition at the time of the wreck.

   Two commandos from the elite
Bracamonte Battalion materialize out of the shadows near a Jesuit
parish house.
   They stop a departing visitor.
   ``Who are you looking for?'' one demands coldly. ``What do you
want? Show me your identification.''
   The church is suspect in El Salvador, denounced by the right and
persecuted as subversive because it has become a force for social
change, a voice that denounces rights abuses.
   It threatens the status quo in a country where a handful are
wealthy and the majority live in ignorance, poverty and disease and
those who try to change things risk torture and death.
   It is also a country torn by a civil war pitting a leftist
guerrilla force against a succession of U.S.-backed governments _ a
war that has taken more than 71,000 lives.
   After the massacre of six Jesuit priests last week, Attorney
General Mauricio Colorado accused Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas
and auxiliary Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez of fomenting leftist
violence.
   He wrote to Pope John Paul II that the prelates should be pulled
out of El Salvador for their own good.
   The clerics, he said, have ``persisted in keeping alive the
questionable ideology of the `church of the poor''' and are blamed
for ``much of the violence that has devastated El Salvador for many
years and culminated in the rebel actions of this week ...''
   More than 1,000 people were killed in the 11-day offensive.
   A dozen years ago, a Jesuit activist, the Rev. Rutilio Grande,
asked what would happen if Jesus came to El Salvador.
   ``They'd accuse him of being a rebel, a foreign Jew, of getting
mixed up in exotic and strange ideas ... they'd crucify him,''
Grande said in a homily in the rural parish where he worked among
the poor.
   He was dead less than a month later, gunned down by a death
squad on his way to say Mass.
   Grande was one of the first priests to fall in the bloody
attempt to suppress church activism in El Salvador. Dozens of
priests, nuns and lay workers have been murdered since, including
the six Jesuit academics. Teachers, nurses, doctors, social
workers, academics _ all are suspect.
   Grande's life and death symbolized the new role for the Roman
Catholic Church in El Salvador.
   For hundreds of years, the church had worked with the Spanish
conquerors and colonial rulers and with the oligarchs that
followed. Ignore the misery of life on earth, it taught, and await
your celestial reward. There were few dissenting voices.
   In 1968, a Latin American bishop's conference in Medellin,
Colombia, decided the church should tend the material needs of the
poor as well as their spiritual needs, calling it a ``preferential
option for the poor.''
   Instead of counseling forbearance from the sidelines, many
clerics now felt their duties included standing at the side of
parishioners trying to do things such as organize peasant
cooperatives that might ease their crushing poverty.
   As war devastated El Salvador, the importance of churches and
church workers, both Catholic and Protestant, grew.
   Churches are virtually the only humanitarian institutions that
have continued to function throughout a decade of bitter civil war
between leftist guerrillas and a series of U.S.-backed governments.
   In a nation where political violence has fragmented families and
displaced hundreds of thousands, the only place to turn is often a
church. In some rural areas churches and church workers are the
only source of social services, health care and education as well
as spiritual nourishment.
   The church is also at the heart of the intellectual life of this
Massachusetts-sized nation of 5 million. The university where the
priests were massacred is one of the most respected institutions of
higher learning in Central America.
   El Salvador's right _ wealthy landowners and businessmen and
their military allies _ have raged at the sight of the church's
inherent power and influence standing shoulder-to-shoulder with
ideas they consider subversive.
   While the many in the churches blame the war on social and
economic factors, the right blames the conflict on those who try to
change them.
   ``The general feeling of the government is that all humanitarian
service groups in the country have sympathy for the rebels,'' the
Rev. Richard Potter, head of the Episcopal Church's partnership
officer for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in New York this
week after 19 layworkers at the Episcopal refugee center in San
Salvador were arrested.
   The country's only Episcopal pastor, the Rev. Luis Berrano
Laurente, was arrested the next day, Monday. The human rights
monitoring group America's Watch said Friday he was still in
custody.
   As the Salvadoran Roman Catholic church has supported its poor
parishioners, foreign priests, nuns, ministers, missionaries,
doctors, nurses, social worker and teachers have joined them.
   Episcopal, Lutheran, Baptist and Mennonite churches were on the
rosters of the dozens of churches, church schools, refuges and
social offices raided by authorities during the rebel offensive.
Americans, West Germans, Canadians, Spaniards and Guatemalans were
among those detained or deported.
   Many _ both Salvadorans and foreigners _ have fled, many have
gone into hiding in the past two weeks. But even so, they say the
work of the churches is not over.
   ``They feel needed here. And the more they are persecuted, the
more needed they feel,'' said an American academic with extensive
experience in El Salvador.

   America's taste for the hard stuff has plummeted
to its lowest level in three decades.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Friday that
per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986 was 0.85
gallons, the lowest since 1959, when it was 0.84 gallons.
   ``The decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in
the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinking-aged
population,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
   ``These changes were reflected by greater interest in beverages
with reduced alcohol content (light beers and wine coolers), as
well as increased public awareness regarding physical fitness,
nutrition and alcohol abuse.''
   Complete statistics were available through 1986. Preliminary
statistics indicate the decline continued in 1987, to 0.83 gallons,
said researcher Darryl Bertolucci of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Administration.
   The CDC said the drop in consumption of distilled spirits
between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since 1956, as measured in
both actual cases sold and the percentage of the decrease. But the
exact statistics behind those conclusions were unavailable Friday.
   In the United States, the CDC said, per-capita consumption of
ethanol _ the actual alcohol in alcoholic beverages _ was 2.58
gallons from all beverages in 1986, the lowest since 2.64 gallons
in 1977.
   Two of three American adults drink, but a relatively small
number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic
beverages.
   The CDC said 10 percent of drinkers, or just 6.5 percent of the
U.S. adult population, account for half of all the alcohol consumed
in the nation.
   Public health officials defined heavy drinking as an average of
one ounce or more of ethanol each day _ about two beers, cocktails
or glasses of wine. Such drinkers, the CDC said, run a seven-times
greater risk of liver cirrhosis than occasional alcohol drinkers.
   The CDC said at least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among
U.S. men and at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women
are attributable to heavy drinking.
   The agency reported Friday that 26,151 Americans died of chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986; 42 percent of those deaths
were associated with alcohol.
   High rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered
across the country, topped by 31 such deaths per 100,000 residents
in Washington, D.C. Lowest was Arkansas, with six deaths per
100,000 people.
   In another 13,475 deaths, the CDC said, chronic liver disease
was a ``contributing cause.''

   A policeman on trial for two deaths that sparked a
race riot shot a motorcyclist in self-defense as he twisted to
avoid being hit by the vehicle, the officer's partner testified.
   Officer Dawn Campell said she was only a few feet behind William
Lozano the night of the Jan. 16 shooting. Lozano, 31, is Hispanic
and the two victims on the motorcycle were black.
   Prosecution witnesses had testified Ms. Campbell was on the
sidewalk and ducked down behind their patrol car at the moment of
the shooting.
   But on Friday she insisted she was in the middle of the street
when she heard sirens, then spotted the motorcycle speeding toward
Lozano at about 70 mph with another police car in pursuit.
   ``I saw the motorcycle come into the southbound lane, heading
straight for officer Lozano,'' she testified. ``As the motorcycle
got right up on him, I heard a `pop,' and saw officer Lozano give a
twisting movement.''
   She said the motorcycle passed within about a foot of Lozano,
who twisted to escape being hit.
   Prosecutors claim the motorcyclist did not threaten Lozano.
   The driver, Clement Lloyd, 23, died instantly with a bullet in
his head. His passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, was critically
injured when the out-of-control motorcycle crashed. Blanchard died
the next day.
   Assistant State Attorney Don Horn asked if, despite departmental
rules, Ms. Campbell had talked to Lozano immediately after the
incident. She denied discussing the case and said she didn't recall
a conversation at the scene among her, Lozano, and a friend,
officer Manny Gonzalez.
   Horn then showed photographs of the three officers apparently
talking and making gestures just after the shooting. In one, Lozano
appeared to be standing in the position the defense says he
occupied at the time of the shooting, but Ms. Campbell denied they
were reenacting the scene. She and Lozano were together, she said,
because they had been ordered to find the spent shell casing.
   Prior to Ms. Campbell's testimony, defense attorney Roy Black
called the trial a political ploy.
   ``There is more effort made to prosecute a police officer than
any 10 murder cases I've ever seen in this court,'' he said.
   But lead prosecutor John Hogan responded he would make no
apology for the resources spent on the case.
   ``There is a large proportion of the people who live in Dade
County who feel that they could be killed, perhaps for absolutely
no reason because ... of the color of their skin,'' said Hogan.
``(And) because of the occupation of their killer, that no justice
will be done, that the justice system works only for the chosen
few.''

<HEAD>Chic Shops Targeted in Nationwide Protests Against Fur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal-rights activists marched past chic shops in Beverly
Hills, Calif., New York City and at least a dozen cities in between
to protest fur sales on the opening day of the holiday shopping
season.
   The fur industry closely monitored protests on the fourth annual
``Fur-Free Friday.'' It vigorously rebutted charges of cruelty to
animals and accused animal-rights activists of trying to deny
consumers freedom of choice.
   The activists and industry officials also disputed whether the
protests have succeeded in shaming shoppers not to buy fur.
   Bob Barker, host of the game show ``The Price is Right,'' led
2,500 protesters in a march down New York's Fifth Avenue, while
about 150 demonstrators targeted 20 furriers in Beverly Hills'
ritzy shopping district.
   In Harrisburg, Pa., protesters filled a black coffin with about
$10,000 worth of mink, fox, and rabbit furs, splashed with red
paint to symbolize blood. An organizer, the Rev. Marc Wessels of
Philadelphia, said the furs once belonged to people who have since
joined the animal-rights movement.
   ``I'd rather be naked than wear fur,'' read a message on a float
that protesters wearing skin-colored leotards brought to a downtown
Miami shopping mall.
   Four fur shops were vandalized in Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. A spokeswoman for the Animals Rights Foundation of Florida,
Nanci Alexander, blamed the vandalism on furriers trying to make
the protest groups look bad.
   About 50 people dressed in mourning black marched in San
Francisco's Union Square, in the heart of the downtown shopping
district. ``Fur is torture, don't buy fur,'' they chanted as they
weaved through crowds of shoppers.
   Among other cities where anti-fur demonstrations took place were
Scottsdale, Ariz., St. Paul, Minn., Fayetteville, Ark., Corpus
Christi, Texas, New Orleans, Durham, N.C., Columbus, Ohio, and
Syracuse, N.Y. Trans Species Unlimited, an animal rights group,
said protests were scheduled in dozens of other cities.
   In New York, Barker led a four-block-long line of protesters.
   Barker, who resigned as host of the Miss USA pageant over its
award of a fur to the winner, called the nation's fur farms
``animal concentration camps.'' The charge infuriated a spokesman
for the fur industry.
   ``That kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis
in fact,'' said Bob Buckler, executive director of the Fur Farm
Animal Welfare Coalition. ``The fact is animals raised on American
fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals
in the world.''
   Harold DeHart, president of the coalition, said ``Fur-Free
Friday'' is ``simply a media ploy designed to draw attention away
from the determination of animal rights groups to eliminate all
animal use.''
   It was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business, but
most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying.
   ``We have had very good sales at this time of year, as usual, so
I don't believe it has changed at all,'' said Christina Delgado,
manager of Rosina Malta Fashions in Miami, where the front door was
painted red by vandals.
   In Denver, where about 250 protesters targeted five fur stores
in the posh Cherry Creek district, Robin Duxbury of the Rocky
Mountain Humane Society asserted that such protests have cost the
fur industry 30 percent of its market. Duxbury also said five
Denver-area furriers have gone out of business in the past year.
   But the Fur Information Council of America said fur sales have
tripled in the United States in the past decade, to more than $1
billion last year. The fur council monitored the demonstrations
from its office in Washington, D.C., said Richard Parsons, the
executive director.
   In some cities, protesters met counterdemonstrations.
   While 35 protesters gathered at a Seattle shopping center, half
a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners were nearby, holding
signs proclaiming the right to wear fur.
   In Milwaukee, about 80 people who picketed fur shops were
challenged by the Rev. Harold Turner and about eight members of his
Baptist church.
   ``Human rights over animal rights,'' Turner shouted to the
anti-fur demonstrators. ``Take off your leather shoes if you don't
want to kill animals.''

<HEAD>Machinists Say They'll Escalate Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines management and its Machinists
union agree on one thing _ the abrupt end of sympathy strikes by
the pilots and flight attendants won't immediately change the
airline's status.
   In anything, troubles were likely to be compounded for Eastern,
which said Friday it had no jobs to offer the returning pilots and
attendants. The Machinists vowed to continue and intensify their
8{-month strike despite the end of the sympathy walkouts.
   ``It really doesn't affect our operation at all,'' company
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. ``Now we have to deal with the
issue of bringing people back to work if there are openings.''
   The airline asked U.S. District Judge James L. King to determine
the status of all employees: those hired during the strike, union
members who crossed picket lines and returning strikers.
   ``We want to take care of that up front so everyone knows
clearly where they stand,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   A statement from the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers local said the other unions' action ``does not
have a material effect on the strike and on (Chairman Frank)
Lorenzo's failed reorganization plan. It does not change the
reality of Eastern's performance and the problems it faces in a
poor industry environment.''
   ``We're going to escalate the strike,'' said Frank Ortis,
president of Machinists Local 702. ``They're losing $2 million to
$3 million a day. We know they can't survive without maintenance.''
   The company is in disagreement with the pilots and flight
attendants unions on recalling former strikers, and Ortis noted
recent reports that cash-strapped Eastern has resumed negotiations
to sell its South American routes to American Airlines. Eastern
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began March 4.
   ``What are they going to do with those people if they sell South
America?'' Ortis said. He said hundreds of pilots and flight
attendants jobs are tied to those routes and Eastern would face
more legal fights about employees laid off after a sale.
   Although Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern was in solid shape on
maintenance, Machinists officials said Eastern's records declined
last month in on-time performance and customer complaints.
   According to Transportation Department figures released earlier
this month, Eastern's on-time performance fell to 80.6 percent in
September from 86.9 percent in August. Customer complaints fell to
7.93 per 100,000 passengers from 36.24 in August, but the figures
for both months were above the average of 5.77 per 100,000
passengers for the period from January to September.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern has openings for 500 mechanics, with
2,500 on the current workforce including 300 Machinists who crossed
picket lines.
   She said Eastern has 1,700 union flight attendants who crossed
picket lines, and has hired 1,700 new flight attendants with
another 250 recruits in training. That gives the rebuilding carrier
all it needs, she said.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern has 1,850 pilots, including 850 union
pilots who crossed picket lines and 1,000 new hirees, enough for
its schedule of 775 daily flights, which is scheduled to expand
gradually to more than 900 in early 1990.
   The returning strikers go on a recall list and will be called
back as openings come up, Ms. Ceremsak said. Eastern officials have
said seniority is less important than the pilots' qualifications
for specific planes and routes.

   A human rights group has blamed
both the right-wing government and leftist insurgents for killing
civilians during an 11-day rebel offensive.
   America's Watch, in a report released Friday, said the armed
forces ``engaged in targeted killings, arbitrary detentions of
non-combatants and torture.''
   The group also criticized rebels ``for using civilians as
shields.''
   The report, called ``Carnage Again,'' said the air force ``as
far as it is possible to determine, caused great loss of civilian
life by indiscriminate aerial attacks in slum neighborhoods.''
   During the fighting, the air force attacked some neighborhoods
around the capital, San Salvador, in an effort to dislodge rebels
who took up positions there.
   America's Watch criticized both sides for ``impeding medical
care for the wounded'' who could not be evacuated because of the
heavy combat.
   The New York-based group also said the offensive led to
non-combat human rights violations by the military as ``government
forces apparently took advantage of the fighting to settle old
scores.''
   It cited the massacre of six Jesuits, a series of raids on
churches and church-run shelters, death threats against church
officials, and the arrests and expulsions of foreign church workers.
   The report also raised questions about the government's
investigation of the killings last week of the Jesuits at a
church-run univerisity. The report said President Alfredo Cristiani
should have been able to determine what all government forces in
the area did that night.
   Though Cristiani has condemned the killings, witnesses have
reportedly said the Jesuits were killed by forces in military
uniforms.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Friday that a witness to the
massacre has left the country. The witness left with the help of
the governments of El Salvador, France, Spain, Britain, and the
United States, said embassy spokesman Jeff Brown.
   The head of the Jesuit order in Central America, Jose Maria
Tojeira, identified the witness as Lucia Barrera Cerna. Officials
said she had been staying in the Spanish Embassy since the killings.
   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado quoted the woman, who had
worked as a housekeeper at university, as saying she saw men
``dressed in military uniforms'' killing the Jesuits, their
housekeeper and her daughter.
   Jesuit officials said the woman left Thursday for Miami.
   Also Friday, legislators debated a proposed law that would
impose long prison terms for protests and other activities by
peasant, human-rights and union groups.
   The government and military consider most such organizations to
be fronts for leftist rebels.
   Under the proposal, participants in sit-ins or building
takeovers could face up to 20 years in prison. People blocking
traffic with demonstrations could be jailed for five years.

   Authorities are investigating
the giant chemical company Bayer AG on suspicion that it illegally
sold a pesticides plant to Iran, company officials said.
   West Germany has been rocked by several export scandals in the
past year. Some have involved allegations that West German
companies helped build a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   Many chemicals used to make pesticides can also be used in the
manufacture of chemical weapons.
   In its statement Friday, Bayer said customs officials suspect
its 1987 delivery of a pesticides plant to Iran violated West
Germany's export law.
   But the company said West German law does not require an export
permit for the kind of plant it sold to Iran for $2.7 million.
   Customs officials in Cologne refused to confirm that an
investigation was under way.

   A North Korean soldier defected to
South Korea today by walking across the demilitarized zone that
forms the border between the two countries, the Defense Ministry
announced.
   The ministry said the soldier, identified as Kim Son-il, reached
a South Korean military outpost early today after crossing the
heavily fortified border about 40 miles northeast of Seoul.
   The defector was from the second platoon of the fifth company of
North Korea's 25th division, the ministry said. Ministry officials
provided no other details.
   So far this year, at least seven North Korean soldiers,
including Kim, have defected to South Korea.

   Police found plastic explosives tucked into
cans of jam delivered by ship to the port city of Valencia. Ten
people were arrested.
   Police spokesman Manuel Jimenez said those arrested carried
passports of several nations, including Lebanon, and there was
suspicion they could be connected with a terrorist operation.
Lebanon is home to several terrorist groups.
   He said the investigation was in its initial stage after the
arrests were made Friday in Madrid and Valencia. The suspects were
being held in Madrid.
   He said police found 18 pounds of plastic explosives in the
first 100 jam cans they opened. He said a total of 1,600 cans had
arrived in Valencia by ship.

<HEAD>Witness To Shooting of Jesuit Priests in San Salvador in Hiding in
Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who witnessed the massacre of six Jesuit
priests in El Salvador last was spirited to the United States by
Spanish, French and U.S. diplomats and is under guard here at a
secret location.
   The witness was flown Thursday night to Miami from San Salvador
aboard a French military plane with the assistance of a key French
official, the Miami Herald reported in today's editions.
   She has been identified as Lucia Barrera Cerna, 40, a cleaning
woman who worked for two of the slain priests at Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University.
   According to unidentified officials cited by the Herald, the
woman saw the priests and two university employees shot at
point-blank range on Nov. 16 by a group of 30 to 40 men wearing
Salvadoran military uniforms.
   Her account appeared to bolster charges by church officials and
others that the killings were carried out by members of the
Salvadoran military. Salvadoran officials have claimed the killings
could have been the work of leftists trying to pass themselves off
as Salvadoran soldiers.
   The witness also was interviewed by Salvadoran officials, and
Salvadoran Attorney General Mauricio Eduardo Colorado was quoted in
the Herald as saying the witness saw just five assasins _ three
dressed in black and two in olive-green uniforms.
   Bernard Kouchner, the French minister for humanitarian affairs,
said he escorted the woman, her husband and their daughter to the
United States. Kouchner said the family has been handed over to the
U.S. State Department for protection.
   But other, unidentified officials involved in the case said the
witness and her family were being guarded by the FBI. A spokeswoman
at the Miami office of the FBI refused to confirm or deny the
report.
   Kouchner said he was in San Salvador last weekend to attend the
funerals of the priests, and learned Wednesday the witness and her
family were in the Spanish Embassy and wanted to go to Miami.
   ``Inside Salvador it was impossible to protect them,'' Kouchner
said. ``There were death squadrons all around.''
   Kouchner said he offered France's assistance in bringing the
family to Miami, and was joined on the trip by two unidentified
U.S. diplomats, and bodyguards.
   ``We transferred the lady (to San Salvador's airport) under the
protection of our bodyguards and security people from the French
and Spanish embassies,'' Kouchner said, adding that the U.S.
ambassador to El Salvador, William Walker, was present.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani approved of the witness'
relocation to the United States, Kouchner said.
   Meanwhile, an American priest who fled El Salvador last week
after receiving death threats said he planned to carry out a
campaign to end U.S. aid to Cristiani's rightist government.
   The Rev. Jim Barnett, visiting St. Paul, Minn., this week, said
that during heavy fighting in the Salvadoran capital last week he
called friends in the United States to say that the government was
hurting civilians by bombing and strafing of poor neighborhoods
where leftist rebels were entrenched.
   Barnett said he then received a telephoned death threat at the
residence for Catholic and Lutheran clerics where he lived, and
decided to leave the country.
   Many clergy in El Salvador have been threatened by rightists
since the guerrilla offensive began two weeks ago. Many priests are
in hiding. Church members often are accused of sheltering or
supplying the rebels.

<HEAD>Winter Storm Develops Over West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cloudy skies prevailed over much of the nation early today,
while a winter storm developed over the West.
   A storm watch has been posted for the northern Sierra Nevada
range of California with more than 2 feet of snow possible in some
of the higher elevations.
   A winter storm watch also has been issued for the mountains of
southern Idaho for tonight and Sunday.
   Showers dampened much of the northern and central Pacific Coast
region Friday. In western Oregon, a thunderstorm north of Newport
produced hail a half-inch in diameter and wind gusts to 50 mph.
   A cold front brought snow to parts of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow is in effect today for the
northern and central mountains of Colorado, with 4 to 8 inches
expected.
   A snow advisory also was in effect for the mountains of western
Wyoming, where 4 to 8 inches of new snow were expected.
   Snow squalls continued over parts of the lower Great Lakes
region Friday evening. Snow squalls over western New York produced
7 inches of snow west of Amboy. A 60-car accident forced the
closure of Route 81 Friday afternoon.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms dampened extreme southern
Florida.
   High temperatures were only in the 20s and 30s Friday across
much of the area from the northern half of the Atlantic Coast
through the Great Lakes region into eastern sections of the Dakotas.
   Record lows for the date were set or tied in 12 Northeast cities
Friday. Temperatures dropped to 1 degree in Hartford, Conn., and
Caribou, Maine.
   The high for the nation Friday was 80 degrees in Arizona at
Tucson and Yuma.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has ordered the Chicago Cubs to pay
$67,500 in damages to a boy who was struck in the eye by a foul
ball during a game at Wrigley Field, attorneys said.
   The award to Delbert Yates Jr., 16, is only the second of its
kind in the country, Cubs lawyer William Cremer said. In the other
case, a lawsuit against the Houston Astros, the verdict was
reversed on appeal, and Cremer said the Cubs would appeal.
   Contacted Friday night at the family's Valparaiso, Ind., home,
the boy's father, Delbert Sr., said, ``We're pretty happy ...
because maybe the Cubs will do something to protect the fans now.''
   The younger Yates was struck in the face by a foul ball off the
bat of Cubs slugger Leon Durham during an Aug. 20, 1983, game
against Atlanta. He was sitting in a box seat on the third base
side of home plate just a few feet from the protective screen.
   The boy was treated at a ballpark first aid station and taken by
ambulance to a children's hospital, where he spent five days. He
suffered a fractured eye socket which caused double vision, and
required an eye operation a month later, said his lawyer, Mario
Cirignani.
   Cirignani had contended that the protective screen behind home
plate should have been extended further. He said a Cook County
Circuit Court jury on Wednesday awarded Yates $67,500 for his pain
and suffering.
   But Cremer said, ``I think there is an excellent chance of
getting it reversed.''
   ``If the verdict is upheld, what do the Cubs do?'' Cremer asked.
``Do they then screen the entire park to protect themselves against
liability? Catching foul balls is as much a part of baseball as
crackerjacks and peanuts.''

   A 24-mile-long oil slick off
southern Vancouver Island has coated several beaches and oiled at
least 50 birds, most of which were expected to die, authorities
said.
   Efforts to contain the slick with booms failed Friday because of
strong currents, said Colin Hendry of the Canadian Coast Guard.
More skimming efforts were scheduled today.
   Hendry estimated the slick, first noticed Thursday, involved 550
to 1,100 gallons of Bunker C fuel oil of the type used to power
deep sea ships. He suspected it came from a tanker or another
ship's waste-oil tank.
   The slick had not reached threatened any Washington state
beaches by Friday, said Pete Neumann, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
in Seattle.
   Canadian Coast Guard volunteers and about 30 members of a
British Columbia provincial environmental youth corps walked along
beaches and collected about 15 cubic yards of oil-covered seaweed,
rocks and gravel by late Friday afternoon.

   About 45 businesses displaced by the
Oct. 17 earthquake reopened in temporary quarters _ seven huge
tents erected just in time to attract holiday shoppers.
   ``We love Santa Cruz and this is part of our life,'' said Louise
Bagnall, a shopper in the tent pavilion, which was erected on the
site of the Pacific Garden Mall, devastated in the 7.1-magnitude
quake. ``We just felt we must support Santa Cruz and see it come
out of the rubble and live again.''
   A ribbon was cut to open the shopping pavilion to business
Friday and ``within minutes the place was packed,'' said Louis
Rittenhouse, president of the Downtown Association.
   ``We hope people will return to Santa Cruz to shop and spend
long weekends now,'' Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt said in a statement.
   Many of the small to medium-sized businesses feared they would
go out of business if they were not open in time for the holiday
shopping season.
   Some store owners relied on the kindness of strangers to get
their businesses going in the tents.
   Margaret Wilson, owner of Lilly Wong's gift store, said she was
able to set up shop in three days thanks to about 30 volunteers who
helped each day.
   ``Those were people I'd never even seen before,'' she said.

   The Coast Guard rescued three people

   Don Bothell, 44, of Cordova, Alaska, Paula Carroll, 44, of
Seattle, and her 13-year-old son, Jacob, were tired but in good
health after abandoning their 43-foot ketch and drifting in a raft
off Charleston, S.C.
   A helicopter from the Coast Guard Air Station in Savannah
rescued them Thursday afternoon when the emergency signal from
their raft was picked up by a satellite monitored by the Coast
Guard in Miami, said Cmdr. John Whitehouse.
   ``We thought it might be two weeks before someone realized we
were missing,'' Bothell said.
   They floated in the four-man raft for only about four hours.
   ``When the Coast Guard officer jumped into the raft to help us
into the harness, he said, `Happy Thanksgiving,''' Bothell said.
``It was the first time it even occurred to me that it was
Thanksgiving.''
   The survivors later ate a Thanksgiving feast.

<TEXT>
   A week ago, the editor of a Czech-language
newspaper published in this tiny, central Texas town predicted in a
column that change would soon come to his homeland.
   But Jan Vaculik, who left Czechoslovakia a month after the
Soviet invasion in 1968, was stunned when the hard-line members of
the Czechoslovak Politburo resigned Friday.
   ``I didn't expect such change so rapidly,'' Vaculik said. ``I'm
excited at least that these guys are gone. I always feared that
they may turn violent against the people.''
   Vaculik, 44, publishes the monthly Hospodar for 1,000
subscribers in the United States and 1,000 in Czechoslovakia, he
said. Most of the paper's readers are older and remember the
``dream of the First Republic,'' the only independent
Czechoslovakian republic, from 1918 to 1938.
   ``They know there is a different way,'' Vaculik said.
   About 85 percent of West's 2,300 residents are of Czechoslovak
descent, Vaculik said, but only a handful were born in
Czechoslovakia. Good farming conditions and cheap land brought most
of them to West in the 1870s.
   The town's 22-member dance ensemble toured Czechoslovakia last
year.
   ``It was really a culture shock. Things that we have at our
fingertips they're not able to have,'' said Maggie Grmela, who
started the dance group with her husband 14 years ago. ``We're
pleased to see what's happening now.'' In Granger, a town about 80
miles south of West that is also predominantly Czech, residents are
also watching events in Czechoslovakia closely. Both towns are in
central Texas between Dallas and San Antonio.
   ``It looks like they might finally get some freedom, but it's
hard to judge,'' said Jannine Lalla, who visited Czechoslovakia 11
years ago. ``They're a complicated outfit over there. The people
are so nice, but they are afraid.''
   Joe Vrabel of Granger publishes Nasinec, a 75-year old
Czech-language weekly newspaper, but has never been able to sell
the paper in Czechslovakia. He hopes the changes pro-democracy
demonstrators seek will enable him to do so.
   ``I never thought it would be free there again,'' he said.

<HEAD>East German Leaders Hits Streets in New Appeal for Support</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Krenz in Leipzig, official saying

<TEXT>
   As the East German capital emptied today for
a third weekend of visits to the West, Communist leader Egon Krenz
took his appeal for public trust to the streets of Leipzig, a hub
of recent protests.
   On Friday, other leading Communists said East Germany should
consider stronger ties with West Germany to rescue this country's
troubled economy.
   During his stroll through the center of the grimy industrial
city of Leipzig, Krenz was besieged by shoppers and workers who
pounded him with questions about the nation's future, the official
ADN news agency reported.
   ``Can the desperate situation with the economy be improved? ...
Will those responsible for the misery be punished?'' residents
asked Krenz, ADN said.
   They offered ``question after question, but also
encouragements,'' ADN said, quoting strollers as yelling: ``Egon,
keep it up! We wish you health!''
   Protests in Leipzig, a weekly ritual, have attracted hundreds of
thousands of people. The demonstrations there and elsewhere in East
Germany, coupled with an exodus to the West through other East bloc
countries, prompted East Germany to open its borders to the West
earlier this month.
   The generally positive report on Krenz's visit appeared aimed at
boosting the leader's image at a time of disillusionment with
Communist Party stalwarts.
   Krenz reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued
leadership within the party, which is split on how to proceed with
reforms. He has admitted he could be replaced at a major party
meeting next month.
   In another move aimed at winning public confidence, Parliament
Speaker Guenther Maleuda said in an interview published by the
youth newspaper Junge Welt that parliamentary elections could come
as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law can be worked out
early next year.
   He did not indicate the vote would be truly democratic, as other
top officials have. However, he said he could envision
participation by groups other than the current established parties
aligned with the Communists.
   The rush for the borders began early, with more than 300,000
crossing into West Berlin and West Germany before nightfall Friday,
and hundreds of thousands more traveling through the night.
   Trabant and Wartburg cars backed up as far as 25 miles at border
crossings into West Germany's Bavaria state, and East Berlin's
Potsdamer Platz crossing in the Wall for pedestrians was packed by
thousands before noon.
   East German public transportion was so overwhelmed with the
westward travelers that the federal Transport Ministry issued an
appeal to citizens late Friday to avoid using the rail system.
   Most of the East Germans were just headed for visits, mostly to
shop.
   However, a new surge of East German refugees also has become
apparent over the past few days, with more than 3,000 applying for
resettlement in West Germany on Thursday and Friday.
   Also today, ADN said Werner Eberlein, a member of the ruling
Politburo and head of the party's disciplinary committee, called
for a thorough probe of ``misuse of office, corruption, personal
enrichment and other guilts.''
   He did not say exactly who he was referring to. But the party
has already launched an investigation into the actions of former
party chief Erich Honecker and other top officials of the ousted
leadership.

<HEAD>Customers Cram Stores as Peak Buying Season Gets Going</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd-4th grafs to CORRECT spelling of accommmodate, bingeing.
Minor editing elsewhere. A version moved on the financial wire.</HEAD>

   The holiday shopping season is officially open and retailers
hope the huge crowds that packed stores on the traditional kickoff
day after Thanksgiving are a prelude to a merry and profitable
Christmas.
   ``Nobody's anticipating a banner year,'' said Blair Holden,
manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. store in Lansing, Mich. ``But
we're hoping to do as well as last year and maybe a little better.''
   As the peak holiday selling season began Friday, many merchants
tried to accommodate shoppers with longer hours, bargains and
special services on a day that usually is the busiest of the year
for retailers.
   But there were some indications buyers were bingeing less than
retailers hoped.
   Thousands stopped by the 59-store Sierra Vista Mall in Clovis,
Calif., but mall manager Russ Joyner said, ``We're finding that
people are waiting longer to do their shopping.
   ``The last Saturday prior to Christmas is the day that really
seems to be the most lucrative,'' Joyner said.
   Almost half of retailers' annual business is done in the weeks
between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Usually shoppers swarm stores
in the days immediately after Thanksgiving and then lose interest
until the final, frantic days just before Christmas.
   This year's retail outlook varies by region but nationwide
retail sales are expected to rise only about an average of 5.5
percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9
percent gain.
   Retailers and industry analysts say holiday shoppers are likely
to continue holding back generally on purchases of expensive,
long-lasting goods, such as home appliances, as they have all year.
   Store workers said consumer electronics and video games appeared
to be selling fast on Friday. Clothing, costume jewelry and
accessories also did well.
   ``Nintendo is selling awful good and camcorders are blowing out.
Anything in the electric (department) is selling very well,'' said
Bob Gilley, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. store at Merle
Hay Mall in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores appealed to
bargain hunters.
   The six B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores in New York, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania drew hordes to the chain's
going-out-of-business sale. Only Altman's Cincinnati store will
remain open after its financially ailing parent Hooker Corp.
couldn't find a buyer.
   The morning crowd clamoring to get into B. Altman's main store
in Manhattan was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts. By
midafternoon, police turned people away, saying the enormous store
was dangerously overcrowded.
   ``It's like a war zone,'' said Audrey Lavine of Manhattan, who
battled the bedlam to buy a designer suit.
   Elsewhere, shoppers who showed up early got special treatment.
The Wal-Mart store in Terre Haute, Ind. offered extra low prices on
selected items from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. During a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.
sale at Fred Meyer's, a discount store about 20 miles south of
downtown Seattle, shoppers drank free coffee, sipped apple cider
and munched on doughnuts.
   Some malls offered other amenities. Shoppers at Grossmont Center
outside San Diego could leave their youngsters at a free child-care
center and take beepers in case of an emergency. The Somerset mall
in Troy, Mich., and Emporium-Capwell's outside Oakland, Calif.,
offered valet parking to ease clogged lots.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to UPDATE with Mouawad's burial, MOVES UP
Aoun rejection of Hrawi. Pickup 9th pvs, `Aoun's appointment...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHTOURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New President Elias Hrawi today chose a
Moslem leader as the new prime minister and formally disbanded the
military government of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Hrawi, a 64-year-old Maronite Catholic lawmaker, was elected by
Parliament on Friday as Lebanon's 10th president. He succeeds Rene
Mouawad, who was assassinated Wednesday by a car bomb in Beirut and
buried today.
   ``The peace march has started and it will not stumble,'' Hwari
told Parliament Friday as it met in this Bekaa valley city guarded
by hundreds of Syrian troops. ``We shall not allow anyone to stand
in the way.''
   Hrawi's decree ousting Aoun's three-man military cabinet is a
formality. Aoun still controls the 20,000-member army, has
denounced Hrawi's election, and claims that his military cabinet is
Lebanon's only legitimate government.
   In Hrawi's hometown of Zahleh in the eastern Bekaa valley,
residents fired guns into the air to celebrate his selection.
Hundreds danced in the streets.
   In contrast, church bells tolled and an army band played dirges
in the northern mountain town of Zgorta during the funeral of
Mouawad, whom Hrawi described in his acceptance speech as ``the
martyr of national unity.''
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual leader of the Maronite
community, led the funeral services, and Papal Nuncio Pablo Pointe
read a message from Pope John Paul II in which the pontiff said he
was praying for peace in Lebanon.
   Women wailed as the coffins of Mouawad and six slain bodyguards
were carried out of the cathedral of St. John the Baptist for
burial in a cemetery nearby. Mothers, sisters and wives of the
slain bodyguards flung themselves on the caskets as they were
lowered into the graves.
   Christians and Moslems nationwide joined in a strike in tribute
of the fallen president.
   Like Mouawad, Hrawi chose Sunni Moslem leader Salim Hoss to head
a new government comprised of Christians and Moslems under an Arab
League peace accord aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite like Hrawi, opposes the peace accord
because it has no deadline for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian
soldiers from Lebanon.
   Aoun was named to head an interim cabinet by former President
Amin Gemayel on Sept. 22, 1988, just before Gemayel's six-year term
expired with Parliament unable to elect a successor.
   Aoun's appointment was rejected by Moslems, and resulted in the
emergence of two rival cabinets vying for power. Hoss headed the
Moslem cabinet.
   The ensuing political crisis renewed fighting between Moslem
militias and their Syrian allies and hard-line Christian forces led
by Aoun.
   Hoss today announced a cabinet that he said he had chosen as
prime minister-designate under Mouawad.
   Hoss, 60, retained Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt as public works
minister and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri as
minister of elecrical and hydraulic resources. Berri also got the
housing and cooperatives portfolios.
   Berri and Jumblatt are Syria's main allies in Lebanon. They
fielded the largest Moslem militias in the civil war against the
Christians.
   Hoss also appointed George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing
Phalange Party, Lebanon's largest Christian political force, into
the new government as minister of post and telecomunications.
   But Saadeh, a Maronite Catholic living in the Christian enclave
controlled by Aoun's army, appeared reluctant to take up the post.
   ``I was surprised by my appointment. I don't oppose the new
government, but the question of my participation must first be
approved by the Phalange politburo,'' Saadeh said in a statement
broadcast by the party's Voice of Lebanon radio station.
   In addition to the Maronite, Sunni, Shiite and Druse
communities, the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics and Armenians also
were represented in Hoss' government.
   Aoun, who vehemently opposed Mouawad's election, said Hrawi's
election was ``as unconstitutional as that of Mouawad. Both have
been elected under Syrian occupation.''
   ``They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before
appointing a new president,'' Aoun said in a statement released by
his press office in Beirut's eastern suburb of Baabda.

   Israeli warplanes today blasted a
guerrilla base of a radical Palestinian faction near Syrian army
lines in southeast Lebanon. At least two group members were
wounded, police said.
   In Israel, an army spokesman confirmed the air attack on Sultan
Yaaqoub, the second on the village in three days. The jets returned
safely to base.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules,
said the strike was aimed at ``terrorist targets related to Ahmed
Jibril.''
   Jibril is a former Syrian army captain who heads the radical
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   A Lebanese police spokesman confirmed that the target was a
Popular Front base. There were no immediate reports of fatalities.
   The police spokesman said two fighter-bombers fired six rockets
into the base in Sultan Yaaqoub, in the Bekaa Valley, in two late
morning runs.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the planes also
dropped about six time bombs that exploded in a 10-minute period
after the air attack.
   Syrian soldiers manning surface-to-air missile batteries in the
Bekaa Valley did not fire at the raiding jets, the spokesman said.
   Witnesses said guerrilla defenders fired on the attacking jets
with twin-barreled, anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed.
   They said smoke billowed from a one-story building at the base
seconds after rockets crashed into it.
   The air raids today and Thursday were seen as a warning to Syria
to prevent its guerrilla allies from taking advantage of the
current political turmoil in Lebanon to stage attacks on Israel.
   Both raids followed the assassination of Lebanese President Rene
Mouawad. Today's bombing came hours after the election of a
presidential successor, Elias Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic also
backed by the Syrians.
   On Thursday, four Israeli F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers struck
bases of the Syrian-backed Popular Front in Sultan Yaaqoub and the
adjacent Deir Zanoun in a 10-minute attack. One fighter was killed
and four were wounded.
   The pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, also
has bases in the area. Hezbollah is the umbrella group for Shiite
Moslem factions holding 18 Western hostages in Lebanon, including
eight Americans.
   Today's raid was Israel's 16th attack on targets in Lebanon this
year. By police count, the raids have killed 18 people and wounded
109.
   The Popular Front is opposed to peace overtures by Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.

   Campaign workers fought pitched battles
in India's biggest city today, and the Election Commission
announced there was evidence of vote rigging in Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's district.
   A respected weekly released a poll saying Gandhi's party will be
``hard pressed'' to win 200 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, or
House of the People, Parliament's decision-making lower chamber
which will choose the prime minister. The poll in Sunday magazine
interviewed 11,500 voters.
   In another development, opposition leader Vishwanath Pratap
Singh, considered the top choice to replace Gandhi, said he was
reluctant to become prime minister should his five-party opposition
coalition win.
   ``It is political suicide to depend too much on an individual,''
Singh said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``So I have
decided not to accept any proposal to become the prime minister.''
   Violence continued today when campaign workers in Calcutta, the
capital of West Bengal, battled with bombs and bricks.
   One election official was killed and dozens were injured. Police
fired into the air and used tear gas to disperse the crowds.
   Two other people were killed in campaign-related violance, one
in southern Andhra Pradesh and the other in southern Tamil Nadu.
   So far 97 people have died since voting began Wednesday.
   The elections, which end Sunday and will determine whether
Gandhi remains in power or falls victim to a newly energized and
united opposition, are shaping up as the most violent in India's
history.
   At least 141 people have been killed since the election was
announced in mid-October, surpassing the 38 people who died during
the December 1984 election that propelled Gandhi to power two
months after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
   Voting will take place Sunday in tiny Sikkim, the northern state
of Punjab where Sikh separatists have killed more than 1,650 people
this year, and in eastern Bihar state where violence between Hindus
and Moslems has left at least 300 people dead in the past six weeks.
   First election results are expected Sunday night after the polls
close.
   Since the voting started, the Congress Party and the opposition
National Front coalition have traded charges of voter intimidation
and ballot fraud.
   Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. Peri Sastri said an
investigation in Gandhi's district has found evidence of vote
rigging in 50 percent of the polling places it checked.
   The Congress Party has denied it was responsible for rigging in
Amethi, the constituency where Gandhi is seeking re-election.
   Peri Sastri said he hoped a decision would be made on a revote
in the Amethi district Sunday when counting is supposed to begin.
   Revoting has already been ordered in 930 of the country's
590,000 polling places because of ballot fraud.
   Peri Sastri's dramatic news conference began when 40 Indian
reporters barged into his office. Soon afterward he received a
telephone call from an Election Commission investigator who had
been sent to Gandhi's district to investigate allegations of vote
fraud.
   Peri Sastri allowed reporters to stay in the room as he spoke
with the investigator, C.L. Rose.
   Rose visited 35 polling stations in 10 villages and reported
rigging in 50 percent of them, Peri Sastri said. Villagers issued
``angry and grievious complaints against the voting,'' Peri Sastri
said. He said the decision on Amethi was a serious one.
   ``Here is an allegation which will damage not merely an
individual but an institution, the institution is the prime
ministership,'' he said.
   He said his decision would not just effect the district but the
``whole country as well.''
   The Congress Party has been accused of large-scale rigging in
Amethi.

<TEXT>
   Police today questioned 10 passengers
about a bomb found aboard a Saudi jumbo jet carrying 339 people.
The bomb failed to go off, and the plane returned to Pakistan
safely.
   The Boeing 747 was traveling from Islamabad to Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 367 was flying over the
Arabian Sea when it was ordered to land in the southern port city
of Karachi because of an extortion threat.
   While the plane was airborne, officials said airport security in
Islamabad received an anonymous letter threatening to blow the
plane up unless a demand for $15 million was met.
   In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, the airline today issued a statement
saying that ``with God's blessing,'' a bomb found in a piece of
unclaimed luggage failed to go off, sparing the lives of the 332
adults and seven children aboard.
   Eight ounces of dynamite were found in the unclaimed bag, said
Moinuddin, the head of a bomb squad. The dynamite was surrounded by
clothes, a cigarette lighter and a box of matches, said Moinuddin,
who only uses one name.
   Earlier police reports called the device a time bomb and said
only a loose battery wire prevented it from exploding.
   Police gave few details about the 10 passengers held for
questioning. ``We haven't laid any charges; we are just questioning
them,'' said a Karachi police official on condition of anonymity.
   He said all 10 were from Pakistan's North West Frontier Province.
   Islamabad police said they also were questioning a taxi driver
who delivered the extortion letter to an Islamabad airport officer
shortly after Flight 367 left Islamabad.
   The note demanded $15 million in ransom to be deposited in three
bags at a location in Islamabad, said the Saudi airline. Pakistani
police earlier put the figure at $1.5 million.
   No one has claimed responsibility for placing the bomb on the
plane, and police have refused to discuss possible suspects.
   A terrorist bomb exploded aboard a New York-bound Pan Am jumbo
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259
people aboard and 11 people on the ground. Investigators in England
later determined that the explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in
a cassette-recorder.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Vietnamese Battle at Detention Center; Police Fire Tear

<TEXT>
   Police today fired tear gas into a refugee camp
to break up a battle between hundreds of Vietnamese boat people
armed with stones and spears, officials said. At least five people
were injured.
   The fight between rival groups from two different provinces in
Vietnam broke out after a man was attacked, police said. The
Vietnamese tore down a 17-foot-tall fence that separated the two
groups at the Shek Kong center.
   Police reported four Vietnamese were injured, including a man
who was hospitalized in fair condition with stab wounds to the
chest. A police officer was also slightly injured but required no
hospital treatment.
   Besides using stones and spears, the boat people also fought
with water pipes and sharpened iron rods before police dispersed
them, officials said.
   There have been frequent fights in recent months among
Vietnamese boat people held in detention camps in this small
British colony.
   More than 55,000 Vietnamese refugees are languishing in the Hong
Kong camps, hoping for resettlement and fearing forced repatriation
to their Communist-ruled homeland.
   It is expected that tens of thousands of boat people will be
denied refugee status by Hong Kong, and tension has increased in
the camps with the possibility that they will be sent back to
Vietnam.
   On Friday, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said his
country has ``little choice'' except compulsory repatriation for
the boat people, who are putting an ``intolerable strain on Hong
Kong's patience and resources.''
   At a Camp David meeting Friday, President Bush criticized
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for the plan to force the
boat people back to Vietnam. Mrs. Thatcher made no comment on the
criticism when she returned to Britain today, but a Foreign Office
official, William Waldegrave, said:
   ``What are we supposed to do? They cannot just sit there in
those camps getting cholera. We have to do something. I do not know
what else there is to do. Everyone shares the anxiety.
   ``We have tried to persuade the international community to take
them. The international community will not take them _ not America,
not Sweden, not Switzerland, Australia, not anybody.''

<HEAD>Make-Believe Virginia Town May Be Crime Capital of World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUANTICO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The real crime capital of the world may be
a small town nestled in a rural Virginia forest where bank
robberies, kidnappings and deadly extortion plots are running
rampant. The town's mayor, however, shrugs it off with a serene
smile.
   After all, as the interminable struggle between good and evil
rages outside his office window, Jim Pledger boasts a police force
that would be the envy of any big-city mayor _ dozens of smart,
square-jawed young FBI trainees.
   Pledger is mayor of ``Hogan's Alley,'' a fictitious but
strikingly realistic town built on a wooded, 20-acre site at the
FBI Academy, about 40 miles south of Washington, D.C., where
students practice nabbing criminals, interrogating witnesses and
gathering evidence.
   ``This is the most crime-ridden town in the world,'' says
Pledger, the training unit chief in charge of Hogan's Alley. ``But
the great thing is that our law enforcement people have a 100
percent success rate solving crimes.''
   At first glance, the town is picture-book America, with its own
post office, drugstore, bank, barber shop, combination pool hall
and Greyhound bus station, coin-operated laundry, movie theater,
motel and boarding houses.
   All are phony except for the Pastime Bar, where FBI employees
can step inside for a cup of coffee or a sandwich while waiting for
the next crime wave.
   Visitors with long memories might notice something familiar
about the movie theater, the Biograph, which features Clark Gable
and Myrna Loy in ``Manhattan Melodrama.'' It was under the same
marquee of the Biograph Theater in Chicago that gangster John
Dillinger was shot dead in 1934.
   In this town, there are no mothers pushing baby carriages or
merchants hurrying to work. The streets are strangely empty until
the silence is broken by volleys from blank-firing shotguns and
revolvers, the squealing tires of police cruisers and shouts of
``Freeze! This is the FBI!''
   The make-believe bad guys and witnesses who inhabit Hogan's
Alley are amateur ``role players'' hired by the hour through a
commercial talent agency.
   They include housewives from the neighboring Marine Corps base
at Quantico, schoolteachers, retirees and off-duty firefighters and
police officers. None has any previous acting experience.
   ``In this town, crime pays _ at $8 an hour,'' says Pledger.
   A huge sign on the outskirts of town gives visitors fair warning:
   ``Welcome to Hogan's Alley. City Limits. Caution: Law
enforcement training exercises in progress. Display of weapons,
firing of blank ammunition and arrests may occur. If challenged,
please follow instructions. Have a nice day.''
   Last Wednesday, the day started literally with a bang at 8:20
a.m. when the Hogan Bank was robbed. Three gunmen fled with about
$30,000 in play money, some of it in $50 bills bearing Pledger's
portrait.
   Four teams of FBI trainees _ 44 in all _ sprang into action,
following a minute-by-minute script written by their supervisors.
   While the first team was interviewing bank employees and dusting
the teller's cage for fingerprints, other trainees quickly arrested
the first suspect, a shaggy-haired man in plaid shirt and jeans, at
his hideout in the Dogwood Inn motel.
   Another gunman was grabbed, handcuffed and frisked outside his
three-story townhouse while his girlfriend loudly complained and a
nosy neighbor gawked. The third suspect, who lives in the local
trailer park, was caught in an FBI ambush at Will Johnson's Garage,
where he had left his aging green sedan for repairs.
   Case closed in just four hours.
   ``These trainees know they're play-acting, but their adrenaline
really gets pumping,'' said training supervisor Donald J. Gray.
   The nosy neighbor outside the townhouse was Thomas Burkhard, a
retired Massachusetts dairy marketing executive who now lives in
nearby Woodbridge, Va. His daughter, Lisa Bennett, a doctor's
receptionist and mother of two, played the bank teller in the phony
robbery.
   ``It's fun, frankly,'' said Burkhard. ``I don't do it for the
money, I do it because I enjoy it. It's ideal for me _ gives me
something to do three or four days a month.''
   Has he discovered any hidden talents for acting?
   Burkhard laughed and replied, ``My role is to be a nuisance, and
I've almost been kicked off the porch a couple of times. I get a
thumbs-up occasionally from the instructors.''

   Hundreds of monkeys descended from
their Buddhist temple home Saturday for a 12-course meal complete
with menus and linen napkins but forgot their manners and hurled
soda cans at the curious humans.
   The furry guests leaped aboard the neat rows of tables to devour
vast spreads of sweet and sour noodles, salad, tomato cocktail,
fried rice, Chinese-style noodles, potato soup, banana cake and
coconut candy.
   A local hotel owner, Yongyut Kiwattanananusan, gave the monkeys
the meal to thank them for the success of his Lopburi Inn. The
monkeys are symbols of good fortune and a favorite tourist
attraction in this small provincial capital 70 miles north of
Bangkok.
   The monkeys dined on the grounds of the Wat San Prakhan in the
morning, and a second feast was given in the afternoon at the
10th-century Three Pagodas Temple.
   At Wat San Prakhan, they feasted with abandon despite attempts
by an army of waiters to keep order. At one stage, some swung up
into the trees and hurled soft drink cans at hundreds of human
spectators.
   The second feast was held before much larger crowds of people.
It fizzled out as a monkey named Wang led his fellows in a tactical
retreat, leaving untouched more than 40 tables of food.
   Townspeople said the monkeys sleep at the Wat San Prakhan and
cross the road at exactly 8 a.m. each morning for breakfast at the
Three Pagodas Temple.
   They believe the monkeys are the disciples of the four-handed
Hindu-Buddhist idol around which the Wat San Prakhan was built.

<HEAD>Marcos Ally, Aquino Foe, Slips Back Into Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of Ferdinand Marcos' closest
allies has slipped back into the Philippines three years after
President Corazon Aquino, who is also his cousin, banished him to
the United States.
   Eduardo Cojuangco was welcomed as ``the leading light of the
opposition'' by those opposed to Mrs. Aquino, but he said after his
return late Friday that he came back mainly to defend himself
against charges he helped Marcos steal from the government.
   Cojuangco, 54, left the Philippines in February 1986 aboard the
same American military plane that carried Marcos into exile in
Hawaii after his ouster in an uprising that brought Mrs. Aquino to
power. Marcos died Sept. 28.
   Assistant presidential spokeswoman Lourdes Sytangco said
manifests of flights from abroad did not include an Eduardo
Cojuangco and he may have traveled under an assumed name from the
United States.
   A presidential security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Mrs. Aquino learned of Cojuangco's arrival from
airport officials Saturday.
   Cojuangco, who is a first cousin to Mrs. Aquino, said he wanted
to return to clear his name of allegations he helped Marcos loot
the Philippine treasury of billions of dollars.
   The Aquino administration seized Cojuangco's assets and has
named him as a defendant in 29 civil suits. Presidential spokesman
Adolfo Azcuna said criminal charges were also being prepared.
   ``I am thankful that we have been able to come home because for
a long time I have wanted to come back here,'' Cojuangco said in an
interview with DZRH radio. ``And I thank the almighty that I have
been given the opportunity to return to my beloved motherland.''
   Cojuangco told a group of reporters Saturday that his defense
counsel advised him to return home to make it easier to prepare his
defense.
   Cojuangco said he was issued a passport by the Philippine
Consulate in Los Angeles. Azcuna said the palace was unaware any
passport was issued.
   Cojuangco's passport was canceled in 1986, along with those of
Marcos and his immediate family.
   Mrs. Aquino banned the Marcos family from returning and refused
to allow her predecessor' body to be buried in the Philippines,
citing national security.
   Rep. Rodolfo Albano, former minority leader in the House of
Representatives, said Cojuangco's return would boost the opposition
forces, still grasping for a leader since Marcos' death.
   ``If he will accept it, we will wholeheartedly give the
opposition leadership to him,'' Albano said of Cojuangco. ``We
welcome him as the leading light of the opposition.''
   But Nicanor Yniguez, leader of Marcos' New Society Movement
party, said Cojuangco apparently wanted to devote his time to
clearing his name and if he wanted to stay out of politics ``we
respect his decision.''
   Others seeking support from Marcos followers include Vice
President Salvador Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile. Both are seen
as possible contendors for the presidency in 1992. Mrs. Aquino says
she will not seek re-election.
   During the Marcos administration, Cojuangco was described as the
second-most powerful figure in the national economy after the
president himself.
   Cojuangco was variously chairman of the San Miguel Corp., the
country's largest food and beverage company; the United Coconut
Planters Bank; and head of the state monopoly for exporting
coconuts.
   He was also governor of Tarlac province, stronghold of the late
Sen. Benigno Aquino, Mrs. Aquino's husband.

   Nearly a year after Pan Am Flight 103 blew up,
investigators hunting the bombers struggle with an international
web of evidence, theory and tales of political intrigue.
   Theories abound. Some conflict, others interlock. Proving any of
them is another matter.
   Terrorism experts and media investigations have pointed to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
Theories are that Iran hired the organization to avenge a U.S.
warship's July 1988 downing of an Iran Air jet with 290 people
aboard. Iran has denied any involvement.
   Flight 103 of Dec. 21 was an ordinary flight full of ordinary
people: students going home for Christmas; GIs taking infants to
meet their grandparents; a newly engaged couple, a pilot's wife, a
Peace Corps volunteer.
   The Boeing 747 blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, Lockerbie's regional
police force, still heads the investigation. Eighty officers are
assigned to the investigation, which has stretched to West Germany,
Malta and Scandinavia.
   Inspector Thomas McCullough said 85 percent of the Boeing 747
has been recovered, along with 16,000 pieces of belongings that
were on board.
   ``We are making satisfactory progress with the investigation,''
McCullough told The Associated Press. ``Our progress to date
certainly makes us optimistic that there will be a satisfactory
conclusion.''
   Police won't say more. There are reports of friction between the
British and West German police. The two forces don't even agree
publicly about whether the bomb was planted in Frankfurt, London or
elsewhere.
   It is a key question, and the answer will help fix the blame for
the security lapse that allowed the bomb aboard.
   Lord Fraser, the Lord Advocate, Scotland's senior law officer,
recently appealed to the news media to exercise restraint in their
reporting lest they ``seriously jeopardize the international
criminal investigation and any future court proceedings.''
   What is officially on record is that the bomb was made of a
plastic explosive packed in a Toshiba radio-cassette player, and
hidden in a suitcase that was loaded into a forward cargo hold.
   Paul Channon, Britain's transport secretary at the time, said it
was probably Semtex, the colorless, odorless, putty-like explosive
made in Czechoslovakia.
   Deputy Chief Constable John Orr said the ``balance of
probabilities'' pointed to the bomb being loaded on a Boeing 727 in
Frankfurt, where Flight 103 originated.
   Passengers and baggage continuing on to New York were
transferred to the larger plane at London's Heathrow Airport, and
the hold where the bomb exploded contained mostly baggage loaded in
Frankfurt and a small amount of interline baggage, Orr said.
   West German police maintain there's not enough evidence to prove
the bomb was put on board in Frankfurt.
   Paul Wilkinson, an Aberdeen University professor who studies
terrorism, said the Popular Front, a radical Palestinian group
based in Syria, fits the bombmakers' profile.
   ``They have the expertise, they have a tradition of this type of
attack, they have been caught red-handed in West Germany with this
type of bomb,'' he said in an interview.
   PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain, has
denied involvement but admits his faction has used devices such as
the one that destroyed Flight 103.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. and others have named the
bombmaker as Marwan Khreesat, a Jordanian member of the Popular
Front.
   Khreesat was among 16 Palestinians suspected of planning a
terrorist attack who were arrested in West Germany two months
before the Pan Am bombing. In raids in Frankfurt and Nuess, police
also seized Semtex bombs with air pressure-sensitive detonators,
like the one that would rip apart Flight 103.
   All but two of the Palestinians were released. The BBC-TV
investigative program ``Panorama'' said Khreesat was freed because
he was a double agent working inside the Popular Front for
Jordanian intelligence, and is now living in Jordan.
   While The Sunday Times of London made a connection to Iran, CBS
said in February it was in revenge for the 1986 U.S. bombing of
Libya and the U.S. decision to talk with the PLO. They said Jibril
cleared the operation with Syrian intelligence and had the full
backing of the Libyan secret service.
   The Sunday Times said Jibril ordered his top aide, Hafez
Dalkamoni, to set up the bombing team, and that Dalkamoni recruited
Khreesat. Dalkamoni and another Palestinians are in jail in West
Germany as the result of the October raids.
   The Sunday Times said Khreesat assembled the bomb in Frankfurt
and that it was smuggled to Malta, a Mediterranean island republic
with close ties to Libya.
   Dalkamoni and Mohammed Abo Talb, an admitted member the
Palestine Popular Struggle Front, another extremist faction, went
to Malta and told the cell to put the bomb on the Dec. 21 Air Malta
flight to Frankfurt, the newspaper said.
   Abo Talb is one of three Palestinians on trial in Sweden for
bomb attacks in northern Europe on Israeli and American targets.
Court records examined there by The Associated Press confirm Talb
visited Malta Oct. 19-26, 1988, after spending one day in Cyprus.
   The Sunday Times said a baggage list shows one suitcase was
transferred onto the Pan Am flight in Frankfurt from Air Malta
Flight KM180. In violation of international regulations, it was not
accompanied by a passenger. Air Malta says all the flight's
passengers and baggage are accounted for.
   The newspaper said West German authorities knew about the
possible Malta connection in February but didn't tell the British
until August, when the British said the bomb suitcase contained
clothes made and sold in Malta.
   The Sunday Correspondent maintains the bomb began its journey in
Larnaca, Cyprus. It said at least four U.S. intelligence officers
boarded a Frankfurt-bound Cyprus Air flight on Dec. 21 and
transferred to Flight 103, and that one of their suitcases was
switched.
   A report obtained by British relatives of Pan Am victims said up
to eight CIA agents were on Flight 103, returning home after
pinpointing the location of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   The report, said to have been prepared by a private investigator
hired by Pan Am's insurance underwriters, says the agents also
discovered a CIA-protected drug smuggling ring at Frankfurt Airport.
   Sections of the report released by Ohio Congressman James
Traficant Jr., said the terrorists used the drug pipeline to
smuggle the bomb aboard Flight 103 in Frankfurt.
   The CIA has denied the allegations.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half a million cheering
demonstrators today hailed Alexander Dubcek and told their
Communist rulers that a remarkable leadership reshuffle failed to
meet their demands for more democracy.
   Unpopular Prague party boss Miroslav Stepan, a hard-line member
of the new Politburo chosen only Friday, resigned together with the
entire city party leadership today, the official news agency CTK
said.
   Today's rally at Letna field _ the largest in the nation's
history _ was shown on state-run television.
   Dubcek, the bold architect of the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms
that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, made his strongest
comments to date in favor of reform. The rally capped a historic
week of protests that forced the entire ruling Politburo to resign.
   ``The political leadership has lost touch with the people, and
the crisis has deepened,'' said Dubcek, 67, rejecting Friday's
leadership changes as a cosmetic maneuver.
   ``Long Live Dubcek!'' the people cried. ``Dubcek To the
Palace!'' they chanted, referring to the official residence of
Czechoslovakia's president.
   Dubcek, who was ousted from the party he led and spent nearly 20
years in virtual seclusion, urged party leaders to hear the voice
of the people.
   ``I appeal to the Central Committee of the party to take the
initiative and the ideas (of the reform group) very seriously,'' he
said, speaking publicly in Prague for only the second time since
1968.
   Prominent dissident Vaclav Havel also addressed the cheering
demonstrators, telling them that the opposition group Civic Forum
would demand to negotiate democratic reforms with the ruling party
Politburo.
   State-run media also reported criticism from Communist Party
members who said the measures implemented at Friday's Central
Committee meeting did not go far enough.
   The Central Committee replaced the 13-member Politburo with one
containing nine members, six of whom had sat on the former body.
The committee also named Karel Urbanek to replace party leader
Milos Jakes. Urbanek, 48, had been an obscure Politburo member in
charge of the Czech republic.
   Jakes, 67, was the third East bloc leader to fall from power in
five weeks. All were hard-liners who resisted the reforms
instituted by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Central Committee's 16-hour session ended early today with a
retooled government in place but left questions whether the regime
would embrace the changes demanded by demonstrators.
   Official media said the Central Committee adopted a reform
program that envisioned new laws on assembly, association, the
press, education and defense. But a draft law on the press
published recently, for instance, foresaw stiff fines for simply
passing on unauthorized publications.
   Opposition leaders called for a general strike Monday to demand
real reforms.
   Referring to Friday's reshuffle, Dubcek said today, ``The
changes did not meet the demands of the people.''
   ``They (the government) are telling us that the street is not
the place for things to be solved, but I say the street was and is
the place. The voice of the street must be heard,'' he said to
deafening roars from a flag-waving crowd that braved freezing
temperatures to attend the rally.
   ``We appeal to the Central Committee that those who have caused
the stagnation leave their posts and do not obstruct further
development of this country,'' Dubcek said.
   The dramatic developments were chronicled in part on
Czechoslovak state-run television, which on Friday night showed
film clips that revealed Stepan was booed by factory workers who
demanded his resignation Thursday.
   Television showed a stormy city party meeting with lower ranking
officials fiercely attacking Stepan.
   It also repeatedly showed pictures of the police brutality Nov.
17 that helped cause the current protest movement. Police had
clubbed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators urging greater democracy.
   The stunning changes also have been covered in the Soviet media.
The official news agency Tass today described the atmosphere as
``uncertain, tinged with emotion and not without a tint of
political romanticism.''
   Earlier, Zdenek Horeni, editor in chief of the official
Czechoslovak daily Rude Pravo, told reporters the party envisioned
changing the article in the Constitution that guarantees the
leading role of the Communists in government.
   But he refused to say what kind of reform this entails. Previous
comments by party officials have suggested that the Communists will
remain automatically supreme in Czechoslovak politics.
   Jan Urban, chief spokesman of the opposition group Civic Forum,
told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview from
Prague the new Politburo members were all ``very experienced
apparatus people with no idea of reformist thinking.
   He said the opposition was giving the new Politburo until Monday
to show their ``reform minds'' by immediately releasing political
prisoners, starting talks with the people and including
non-Communist parties in Parliament.
   ``There's nothing to be satisfied with,'' he said. ``Not all the
very compromised persons have gone.''
   Seven Politburo members lost their seats. In addition to Jakes,
those ousted included Gustav Husak, Alois Indra, Karel Hoffmann and
ideology chief Jan Fojtik _ all of whom were directly responsible
for the Soviet-led crackdown on the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of
1968.
   Although Husak lost his seat, he retains his title as president
for now.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec also lost his Politburo seat, meaning a
new premier will likely be named soon. The seventh Politburo member
removed was Frantisek Pitra.
   Stepan had kept his seat, as did the head of the official trade
unions, Miroslav Zavadil. Urbanek and five holdovers were joined by
three unknown new men, Josef Cizek, Miroslav Huscava and Miroslav
Zajic.
   What little is known of Urbanek suggests that he is an orthodox
Communist. He criticized leading dissidents in the party weekly
Tribuna in March.

   Like members of a sports team that has just
finished a rebuilding season, members of Congress are telling the
public to wait 'till next year.
   But when they return from their two-month-long holiday break,
election year pressures will make tough legislative issues like
deficit reduction and campaign finance reform even tougher to solve
in the second session of the 101st Congress than they were in the
first.
   ``This is an incomplete Congress,'' said House Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia. ``And I think we won't know until the end
of next year whether it's a good Congress.''
   The Senate started the year with a new chief, Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine.
   Then, nearly halfway through the year, the House had to get new
leadership when Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Majority Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., resigned. Wright was accused of ethics violations
in his personal finances, and Coelho quit rather than face a
similar inquiry from the House ethics committee.
   Gingrich, who was Wright's chief accuser, climbed into the No. 2
spot among House Republicans when Dick Cheney resigned to become
Secretary of Defense.
   ``I can't recall any year having seen such turmoil,'' said Rep.
Dale Kildee, D-Mich., a 13-year House veteran. ``The new leadership
is just beginning to feel its way. ... It's been a salvage and
repair operation.''
   House and Senate leaders at year's end pushed through a raise in
the minimum wage, new spending to fight drugs, aid to Poland and
Hungary and a controversial pay raise and ethics package. A plan
was approved to bail out and re-regulate the savings and loan
industry, at a cost to taxpayers of perhaps hundreds of billions of
dollars in the next few years.
   But completion of many other issues was left for the next
session. Among the major ones: clean air, child care and campaign
finance reform.
   President Bush proposed campaign reforms and a bipartisan House
task force worked on the issue. But agreements were elusive, as
each party pushed for advantage.
   Foley and Mitchell list campaign reform as a top priority for
the new year, but Mitchell said he was not optimistic.
   ``We have to change the method, the system, by which we elect
public officials in our society and by which we finance and conduct
campaigns,'' he said, renewing his call for public financing.
   Mitchell said he also plans to introduce legislation to provide
long term health care for the elderly. But he's not optimistic
about that one either _ given how Congress just repealed the
Medicare catastrophic illness coverage.
   ``There is understandable reluctance on the part of members of
Congress to get into this issue, having just been burned,'' he said.
   Congress every year gets into the issue of deficit reduction,
and this year was typical in that the legislation approved won't
solve the long-term problem.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the House
Budget Committee, said the inexperience of the Democratic leaders
hurt this year's efforts at deficit reduction.
   ``We had two new leaders this year who were not dry behind the
ears before plunging into (budget) summitry,'' Frenzel said.
   ``They will be far more effective next year. They're going to be
able to exercise a lot more discipline. The leaders have to be able
to enforce the agreements.''
   But there also will be ``factors out there not working today,''
he said. ``The election year will make our work immeasurably more
difficult.''
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said one of the best things the
Democratic leaders did was get Congress out before Thanksgiving to
give themselves time to regroup.
   ``We need this time to reflect, to see if we can come up with a
legislative agenda,'' he said.
   ``It has been a long year. I think the membership is
exhausted,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   But Synar was more optimistic about next year, foreseeing
success likely on long-delayed legislation on child care, clean air
and the campaign finance issue.
   ``We get a `C' for the first session,'' he said. ``But we can
improve the grade with a make-up in the first three months'' of
next year,'' he said.

   A man already sentenced to 3,576
years in prison for defrauding the government received an addition
370-year sentence from an anti-graft court.
   Despite the long sentences, Rolando Mangubat will probably spend
no more than 30 years behind bars, because that is the maximum time
in prison the law allows.
   The latest sentence against Mangubat, a former regional
accountant of the Ministry of Public Works and Highways, was
announced Friday after the court found him guilty of 55 graft cases
and four cases of falsifying public documents.
   Mangubat was also ordered to pay the government $86,000, which
he allegedly pocketed by faking delivery receipts of construction
materials from August 1977 to July 1978. He was also barred from
holding any other public office.
   Last month, another anti-graft court found him guilty of 392
cases of fraud and graft and sentenced him to 3,576 years in prison.

   The Navy, under pressure from state officials
worried about safety, has stepped up plans to retrieve live and
deactivated explosives accidently dropped onto public lands outside
bombing ranges.
   The Navy will start looking for the loose ordnance on Bureau of
Land Management property outside two of its bombing ranges during
the next three weeks, said Capt. Rex Rackowitz, commanding officer
of the Fallon Naval Air Station.
   The search is a continuation of an exercise nicknamed
``Operation Ugly Baby'' to retrieve stray bombs that have dotted
the desert at least 60 miles outside Reno for up to 30 years.
   No accidents have been reported involving the bombs, but state
officials have been outraged since revelations surfaced that the
Navy in October began a secret operation outside its Bravo 17 range
to retrieve errant explosives.
   The Navy said it was secretive to prevent the curious from
collecting souvenirs or interfering in the cleanup.
   Navy officials had planned to start the cleanup around two other
bombing rantes, Bravo 16 and Bravo 19, in the spring. In a letter
to Gov. Bob Miller on Friday, Rackowitz said the work would resume
now in order to better protect the public and quickly resolve the
situation that has drawn the unwanted attention of state
environmental officials.
   ``Please know that the Navy is attempting to resolve this
situation quickly and with utmost concern for the safety of the
citizens and property of Nevada,'' Rackowitz wrote.
   Nevada Environmental Protection Chief Lew Dodgion this week
cited the Navy for violating state law by leaving bombs on public
lands. He said he might seek fines as high as $10,000 a day against
the Navy for failing to notify the state about the hazardous
materials cleanup, and failing to file a plan for the recovery
operation.
   Rackowitz said some of the bombs and rockets may have landed
outside the fenced ranges because of inexperienced pilots or
equipment failure.
   The bureau has closed off lands around the ranges during the
cleanup.
   The Navy plans to sweep for bombs outside its Bravo 16 bombing
range beginning Monday through Dec. 2 and on Bravo 19 from Dec.
4-15. About 150 naval personnel are traveling to Fallon to help.
   More than 80,000 pounds of scrap metal and bombs were recovered
from more than 2,000 pieces of ordnance during the the Bravo 17
cleanup, the Navy said.

   Guerrilla forces pounded a key

Saturday after overrunning front-line positions and surrounding the
town with more than 1,000 fighters.
   In a pre-dawn attack Friday, the guerrillas mined Route 69 _ the
government's only access road to Svay Chek town _ and seized
positions east and west of town. Their ultimate objective is
Sisophon, 13 miles to the south, a government military operations
center for areas along the Thai border.
   Government forces returned the guerrilla fire Saturday, opening
up with tanks and heavy guns in blasts that rocked the trenches the
guerrillas had dug in the jungles and rice fields. All day, the
area reverberated with the thunder of heavy rounds and automatic
weapons fire.
   Friday's attack was the third and largest on the town by
guerrillas of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the
front's chief of staff, Gen. Pan Thai, said Saturday. He promised
another big assault Sunday morning.
   ``This is the most important battle so far for the KPNLF,'' he
said. ``If we do not take Svay Chek tomorrow, we will not withdraw.
We will reinforce our positions until we capture Svay Chek.''
   The front is the smallest of three guerrilla groups fighting the
government that Vietnam installed in Cambodia after a late 1978
invasion. Its fighters captured the area north of Svay Chek in late
September, only days after Vietnam made what it claimed was the
withdrawal of its last troops from the country.
   The capture of Svay Chek, the capital of the district of the
same name, would be their biggest victory of the war.
   But they faced vastly superior government firepower.
   ``They have so many mortars and heavy guns we aren't even
counting any more,'' said front-line guerrilla commander Gen. Khun
Boeng.
   Guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government Thursday
increased the number of defenders at Svay Chek to 2,000 by trucking
in 800 more soldiers just hours before the guerrillas cut off Route
69.
   While their jungle-shrouded guns pounded the town with mortars
and rockets, hundreds of guerrillas launched infantry attacks on
the defense perimeters at Svay Chek at 4:30 a.m. Friday. The 107mm
rockets were captured last month.
   ``No problem, no problem! Take cover! Take cover!'' the
artillery commander shouted as the Soviet-made T-54 tanks fired
back.
   Thousands of rounds from rockets, mortars, artillery and
automatic weapons pounded the earth.
   Hundreds of soldiers and civilians brought ammunition and
supplies to the front by ox carts, foot and Soviet-made transport
trucks they have captured in the past two weeks.
   More than 300 guerrillas arrived early Saturday to join the next
assault, Pan Thai said. Guerrilla commanders from infantry and
mortar units met in the jungle command post in Svay Chek district
to plan the attack.
   At one guerrilla base, medics were taking off a truck a
guerrilla wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel from a
rocket-propelled grenade. There were no reliable figures on
casualties in the fighting.
   Next to their hammocks, the guerrillas dug trenches in the
jungles and in the rice fields to prepare for their next advance.

   A shooting spree in the parking lot of a
dog track caused spectators in the packed grandstand to stampede
onto the track, injuring 40 people, and a guard was shot in the leg.
   An unknown gunman indiscriminately fired shots from the parking
lot of the Victoryland dog track toward the main track building
late Friday, then drove away while continuing to shoot, track
president Milton McGregor said Saturday.
   The gunfire ``created a panic circumstance in the first floor
viewing area'' of the grandstand, McGregor said.
   Several hundred people stampeded onto the track, causing most of
the injuries, law enforcement officers at the scene said.
   Track officials said 6,000 people were at the track.
   There had been no arrests by Saturday morning, but police said
they were looking for a dark 1975 Chevrolet or Buick from which the
shots were fired.
   Kevin Traylor, a chart writer at the track, said the shooting
spree prompted officials to cancel the evening's last five races at
Victoryland, the busiest of the state's three dog tracks, located
15 miles east of Montgomery.
   A member of the dog track's police force suffered a superficial
leg wound from a ricocheting bullet, McGregor said.
   Four people remained hospitalized Saturday at Baptist Medical
Center. A hospital nursing supervisor, who asked not to be
identified, said they were all in stable condition and none had
life-threatening injuries.

<HEAD>Move To Show Berlin Wall Where Churchill Cited Iron Curtain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FULTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winston Churchill made his historic speech
about an ``iron curtain'' across Europe in this college town 43
years ago. Now, there's a move to pay tribute to the disintegration
of that curtain by putting part of the broken Berlin Wall on
permanent display.
   Supporters of the idea say it would be a tangible tribute to
Churchill's descriptive phrase, delivered in a lecture at
Westminster College here 43 years ago.
   Diplomatic, logistic and financial barriers would have to be
crossed. Still, supporters say Westminster is the right place for a
symbol of chilled East-West relations.
   ``This was where Winston Churchill first used those words about
an `iron curtain' descending across Eastern Europe. The first
glimpse in 1989 of that curtain ascending across Eastern Europe
brings us a sense of closure to his prediction,'' says the Rev.
Michael Vaughn, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Fulton.
   ``I would like to see the memorial here which notes Churchill's
moment in history bracketed with the other end of history: the fall
of the Berlin Wall.''
   Out of government, but with a wartime leader's perspective on
postwar Europe, Churchill spoke at Westminster on March 5, 1946.
Introduced by President Harry S. Truman, the former prime minister
called for unity between Great Britain and the United States.
   Then he uttered these famous words:
   ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron
curtain has descended across the Continent.
   ``Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of
Central and Eastern Europe _ Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna,
Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia.
   ``All these famous cities and the populations around them lie in
what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form
or another, not only to Soviet influence but a very high and, in
many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow.''
   Churchill, who died in 1965, is memorialized at the school with
a towering statue, an extensive archive and museum, and in an
ancient stone church that was moved from London after being blasted
by German bombs.
   Visitors say the rebuilt church is proof of a future after
conflict, and Vaughn says the relocated wall could also be
inspiring.
   ``I think part of the symbolism should be a massive gap in the
wall if it's brought here _ like the cross, which was a sign of
execution, that we now lift up as a sign of hope in Christianity,''
he says.
   ``Now, a wall that separated us has cracked and come down and
shown us that physical barriers cannot divide free people.''
   East Germany's opening of its border to the West prompted
celebrations at Westminster, where students and townspeople packed
the old church on a recent evening for a service of thanksgiving.
   ``We are here to celebrate the death of an inanimate object _ a
wall,'' Jack Rogers, head of Ecumenical Ministries of Callaway
County, told the worshipers. ``Yet that wall has come to symbolize
all that has kept us apart.''
   For Vaughn, moving a section of the Berlin Wall to Fulton would
be a way of bringing people together.
   ``Often the people of Israel would erect stones to momentous
events, often as altars but sometimes just groups of stones. Later
their children would ask them, `What mean these stones?'
   ``When later generations come, we can point to these stones, if
you will, from the Berlin Wall and say, `This is a period in our
life when we learned how to make peace.'''

<HEAD>Honduras Votes, But Big Problems Are on the Borders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in this poverty-stricken
nation choose a new president Sunday whose biggest problem may be
beyond any Honduran leader's control _ the civil wars raging in two
neighboring countries.
   After years of military rule, it will be Honduras' third
straight free presidential vote.
   ``One thing you can say for the current government is the fact
that we are going to have free elections,'' National Party
candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Callejas is the narrow favorite.If he beats Liberal Party
candidate Carlos Flores and takes office for a four-year term Jan.
27, it will mark the first transition of power to an opposition
party since 1932.
   Both candidates are young, vigorous, U.S.-trained engineers with
relatively conservative economic views and pro-U.S. foreign
policies. The lively campaign and the feeling that Honduras can't
lose have brought a tone of pleased surprise to many comments on
the election.
   Flores, 39, is a newspaper publisher who comes from a family
that owns textile mills; Callejas, 46, comes from one of the
counry's old land-owning families.
   Both candidates support the presence of a U.S. base in
Palmerola, where 1,600 Americans rotate through on training
missions, and both oppose making the arrangement permanent.
   The winner will face a critical situation, however. Honduras, a
country of about 5 million, has all the problems of a Third World
nation: a stagnant economy with per capita income of about $500, a
high foreign debt, massive unemployment, inflation, little
industry, bad telephones and worse roads.
   The country got about $186 million in U.S. aid last year, about
$41 million of it military; $70 million in fiscal support has been
withheld until Honduras makes economic reforms that weren't
possible in an election year.
   Its biggest problems, however, are outside its borders and may
be outside any Honduran president's control: the bloody civil war
in El Salvador on the southeast, and the continuing Contra war on
the southwest in Nicaragua.
   Half a million war refugees have sharpened economic trouble and
created resentment. Arms smuggling is rife and ordinary criminals
wield assault rifles. The U.S.-supported Contras have become an
embarrassment that the country can't shake.
   This year, there was a spurt in political violence on both left
and right. U.S. soldiers were attacked several times, most
seriously in July, when seven soldiers visiting a discotheque were
injured by a grenade.
   Both candidates see peace in Central America as vital to
progress, and although both say the Contras must leave Honduran
soil, neither has offered new ideas on how to do it.
   ``In the long run, there can't be any recovery without peace and
security in Central America,'' said Callejas.
   Foreign investment, outside of bananas and zinc mining, has been
nonexistent in recent years.
   Flores has tried to separate himself from incumbent President
Jose Azcona Hoyo, who took office in 1986 in a split election
against Callejas. Azcona's inability to solve the economic and
Contra problems has hurt. He is barred by law from seeking another
term.
   ``What we need to do is make some strong decisions. Lack of
decisiveness has been most important,'' Flores said in an interview
with the AP.
   Flores also points to the Liberals' successful education and
health programs, although with money low the social security system
has been unable to afford medicine.
   More than 2.2 million voters are registered and 1.9 million are
expected to turn out to elect a president, three vice presidents,
128 members of a unicameral congress and more than 289 mayors.
   Voting is by party slate, so there can be no ticket splitting.
Polls show Callejas with a 10 percent lead and few undecided, but
when voters are asked to select by party, the Liberals have a
slight lead.
   Two minor party candidates are not expected to be a factor. The
military appears to be politically neutral.
   Callejas has campaigned vigorously in traditionally Liberal
regions and has had some success, in part because he became the
first candidate many peasants had ever seen. But party loyalty runs
strong.
   ``Most people have their party symbol branded on them at
birth,'' said Saul Cruz, a carpenter in the southern city of
Nacaome.
   Callejas has promised to reduce the size of government and make
free market reforms, guarantee that investments will not be
expropriated, fight corruption and cut red tape.
   Flores makes similar promises and adds that he will try to reach
a national consensus on economic policy before the inauguration to
``rescue the nation's credibility.''
   With positions similar on substantive issues, the campaign has
at times been bitter and personal.
   Flores does not use his second last name, Facusse, because it
reminds voters that he is of Lebanese Christian descent _ a group
resented because of their economic success.
   Flores was also attacked at first for having an American wife
who does not speak very good Spanish, but Mary de Flores proved a
sympathetic campaigner and the issue faded.

<HEAD>Bad Days for Senator Pothole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day after the Village Voice ran a story
alleging he'd made phone calls to a federal prosecutor on behalf of
two mobsters, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato was acting punchy.
   The report was one more in a series of blows the press has
landed on New York's pugnacious Republican senator, and he returned
a phone call to put his spin on what had happened. But instead of
his usual, ``Howahyah?'' greeting, the senator burst into an
off-key ditty, based loosely on Allan Sherman's parody about an
unhappy camper, ``Hello Mudda, Hello Fadda.''
   ``This is Alfonse.
   ``I've had better
   ``Times and days. ...''
   To the suggestion that things couldn't be that bad, D'Amato was
inspired to a second verse:
   ``The singing waiter
   ``In the future.
   ``How you like your
   ``Wine and pasta?''
   He dissolved into asthmatic laughter. Had Al D'Amato finally
lost it?
   Not at all. Songs and silliness, pet names and baby talk _ this
is D'Amato behind the scenes, schmoozing, cajoling, disarming,
playing the affable dope. And right now, D'Amato needs all the
friends he can get.
   Just as ``Senator Pothole'' had begun to shed his image as a
world-class pork-barreler and small-town machine pol, the media
uncovered his remarkable ability to manipulate the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development to the benefit of his
campaign contributors and friends.
   And he has other troubles. The Village Voice recounted two
questionable phone calls that the senator made to then-U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in 1984 and '85. The Voice said the calls
were on behalf of mobsters; D'Amato denies it.
   Another recent charge involved D'Amato's brother, Armand, a
former state assemblyman who is now a lawyer in private practice.
Armand obtained information for Unisys Corp. by drafting a letter
to the Navy in his brother's name regarding a $100 million
antimissile contract. Unisys was a $35,000-a-year client of Armand
D'Amato's law firm.
   Sen. D'Amato said he was unaware that his brother represented
the Long Island contractor, and said he also had not known about
the letter.
   Since last spring, each week has seemed to bring a new
allegation against D'Amato, and the charges are taking a political
toll. Two recent polls _ one statewide, the other in New York City
_ showed D'Amato's popularity declining for the first time since he
was elected in 1980. In July, Mark Green, the Democrat who lost to
D'Amato in 1986, asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to
investigate.
   On Nov. 17, the ethics committee hired Robert S. Bennett as a
special counsel to determine whether an investigation of alleged
influence-peddling is warranted.
   In an interview last week, D'Amato said he is the victim of a
``pile on'' by the press, adding that he was certain the ethics
inquiry will exonerate him.
   ``I'm proud of my record,'' he said. ``I have nothing to be
ashamed of.''
   D'Amato said his support for housing projects has had nothing to
do with whether a particular developer or applicant had supported
him politically.
   ``Show me where there is a situation where there has been a
town, where there has been a county, where there has been a
worthwhile program or project that has asked for our support where
we've ever turned them aside,'' he challenged.
   And he predicted he will be just the first senator to undergo
similar scrutiny.
   ``If you were to ask for all the letters that various
congressmen and senators sent on behalf of constituents (to) HUD,
you will find that there are a number of grants that have been
successful and that people contributed to them,'' he said.
   ``Are we going to say, therefore, people should be precluded who
contribute to your campaign from normal constituent services? I'm
not talking about things which are extraordinary or things that are
wrong. But a letter of support of a letter of inquiry to take a
look at something? I don't think that's the case.''
   D'Amato's image began to erode in May when the Wall Street
Journal reported how the Reagan-era HUD favored well-heeled
developers who contributed generously to the GOP and hired powerful
Washington consultants.
   Around HUD, the story said, D'Amato was known as ``the senator
from Puerto Rico'' because of the keen interest he took in helping
the commonwealth win subsidies. Some Puerto Rican developers who
obtained these funds were big contributors to D'Amato's re-election
campaigns.
   D'Amato has since denied that he had ever tried to steer HUD
money to any particular developer in Puerto Rico.
   The New York Times dealt D'Amato a second blow two weeks later,
when it reported on irregularities in how inexpensive HUD houses
were awarded in the early 1980s in D'Amato's hometown of Island
Park, N.Y.
   D'Amato has said he played no role in his cousin getting a house
and he has praised the Island Park HUD program.
   But the Times story also chronicled the tale of Island Park's
pork barrel pool, which was to be built using a $425,000 grant
D'Amato had wheedled out of a special fund controlled by then-HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce. In July, the village dropped the project
after unfavorable news reports.
   How does D'Amato justify asking HUD to build a swimming pool in
a middle-class, beach front community, when so many Americans are
homeless?
   ``It was a grievous error in political judgment,'' he admitted
last week. `... If you want to say I was naive as it relates to
Island Park, I was. Dumb.''
   Throughout the summer, as HUD released reams of old files and a
House panel conducted investigative hearings, D'Amato's name came
up again and again. Sometimes his name was being used without his
permission, says D'Amato.
   D'Amato came from Long Island politics to win election to the
Senate after a challenge to Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y., in which he
capitalized on Javits' age (76), illness (a progressive nerve
disease) and liberalism.
   In his first term, D'Amato earned a reputation as the senator
who got the little things done for New York. He bucked his own
party by fighting against President Reagan's demand for an end to
federal subsidies that help pay for mass transit systems, and he
defended tax-exempt industrial development bonds as a stimulus for
creating and retaining thousands of jobs in New York.
   During his second term, D'Amato perfected his knack for latching
instantly onto issues of great public relations value, and emitting
much sound and fury.
   ``As a senator, D'Amato has also been shrewd to the point of
shamelessness in taking practically any position, espousing any
cause, and lobbying for any project or program that could be
popular with even the smallest segment of the New York
electorate...,'' observed ``The Almanac of American Politics 1990.''
   Still, Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington, said in a recent interview that he
believed D'Amato had been on his way to winning some respect as a
senator _ until HUD.

   Witnesses saw flames shooting from a
plane before it crashed and broke into two Saturday on takeoff from
Seoul, state radio reported. At least 19 of the 52 people aboard
were injured.
   The Dutch-made Fokker F-28 also had not gained enough speed
while taking off from Kimpo International Airport to remain
airborne, the state-run KBS network quoted government safety
officials as saying.
   The plane crashed on the runway, broke in two pieces, and its
right wing was ripped off. Airport officials said firefighters with
22 fire engines took 20 minutes to extinguish the fire. The injured
were rushed to four nearby hospitals, the officials said.
   Korean Air officials, who declined to be named, said they had no
idea why the plane had crashed. The captain was among the injured
and officials were waiting to question him, they said.
   It also was not clear what could have caused the flames.
   Airline officials said four passengers were seriously hurt and
15 were slightly injured. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency,
said more than 40 of the passengers and crew suffered at least
minor injuries.
   The airline said four passengers were foreigners, including two
Australians, but they had no further details. The plane, with 46
passengers and a crew of six, was on a domestic flight to the east
coast town of Kangnung.
   KBS quoted witnesses as saying they saw flames shooting from the
plane as it tried to climb into the air.
   It quoted government safety officials as saying it appeared the
flight crew attempted to take off before the plane had gained
sufficient speed.
   An aircraft must reach a sufficient speed during its
acceleration down a runway to reach takeoff speed and gain the
velocity to climb.
   The crash broke the plane in two and ripped off the right wing,
one of the two engines and the landing gear, according to witnesses
at the scene.
   One passenger, Cho Hyung-to, said the plane appeared to climb
about 100 yards into the air when it began tilting to the left,
according to Yonhap. The businessman said the pilot tried to tilt
right to correct the problem, but the plane plunged nose first into
the ground, it said.
   The jet was made by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker in
1985 and purchased by KAL in 1987, airline officials said.
   A Korean Air DC-10 crashed in July while attempting to land in
Tripoli, Libya, killing 80 people. South Korean civil aviation
officials concluded pilot error was the cause of that crash and
this week had ordered the state airline to increase its safety and
training regulations.

<TEXT>
   One of New Orleans' biggest tourist rides is
back on track.
   The 154-year-old St. Charles Streetcar line, the oldest
continually operating streetcar line in the world, made its first
cross-city run in more than a year Friday.
   The streetcars made the 6{-mile trek from the edge of the French
Quarter up St. Charles Avenue with swags of greenery draped above
the windows. During an evening run, people living along St. Charles
Avenue turned on their Christmas lights to greet the riders.
   ``They are the best way to go,'' said one of the first-day
passengers, Kay Young. ``You can have a good time looking around,
and enjoy seeing things as well as it's a wonderful mode of public
transportation.''
   Since October 1988, one stretch of track or another has been out
of commission while crews replace the track and the bed of rocks
beneath it.
   The $47 million project is the first total renovation since the
1835 opening of the line, which is listed both on the National
Register of Historic Places and as a National Mechanical
Engineering Landmark.
   The vintage-1920 cars with a driver's seat at each end are
considerably more modern than the mule-drawn or steam-driven cars
used for the line's first five decades after its opening in 1835.
   Part of the problem in maintaining the streetcars has been that
the rock bed tends to solidify, said Michie Stoutz, spokeswoman for
the project. ``It would become like big blocks of cement.''
   Crews laid down thick, flannel-like fabric and a plastic grid,
both designed to get water out of the rail bed and into the soil
beneath it.
   Then new rocks, imported because there aren't any in south
Louisiana's mushy soil, were laid down and topped with new hardwood
ties and heavier rails than the ones they replaced.
   Planners divided the work into 10 areas to close as few
intersections as possible to other traffic as the parallel sets of
tracks were ripped out, and to minimize disruption to the 20,000
people who ride the streetcars every day.
   Buses have been ferrying riders between Canal Street, on the
edge of the French Quarter, and the edge of construction work.
   Tourists haven't been totally trolley-less. Valerie Robinson, a
spokeswoman for the Regional Transit Authority, said the 1{-mile
riverfront line which opened for the Republican National Convention
in 1988 has been carrying 4,000 people a day during the week and
6,000 to 7,000 a day on weekends _ about as many as can stuff
themselves into the four crimson cars.
   By the time the Aquarium of the Americas opens next September,
officials expect to have added a second set of tracks and three
more cars to the route.
   Streetcars once ran all through this city but only two lines now
exist. The lines covered by asphalt include the Desire Street
route, made famous by Tennessee Williams. One streetcar named
Desire remains on display in the French Quarter.

   An opposition party that has won only
two national elections this century is favored to defeat the
governing Colorado Party in balloting Sunday.
   The vote follows a lackluster campaign that brought out few
differences between the Colorados and the opposition National Party
or their main candidates _ one the son and great-nephew of
presidents; the other the grandson of a longtime party leader.
   Neither center-right party severely criticized the other,
alleged campaign violations or indicated they would dispute the
outcome.
   The winning candidate will replace President Jorge Sanguinetti,
who took over from a 12-year military dictatorship in 1985. The
change of political leadership was not expected to bring major
shifts in policy.
   Polls gave Luis Lacalle of the National Party a big edge over
the main Colorado candidate, Jorge Batlle, whose name is pronounced
BAHT-lee. Equipos Consultores, the country's most respected polling
agency, projected the Nationals would receive 38 percent of the
total vote and the Colorados 30 percent.
   Lacalle and Batlle cite the same problems _ inflation, low
growth, high foreign debt payments, deteriorating public services.
Both want to cut government bureaucracy, allow private companies to
compete with state firms in some areas, sell gold reserves to
reduce the debt and reform public education.
   The Colorados and the Nationals have dominated political power
for a century and a half, except during the 1973-85 military
dictatorship.
   Political observers said Lacalle, whose campaign was considered
a long shot when he started 18 months ago, overtook Batlle by
convincing voters he was less ideological and would undertake
reforms through consensus.
   ``Lacalle has not said exactly what he'll do, but it looks like
he'll do it by coalition, not by force,'' said Luis Rosadilla, a
former Tupamaro guerrilla whose political wing, the Movement for
Popular Participation, supports the leftist Broad Front candidate
for president, Liber Seregni.
   A favorite Lacalle remark is, ``I want to be a president
respected by everyone and feared by no one.''
   Lacalle, 48, is an attorney and was first elected a national
deputy in 1971. During the dictatorship, which followed an attempt
by left-wing terrorists to overthrow the government, he worked on
the family ranch in central Uruguay and practiced law.
   The grandson of Luis Alberto de Herrera, the National Party's
leader for five decades until his death in 1959, Lacalle was
elected to the Senate in 1984.
   Batlle, 62, also an attorney and senator, is the great-nephew of
former President Jose Batlle y Ordonez, who set up Uruguay's
welfare state at the turn of the century. His father, President
Luis Batlle, extended those reforms following World War II.
   Twelve candidates are running for president, although only
Lacalle and Batlle, and perhaps former president Jorge Pacheco
Areco, another Colorado candidate, have a real chance at victory.
   A party may field several candidates. The Colorados and
Nationals have three each. Thus, Lacalle will win if the votes cast
for the three National presidential candidates exceed the total
number of votes cast for any other party.
   Sanguinetti is barred by law from seeking immediate re-election.
   Also at stake is the makeup of the 30-member Senate and
99-member House of Deputies as well as governments in 19 provinces.
   Polls open at 8 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m. Preliminary tallies
are expected late Sunday.
   Voting is mandatory for Uruguayans 18 years and older. Failure
to vote is punishable by a small fine.
   The National Party ruled this nation of 2.9 million between
Brazil and Argentina from 1959-67, winning elections in 1958 and
1962. The term of office later was expanded to five years.
Sanguinetti is due to step down in March 1990.

   Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian
guerrilla base for the second time in three days Saturday, and
Lebanese police said the jets dropped time bombs that exploded as
rescuers dug through the rubble.
   At least two guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command base were wounded in
the air raid, police said.
   In Israel, an army spokesman confirmed the attack on the
guerrilla base. He said the jets returned safely.
   A Lebanese police spokesman said two fighter-bombers fired six
rockets into the base in Sultan Yaaqoub, in the Bekaa Valley, in
two late morning runs.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the planes also
dropped about six time bombs that exploded in a 10-minute period
after the air attack.
   The delayed blasts caused no other casualties, he said.
   Israeli authorities refused comment on the reported use of time
bombs. ``The Israeli Defense Forces do not give information about
weapons or ammunition that it uses,'' said the army spokesman, who
is not identified according to military regulations.
   Israel has reportedly used such explosives in the past in
Lebanon. Their use was reported in the initial days of Israel's
June 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Syrian soldiers manning surface-to-air missile batteries in the
Bekaa Valley did not fire on the Israeli jets, police said.
   The guerrillas opened up with twin-barreled anti-aircraft guns,
but witnesses said no hits were observed.
   On Thursday, four Israeli F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers struck
bases of the Popular Front in Sultan Yaaqoub and the adjacent Deir
Zanoun. One fighter was killed and four were wounded.
   The raid was the 16th Israeli air strike on guerrilla bases in
Lebanon this year. By police count, 18 people were killed and 107
wounded in the earlier raids.
   The Popular Front, led by former Syrian army captain Ahmed
Jibril, is opposed to peace overtures by Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Jibril's faction has been blamed for numerous terrorist attacks
and named in news reports as a suspect in the December 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland. The explosion killed 270
people. Jibril denied his group was involved.

   The stunning events in Eastern Europe are
expected to dominate the upcoming superpower summit in Malta,
although President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev also
will be discussing arms control, trade and regional conflicts from
Nicaragua to Afghanistan.
   Bush is holding his first meeting as president with Gorbachev, a
more experienced summit participant, and his advisers say he is
being briefed on every imaginable topic, including nuclear weapons
controls and the environment.
   At the same time, the president has tried since he first
announced the session on Oct. 31 to reduce expectations of a
dramatic breakthrough _ to the point of insisting the Dec. 2-3
meeting isn't really a summit, just a ``feet up'' get-together.
   ``This is a first meeting, a time for exploration. It is not a
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next
year's summit,'' he said Wednesday night in a nationally televised
speech.
   In an interview with foreign journalists Bush said he was
``prepared to think anew'' about reducing U.S. troop levels abroad
because of changes in Eastern Europe. However, he added, ``we do
what we do in conjunction with our allies,'' not in private talks
with the Soviet leader.
   The events that serve as backdrop for the summit are momentous _
the holes in the Berlin Wall, the changing regimes in Poland,
Hungary, East Germany and Bulgaria and fast-moving developments in
Czechoslovakia. In Prague, the entire Czech ruling Politburo was
pressured to resign in a remarkable weekend
   leadership shuffle that was continuing Saturday with the largest
rally in the nation's history demanding still more change.
   In his speech, Bush described his summit message to the Soviet
leader this way:
   ``We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this process
of reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him our
assurance that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking
advantage, but as a people offering support.''
   The setting for the talks is striking: U.S. and Soviet warships
off the coast of the tiny, island nation of Malta, far from the
crossroads of major international events.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet for more than seven hours over the
two days, talking Saturday aboard the Soviet missile cruiser Slava
and Sunday on the USS Belknap. The ships are to anchor in
Marsaxlokk Bay, within sight of fishing villages on the eastern end
of Malta and about 220 miles north of Tripoli, Libya.
   The customary horde of journalists will be there to cover the
talks _ from a distance _ but Raisa Gorbachev and Barbara Bush will
not accompany their husbands.
   Gorbachev's reputation after four years on the world stage is as
a man who loves to spring surprises, and White House officials say
the president will be prepared for anything thrown his way. Bush
has been meeting regularly with advisers and outside experts,
including one session several days ago with four previous
ambassadors to Moscow.
   The president will know about the highs and lows of the Soviet
leader's perestroika program, an immense undertaking to revamp the
Soviet economy and, with it, military and political policy.
   Administration officials say they are determined to avoid a
repeat of the last superpower summit that the United States played
down, President Reagan's meeting with Gorbachev in Reykjavik,
Iceland, in October 1986.
   Reagan found himself in a spirited bidding match with Gorbachev
on who was more determined to banish nuclear weapons. Their
dazzling duet crashed in disagreement over the U.S. ``Star Wars''
search for a space-based shield against Soviet ballistic missiles.
   So no subject can be ruled out _ with or without an agenda.
   But as described by a number of U.S. officials and the president
himself, Malta primarily will be a listening event for Bush _ an
opportunity to get a firsthand assessment of how Gorbachev is going
about perestroika and what it bodes for U.S. foreign policy and
security interests.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, impelled both by budget
constraints and an easing of East-West tensions, already has vowed
to cut U.S. military spending. Bush's assessment of Soviet
intentions is bound to become part of the Pentagon calculations.
   The President proposed in May a reduction of some 30,000 U.S.
soldiers in Western Europe as part of a treaty under negotiation in
Vienna, Austria, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Administration officials have under study the possibility of
even deeper cuts _ either to be made in a revised proposal by the
allies or to be pursued in a second set of negotiations with the
Soviet-led alliance after a treaty is nailed down.
   The Soviet leader is in the midst of carrying out a unilateral
withdrawal of six tank divisions from Eastern Europe over two
years. And he has pledged to cut Soviet forces by a half-million
overall.
   Bush reiterated his support for perestroika during his presummit
speech and hailed Gorbachev as the ``dynamic architect of Soviet
reform.''
   But that does not mean Bush is going to the Mediterranean with
crates of goodies for Gorbachev.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher has held out the prospect
of a year-to-year waiver of high U.S. tariff barriers if new Soviet
legislation to make emigration and travel easier passes U.S.
inspection.
   But he also cautioned at a recent news conference that
restrictions on trade credits would not be eased.
   Gorbachev has encouraged the political and economic reform that
spread from Hungary and Poland this fall to East Germany and
Bulgaria. But he also has said he wants the Warsaw Pact kept intact.
   Nor would he be receptive to the reunification of a powerful
Germany _ a touchy subject that Bush avoided in his speech.
   Amid the presidential reassurances, though, could be some
pointed discussion about Afghanistan and Central America.
   Bush's speech included the declaration that Nicaragua and Cuba
are holding off a regional trend toward democracy ``only because of
the massive support of weapons and supplies from their communist
allies.''
   ``So when I see President Gorbachev, I'll ask him to join with
us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the peoples of Latin
America,'' he said.
   Soviet weapons also are helping the Marxist government in
Afghanistan against U.S.-aided rebels.

<HEAD>Greens Party Forms to Combat Worsening of Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>

   East Germans worried that the drive to revive
their economy could churn out more pollutants and darken the
brown-coal haze over the nation have formed their own
environmentalist Greens Party.
   East Germany is one of Europe's most contaminated countries,
with rivers awash in industrial effluent and air so heavy with
smoke that visibility is cut to a few blocks in cities such as
Leipzig and Dresden.
   Conditions in Leipzig gave birth to a broad opposition movement
that embraces pro-democracy activists as well as champions of
environmental protection.
   The East German Greens want ``direct influence'' on national
affairs and will field candidates in elections for Parliament and
executive posts, founding member Gerhard Baecher was quoted as
saying in Saturday's National Zeitung, a state-run newspaper.
   Political parties outside the Communist-controlled Parliament
are not recognized by East German authorities, although officials
have recently tolerated public activities by the growing number of
unsanctioned pro-reform movements.
   Opposition groups as well as many senior Communists have called
for free elections as early as next year. But a new election law
must be worked out first to set conditions on candidacy and
balloting, and the various political factions have not yet
clarified who will draft the legislation.
   ``Without a functioning environment, there can be no functioning
society,'' Baecher was quoted by National Zeitung as saying.
   He said the party, like its Western counterparts, would also
champion the causes of women, non-violence and ``total
disarmament.''
   ``Militarism threatens not only peace and security, but it is
the greater environmental danger as well,'' Baecher said.
   West Germany's Greens have been a political force for more than
a decade and have had parliamentary representation since 1982. The
casually clad legislators have shouted down conservatives or
knitted during lengthy parliamentary debates.
   In a break with traditional Greens policy, Baecher conceded that
East Germany cannot for the time being renounce the use of nuclear
power.
   The East German Greens have instead proposed boosting
alternative energy sources, like solar and wind power, over the
next few years to cover 10 percent of national needs.
   Baecher also spoke out for better ties between the two German
states to help East Germany convert from using brown coal as its
primary source of industrial energy production.
   ``Such improved ties could assist in the short-term conversion
to hard coal,'' he told the newspaper. ``West Germany sits on
gigantic mounds of hard coal that they can't even begin to use. We
could use it to reduce emissions by as much as 50 percent.''
   East Germany's new environment minister, Hans Reichelt, told
reporters in East Berlin on Friday that a turn away from brown coal
was not possible soon.
   The nation's major industrial facilities are powered by the soft
coal, which emits significantly higher levels of sulfur than hard
coal. Soft brown coal of the type used extensively in eastern
Europe is banned or severely restricted in most Western countries.
   Reichelt said he expected double the funding for environmental
cleanup projects beginning next year and said more stringent
controls on emission and effluent were being developed.
   Baecher said the new party will seek radio, television and
newspaper exposure to raise environmental consciousness among the
16.5 million East Germans.

   When Mary de Flores steps to the front
of the podium, a thrill runs through the small crowd at a Liberal
Party rally.
   ``It's Mary! It's Mary!'' squealed an 8-year-old girl,
stretching to see the woman in jeans and a red blouse accepting
presents from a group of small children.
   ``Her Spanish is really awful,'' remarked another resident of
this southern Honduran city. ``But she seems very nice.''
   Mary de Flores, born in New Orleans, has made another convert
for her husband Carlos Flores, who wants to be elected president of
Honduras on Sunday.
   ``I was always the shyest in the whole school,'' Mrs. Flores
said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I could never get
up before a big group of people in English, and now I have to do it
in Spanish.''
   It's not the life she visualized when she met the energetic
young engineering student who became her husband at Louisiana State
University.
   ``My father was an engineer,'' she said. ``I kind of expected
that kind of life.''
   She did not expect the poverty that afflicts Honduras, a poverty
so deep that she reveals her age _ 37 _ but not her birthday.
   ``If they know my birthday, really poor people give me presents.
You feel ...,'' she trailed off. ``It's hard to take from people
who have nothing. Someone is making $40 a month and they spend $4
to buy you some flowers.''
   She has two children and works with poor children at a local
hospital.
   ``You see children with kwashiorkor, they've gone for so long
their bodies can't function. Dozens of kids die of measles. That
would never happen in the States. You see kids who drink turpentine
to get rid of worms, parents who sell eggs to buy cola.''
   She was attacked, especially in the Liberal Party primary, for
refusing to take Honduran citizenship.
   ``It's like trying to choose between two children,'' said Mrs.
Flores. ``I didn't come here to escape the United States. My
father, my brother, they fought for the United States.''
   Mrs. Flores would like to do what many Hondurans do and hold
dual citizenship, but she said U.S. officials told her she was too
prominent a personality to take Honduran citizenship without
renouncing U.S. citizenship.
   The issue faded when it became clear Mary de Flores could
connect with the voters.
   ``She's an asset. She is not faking it, and people know that,''
said Flores, who narrowly trails his chief opponent, Rafael
Leonardo Callejas of the National Party.
   ``Sometimes I feel uncomfortable with the upper classes. The
poor people, they remind me of my grandparents, they were cotton
farmers in Tennessee. When I smell a wood fire, it's nostalgic,''
said Mrs. Flores.
   ``The poor have so much faith in what Carlos is saying. When
those people are so poor and so concentrated, you feel an enormous
responsibility,'' she said.
   ``Carlos is optimistic about the future, though. I'm optimistic
because he's optimistic,'' she said.

<HEAD>Iranian Navy, Revolutionary Guards to Hold Joint Naval Maneuvers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Iranian navy said
Saturday his naval forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps will conduct joint maneuvers in the Persian Gulf and the Sea
of Oman next month, Tehran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rear Adm. Ali
Shamkhani as saying the week of war games will concentrate on
training and coordinating the activities of the navy and the
Revolutionary Guards Corps.
   The joint maneuvers follow the merger of the Revolutionary
Guards Ministry and the Defense Ministry, which oversees Iran's
regular forces, earlier this year. The two ministries were merged
to streamline the military chain of command.
   Lack of coordination between the Revolutionary Guards and the
armed forces led to a string of battlefield defeats for Iran in the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The maneuvers, which begin sometime in mid-December, will be the
first since Shamkhani was appointed head of the navy by the
country's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, last month.
   The former head, Rear Adm. Mohammad Hussein-Malekzadegan, was
abruptly replaced as the head of the 14,500-man navy.
   The Iranians held their last naval maneuvers in the Persian Gulf
in mid-October.
   During those war games, Iraq accused two Iranian gunboats of
attacking an Iraqi tugboat and of killing one crewman.
   Iran's U.N. Ambassador, Kamal Kharrazi, denied that accusation.
He said two Iranian boats had been attacked by an Iraqi vessel in
late October and a crewman taken prisoner.
   There has been some disagreement among top Iranian leaders on
what to do about having two separate fighting forces within the
country.
   After his election in July, President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
the Revolutionary Guards would be merged with the regular armed
forces.
   But earlier this month Khamenei said such a merger would not
take place.
   The merger seems to be limited to the level of administration.

   Doris Loretta England and Cecil Pegan
decided late was better than never for their wedding _ 53 years
after their first date.
   ``He's still the same as before,'' the bride said. ``He was a
real nice fellow when I first went out with him _ and he's still a
real nice fellow.'' Their wedding was scheduled for Saturday.
   The two dated for about six months during that initial
courtship, when Mrs. England was still in high school. Then Pegan
left Wabash County to find work in Muncie and they lost touch.
   ``Everyone was working on farms then,'' Mrs. England recalled
last week. ``He was earning about $30 a month, and went down to
Muncie where he could earn $45 a month.''
   Each married and had three children. Mrs. England's husband died
21 years ago. Pegan's wife died four years ago.
   On June 3, the two met again at a school reunion.
   ``I recognized him, but he didn't recognize me at first,'' said
Mrs. England, 70.
   ``He didn't know my last name, so he asked someone and got my
phone number. He gave me a call and it was a real surprise. He
asked me out to supper, for about a week later. But then he decided
he didn't want to wait that long, and he called back to see if we
could meet sooner. So he came over and we had a good reunion.''
   After they decided to get married, Mrs. England went to tell her
mother, Pearl Figert, who is 102.
   ``She kind of remembered him. I asked her what she would think
if I decided to tie the knot again. She told me, `Well, you're old
enough to know your own mind!''' Mrs. England said.
   ``We got along real well,'' said Pegan, 76. ``There were never
any cross words. I don't know why we separated. I had thought about
her quite a bit.''
   The couple was planning a trip south for their honeymoon.
   ``We'll just travel as we feel like it,'' Pegan said. ``There's
still a lot of catching up to do.''

   The roadway the newts use through Tilden Park to Wildcat Creek

   Discovery's astronauts shut down
experiments and checked flight control systems Saturday as they
prepared to end their secret military mission with a rare Sunday
night landing in the California desert.
   NASA gave no details of the flight, but standard procedure for
the day before a landing would call for Commander Frederick Gregory
and pilot John Blaha to run through a series of tests to make
certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for the
return to Earth.
   Mission specialists Manley Carter, Story Musgrave and Kathryn
Thornton were expected to pack up the experiments. Some of which
were believed to be connected with the ``Star Wars'' spaceborne
missile defense project, while others reportedly tested the
astronauts' capabilities as military observers in space.
   Mission Control in Houston broke the official silence on the
mission Thursday to report that Discovery would return home on
Sunday, landing at 7:02 p.m. PST at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Just as Discovery became the third shuttle in 32 missions to be
launched after dark, it will be the third to land at night. The
spacecraft blazed into orbit Wednesday night from Cape Canaveral.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported
Saturday that conditions at Edwards were expected to be acceptable
for landing, with winds gusting from 12 to 20 mph. An earlier
forecast had predicted winds might gust as high as 32 mph.
   Mission rules dictate that the shuttle not land in crosswinds of
more than 20 mph. But there are several runways to choose from at
Edwards, enabling the shuttle to select one that could avoid the
strongest breezes hitting it broadside.
   Otherwise, conditions were expected to be favorable, with
scattered clouds at 8,000 feet and visibility of seven miles.
   If the winds interfere, the shuttle generally carries enough
food, fuel and other supplies to stay up at least two days beyond
the target landing date.
   The Edwards Air Force base, which has been host to as many as
half a million people for shuttle landings, will be closed to the
public Sunday because of the military nature of the flight.
   The news blackout was imposed by the Defense Department, which
wants to keep the flight's goals a secret. However, sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity reported earlier the astronauts had
achieved their main task on Thursday when they deployed a 2{-ton
spy satellite to gather military intelligence over much of the
Soviet Union, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
   The next shuttle flight is set for Dec. 18, when Columbia is due
to lift off here for a 10-day Christmastime flight, during which
the five-member crew will release a communications satellite and
retrieve a scientific satellite.

   Country music legend Johnny Cash says he
has entered an alcohol and drug treatment center here for treatment
to guard against suffering a relapse.
   Cash entered the Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Center for a two-week stay last Sunday, the Nashville Banner
reported Saturday.
   ``I came in sober and I came in straight,'' Cash said. ``Anyone
who has undergone drug treatment has the chance of a relapse, and I
am wise enough to know that. I enjoy my life too much to do that.''
   Lou Robin, Cash's manager, said the singer began his treatment
on the advice of his doctors. He is expected to be released Friday.
   Cash, 57, underwent double-bypass surgery last December. He said
he received strong pain-killers during the stay and that his
doctors advised him to enter the alcohol and drug treatment center
afterward.
   Robin said Cash has been off his pain medication for some time
and is in excellent health.
   Cash has battled drug and alcohol addiction throughout his
career. In 1984, he was treated at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho
Mirage, Calif. At that time, he said had taken amphetamines,
barbiturates and pain-killers for years.
   Cash, a Country Music Hall of Fame member, has since campaigned
against drug and alcohol abuse.
   His manager says Cash will vacation with his family in the
Caribbean following his treatment, and will resume touring in
January.

   What do sports figures Sugar Ray Leonard,
Sonny Jurgensen and Mark Rypien, media celebrities Dan Rather and
Connie Chung and actors William Shatner and Pee Wee Herman have in
common?
   None of them is any match for 89-year-old Sister Marie Louise, a
cloistered nun, when it comes to picking professional football
winners and losers.
   She went 11-and-3 two weeks ago on her appearance as WUSA-TV's
``Mystery Prognosticator Contest,'' which has featured the
less-successful secular selectors.
   That was the week the Houston Oilers defeated the Cincinnati
Bengals on a last-play field goal by Tony Zendejas.
   ``I just had to have that game, because 10 and 4 would have put
me in a tie with some of the others in the race,'' Sister Marie
Louise recalled.
   ``I kept saying `Sweet Jesus, please let me have this Oilers
game,'' she said. ``Then my record will go to 11 and 3. Oh, I was
praying so very hard to the Holy Spirit that night. Well they
finally pulled it through. That little Zendejas came in and booted
it. ... I was jumping out of my chair.''

   Country singer K.T. Oslin says she's
enjoyed the slower pace of Nashville since moving from New York.
   ``I had been very saturated with the city, that's why I moved
away,'' Ms. Oslin said recently. ``You can live longer if you live
here; you're not so stressed out.''
   Ms. Oslin has two big-selling country albums, was named female
vocalist of the year in 1988 and has numerous awards to her credit.
She will headline a benefit on Wednesday for the Nashville
Songwriters Association International.
   She says she spends much of her time now in a suburban Nashville
home with a piano, drum machine and stereo, trying to re-create the
mood she achieved in her New York apartment before stardom.
   ``In the early days I wrote thinking, `Gee, this would sound
good on the radio,' not knowing anything about the restrictions of
radio, the gantlet one must have to run before it even gets to
radio.
   ``I am in a position now of trying desperately not to write for
radio. I'm trying to get back at _ `Gee, this would be fun, I bet
people would love this.'''
   She began her career on the Broadway stage in a 1967 production
of ``Hello, Dolly!'' but made her mark on the country charts with
the anthem ``80s Ladies.'' She also won a Grammy award this year
for her hit, ``Hold Me.''

   Entertainer Jayne Meadows and husband Steve
Allen gave the Salvation Army a ``kettle kickoff'' for its 1989
Christmas season fund-raising campaign.
   Actress Zs Zsa Gabor and poet Rod McKuen also were on hand at
Friday's festivities. McKuen was born in a Salvation Army hospital.
   Miss Meadows told the audience that the Salvation Army was
feeding, clothing and providing shelter for the needy long before
the plight of the homeless became trendy.
   ``Certain organizations become fashionable for a while, but the
Salvation Army has gone on and on and on and on and always will
because they thought about the homeless long before the rest of us
did,'' she said.
   The entertainers sang Christmas carols and encouraged their fans
to give money to the 111-year-old charity.

   President Elias Hrawi declared the
Cabinet of the rebellious army chief, Gen. Michel Aoun, dissolved
Saturday and named a new government to end 14 years of civil war.
His predeccesor, slain after 17 days in office, was buried.
   In a rare display of national unity, businesses in both Moslem
and Christian areas closed for a nationwide day of mourning for
Rene Mouawad, killed by a bomb Wednesday.
   Church bells rang and bands struck slow drum beats as his
flag-draped coffin inched through crowds in Mouawad's hometown of
Zgorta. His widow, Nayla, and daughter Rima and son Michel walked
sobbing behind the cortege.
   Weeping women tossed roses and waved from balconies.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
community, presided over the service, and Papal Nuncio Paolo Ponte
read a message from Pope John Paul II, saying the pontiff was
praying for Lebanon's salvation.
   A 21-gun salute was fired as the coffin was put into a crypt at
St. Mary's Church, where it will remain until completion of a tomb
at the cemetery.
   Aoun said Hrawi's election Friday was ``as unconstitutional as
that of Mouawad. Both have been elected under Syrian occupation.''
   ``They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before
appointing a new president,'' he said in a statement.
   No one has claimed responsibility for Mouawad's assassination.
   Hrawi put himself on a collision course with Aoun by dismissing
the general's military Cabinet before dawn and forming a national
unity government with members from Lebanon's seven major sects.
   The new government, under Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, is to oversee implementation of an Arab League-brokered plan
to introduce political reforms aimed at ending the civil war, which
has killed more than 150,000 people.
   Aoun rejects the accord, which was approved by parliamentarians
in October and which cleared the way for Mouawad's election Nov. 5.
The military general said the plan is unacceptable because it does
not provide a timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops
from Lebanon.
   Mouawad, 64, and 23 other people were killed Wednesday by a
remote-controlled bomb in Moslem west Beirut.
   It was not clear how Hrawi and Hoss would go about removing Aoun
to head off final partition of the country. Aoun commands the
loyalty of a cohesive army of about 20,000 that stands as the
nation's mightiest fighting machine.
   But his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians,
whose soldiers control 70 percent of Lebanese territory under a
1976 Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting.
   State-run television in Beirut said Hrawi, Hoss and Defense
Minister Albert Mansour were meeting possibly to discuss dismissing
Aoun and appointing a new army commander.
   Aoun is holding out with his troops in the country's Christian
enclave, comprising east Beirut and land to the north. He said his
Cabinet is Lebanon's only legitimate government.
   The 54-year-old soldier, a Maronite Christian like Hrawi, was
named to head an interim Cabinet by outgoing President Amin Gemayel
on Sept. 22, 1988, because Parliament was unable to agree on a new
president.
   Lebanon had been without a president since then until
parliamentarians approved the peace plan and then elected Mouawad.
   Hoss, whom Mouawad selected to be prime minister, also was named
prime minister by Hrawi, in addition to foreign minister.
   He retained Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt as public works
minister, and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri as
minister of electrical and water resources. Berri also was given
the housing and cooperatives portfolio.
   Jumblatt and Berri are Syria's main allies in Lebanon. They
fielded the largest Moslem militias in the war against the
Christians.
   Michel Sassine, a Greek Orthdox offered the position of deputy
premier and labor minister, turned down the post and flew to Paris
without explaining why, state-run television in Beirut reported.
   Hoss introduced George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange
Party, Lebanon's largest Christian political force, into the new
government as minister of post and telecommunications.
   Saadeh, a Maronite based in the Christian enclave controlled by
Aoun's army, said his participation must first be approved by his
party's Politburo.
   Also Saturday, Israeli jets blasted Palestinian targets in
eastern Lebanon for the second time in three days, wounding two
guerrillas, in the 16th such air raid on the country this year.
   The target was a Bekaa base of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General command.
   Police said at least two PFLP-GC fighters were wounded as two
fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in two runs at
10:50 a.m.

   A cleaning woman who is the only known witness to
the massacre of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador slipped into
Miami with help from diplomats of four nations, officials said.
   The woman took shelter at the Spanish Embassy in San Salvador
after the Nov. 16 attack during renewed violence in the nation's
decade-long civil war. Late Thursday, she flew with her husband and
daughter to Miami aboard a French military plane, officials said.
   Lucia Barrera Cerna, 40, was turned over to the State Department
and remained in Miami on Friday, said Bernard Kouchner, the French
assistant secretary for humanitarian action who accompanied the
family.
   ``This lady is risking her life,'' Kouchner said. ``You know
Salvador. Who is able to guarantee any life in Salvador? You know
the history of violence and assassination.''
   The woman was brought to the United States ``in the interests of
cooperating fully with President (Alfredo) Cristiani's efforts to
bring the murderers to justice,'' State Department press officer
Dave Denny said Saturday. ``A Salvadoran investigator from the
Special Investigative Unit will be traveling to the United States
to take her deposition.''
   The Miami Herald, quoting unidentified sources, said the FBI was
guarding the family.
   But FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz, contacted Saturday in
Washington, would say only that the FBI was helping investigate the
slayings. ``Our standard policy is not to comment about ongoing
investigations, so we have no comment about the details of that
investigation,'' he said.
   Barrera was likely to be moved at irregular intervals for her
own protection, Kouchner said.
   Salvadoran Attorney General Mauricio Colorado has quoted the
woman, who worked as a housekeeper at Central American University,
as saying she saw men ``dressed in military uniforms'' killing the
Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   Jose Maria Tojeira, the highest-ranking Jesuit in Central
America, has said that Barrera, a university employee for 10 years,
reported 30 military men rounded up the priests and shot them
point-blank in a campus garden.
   ``Inside Salvador, it was impossible to protect'' the family,
Kouchner said. ``There were death squadrons all around.''
   The family's flight received multinational support.
   ``A departure was worked out in conjunction with the Salvadoran
government and French, Spanish, U.S. and British officials,'' said
American Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown.
   Even with approval to leave from the Salvadoran government,
Kouchner said, the family required extensive protection as they
left their homeland.
   ``We transferred the lady under the protection of our bodyguards
and security people from the French and Spanish embassies,'' he
said. ``The American ambassador was there. We all protected the
lady, and I delivered the lady here in Miami.''
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker had said the United States would
do everything possible to obtain the testimony of witnesses and
would offer them protection if necessary.

   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz made a
campaign-style visit Saturday to the opposition stronghold of
Leipzig in his latest effort to portray himself as a popular
reformer and survive a crucial party congress.
   A Communist Party newspaper said some of the leadership under
Erich Honecker, who was ousted Oct. 18, may be prosecuted for
corruption.
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans headed to West Berlin and
West Germany for more shopping, the third weekend of their new
freedom to travel, one of several reforms since Krenz took over.
   Parliament Speaker Guenther Maleuda said in an interview
published by the youth newspaper Junge Welt that parliamentary
elections could come as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law
is passed.
   Krenz's Leipzig visit, broadcast on state TV, was another
attempt to disassociate himself from his mentor's hard-line
policies and present himself as a populist. TV footage showed him
surrounded by workers and shoppers in what seemed like a campaign
stop.
   ``I don't think socialism is kaput,'' Krenz said. ``I think the
disfigurements of socialism are kaput.''
   Citizens grilled him about the country's moribund economy and
the government's sincerity in dealing with corruption.
   ``Come down on Mondays and talk to us,'' said one young man in
the city, where hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets
each Monday. ``Then things will get better in Leipzig.''
   Krenz praised Leipzig for giving ``many impulses'' to the
current promises of reforms.
   Opposition leaders say Krenz's past in Honecker's inner circle
will continue to block his efforts to gain popular support. The TV
report on Krenz's tour appeared aimed at boosting the leader's
image at a time of little trust or sympathy with Communist Party
stalwarts.
   Krenz reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued
leadership within the party now split on how to proceed with
reforms. He has admitted that he could be replaced at next month's
party congress.
   On Saturday, the Communists' daily newspaper, Neues Deutschland,
said members of Honecker's government could be prosecuted for cases
of ``misuse of power, corruption and personal enrichment.''
   Honecker himself is the target of a party disciplinary
proceeding and one of his top lieutenants was stripped of his
membership.
   The newspaper said party disciplinary proceedings were under way
or planned against other former officials. It did not mention names.
   ``Those who have made themselves guilty will be brought to
accountability by the party and, where necessary by judicial
officials and other agencies, both in criminal and disciplinary
proceedings,'' the newspaper quoted chief party investigator Werner
Eberlein as saying.
   In Hamburg, the Bild am Sonntag quoted opposition leader
Wolfgang Schnur as proposing West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker as the head of state for both German nations, in a step
toward possible reunification.
   Schnur is a member of the Democratic Awakening, which is smaller
and generally considered more conservative than the better known
New Forum opposition group.
   The official ADN news agency said an East Berlin policeman
sentenced to jail on charges of injuring a pro-democracy protester
was placed back on the force on suspended duty.
   The move by Police Chief Friedhelm Rausch followed a court
ruling Friday that found the policeman guilty of pushing a
demonstrator down stairs after an Oct. 7 rally. The court sentenced
him to 14 months in prison but an appeal is expected.
   Rausch was quoted as saying the policeman was reinstated because
the court used his dismissal after the incident as proof of guilt.

<HEAD>Whites March in Black Township to Demand End to Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 whites
received a thunderous welcome Saturday when they staged an
unprecedented march into a black township and joined residents in
calling for an end to apartheid.
   The ``March of Hope'' began Saturday morning outside a hospital
in the southern coastal city of Port Elizabeth and proceeded three
miles to the New Brighton township, growing in numbers along the
way.
   When the whites, including children and senior citizens, reached
the township, they were loudly cheered by an estimated 50,000 black
residents who filled the streets. Some youths climbed on rooftops
to get a view of the visitors.
   ``The spontaneous welcome was amazing,'' said Flip Potgieter, a
city councilman in Port Elizabeth. ``This was an amazing
experience.''
   ``You must take this message to your homes and help forge this
unity which will take us to a new, non-racial, democratic South
Africa,'' said Michael Xhego, a black anti-apartheid leader. ``We
hope the whole country will learn from this march and follow suit.''
   New Brighton's assembly hall was packed, and tens of thousands
stood outside to hear whites express solidarity with blacks in
seeking an end to apartheid, South Africa's system of legalized
race segregation.
   ``This shows that good will exists in Port Elizabeth and that
not all whites support apartheid,'' said Ronnie van Wyk, a lecturer
at the University of Port Elizabeth.
   Few South African whites visit the country's black residential
areas, and Saturday's demonstration marked the first organized
march by white citizens into a township. Police kept a low profile
and no incidents were reported.
   Elsewhere, four recently released African National Congress
leaders and several hundred supporters were tear-gassed in the
black homeland of Transkei.
   The four had arrived hours earlier in the homeland capital of
Umtata and were warmly welcomed by several thousand supporters at
the airport.
   However, police fired tear gas into a packed Anglican church
when the four men were preparing to give speeches.
   The reason for the police action was not immediately clear.
   ``I believe these policemen acted on their own crazy
initiative,'' said the Rev. S. Qanjule.
   The police are under the control of the nominally independent
government in the homeland, not the white-led South African
government.
   The homeland's military leader, Gen. Bantu Holomisa, has said
the ANC leaders were welcome in Transkei, and he was scheduled to
appear with them at a rally Sunday.
   The ANC members _ Walter Sisulu, Elias Motsoaledi, Wilton Mkwayi
and Andrew Malengeni _ were not hurt in the incident. The four were
among seven ANC leaders freed from prison Oct. 15 in what was seen
as a trial run for the release of Nelson Mandela, the country's
best known black leader.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk said in September that the
government would no longer break up lawful demonstrations, and
since then there have been dozens of peaceful anti-government
marches throughout the country.
   The decision to allow protests is part of de Klerk's larger
effort to reduce racial conflict in South Africa. In his latest
move, he announced Friday that four neighborhoods around the
country would be open to all races, easing a 39-year-old policy of
strict residential segregation.
   Earlier this month, de Klerk declared beaches open to all races
and called for repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which allows
segregation of many public facilities.
   He says he seeks an end to all discriminatory laws but also
promises to maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods for
whites who want them.

tactic works.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southern California bug experts again are
marshaling their toughest weapons _ pesticides, traps, and swarms
of sterile flies _ to put down a menacing Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation.
   At stake in the medfly war is a big chunk of California's $16
billion annual agricultural production, farm-related jobs and the
availability and affordability of a variety of produce to consumers
nationwide.
   The battlefield for now is a 156-square-mile crescent of Los
Angeles suburbs from the northern San Fernando Valley to the Orange
County community of Brea, 25 miles southeast of downtown Los
Angeles.
   They are fighting the flies with pesticide-spraying helicopters,
quarantines, millions of sterile medflies, thousands of fly traps
and an army of workers to check traps, remove infested fruit,
release the swarms of ``steriles'' and deliver spraying notices.
   Officials hope the millions of sterile male medflies will mate
with fertile females, preventing them from laying fertile eggs.
   The cost of the battle has reached $10 million, but the cost of
losing the war and allowing the fly to become established is
incalculable in a state where road signs proudly claim agriculture
as its No. 1 industry.
   ``It would make California kind of an international pariah. A
lot of other countries and states would slap quarantines on us,''
said Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Food
and Agriculture.
   ``It would not be out of line to say it would destroy the soft
fruit industry in California,'' she said. Vegetable growers and
nursery operators would also be affected.
   The state has faced off with the medfly before. In 1981,
California spent about $100 million to eradicate a statewide
infestation that destroyed $100 million in crops.
   The enemy is smaller than a housefly and has dark blue eyes, a
glistening black thorax with yellowish bands, a yellowish abdomen
crossed by silvery bands, and droopy wings banded and blotched with
yellow, brown and black.
   Native to Africa but now thriving in subtropical regions around
the globe, the medfly lives only about three weeks to a month. A
female, however, can lay up to 300 eggs during a lifetime.
   The eggs, which can be laid in 250 kinds of fruits and
vegetables, develop into maggots that feed on the pulp around them.
   A stricken fruit spoils and falls to the ground, allowing the
larvae to enter the soil. About eight days later they emerge from
the ground as adult flies. Sexual maturity occurs after four or
five more days.
   The first medfly of the current siege was discovered in Los
Angeles County on July 20. That find and later ones triggered
quarantines, aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion, releases
of millions of sterile flies, clearing of fruit from backyard trees
and application of pesticide on soil where infested fruit was found.
   Disturbingly, trapping has continued to turn up fertile medflies
as supply lines to the battlefield have grown long and thin.
   To prevent breeding, sterile flies must be released by the
millions each week for two generations after a zone is sprayed with
malathion. Now the demand for sterile flies exceeds the output of a
laboratory in Hawaii that produces them. The result has been orders
to send up helicopters to give a second dose of malathion to areas
that don't get sterile flies.
   Authorities contend that the finds are not one big infestation
but a series of isolated outbreaks caused by quarantine violations,
commercial smuggling of fruit from Mexico and mailing of produce
from other countries.
   However, Roy Cunningham, the leading entomologist on the state's
medfly advisory panel, called the situation grave this month and
said, ``The attitude is that we are going to have to treat this as
one huge area.''
   Los Angeles County Agriculture Commissioner Leon Spaugy
continues to believe the outbreaks were localized, but the debate
and possibility of more generalized pesticide spraying has fanned
opposition efforts.
   The malathion is mixed with a corn syrup bait that can mar the
finish of cars left uncovered during the late-night sprayings.
What's worse, opponents say, is that spraying poison into the air
over cities could be a health risk.
   Health authorities have long held that malathion delivered in
small amounts _ 2.4 ounces per acre is the standard amount,
according to the state agriculture department _ is not a risk.
Others are not convinced.
   Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, whose district has
an infestation, recently said in a letter to Food and Agriculture
Director Henry Voss that it was clear malathion ``is itself of
questionable safety to the health of humans exposed to it.''
   And Mayor Pat Reichenberger of suburban Monterey Park plans to
ask the City Council there to endorse a resolution demanding Gov.
George Deukmejian prohibit malathion spraying because of unknown
long-term health risks.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
looking back on his work for Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
says he doesn't believe he could have foreseen the thrift's
spectacular failure, expected to be the costliest in the nation's
history.
   Nearly five years ago, Greenspan testified before Congress as a
private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of Lincoln and
its owner, Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift
institutions' direct investments in real estate development.
Greenspan, a conservative economist generally opposed to government
meddling in business, supported him.
   In an interview last week, Greenspan said he was surprised and
distressed by Lincoln's eventual failure because of sour real
estate deals. But he said he still supports short-term direct
investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks.
   Supporters of direct investments have long argued that they can
benefit S&amp;Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages.
   ``I look back and I say to myself, `Was there something I should
have seen and didn't see?' and the answer is, `There was nothing
visible _ at least to me,''' Greenspan said.
   In early 1985, Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln was a fast-growing
institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional
home-mortgage lending. Greenspan was a private economist with
impressive political credentials as President Ford's chief economic
adviser a decade earlier.
   Now, Lincoln is insolvent and under government control.
Regulators say it will cost taxpayers $2 billion to protect its
depositors, making it the nation's largest S&amp;L failure.
   Greenspan is no longer a private consultant and, suddenly, his
five-year-old statements loom large. As chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, he is considered by many to be, after the president,
the most powerful official in the nation. The Fed influences daily
life, perhaps more than any other government agency, through its
manipulation of the economy and credit.
   In a Feb. 13, 1985, letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco, Greenspan argued that Lincoln deserved an exemption from
regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts' direct investment in
real estate and other commercial ventures.
   Lincoln's management, he said, was ``seasoned and expert in
selecting and making direct investments'' with ``a long and
continuous track record of outstanding success.'' The institution
itself was ``financially strong,'' in a ``vibrant and healthy
state'' and ``present(ed) no foreseeable risk to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,'' he said.
   Two weeks later, on Feb. 27, 1985, Greenspan told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on consumer, commerce and
monetary affairs that direct investments, while undoubtedly risky,
were essential for thrifts to diversify their holdings.
   Traditional S&amp;Ls, which took in short-term deposits and made
long-term mortgage loans, were vulnerable to a sharp rise in
interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative,
he said.
   He also endorsed a study by economist George Bentsen, now with
Emory University, which cited the success of 17 S&amp;Ls in direct
investments. Fifteen of the 17 have since failed.
   ``It was my view then, as it is now, that interest rate risk was
the crucial problem confronting S&amp;Ls _ the problem of long-term
assets financed by short-term deposits. In that particular context,
at that particular time, direct investment would reduce risk,'' he
said.
   Greenspan still believes Bentsen took a ``rather sensible
statistical approach'' but he points out that most of the 17 S&amp;Ls
cited in his study were located in Texas, later the center of the
oil and real estate bust.
   The central bank chairman's views have been cited as one of the
reasons why a petition, calling on S&amp;L regulators to postpone
direct investment limits, attracted 225 signatures in the House in
early 1985.
   It is also being cited as a reason why, two years later, five
senators decided to intervene with S&amp;L regulators after Keating
complained about their efforts to examine Lincoln's finances.
   The five _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain,
R-Ariz. _ met with the regulators in April 1987.
   Two of them _ Cranston and McCain _ said Greenspan's views on
Lincoln's health heavily influenced their thinking.
   ``The problem, as conveyed to me at the time, not only by Mr.
Keating but also by Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Young &amp; Co. (an
accounting firm) was that federal examiners bore substantial
responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state
of limbo for this institution,'' Cranston told the Senate Ethics
Committee in a Nov. 16 letter.
   Greenspan said he does not understand why the senators cite his
opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after it was given.
   ``You do not rely on a 2{-year-old letter unless you call the
guy who wrote it. No one ever called me,'' he said.
   Greenspan, as president of Townsend Greenspan &amp; Co., was hired
to review Lincoln's condition by the New York law firm of Paul
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. He said he could not remember
how much he was paid for his work, but said he charged his usual
hourly rate.
   The partners of the law firm, he said, were long-time, trusted
associates. ``They certainly never gave me the slightest impression
that these were other than good people'' at Lincoln.
   Greenspan said he recalls meeting Keating himself two or three
times, but never for a detailed, analytical discussion. The people
working under Keating ``frankly I found fairly impressive,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   An state prison inmate whose sentence was
to have expired Saturday was the first to be charged because of two
nights of riots last month in which 123 guards and inmates were
injured, police said.
   State police at Harrisburg said more arrests were pending in
connection with the violence at Camp Hill State Prison, but they
would not give specifics on when or how many.
   William Diggs, 25, was arraigned Friday at the prison on charges
of riot, kidnapping, assault by prisoner, criminal attempt to arson
and making terroristic threats. Bond was set at $500,000.
   Inmates seized control of the medium-security prison Oct. 25 and
26, terrorizing guards, taking several hostages and setting fire to
many of the buildings in the 52-acre compound.
   The riots caused $15 million in damages. Gov. Robert P. Casey
suspended one prison official and has ordered a complete
investigation into claims that locks broken on the first night were
not fixed, allowing inmates to pop cell doors open for the second
night of rioting.
   No details of the charges against Diggs were released, and
authorities stopped short of calling him a ringleader in the
rioting.
   Cumberland County District Attorney J. Michael Eakin issued a
statement saying Diggs' sentence on a previous offense was to
expire Saturday and police wanted to file the charges before he was
released from prison.
   ``The timing of these charges relates to the defendant's
impending release from custody and should not be construed as
indicative of greater complicity than that alleged in the
charges,'' the statement said.
   Diggs was serving 3 to 6 years on a conviction for robbery and
conspiracy in Philadelphia.
   Eakin said the criminal investigation is continuing. ``We will
begin filing charges for the majority of incidents in several
weeks,'' he said.
   Kenneth Robinson, press secretary for the Department of
Corrections, was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>U.S. Czechs React to Political Changes Sweeping Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th and 9th graf to CORRECT spelling to `Herrmann,' sted

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans of Czechoslovakian heritage were mostly cheered by the
political changes taking place in the eastern European nation, but
many of them tempered their feelings with skepticism.
   ``Boy, this is great _ if it's for real,'' said Glenn W.
Zajicek, former mayor of Wilber, the self-professed Czech capital
of Nebraska.
   ``I have to see it to believe it,'' said Dolores Pavlik, who
lives at the Notre Dame Convent in Omaha, Neb.
   The hard-line Communist Party leadership in Czechoslovakia
resigned Friday, forced from power by a week of huge pro-democracy
protests. But the new government is dominated by officials who also
served the previous regime.
   ``We have to watch the members of that (new) Politburo to see
what direction they will take,'' said Jan Vaculik, editor of a
Czech-language newspaper in the small central Texas town of West.
   Vaculik, who left Czechoslovakia a month after the Soviet
invasion in 1968, said the change isn't yet as sweeping as what has
happened in East Germany. But he said: ``I'm excited at least that
these guys are gone. I always feared that they may turn violent
against the people.''
   One of the speakers at rallies in Czechoslovakia was Alexander
Dubcek, the reformist former party leader ousted in 1968 when
Soviet troops invaded. In the teens, Dubcek's father had immigrated
to the United States, but he returned home after spending 14 months
in an internment camp in Texas for refusing to serve in the
military. Dubcek was born in 1921, after his father returned home.
   In Chicago, Dagmar Herrmann, a Czechoslovakian-born translator
who left her homeland in 1965, said Saturday she visited there
several times this year on business and felt this month's upheaval
``truly was unexpected.''
   ``They must have been as astonished as we were here,'' Herrmann
said. ``Nothing was truly planned, the same way it had been in
Poland. Czechoslovakia doesn't have anything like Solidarity. It
doesn't have opposition parties the same as Hungary had.''
   ``The Czechs are not truly people with their blood boiling. They
are quite stoic,'' she said.
   A woman who fled Czechoslovakia with her husband in 1949 and
settled in Nebraska told the Omaha World-Herald on Friday that she
didn't believe reformers in the Czechoslovak Communist Party can be
trusted.
   ``I don't trust communists,'' she said. ``They lie like it's
nothing.''
   The woman said she didn't want to be identified for fear of
retaliation against her mother and two sisters who still live in
Czechoslovakia. She hasn't seen them in 40 years.
   ``We're scared. We're scared for our people over there,'' she
said.
   Irma Ourecky, director of the Czech Musuem in Wilber, Neb., was
more optimistic. ``No one really knows,'' she said. ``But it seems
like, with the (Berlin) Wall down now, things will be different.''
   In Granger, Texas, a town about 80 miles south of West that is
also predominantly Czech, residents also are watching events
overseas.
   ``It looks like they might finally get some freedom, but it's
hard to judge,'' said Jannine Lalla, who visited Czechoslovakia 11
years ago. ``They're a complicated outfit over there. The people
are so nice, but they are afraid.''
   Joe Vrabel of Granger publishes ``Nasinec,'' a 75-year old
Czech-language weekly newspaper, but has never sold the paper to
residents in Czechslovakia. He hopes the changes pro-democracy
demonstrators seek will make it easier for him to do so.
   ``I never thought it would be free there again,'' he said
Friday. ``I've been thinking, just today, about selling the paper
in Czechoslovakia.''

<TEXT>
   A home for AIDS victims that was allowed
to open only after a federal court battle with the city has closed
after less than 2{ months because of financial problems and public
ill will, its chairman says.
   Keith Thomas, chairman of the Our Place board of directors and a
volunteer at the house, said the board voted unanimously Nov. 18 to
close the home.
   Our Place was intended to house up to seven men. At least two
AIDS victims lived there until their deaths.
   ``The house was shut down officially last weekend,'' Thomas
said. ``We voted to shut it down because of the ill feelings from
the public toward the home, the missappropriation of funds and
in-house fighting between Anna Berry and Charles Baxter.''
   But Ms. Berry, former administrator of the home, said Friday
that Our Place was closed because of a lack of funds, adding that
she got along well with Baxter, who founded Our Place.
   ``The reason the board decided to dissolve (Our Place) was there
was not enough money to keep it going,'' she said. ``Charles and I
were not fighting.''
   Thomas said he began working as a volunteer when the home opened
to balance the books and help residents.
   ``The money was not spent the way it was intended to be spent
when it was donated,'' Thomas said. ``I was a volunteer trying to
set up the books. I know there was mismanagement.''
   Baxter, a nurse's aide with no previous experience running a
boarding house, battled with city officials for several months for
permission to open the house. He filed suit and U.S. District Judge
William Stiehl ordered the city to grant him a permit, ruling that
the denial of a permit violated the Fair Housing Act.
   ``Irrational hysteria and public panic cannot support activity
that ... is clearly discriminatory,'' the judge wrote.
   Baxter got the permit Sept. 5 and the home opened Sept. 10.
   Baxter said the downtown building that he chose for Our Place
was ideal because it had a hospice next door, a hospital down the
street and a doctor's office in the back.
   City officials had argued that the home was too close to a
junior high school and was in a too-heavily traveled part of town.
Other concerns included that it would cause property values to
decline and people to avoid the area.
   Thomas said the board, made up of professionals including a
psychologist, hopes to open another home for people with AIDS.
   There was no comment from Baxter; there was no reply Saturday to
a message left on an answering machine at a listing for him in
Belleville. Someone who answered the phone at Ms. Berry's home said
she was not there.

<TEXT>
   A British businessman who hoped to set
a new distance record in a hot-air balloon canceled the trip early
Sunday because of weather-related damage to the craft that will
take months to repair.
   ``I'm terribly sorry, but we're not going to be able to take
off,'' a dejected Richard Branson said as the balloon was being
deflated behind him, changing from a towering, shimmering mass into
a limp rag the size of a baseball field.
   Branson and his co-pilot, Per Lindstrand, said frost had stuck
parts of the balloon to the ground when it was laid out Friday
night, and when it was inflated Saturday night the fabric ripped.
   The two planned to make a 6,200-mile flight across the Pacific
and land on the West Coast of the United States early this week.
   They had hoped to take off early Sunday after winds forced them
to call off a launch Friday night.
   Local officials in this town on the southern Japanese island of
Kyushu had to scrap a special fireworks show they had planned for
Friday's launch, and the cancellation sent hundreds of disappointed
townspeople walking back down a 1.5-mile-long hill they had climbed
to the launchpad.
   Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways and the Virgin Music
Group, already holds the distance record for hot-air ballooning for
a trip he and Lindstrand made across the Atlantic Ocean in 1987.
That trip almost ended in disaster when the huge craft flew out of
control and crashed into the sea off Scotland.
   Branson said the repair work on the new balloon will take
months. ``But we will be back in January or February, and I hope
that time we have better luck,'' he said.

   Bottle-hurling masked militants
clashed with hundreds of police Saturday after a protest march by
about 15,000 leftists turned violent.
   Ten police officers and at least one militant were injured in
the melee. Fifteen people were arrested, including eight in the
violence, police said.
   People from across West Germany took part in the march
protesting the Nov. 18 death of a 24-year-old woman hit by a car
while police chased her during a demonstration.
   Violence erupted Saturday when scores of militants turned over a
police car in the middle of the city after the protest, witnesses
said.
   Hundreds of riot police converged on the area, and were
bombarded with bottles, stones and metal objects hurled by the
militants, according to witnesses.
   Masked militants among the protesters broke windows at 14
businesses and a police station along the way, said police, who
confiscated air pistols, clubs and spray-paint cans.
   Thousands of police officers sealed off the streets of this city
in Lower Saxony before the protest, which drew members of West
Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, the leftist Greens,
trade unions and church groups.
   The Nov. 18 death occurred after neo-Nazi ``skinheads'' and
masked leftist protesters battled in Goettingen and police moved in
to make arrests. The woman protester was hit by a car while fleeing
from police.
   Activists say she was not involved in the fighting and that
police had no right to pursue her.

<HEAD>County Won't Display Creche</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Allegheny County officials have decided not to
set up a nativity scene surrounded by reindeer and Santa Claus,
even though the U.S. Supreme Court says a secular display is
permissible.
   The Supreme Court ruled in July that the county's traditional
nativity scene crossed the constitutional boundary between church
and state. But the court upheld the city of Pittsburgh's right to
display a Jewish menorah, which stood alongside a Christmas tree in
the City-County Building.
   The Supreme Court said placing secular items around the Nativity
scene would make the display acceptable.
   Given that choice, the county chose to not display the creche at
all.
   ``You have to ask yourself, how much do you want to junk it up?
Then who do you offend?'' said Maura Minteer, manager of the
county's Bureau of Cultural Programs. ``Do you put in a reindeer
and a blue Smurf? I'd just as soon not do it.''
   As in past years, the county will erect a 12-foot Christmas tree
in the courthouse Wednesday, along with wreaths and poinsettias,
Ms. Minteer said.
   Meanwhile, a Jewish group in the Pittsburgh area is asking the
city to reconsider its decision not to place a menorah on the steps
of the City-County Building this year. The menorah marks the
celebration of Hanukkah, which begins at sundown Dec. 22 and lasts
eight days.
   Pittsburgh Solicitor Dan Pellegrini said the city agreed not to
display the menorah if the county could not place the creche in the
courthouse.
   The group Chabad, which began erecting the menorah in 1980,
since has held talks with Mayor Sophie Masloff's office. Charles
Saul, attorney for Chabad, said he last met with city officials
Nov. 13 and is awaiting a decision.
   ``We consider this a free-speech issue, and the menorah is a
symbol of free speech,'' Saul said. ``That area is a public forum
and if they permit other forms of free speech, they ought to permit
this as well.''
   The Supreme Court decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit filed by
the American Civil Liberties Union and several city residents who
objected to the Nativity display and the menorah.
   The Holy Name Society, a Catholic organization that owns the
creche, also doesn't want to see the display surrounded by secular
items.
   The society is working with County Commissioner Lawrence Dunn to
find an alternate downtown location for the creche.

<HEAD>Communists Dismantle Police Ideology Squad</HEAD>
<UNK>With AM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt</UNK>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist leadership on Saturday
dismantled a police squad that cracked down on human rights
activists and political opponents, the state BTA news agency
reported.
   It was the latest in a series of reforms since the Communists
replaced hard-line chief Todor Zhivkov on Nov. 10 and joined the
change that has washed over every Warsaw Pact nation except Romania.
   The decision came one week after 50,000 Bulgarians _ in the
largest protest since Bulgaria became a Communist nation _ rallied
for more democracy, free elections, respect of human rights and an
end to 45 years of police repression.
   Interior Minister Georgi Tanev, after a meeting with new party
leader Petar Mladenov, took away ``a number of functions'' from the
police ideological department and made assignments ``to other state
and public institutions in the spirit of the deep democratic
changes in Bulgaria,'' BTA said.
   The activity of the ideological department will be ``transformed
toward protection of the constitutional order (and) the rights and
freedoms of the citizens,'' BTA quoted Tanev as saying.
   While Tanev did not elaborate, he said the structure of the
ministry would be simplified and its staff reduced.
   ``In the past ... mistakes have been made, there has been an
inclination toward actions based on force at the expense of ...
dialogue,'' BTA said.
   BTA described the police unit as responsible for cracking down
on ``ideological diversion'' and human rights activists. Until Nov.
17, when Parliament scrapped it, Bulgaria had a law forbidding
dissent.
   Last week, Bulgaria's new reform-minded leadership set up a
commission to investigate alleged corruption under Zhivkov.
   Zhivkov, who had been in power for 35 years, has been accused of
living in luxury at the expense of the people, and at recent
rallies protesters demanded he be prosecuted.

<TEXT>
   With 16,000 members, the
Czechoslovak Socialist Party is dwarfed by the 1.7 million
Communist cardholders.
   For most of the past four decades since the Communist takeover,
the Socialists have been docile junior partners who carefully toed
the line of the ruling party and even accepted its leading role in
their statutes.
   But with the ruling party in disarray following a week of huge
pro-democracy demonstrations, they are beginning to flex their
muscles.
   Last week, they issued what a senior party official called a
``declaration of independence,'' printed in the party newspaper,
Svobodne Slova, or Free Word.
   It was a formal and forceful defense of freedom of opinion and a
plea for an ``open dialogue'' about the future of this country. It
was published three days after police clubbed students peacefully
demonstrating on Nov. 17.
   The crackdown triggered a wave of huge protest demonstrations
that eventually brought a shake-up in the Communist leadership. At
the same time, the Socialists' prestige soared.
   Since the declaration was published Monday, speakers at the
protest rallies have addressed the hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators in Wenceslas Square from the party newspaper building
along the square.
   ``You may call that statement a declaration of independence,''
Dr. Jiri Vyvadil, head of the Socialist faction in the Czechoslovak
Federal Parliament told The Associated Press. ``Now, we have become
a real party.''
   Vyvadil, 35, portrays his party as left of center, and said it
has close contacts with the East German Liberal Democratic Party
that also has increasingly distanced itself from the Communists.
   ``We don't want to be heroes,'' he said. ``But the situation
demands it.''
   He said his party wants to be a ``party of national
reconciliation'' and wants a ``consensus with the Communists, but
at this moment that is difficult.''
   ``Our partners accused us of heating up the situation with our
statement,'' he said. ``But if they had joined us in our approach,
things would be quiet again by now.''
   ``The Czech people do not like barricades and heroic deeds,'' he
said. ``We are all a bit conservative, against change.''
   The change in the Socialist Party's stance did not come
overnight.
   Party chief Jan Skoda, who joined opposition speakers at a
protest rally last week, came out in May with a startling call for
genuine political pluralism and for guarantees of civil rights.
   ``Without substantial progress in the democratization of
political, social and economic life we shall not manage to ... gain
the citizens' support for changes,'' he said in a speech that
anticipated the popular pro-reform tide.
   A new party platform reflecting the new approach is nearing
completion. It is to cover a wide list of points, ranging from a
call for a stronger Parliament to a project for a constitutional
court.
   Will the party also call for free, secret elections?
   ``Of course,'' Vyvadil said, ``we would like to resume this
tradition the country knew under Tomas Masaryk,'' the first
president of independent Czechoslovakia.
   ``But I am not sure that we will have as many candidates as we
will need,'' he added in a reference to his party's growing
popularity.

   Parents in one family are collecting
pictures to send to a daughter they have yet to meet. A father in
another home 65 miles away copes with the devastating news he had a
daughter he will never meet.
   The players in the drama that intertwined two families and one
little girl are Ernest and Regina Twigg of Sebring and Robert Mays
of Sarasota and the girl he raised, Kimberly.
   The Twiggs and Mays discovered last Sunday that they raised each
other's child. Kimberly and another girl, Arlena, were born in 1978
in a Florida hospital, swapped and each given to the wrong family.
   Arlena Twigg, Mays' biological daughter, died last year of heart
disease long before he learned of the swap. They never met.
   ``I feel a sense of loss,'' Mays said last week. ``Just what I
lost is hard to say. Obviously I've lost a daughter, but I didn't
know the little girl. I don't have a personality to remember or a
face to remember or anything like that.
   ``I really feel like I had two daughters; one lived and one
died.''
   Mays, a 44-year-old roofing contractor, raised Kimberly, who
will celebrate her 11th birthday Wednesday.
   Genetic testing showed that Kimberly was really born to the
Twiggs, parents of seven other children.
   The child the Twiggs named Arlena and reared as their own was
the daughter of Mays and his late wife, Barbara, who died of cancer
in 1981.
   Both families say a switch occurred at Hardee Memorial Hospital
in Wauchula but they have no idea how. The Mays baby was born on
Nov. 29 and the Twigg baby on Dec. 2, 1978.
   The Twiggs are suing the hospital, and Mays is considering it.
Officials at the hospital have refused to comment on the issue.
   Just before Arlena died in Pennsylvania in August 1988, the
Twiggs discovered through genetic testing she was not related to
either of them.
   After her death, they began a 14-month search for their missing
daughter.
   It brought them to Kimberly Michelle Mays, the only other white
girl in the nursery at the rural Florida hospital at the same time.
   The Twiggs waged a custody battle in court as Mays resisted
genetic testing. He sought the expertise of child pschologists who
advised against it.
   This fall the Twiggs moved their family back to central Florida
to be closer to Kimberly. Twigg, whose children range in age from 6
to 21, got back his old job as an Amtrak ticket agent in Sebring.
   Finally, in late October, they broke the impasse by signing an
agreement renouncing any claim on Kimberly no matter whose child
she was. But they wanted visitation privileges, and promised to let
psychologists for both sides interview the girl and suggest a
schedule.
   On Nov. 17, results of sophisticated series of blood-protein
tests were returned from Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.
The tests, which analyze genes, determined with a 99.9 percent
certainty that Kimberly was a Twigg and with a 98.9 percent
certainty that Arlena was a Mays.
   Both families shared their feelings publicly last week through
tears: tears of joy for the Twiggs that they had found their lost
daughter and tears of pain for Mays, who had to explain to his only
child she wasn't his biological daughter.
   Mays spoke Wednesday about the trauma of telling Kimberly.
   ``She cried and cried and cried for a long time,'' he said. Then
she asked what it meant about their relationship.
   He said he assured her, ``Honey, you'll always be my daughter,''
and told her nothing would change.
   ``I hope desperately we can continue to have the relationship
and the happiness we've shared,'' he said in an interview later.
``I was perfectly happy with our life prior to this, and I think
she was, too. I told her that it had no significance in our life
whatsoever.''
   The Twiggs want their first meeting with Kimberly to be special.
They plan to send family pictures first, then perhaps meet with her
alone _ without their other children.
   ``We'll take it slow,'' Mrs. Twigg said.
   Mays won't talk about his own hurt. ``I'll have the rest of my
life to sort out my feelings as to what happened,'' said Mays.
   He wants to know where Arlena is buried. His attorney has asked
the Twiggs' lawyer for the location of the grave. He said he'll
visit the site as soon as he can.

<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the city is trying to rebuild
following the devastating October earthquake, a court-ordered
change in how the city council is elected will shake up municipal
leadership.
   The Dec. 5 election will mark a switch from at-large to district
elections, mandated by a federal court to give Hispanics fair
representation on the city council.
   ``When we look back 10 or 15 years from now and we see
significant Hispanic participation in voting, Watsonville will be
seen as a catalyst for that change,'' said Joaquin Avila, the
attorney who represented the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund in the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit, filed by the fund in 1985 on behalf of three
plaintiffs, alleged the at-large system discriminated against
Hispanics. Although about half the city of 30,000 was Hispanic,
until then no Hispanic had ever been elected to the council. The
lawsuit was one of many filed by members of minority groups seeking
to overturn at-large voting in cities across the country.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the city's
attempt to overturn an appeals court's order to create district
voting.
   The election, originally scheduled for May 9, was postponed
until Nov. 7 to allow time to develop the district plan. After the
Oct. 17 earthquake, the election was postponed again; the disaster
destroyed more than 300 homes and damaged 1,900 and displaced
dozens of businesses in the town 95 miles south of San Francisco.
   Sixteen candidates, five of them Hispanic, are vying for seven
seats on the new council, which will choose a mayor from among the
council members and work with the more powerful city manager. Three
incumbents are seeking re-election.
   Housing and development, big issues last spring, have become
even bigger since the earthquake, with 135 families still living in
tents or shelters and many more staying with friends or relatives.
   Councilman Tony Campos, a wealthy real estate agent who
inspected many of the cracked buildings, last week estimated damage
at $179 million to businesses and $165 million to homeowners.
Earlier official estimates put the total damage in the city at $112
million.
   The most important business downtown, Ford's, built in 1852 and
the oldest department store in California, succumbed to a wrecking
ball last week.
   Ford's, a $40 million company that also lost two other stores in
the quake, hasn't decided yet whether to rebuild a big store in
Watsonville.
   That decision, and many others that businesses must make,
depends largely on the availability of financing and the speed with
which the city can put together a recovery plan and obtain federal
and state help.
   ``We're going to have to have people who can make decisions,''
said Campos, who became the first Hispanic council member in 1987.
``We're in trouble right now. The earthquake was bad enough. If we
lose these businesses the economic aftershocks will cripple
Watsonville completely.''
   Mayor Betty Murphy, who is running against Campos in District 6,
dismisses the notion that the city, which sits in the center of a
rich agricultural area, could be headed for oblivion.
   ``This is a very strong, personal and old community,'' she said.
``It won't be any ghost town, but it is going to be difficult.''
   Campos and Murphy are stressing the need for experience and
continuity on the new council, arguing that an inexperienced
council can slow recovery.
   Campos opposed the voting rights suit.
   ``If the elections would have been left the way they were, you
would probably have four or five Hispanics on the city council, if
not this year then within the next two-year term,'' he said. ``One
of the worst things they did was file this lawsuit. It's pitting
two incumbents (Campos and Murphy) against each other and causing
some friction in the community.''
   Cruz Gomez, a candidate in District 1, is among those calling
for change, especially in regard to the attention paid to poorer
Hispanic residents.
   Gomez opposes re-electing Campos and the candidacy of another
Hispanic, saying they don't represent poor Hispanics.
   ``We have to go by issues and action, and not by skin color or
origin,'' she said.

<HEAD>Winter-Like Storm Developing Along West Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wintry storm came ashore on the northern Pacific Coast on
Saturday, threatening up to 3 feet of snow in the mountains, and
storm watches were posted all the way to the Rockies.
   Rain fell at lower elevations. Snow began falling on the coastal
mountain ranges of Washington, Oregon and Northern California.
   Two to 3 feet of snow was possible in the northern Sierra Nevada
range in California, the National Weather Service said.
   ``Travel across the Sierra should be avoided if at all possible
during this storm,'' the weather service warned.
   The weather was welcomed by ski resort operators in the Sierra,
who have had a poor season so far.
   ``It couldn't be better,'' said Doug Garver, manager at Boreal
Ski Area. He said snow started falling there Thursday and ``hasn't
stopped since.''
   Four to 8 inches of snow was expected by Sunday morning in south
central Oregon, the weather service said.
   Farther inland, winter storm watches were posted through Sunday
for the mountains of Utah and Utah's northern valleys, the
mountains of southern Idaho and southern Montana, western Wyoming
and the Colorado Rockies.
   From Friday night into Saturday, snow fell across the Colorado
Rockies, with up to 12 inches at Gothic, 10 inches at Berthoud Pass
and 9 inches at Mary Jane and Steamboat, the weather service said.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms drenched the Florida Keys.
Key West was soaked with 2.30 inches of rain late Friday and got an
additional 3.25 inches during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   A few showers and thunderstorms spread along the central Gulf
Coast.
   A few light showers developed along a cold front over Iowa and
eastern Nebraska. In the Northeast, light snow showers extended
over northern New England and upstate New York.
   Temperatures remained in the 50s overnight in Southern
California and southern Arizona. The morning low of 55 degrees at
Riverside, Calif., was the city's warmest on record for the date.
   At the other extreme, lows were in the teens in northern
Minnesota and Upper Michigan, and across much of the Northeast,
with temperatures in single digits in northern Maine. Allentown,
Pa., tied its record low for the date of 16 degrees.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 1 degree above zero at
Houlton, Maine.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Secretary Cheney Implies Army Facing Biggest Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the United
States must maintain naval superiority and modernize strategic
nuclear weapons, implying budget cuts might hit the Army hardest,
the Los Angeles Times said Saturday.
   In an interview in Washington on Friday, Cheney suggested that
the job of maintaining ground forces in Europe could be left to
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, the Times said.
   Cheney, who emphasized that the NATO balance would not be
changed unilaterally by the United States, said one scenario would
have the allies take the main role of ground defense while the U.S.
upgrades naval and air forces in the alliance.
   ``Should the U.S., as some have suggested, take on a role that
emphasizes more heavily the U.S. obligation in the naval area and
in air supremacy and places a greater emphasis with our allies in
terms of the ground combat role in Europe?'' Cheney asked. ``All of
those issues it seems to me are up for grabs.''
   He also said: ``The U.S. is now and will want to continue to be
the pre-eminent naval power in the world,'' even as the nation's
overall defense budget is subjected to cuts.
   Cheney also said ``we're going to want to preserve our strategic
nuclear capability,'' adding that preservation of adequate
conventional forces would be another demand.
   The secretary said he remained skeptical about reforms in the
Soviet Union.
   ``I still think vigilance is the order of the day,'' he said.
``I still think we have to be very cautious about assuming that Mr.
(Mikhail) Gorbachev will be successful, or assuming that his
successors will be more like him than like conventional Soviet
leaders: Brezhnev, Khrushchev, Stalin, etc.''

<HEAD>Federal Study Says Too Many Radioactive Dumps Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States are pushing for more
low-level radioactive waste dumps than the nation needs or probably
can afford, according to a federal report to Congress.
   The Office of Technology Assistance, which reviews scientific
matters for Congress, concluded that too many low-level radioactive
waste sites have been proposed at a time when less and less of that
waste is being produced.
   The report is expected to bolster the arguments of opponents to
radioactive waste sites proposed in such states as Michigan, North
Carolina and New York.
   ``The problem is there is an incredible reduction in the volume
of waste we've had, and it looks like it's going to continue,''
said Gretchen McCabe of the agency, who coordinated the study.
``From a cost-per-unit standpoint, we're estimating huge cost
increases.''
   Utilities and industries in 1988 created 55 percent less
low-level radioactive waste than in 1980, and the amount will
decrease by half again before 1993, the OTA report predicted.
   More than a dozen disposal sites, including one in Michigan, are
proposed to take the waste now handled at three sites.
   The report, given to Congress last week during its hectic push
to wrap up business before the holidays, doesn't specify exactly
how many radioactive waste disposal sites the nation needs.
   ``Frankly, it's a huge political game so there really isn't an
optimal number,'' McCabe said in a telephone interview Friday from
her home in Washington, D.C.
   At least some of the proposed sites will cost more than 10 times
the current amount to run because there is not enough radioactive
waste to support them, McCabe said. Disposal costs now average $35
to $45 per cubic foot to handle 10,000 cubic feet of waste a year,
she said.
   South Carolina, Washington and Nevada now have the only
operating disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. Sites in
Illinois, Kentucky and New York were closed because of health and
environmental dangers.
   When the three states balked at becoming the nation's
radioactive dumping grounds, federal lawmakers gave all states
until 1993 to prove to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission they can
handle their own waste.
   Many states already have entered compacts for other states to
house their waste, angering those whose backyards are selected for
the dumps. For instance, seven Midwestern states have agreed to
send their radioactive waste to Michigan, prompting outrage in the
three Michigan counties considered candidates for the dump.
   The Office of Technology Assessment report gives three options:
a federal limit on the number of dumps, oversight hearings to
encourage states to limit the dumps themselves or no federal action
at all. The agency does not endorse any option.

   Jurors deliberated for the 17th day
Saturday in the sedition trial of three people, reviewing testimony
by an FBI currency analyst and giving little hint of what was
happening in the jury room.
   The two men and a woman are accused of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy and the arcane charge of seditious
conspiracy, which has been rarely used since it was invoked during
the Civil War to prosecute Confederate loyalists.
   Prosecutors allege that Raymond Levasseur, his wife, Patricia
Gros Levasseur, and Richard Williams were members of a terrorist
band that robbed banks and bombed buildings along the East Coast
from the mid-1970s to 1984.
   The jury recessed Saturday without reaching a verdict in the
trial, which has gone on for almost a year.
   The testimony requested was that of FBI Agent Donald Haldiman,
who testified about how money seized at the time of the defendants'
arrest was matched against Federal Reserve shipments.
   Haldiman said records showed the money had been sent to branches
of the Sovran Bank. The indictment alleges that Levasseur and
Williams were part of a group of four men who robbed the Norfolk,
Va., branch of the bank in June 1984.
   Earlier in the week, jurors asked to look at charts of
footprints taken at a bombing site.
   The prosecution based much of its case on notebooks allegedly
written by the defendants in an elaborate code that detailed
strategies and recorded minutes of meetings. Defense attorneys said
the books weren't a reliable record, terming them ``error-ridden
jottings.''
   Some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to
be expected, considering that the trial has taken 11 months and
included testimony from about 200 witnesses. Evidence in the case
filled filing cabinets and boxes stacked in the courtroom.
   A trial in New York City involving some of the bombings
prosecutors allege the group took part in resulted in 19 days of
deliberations.
   The Springfield jury has diligently worked through weekends,
taking only one day off for Thanksgiving and one Saturday off while
a juror renewed her wedding vows. Jurors planned a half-day session
Sunday.

   A Havana court sentenced three Cuban human rights
activists to prison after convicting them of giving false
information to foreign journalists during a drug trial last summer,
the Cuban government news service reported.
   Elizardo Sanchez, Cuba's most outspoken internal critic, was
convicted and given a two-year sentence Friday, Prensa Latina
reported. Hiram Abi Cobas and Hubert Jerez were sentenced to 18
months each.
   The prosecution had asked for prison terms of three or four
years for the three activists.
   The three were arrested Aug. 6 on charges of ``spreading false
information against international peace'' in an attempt to
discredit Cuban courts when they spoke with U.S. television
networks and Radio Marti, a U.S. government station beamed to Cuba.
   The defendants were accused of telling U.S. media that Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez had been psychologically tortured and had
confessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugs
administered by his interrogators.
   Granma, the official Cuban newspaper, said the three carried out
a ``campaign of slander'' aimed at ``discrediting the action of
Cuban courts'' during Ochoa's trial.
   Ochoa, a Cuban war hero, and three other men were executed in
July following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the Cuban
defense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs from
Colombia to the United States.
   The trial and the corruption it revealed were extremely
embarrassing to Cuba's communist leader, Fidel Castro, who had
insisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were part
of a U.S. plot to discredit his government.
   Sanchez, imprisoned for more than six years since 1972,
co-founded the Cuban Human Rights Committee in 1976 and the
Commission for Human Rights and National Conciliation in 1987. He
served eight months for a similar offense in 1986.
   Cobas is acting head of the Human Rights Party of Cuba, and
Jerez is president of the Jose Marti Commission on Human Rights.

   News media in the East bloc on Saturday generally
lauded the political upheavals in Czechoslovakia that removed
hard-line Communist Party leaders but the dramatic events were
virtually unreported in Romania.
   Romanian party chief Nicolae Ceausescu has firmly opposed the
democratic reforms sweeping Eastern Europe and on Friday the
71-year-old Ceausescu was re-elected to another five-year term as
party leader.
   Soviet television's nightly news program Vremya said that as
changes transformed Poland, Hungary and East Germany the
Czechoslovak ``leaders _ now the country's former leaders _
repeated like prayers the words `order' and `quiet.' ''
   Vremya commentator Sergei Andreyev said in the broadcast from
Prague, ``Quiet, if you mean the synonym of stagnation, such quiet
is not needed by a country which has embarked on the road to
democratization.''
   Vremya praised the Czechoslovak protesters for maintaining order
during their massive protests.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the Czechoslovak
Communist Party is willing to form a coalition government with
other parties.
   Although Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms are
credited with providing much of the impetus for the changes in
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Communist Party has given no indication
of accepting such a coalition arrangement.
   Tass quoted former Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Alexander
Dubcek as blaming his country's crisis on ``military interference
in the affairs and life of the Czechoslovak people.''
   Dubcek obviously referred to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pack invasion
of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, which crushed Dubcek's reform
administration that had introduced what became known as the
``Prague Spring.'' Dubcek was ousted and a hard-line party
leadership installed.
   The Soviet government has not renounced the invasion, but some
other East bloc countries have.
   Tass also said the Czechoslovak opposition did not seem to have
``a harmonious and clear-cut action program,'' and many people were
looking to the Communist Party ``to take the country out of the
crisis.''
   In Hungary, which is moving toward a full multi-party system,
the newspaper Magyar Nemzet said, ``The Prague Domino Has Fallen:
the Czechoslovak Party Leadership Resigned.''
   Polish party leader Mieczyslaw Rakowski congratulated Karel
Urbanek on his election as new general secretary of the
Czechoslovak Communist Party, sending wishes for the ``successful
development of social-political reforms in Czechoslovakia.'' Poland
has a coalition government and its premier, a former Solidarity
activist, is the first non-communist government leader in the
Eastern bloc.
   In non-aligned Yugoslavia, newspapers headlined the resignation
of Czechoslovakia's hard-line party leader Milos Jakes.
   ``People are embracing, champagne bottles are being opened,
columns of cars are rhythmically sounding their horns,'' said the
Belgrade daily Politika.
   A Belgrade Ekspres headline said: ``No one (stood) by Jakes.''
   In Jerusalem, former Soviet prisoner Natan Sharansky told Israel
Television that the changes in Eastern Europe made him feel
``exactly as I did when I was released.
   ``On the one hand you're afraid to believe it,'' he said.
``Maybe it's just another dream you're having while in solitary
confinement.''
   He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps before
being freed in an East-West exchange Feb. 11, 1986. He had been
sentenced to 13 years in 1978 on charges of anti-Soviet espionage
for his contacts with Western media and criticism of the Kremlin.
   Sharansky, 41, is the chairman of a Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum
group he founded two years ago to help Soviet Jewish immigrants
adjust to Israel.

   The National League of Cities' annual convention
opened Saturday with drug trafficking and getting federal help to
fight it key topics of discussion for America's mayors.
   Also on the agenda for discussion during the five-day meeting
are ways of dealing with such issues as pollution, ethics in
government and getting more money out of the federal government.
   About 4,500 municipal leaders are expected to attend the
convention.
   The league's president, Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, said
convention discussions would center on the need for federal and
local action in the fight against drugs.
   ``Mayors are going to ... share experiences about what does work
and what doesn't,'' Goddard said in an interview. ``We need to make
a case to the federal government about the extent of what is going
on, because statements issued in Washington, D.C., show that they
don't really know.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle and Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp are scheduled to address the mayors on Monday.
   The mayors are hoping for more visible federal support for local
law enforcement agencies, New Orleans Mayor Sidney J. Barthelemy
said Saturday.
   ``I think all of us hope that the federal government will fund
cities directly; we are the front lines in the war against drugs,''
Barthelemy said. ``We feel the government should give less to the
generals, the state leaders, and more to us, the infantry doing the
fighting.''
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young planned to meet Sunday with other
mayors who are due to leave office this year for a panel discussion
about trends and changes in their cities.
   Young, an unannounced candidate for governor of Georgia, is
slated to receive the League's outstanding leadership award for his
contributions to the organization.
   On Tuesday, Children's Defense Fund President Marion Wright
Edelman is scheduled to speak. Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Reilly is expected to address the mayors
Wednesday.

   More than half a million
demonstrators Saturday scoffed at a Communist Party shake-up and
cheered Alexander Dubcek as he urged leaders to resign and make way
for democratic reforms.
   The beleaguered government bowed to some of the protesters'
demands, releasing a group of prominent political prisoners and
declaring a willingness to give non-Communists greater power.
   Also Saturday, the entire Communist Party leadership of Prague
resigned under increasing pressure for reform. There were
indications the Prague party chief, Miroslav Stepan, was leaving
the nation's ruling Politburo as well.
   On Friday, the 13-man Politburo resigned and the party's
policymaking Central Committee replaced it with a nine-man
Politburo containing several hard-line holdovers including Stepan.
   Another Central Committee meeting was planned for Sunday, with
the government-run news agency CTK saying only that the gathering
would deal with ``political and organizational questions.''
   Dubcek, the reformer ousted after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed his
``Prague Spring'' movement in 1968, was shown for the first time
live on national television as he addressed a sea of flag-waving,
roaring demonstrators at Letna field in northern Prague. It was the
largest rally in the nation's history.
   ``Long live Dubcek!'' the people cried. ``Dubcek to the
Palace!'' they chanted, referring to the official residence of
Czechoslovakia's president.
   Dubcek, who was heckled just days earlier for making what some
considered overly cautious comments, unleashed his strongest public
assault on Communist leaders in more than 20 years. He said
Friday's party changes had failed to go far enough.
   ``The changes did not meet the demands of the people,'' he said.
``The political leadership has lost touch with the people, and the
crisis has deepened.''
   ``We appeal to the Central Committee that those who have caused
the stagnation leave their posts and not obstruct further
development of this country,'' said Dubcek, 67, speaking publicly
for the third straight day.
   Leading dissident Vaclav Havel welcomed the Politburo
resignations but also told the crowd further changes were needed.
   ``Although some of the most discredited people ... were
eliminated, we are deeply concerned by the new personnel lineup of
our top party bodies,'' he said.
   In a 16-hour session that streched into early Saturday, the
party Central Committee replaced party boss Milos Jakes with Karel
Urbanek, a little-known, 48-year-old Politburo member who had been
in charge of the Czech republic.
   Jakes, 67, became the third East bloc leader to fall from power
in five weeks. All were hard-liners who resisted the reforms
inspired by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Five Old Guard Politburo members who were closely linked to the
hard-line policies pursued since the 1968 invasion stepped down,
but Urbanek and five colleagues retained their seats.
   Urbanek, in his first televised speech to the nation Saturday,
opened the way for a more genuine coalition government and admitted
past party mistakes.
   ``We have to distance ourselves from all who have misused their
functions or positions,'' he said. ``Only then will people believe
that we want to end corruption.
   ``We know that we must sit down and negotiate with all those who
are concerned about the destiny of our country,'' Urbanek said.
   He said he would talk with anyone, including opposition leaders
and ``those who left or had to leave the party after 1968.'' He
appeared to refer to Dubcek, who was purged along with half a
million other Communists.
   But Urbanek said his offer was ``nothing new'' and it was
unclear how much power the Communists are willing to share, and
when.
   There are four other parties besides the Communists in
Czechoslovakia. Traditionally docile, they have no powerful
ministries but recently have become increasingly independent.
   A leading Socialist who spoke on condition of anonymity said
last week his party would be ``very reluctant'' to join a
Communist-dominated coalition.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec, ousted from the Politburo on Friday,
said on national television that he was prepared to initiate
dialogue with Civic Forum, the main opposition movement, whose
leaders have called for a two-hour general strike Monday.
   ``Last week, I undertook such dialogue, but we cannot leave it
unfinished. We must meet again and solve problems with which both
sides are concerned,'' Adamec said. ``I think we can do it sometime
next week.''
   State-controlled television shed any semblance of censorship
after the party shake-up. It showed Stepan under fierce attack at a
party meeting. On Friday, it showed workers yelling ``Resign!'' as
he spoke at a factory.
   On Saturday, Stepan stepped down from his municipal post along
with the rest of the city leadership.
   There were indications he would lose his Politburo job as well.
Sources speaking anonymously at the CTK news agency said they were
informed of Stepan's departure from the Politburo but had not been
authorized to carry the dispatch.
   Stepan's Politburo seat was due in large part to his job as
influential Prague party boss, so his resignation on the local
level strongly suggested he was also on his way out from the
Politburo.
   The influential Prague party urged further personnel changes,
including the resignation of trade union chief Miroslav Zavadil. It
also urged an unusual congress to consider further changes to renew
trust in the Communist Party.
   In a concession to demonstrators, President Gustav Husak granted
amnesty to leading jailed dissidents Ivan Jirous, Ivan Polansky and
Frantisek Starek and ordered charges dropped against five other
prominent government critics, CTK reported.
   They are among the best known of about 30 ``prisoners of
conscience'' held in Czechoslovak jails.
   Television repeatedly showed scenes of police clubbing peaceful
protesters on Nov. 17, an attack that sparked a historic week of
demonstrations. And it showed a gathering Saturday in Bratislava of
at least 100,000 demonstrators.

   With cities large and small on the front lines
in the war on drugs, the League of Cities wants Dec. 3-9 declared
as national ``Fight Back Against Drugs Week.'' Local officials are
trying innovative tactics in the struggle, but some ``soldiers''
question whether the nation has the resources and the resolve to
win it.

   In Yakima, Wash., klieg lights aimed at crack houses discourage
nighttime drug deals. Havens for drugs are torched in El Dorado,
Ark. Helmeted Philadelphians sabotage pushers with dusk-to-dawn
street vigils.
   America's cities are battlefields in a way far different from
Bunker Hill or Bull Run. This enemy is drugs, and the weapons
include community hotlines in Columbus, Ohio, newspaper coupons in
Clinton, Iowa, and 1960s-style activism in Shreveport, La.
   ``It's a grassroots war,'' said Randy Arndt, spokesman for the
national League of Cities. ``Drugs is far and away the No. 1 issue
for our cities, ahead of poverty, homelessness, affordable housing
and trash disposal.''
   Images of war are beamed nightly by television into the nation's
living rooms. Police commandos wear flak jackets to shield them
from assault guns. The number of body bags rivals Beirut casualty
lists. Killings erupt from gang wars in Los Angeles to the murder
capital of Washington, D.C.
   President Bush, the commander-in-chief, formally declared war in
September, saying drugs would be fought ``block by block, child by
child.''
   Soldiers in the fight applauded Bush's rallying cry but
criticized the limit of federal dollars, which puts the burden on
cities to pay for the combat.
   ``You can declare war all you want. We ain't got the
ammunition,'' said Sheriff Doug Bair of Yakima County, Wash.
   ``The front line is asked to supply the rear. It's like the
Normandy invasion financing itself by holding a rummage sale,''
said Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, president of the League of
Cities. ``Is that any way to win a war?''
   The League of Cities is pushing Dec. 3-9 as national ``Fight
Back Against Drugs Week'' to give the war on drugs some momentum.
   An underground army has formed of citizens who have had enough.
But criminologist Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland
cautions that fighting should be left to professionals.
   ``Rather than encouraging open combat, officials could ask
citizens to keep their heads down. Not even Smokey the Bear wants
us to rush into forest fires with a garden hose,'' Sherman said.
   The number of bystanders shot and murdered in drug-related
shootings has tripled in the last three years in New York, Los
Angeles, Washington and Boston, Sherman said. From 1986 to '88, New
York City had 128 bystander deaths, Los Angeles 105.
   Police would like to see better national strategies, such as a
national tipline to snitch on drug dealers and stiff fines to make
the drug trade less profitable.
   ``What we are doing is fighting a war. We have not gotten into a
mindset of winning the war,'' said Sevrin Sorensen of the National
Association of Chiefs of Police.
   In the meantime, the combat goes on.
   Yakima, a city of 50,000 in Washington's apple country, has
become a cocaine distribution point for the Northwest, police say.
Drugs are smuggled in from Mexico by agents who blend in with
migrant farm workers.
   To make the drug trade conspicuous, police train four 500-watt
lights on suspected drug dens. Their purpose is similar to air raid
lights discouraging attacking warplanes, and police said they have
reduced traffic 95 percent to the buildings since September.
   ``We want to create a strong sense of paranoia among dealers and
users,'' said Police Chief Pleas Green said. ``We're forcing people
out of their comfort zone.''
   But an American Civil Liberties Union official in Seattle is
unimpressed. ``It sounds like a Hollywood approach to the war on
drugs,'' Jerry Sheehan said.
   The southern Arkansas city of El Dorado, population 26,000,
condemned three suspected crack houses and set them on fire this
spring.
   ``It was really interesting to see people in the neighborhood
standing on the porches, cheering and applauding when the houses
were burning,'' said Mayor Larry Combs.
   In Inglewood, Calif., police have infiltrated suspected crack
houses to run sting operations. When users come to buy drugs,
they're busted.
   In the past 15 months, Philadelphia has sealed 600 abandoned
houses with cinder blocks and stucco to keep out dealers and their
trade.
   A network of community anti-drug groups has spread across
Philadelphia in the past two years. Wearing white plastic helmets,
residents hold all-night vigils to push dealers off street corners.
   ``We all have to get out there and roll our sleeves up. It's the
worst crisis to hit America since Pearl Harbor,'' said Herman
Wrice, a Drexel University professor and community leader.
   The country's heartland, too, has mobilized.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police opened a hotline for residents to
report crack activity in their neighborhoods. It averages about 65
calls a week from private citizens.
   ``Nothing will frighten the pushers so much as to know that
apathy is officially dead in central Ohio, and we're on the
march,'' Mayor Dana Rinehart said.
   Community activists also joined the battle with a block watch
program.
   ``The only way we're going to eliminate the drug problem is to
pitch in and do some of the dirty work. The police can't be
everywhere all the time,'' said Mark Goodman, a member of the Olde
Towne East Neighborhood Association.
   Baseball is an ally in Kansas City, Mo. Ewing Kauffman, the
billionaire owner of the Kansas City Royals, pledged free college
tuition to 500 students at one of the city's most neglected high
schools if they stay off drugs.
   Under the $10 million experiment, the entire 9th and 10th grades
at Westport High School will go to college if they pass random drug
tests.
   ``You give them hope, you give them opportunity, you show them
that somebody cares about them, and they'll stand up to other
people. They'll turn out good,'' Kauffman said.
   The passions of war can even overwhelm anti-tax sentiments. This
month, voters in the Kansas City area approved a quarter-cent
increase in the sales tax to raise $98 million over the next seven
years to fight the war.
   ``The people are fighting back,'' said Joe Serviss, treasurer of
Citizens Against Drugs. ``They are sick and tired of being locked
in their homes and intimidated by drug dealers.''

   The black community of Cedar Grove in Shreveport, La., which was
terrified by an all-night riot 14 months ago, has become the
personal battleground of activist and former comedian Dick Gregory.
   Gregory arrived in June in the northwestern Louisiana city of
200,000. He converted A.B. Palmer Park, once overrun by dope
dealers, into a joyful, child-filled bunker. And he has recruited
Coretta Scott King, her son, Martin Luther King III, and dancer Ben
Vereen for his fight.
   ``I'm here to protect my America and my children. I'm here for
the same reason people go to war,'' Gregory said. ``We want our
neighborhoods back. We want people who'd be willing to die, but not
willing to kill.''
   In the Iowa community of Clinton, police worked with the Clinton
Herald to come up with a newspaper coupon so readers could
anonymously list the names of anyone they suspect of using or
selling drugs.
   ``I'm quite sure we're going to be able to achieve some arrests
through this,'' said Police Chief Gene Bienke.
   But Councilman John Rowland criticized the campaign as ``a Big
Brother syndrome.'' Said Rowland: ``Apparently, it's drugs today.
What is it next week, political subversives?''
   Battlelines stretch from Phoenix, Ariz., to Phoenixville, Pa.
   Authorities in Phoenix target casual users. Those busted can
avoid jail by seeking treatment in rehabilitation centers at their
own expense, which saves on prosecution costs.
   Phoenixville, a Philadelphia suburb of 17,000 residents, hired
its first undercover cop this year. Vince Pacifico, a 25-year-old
former prison guard, helped arrest 31 suspects.
   New York City set up Tactical Narcotics Teams last year after a
rookie police officer was killed guarding a witness in a drug case.
TNT saturates a drug-plagued area for 30 to 90 days, arresting
buyers and sellers to disrupt the drug trade.
   In its first year, TNT made 7,000 arrests. But critics of the
$116 million, two-year program say dealers return when TNT moves
on, not unlike search and destroy missions in Vietnam when
territory was taken but the enemy crept back in.
   Police are encouraged by their successes, but they concede the
enemy is entrenched.
   ``This must be the longest war in history. It's going to be like
the Thousand Year War,'' said Francis Hall, retired head of New
York City's narcotics division.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Open Meeting, Try to End Production Cheating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers formally opened a
strategy meeting Saturday and then turned to private bargaining to
try to end production cheating by some of the 13 member nations.
   Several ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said they wanted crude prices to go higher.
   ``I would like to see them rise,'' Saudi Arabian Minister Hisham
Nazer said at the start of the group's winter conference.
   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh said the cartel ``must get'' to its
target price of $18 a barrel. A basket price of crudes monitored by
OPEC recently hit $17.76 a barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, has been
trading around $20 per barrel. Middle Eastern crudes run several
dollars less.
   The petroleum ministers, who arrived in Vienna several days ago
for informal talks, have as their goal a new production and pricing
agreement for the first half of 1990.
   OPEC's output ceiling now is 20.5 million barrels a day, but
actual production is estimated at more than 23 million barrels.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria told his colleagues the
market ``can easily absorb'' an average of at least 21 million
barrels a day next year.
   A stumbling block in arranging a production deal is demands by
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for bigger shares of the
cartel's output.
   Both have ignored the current accord and pump well over their
quotas. Their actions have angered other members who believe prices
would be higher with more restraint.
   During private discussions Saudi Arabia has proposed that some
countries, like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, be allowed to
produce more.
   ``I think it is a positive concept,'' said Kuwait's Ali Khalifa
al-Sabah. Kuwait, according to analysts, is pumping close to 2
million barrels a day, nearly double its quota.
   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba declined to say what
quota he wanted. He said his country is producing ``more than 2''
million barrels a day, or double its quota.

   The following are the highlights
of Alexander Dubcek's speech before a rally of 500,000 people in
Saturday. His comments were made in Slovak and translated by The
Associated Press:
   The political leadership has lost touch with the people and the
crisis has deepened. ... The changes did not meet the demands of
the people. ...
   They (government leaders) are telling us that the street is not
the place for things to be solved, but I say the street was and is
the place. The voice of the street must be heard. ...
   I appeal to the Central Committee of the party to take the
initiative and the ideas (of the reform groups) very seriously. ..
. We appeal to the Central Committee that those who have caused the
stagnation leave their posts and not obstruct further development
of this country. ...
   Our efforts (in 1968) were crushed, but the ideals of democracy,
freedom and humanity live on in us and in the new generation. ...
Democratic renewal can only succeed when the slogan `All power to
the people' is fully realized.

   A plane carrying mostly Soviet
missiles and other weapons presumably for leftist rebels crashed
near this southeastern village Saturday. Three crew members were
fatally injured and a fourth apparently committed suicide.
   Salvadoran and U.S. military officals said the flight of the
single-engine Cessna originated in Nicaragua and that the crash was
proof Nicaragua's Soviet-backed Sandinista government smuggles
weapons to El Salvador's guerrillas.
   A second plane also apparently on an arms smuggling mission was
burned at a landing strip southeast of the capital San Salvador.
Both planes apparently ran out of fuel.
   Later, rebels fired on a military helicopter carrying reporters
to the site of one of the two planes and two foreign cameramen were
wounded.
   Colleagues said Hugo Burgos, a camerman for Cable News Network,
and Alfredo Hernandez Lopez, a reporter for the Mexican government
radio network were wounded when the guerrillas opened fire near
Zacatecoluca, 18 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   The pilot managed to land the helicopter at the Comalapa
international airport and doctors at the Central Military Hospital
in San Salvador said Burgos was in serious but stable condition and
Hernandez suffered minor injuries.
   The Cessna was carrying 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air
missiles _ 24 Soviet-made and one U.S.-made _ a Soviet-designed
anti-tank weapon and mortar shells. It crashed in a soybean field
just north of the town of El Transito, about 60 miles east of San
Salvador.
   The Salvadoran military press office reported Saturday afternoon
that the second light plane, which had been used to smuggle weapons
to the rebels, was set afire on a dirt landing strip 7 miles
southeast of Zacatecoluca.
   It said residents of the area told army officers the plane's
crew unloaded boxes, presumably containing ammunition, after it
landed. The press office said the plane apparently did not have
enough fuel to take off and the crew burned the craft and then fled.
   The Cessna, painted black and with no registration number, did
not burn. Col. Ricardo Casanova, commander of the 6th army brigade,
said it crashed when it ran out of fuel.
   Fredy Garay, a peasant who lives about a mile from the crash
site, told reporters he heard a sputtering motor and the sound of a
crash at 5:30 a.m. He said as he and a friend approached the
wreckage they heard a single shot.
   Garay said two of the plane's crewmen were dead, one died
shortly after he and his friend arrived and the fourth was dead
from a bullet wound in his right temple.
   Three of the victims wore military fatigue uniforms. None of the
four had identification papers, and officials said it was presumed
they were Nicaraguans.
   An officer showed reporters a Belgian-made Browning pistol that
he said presumably was used by the crewman who shot himself.
   Engraved on the pistol was, ``Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua'' _
Nicaraguan national guard.
   The rear cargo section of the plane was intact but the front
section was destroyed. Salvadoran troops and a U.S. military
adviser were at the Piedra Pacha site within an hour after the
crash.
   When reporters arrived at midday the weapons had been placed in
front of the wreckage _ 24 Soviet-made SAM-7 missiles, one
U.S.-made Redeye anti-aircraft missile, a Soviet-made 75mm
recoiless rifle and 21 Soviet-manufactured 82mm mortar shells.
   A flight plan found in the wreckage indicated the plane was to
have landed at a beach near Amatecampo, south of the capital.
   Lt. Col. Luis Turcios told reporters the surface-to-air missiles
represented ``a great threat.'' He also said the plane ``was proof
of Sandinista intervention in the Salvadoran conflict, of their aid
to the terrorists.''
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have
not used surface-to-air missiles in their 10-year-old war against a
succession of U.S.-backed governments. Such missiles could provide
a tactical boost to the rebels, who last week waged their biggest
offensive of the war.
   El Salvador is northwest of Nicaragua and the two countries are
separated by the Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific Ocean. They do not
share a land frontier.

<HEAD>New Balloting Ordered in Gandhi's District; Vote Fraud Cited</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with re-vote scheduled for Monday, election
commission comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Election officials on Sunday threw out
results and ordered new balloting in Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
district because of vote fraud, affecting about 100,000 voters and
dealing a major blow to Gandhi's re-election efforts.
   The election, with voting staggered over three days on
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, has been tainted by allegations of
fraud. It also has become one of the bloodiest campaigns in
independent India's 42-year history.
   The death toll since polling began rose to 107 Saturday when at
least six people were killed, including a state assembly candidate
fatally wounded by a bomb as he rode his motorcycle in the northern
town of Allahabad. At least 153 people have been killed since
campaigning began in October.
   Sunday, a respected magazine, released results of a poll that
indicated Gandhi's Congress Party would be ``hard pressed'' to win
200 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, Parliament's lower house,
which will choose the next prime minister. The poll was based on
interviews with 11,500 voters.
   The Election Commission issued the stunning order on Gandhi's
Amethi district early Sunday after 10 hours of deliberation.
   It ruled as invalid the balloting Wednesday and ordered new
elections to be held in 98 precincts Monday. About 1,000 voters
were registered in each of the precincts.
   The commission said there were ``serious lapses'' in the Amethi
voting and ordered the Uttar Pradesh state government to
immediately replace the superintendent of police in charge of
polling arrangements along with another officer for alleged ballot
rigging. It directed the state to initiate disciplinary action
against the two men.
   Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. Peri Sastri said the decision
on Amethi was critical for India's future.
   ``It is the country that is involved, not merely the prime
minister,'' he said.
   An opposition coalition had accused the Congress Party of
election fraud in Amethi, 350 miles southeast of New Delhi, even
before the balloting ended Wednesday.
   Congress Party spokesman Anand Sharma denied the allegations and
said the opposition was engaged in a plot to embarrass the prime
minister, who has represented Amethi since 1980.
   So far, the Election Commission has cast out the balloting in
1,236 of the country's 590,000 polling places and ordered new
elections. India has 498 million eligible voters.
   Initial election results are expected late Sunday.
   The top candidate to become prime minister if the opposition
wins told The Associated Press he would not take the job.
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who heads the five-party opposition
coalition known as the National Front, said he would run the party
instead.
   ``It is political suicide to depend too much on an individual,''
said Singh. ``So I have decided not to accept any proposal to
become the prime minister.''
   There was no voting Saturday, but violence persisted.
   In Calcutta, India's biggest city, political activists battled,
and a polling agent was killed in the turmoil. Police fired in the
air and used tear gas to disperse the angry mob.
   Two other people were killed in the southern states of Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. At least 150 Indians fled into Bangladesh
because of political clashes in the far eastern state of Tripura.
   The elections will determine whether Gandhi remains in power or
falls to the most cohesive opposition challenge since India won
independence from Britain in 1947.
   The main campaign issue has been Gandhi's leadership. Neither
party has called for major changes in India's domestic or foreign
policy.
   Reports of high-level corruption have damaged the 45-year-old
prime minister's image as a reformer.
   Massive security was prepared for Sunday's vote in tiny Sikkim
in the state of Punjab, where Sikh separatists have killed more
than 1,650 people this year, and in the state of Bihar, where
clashes between Hindus and Moslems have killed at least 300 people
in six weeks.
   The election turmoil has brought doomsday editorials in
newspapers.
   ``Poll perversion'' said the independent Times of India.
   It called the election in Amethi ``a national disgrace'' and
said: ``If this is the example set in the prime minister's own
constituency, he is left without moral authority to control the
hoodlums and mafia dons who make a mockery of the democratic
process in other parts of the country.''

<TEXT>
   About 300 mourners packed a church
Saturday to remember a newspaper reporter slain in Peru while
investigating narcotics and terrorism there.
   The FBI has joined the probe into the slaying of Todd C. Smith,
28, of The Tampa Tribune, the newspaper reported.
   ``He went for the story,'' Ruel W. Tyson Jr., a friend of
Smith's family, told mourners at the funeral at St. John's
Episcopal Church. ``You see, it was part of his calling, his
assignment. Risk is a part of reporting.''
   Smith had been on vacation. His body was found Tuesday in the
remote town of Uchiza, with a placard nearby denouncing ``North
American spies.'' An autopsy revealed his neck had been broken and
found evidence he had been beaten.
   Authorities suspect the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group,
in Smith's death.
   Smith was in the Upper Huallaga region of central Peru, which is
considered the world's largest source of the coca leaf used to make
cocaine. The area has been in turmoil since Shining Path guerrillas
recently started extorting payments from peasants and Colombian
traffickers to finance their effort.
   Smith, an expert on Latin America, had covered jungle warfare in
Central America. Although on vacation, he apparently was gathering
material for stories.
   Tyson told mourners that Smith's courage stemmed from his
devotion to his work. ``Todd's works, the practices of his calling
as reporter, are the most telling comments on his life,'' the
Chapel Hill, N.C., man told mourners.
   When Smith died, his focus was on his story, Tyson said.
   ``Todd did not live a life that calls for flamboyant terms,''
Tyson said. ``He was no hero. He was a reporter doing his job _
prudently, quietly and with spare prose.''
   Smith reportedly was last seen on Nov. 17, when he was to have
flown home. There were reports that he was overpowered at gunpoint
at the airport on the outskirts of Uchiza or kidnapped from a car
on the way to the airport.
   The FBI is working with the U.S. State Department and the
Peruvian government in the investigation into Smith's slaying, FBI
spokesman Mike Kortan in Washington told the Tribune.
   A memorial service for Smith is to be held Monday in Tampa.

<HEAD>Eastern Blames Machinists For Bomb Threats on Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines blamed striking machinists for
bomb threats against a flight Saturday, claiming their union was
trying to frighten travelers away from the airline during the
holiday season.
   A spokesman for the Machinists union denied that union members
had anything to do with the threats.
   The Associated Press received a call warning that Eastern Flight
90 from Portland, Ore., to Atlanta, due in at 4:38 p.m. Saturday,
was the target of a bomb threat. The anonymous caller said he had
heard about the threat while monitoring air traffic.
   Other news media also received tips on alleged bomb threats,
according to the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said the carrier
received several bomb threats involving Flight 90, including one
from a caller who identified himself as a striking Eastern mechanic.
   After the information was evaluated, the carrier determined the
threats were a hoax, she said. The flight was not disrupted.
   ``Whoever the caller or callers were, they spent more time
calling the media ... I think this is indicative of their (the
Machinists') shift in tactic to try and frighten travelers over the
holiday period,'' she said.
   Charles Bryan, president of Machinists District 100 in Miami,
denied strikers were involved.
   ``I can assure you we are not inolved with any illegal activity
or bomb threats ... that kind of activity can be traced, and we
encourage them (Eastern) to do so and stop the rhetoric,'' Bryan
said. ``We have rigorously and constantly told our membership not
to do anything illegal.''
   The Machinists vowed Friday to continue and intensify their
8{-month strike despite announcements Wednesday and Thursday that
the pilots and flight attendants were ending their walkouts, which
began in March in solidarity with the Machinists' 8,500 members.
   Another Eastern spokesman, Jim Ashlock, said strikers were
``trying to create a big stir, and this is a peak travel weekend. I
believe there's a direct relation between the (bomb threat) tips
and the union workers' announcement about changing tactics.''
   The FBI and the FAA were told about the threats, Ashlock said.

   Police said they were questioning 10
people Saturday who were among the 339 passengers aboard a Saudi
jumbo jet on which a bomb was found.
   Saudi Arabian Airlines said it was ``with God's blessing'' that
the defective time bomb did not explode on board the Boeing 747,
which was rerouted to this southern port city while flying from
Islamabad, Pakistan, to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   While the plane was flying over the Arabian Sea on Thursday
night, airport security in Islamabad received an anonymous letter
threatening to blow the plane up unless a demand for $15 million
was met, officials said. Flight 367 landed safely in Karachi.
   Moinuddin, head of Pakistan's bomb disposal squad in Karachi,
said eight ounces of dynamite were found in an untagged school bag.
It was surrounded by clothes, a cigarette lighter and a box of
matches, said the official, who uses only one name.
   The bomb was set to go off 35 minutes after the jumbo jet took
off from Islamabad, officials said, but a battery apparently jarred
loose, detaching a wire to the detonator.
   In its statement issued in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, the airline
said 332 adults and seven children were aboard.
   Police gave few details about the 10 passengers held for
questioning. ``We haven't laid any charges; we are just questioning
them,'' said a Karachi police official on condition of anonymity.
   He said all 10 were from Pakistan's North West Frontier Province.
   Islamabad police said they also were questioning a taxi driver
who delivered the extortion letter to an Islamabad airport officer
shortly after Flight 367 left Islamabad.
   The note demanded $15 million in ransom to be deposited in three
bags at a location in Islamabad, said the Saudi airline. Pakistani
police earlier put the figure at $1.5 million.
   No one has claimed responsibility for placing the bomb on the
plane, and police have refused to discuss possible suspects.
   A terrorist bomb exploded aboard a New York-bound Pan Am jumbo
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259
people aboard and 11 people on the ground. Investigators determined
the explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorder.

<HEAD>Live From Brooklyn, It's Garrison Keillor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Garrison Keillor returned to the air
Saturday night, saying it's great to be back on radio but that
broadcasting from Brooklyn instead of St. Paul, Minn. feels just a
bit strange.
   At the start of the live, two-hour program broadcast nationally
on public radio stations, Keillor wondered aloud whether anyone in
New York was listening.
   He said it felt ``just a bit odd to do a show in New York City.
You walk around the streets here and you see all the cars on the
streets with signs in the windows that say `no radio in car.' Sort
of feel like you've lost half your audience right there.''
   Keillor said he has learned it's safer in New York ``if you talk
to yourself. So I do that. English mostly. Danish for variety.''
   Saturday's premiere of ``Garrison Keillor's American Radio
Company of the Air'' from the Brooklyn Academy of Music featured a
humorous skit about upper-crust volunteers doomed to fund raising
for public television, satirical slaps at authors and booksellers,
an appeal by a fictitious group that helps clothe featherless
turkeys and several musical interludes.
   The show marked Keillor's return to radio after a two-year
absence that began when he ended ``A Prairie Home Companion,''
which drew 4 million listeners each week on public radio stations.

<HEAD>Violinist Gives Benefit Performance After Drug-Related Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violinist Eugene Fodor gave a benefit
performance Saturday across the street from the courthouse where he
was sentenced last month on a drug-related charge.
   Fodor began with the ``Sonata in G Minor'' by Johann Sebastian
Bach. He dedicated the concert before an appreciative audience of
about 75 people at a church to a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.
   ``It's not easy coming back, but I'm here because I want to face
my demons,'' Fodor said in an interview before the concert. ``I'm
grateful for my new health and I'm happy to be here on different
terms.''
   Fodor, 39, was arrested July 27 and convicted of breaking into a
Martha's Vineyard motel room. A search of the room turned up a
bottle containing more than 20 grams of cocaine, a hypodermic
needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger.
   Fodor pleaded innocent to charges of possession, but after
pleading guilty to the breaking and entering charges he was
sentenced to three years' probation under which he is subject to
random drug testing.
   The violinist had planned Saturday night's concert as a gesture
to the community that he feels started him back on the right track.
   ``I'm grateful for the way my case was handled and for my
recovery and the fellowship I have found. It was here that the
intervention took place. That started me on the program of
sobriety.''
   Proceeds from the concert were to be donated to a drug education
program at the public schools on Martha's Vineyard, a resort island
south of Cape Cod.
   Fodor, an acclaimed violin virtuoso, won a silver medal in the
1974 Tchaikovsky Competition at age 24. After a period of dazzling
success, critics began accusing him of playing only showy
crowd-pleasing selections that lacked maturity. His career began to
tumble, reaching its nadir in the motel room arrest.
   Fodor, who recently spent 28 days in drug rehabilitation in New
York state, said his trials have had a positive effect on his music.
   ``I've found a new spirituality to my music,'' he said. ``I feel
I have never played better. I'm finding depth to my music I didn't
think was possible.''

<TEXT>
   The last issue of the Rome-based daily newspaper
Paese Sera appeared Saturday, just about two weeks shy of its 40th
birthday.
   The failure of the Communist-controlled newspaper follows years
of disputes between the management, the staff and the ownership
consortium that included the printers and the Italian Communist
Party.
   Paese Sera did not say how many people would be put out of work
by the closure, but the Rome newspaper Il Tempo said it would leave
44 journalists and an unspecified number of other employees
unemployed.
   The newspaper's printing house has said since March 1983 that
the newspaper was facing closure because of financial problems.
   Giuliano Prasca, a member of the editorial committee, told the
news agency that the newspaper had run up a deficit of
approximately $2.1 million over the past six years.
   The government-owned television RAI television network reported
that the newspaper's daily circulation stood at 11,000. Another
Communist newspaper, Il Manifesto, reported that Paese Sera would
have needed an average daily circulation of about 16,000 in order
to survive.

   A caterer whose plan to feed the
hungry backfired on Thanksgiving hasn't lost his spirit of giving,
and said Saturday that he plans to make free meals at his banquet
hall a regular event.
   It looked like John Kostik, 40, was going to be stuck with
hundreds of pounds of leftovers from a party planned for 900 needy
people for which only 24 showed up.
   But a food bank came to his rescue, saying it would not let the
food go to waste.
   ``It was the strangest Thanksgiving I've ever had,'' Kostik
recalled on Saturday.
   More volunteers showed up to help serve the food than people to
eat it.
   Kostik and his wife, Jane, 40, found about 80 people to give
food to Friday, but still had about 200 pounds of turkey, 210
pounds of potatoes, 60 cases of bulk corn and more than 200 pumpkin
pies left.
   ``We gave them a couple of turkeys each and some pies. We loaded
them up,'' Kostik said. ``We found the food bank as a result of all
the media attention we got.''
   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank will distribute the
food to poor families, said Joyce Rothermel, the group's executive
director.
   Kostik said he mailed dozens of announcements about the feast,
which cost him $1,000, to Pittsburgh-area newspapers and television
and radio stations, but apparently none was used.
   Volunteers posted fliers throughout the neighborhood, but that
didn't help much either.
   The only people who showed up were reporters who found out about
the free party to which few came.
   ``I hung up on the first television station that called that
afternoon. I didn't want them to make me any more depressed than I
already was. I didn't want to watch my empty banquet hall on TV
that night or read about it in the paper the next day,'' Kostik
said. ``But the attention turned out to be a real good thing after
all.''
   Kostik thinks his use of the word ``needy'' on the fliers
discouraged many people in his neighborhood from coming.
   ``We have a lot of ex-steelworkers here who have been unemployed
a long time and a lot of senior citizens on fixed incomes. They're
the kind of people who are too proud to ask for a handout,'' he
said.
   Kostik wants to try again. He plans to begin serving free meals
at least once a month at the banquet hall.
   ``I'll probably do that starting in December _ maybe every other
Tuesday _ for about 400 or 500 needy people,'' he said.
   But he'll probably rely on word of mouth to attract guests.
   ``On Friday, a lot of people told me if I do this again, they'll
bring a couple of their neigbors who are in the same situation.''

<HEAD>Desert Race Leaves 11 Cyclists Injured</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,100 cyclists buzzed across
the burning Mojave Desert on Saturday in a 135-mile, off-road
motorcycle race that was marred by eleven injuries and has been
opposed by environmentalists.
   Officials of the American Motorcyclists Association charged that
someone had tried to litter the course between Barstow and Las
Vegas with spikes.
   But the four-pronged spikes were dumped on a dummy course that
had been set up to fool protesters, the organizers said.
   Saboteurs also moved some of the course markers, said Ken Boyd
of the association.
   ``They're nothing more than terrorists,'' Boyd said. ``When you
change the course you can take riders over canyons, have them drop
off of cliffs. The riders would have no knowledge of the course.''
   Patricia Schifferle, regional director fo the Wilderness
Society, said the annual race damages topsoil and releases tons of
particulate matter into the air.
   ``We'd like to see this be the last race,'' she said.
   Ms. Schifferle said instructions for riders to stay on the
course for safety and to avoid crushing endangered desert tortoises
are just ``a few token bones tossed to the tortoise for a one-day
joyride.''
   The course was ``ugly,'' said rider Westly Peterson of Los
Angeles. ``It's real dusty, real rough and real short.''
   The race staging area took on the look of a heavy-metal concert
early Saturday with riders and their families, many clad in leather
and chains, arriving before dawn for the race's 7 a.m. start. The
whine of motorcycles reached earsplitting levels as the bikers
revved up, and sand filled the air as the race got under way.
   The Bureau of Land Management said 1,144 motorcyclists and 4,000
to 5,000 spectators and crew members gathered for the event.
   ``It's a zoo, but I love it,'' said referee Ed Hales.
   Three racers suffered serious injuries and were taken to the
Fort Irwin military base hospital, BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield
said. Eight lesser injuries, including dislocated elbows and knees
and broken collarbones, were reported.
   Ms. Maxfield said the race generally took place without
incident, although about 10 riders strayed off course near the
beginning and rode into a wilderness study area.
   ``Other than that it seems to have gone very well,'' she said.
   Ms. Maxfield said BLM officials went over the course both before
and after the race and found no tortoises.

   A West German news magazine
reported Saturday that Lawrence Eagleburger, U.S. deputy secretary

   ``For me there is no question that Germany will be reunited.
This process is now inevitable,'' the Hamburg-based Der Spiegel

   But Spiegel said he added: ``I can't simply tell you how long
that will take.''
   Spiegel quoted him as saying there might be some who are made
nervous by the prospect of eventual German reunification, but that
there is no need to be concerned ``about a democratic Germany
united in peace and freedom.''
   Spiegel printed Eagleburger's comments in German, and they were
translated back into English by The Associated Press.
   The magazine did not say where the U.S. official was interviewed

   The bodies of a woman and a teen-ager
believed to be her daughter were found with their throats slashed
and their mouths gagged with duct tape in a basement apartment
Saturday, police said.
   Police entered the apartment around 10:50 a.m. after the
landlord reported an odor from the basement that he first noticed a
couple of days before, said Lt. Charles Savage.
   The victims were not identified pending notification of
relatives. Savage said the two lived in the apartment in this city
of 43,000 just outside Boston.
   The body of the older woman, who was about 35 years old, was
found in a bedroom, Savage said. The teen-ager, who was about 14,
was found in a closet.
   ``Their throats were slashed, they had stab wounds and there was
duct tape over their mouths,'' he said.
   The time and cause of death have not been determined, said a
technician with the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's office who
would not give his name.
   There were no suspects, Savage said.

   Two off-duty firefighters shopping in a crowded

a pillow display, a fire chief said.
   A plastic container filled with a flammable liquid was put in
the display at a Macy's store in the borough of Queens, then
lighted, said Fire Chief William Nagle.
   Firefighters Bill Kregler and Wayne Wright happened to be in the
store shopping separately during the afternoon when they heard
cries of ``Fire!'' and ran to help, Nagle said.
   The two calmed frightened shoppers and tried to put out the fire
with hand-held extinguishers. When that failed, they took over a
store fire hose that two Macy's employees were unraveling.
   By the time Nagle's crew arrived, the fire was out, the chief
said.
   Kregler was taken to a hospital suffering from smoke inhalation,
but was not seriously harmed said St. John's Hospital administrator
Catherine Wilkinson.
   The store's third floor was temporarily evacuated, but there was
no serious damage, Nagle said.
   The fire was ruled arson and fire marshals were investigating,
he said.

   A British man and woman were selected Saturday to
go to the Soviet Union to train for an Anglo-Soviet commercial
space mission. One is to become the first Briton in space.
   Maj. Timothy Mace, 34, and Helen Sharman, 26, were chosen from
among some 13,000 hopefuls who answered newspaper advertisements.
Their selection from among four finalists was announced Saturday by
the Juno space mission in Moscow and relayed in a live television
broadcast to Britain.
   Mace, an advanced instructor in helicopters in the army air
corps, is a British parachuting champion.
   Miss Sharman researches the chemical and physical properties of
chocolate for the Mars candy company and is studying for a
doctorate degree in the luminescence of rare earth ions.
   Both will train but only one will join two Soviet cosmonauts on
the eight-day mission Juno in April 1991. The other is to act as
understudy.
   The mission is the first commercial space flight and is being
financed by international sponsoring companies. During the mission
the crew is to conduct scientific experiments aboard the Mir
station orbiting above the Earth.
   On Thursday, Mace and Miss Sharman fly to the Soviet Union for
an 18-month training program at the Soviet space complex in the
Gagarin Center near Moscow. Each is to be paid about $78,000 by the
fund-raising company Antequaria.
   The mission is scheduled for April 12, 1991 _ the anniversary of
the first manned flight in space, by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

<HEAD>Civil Liberties Lawyer Dead at 77; Represented Ellsberg and Bond</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonard B. Boudin, a civil liberties lawyer who
represented many well-known liberal or radical clients and whose
daughter Kathy belonged to the militant Weather Underground, died
after a heart attack. He was 77.
   Boudin died late Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan.
   His best-known legal victory came in 1958, when the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in Kent vs. Dulles that the State Department cannot
withhold passports for political reasons.
   Boudin defended many controversial clients involved in civil
liberties issues, including singer-actor Paul Robeson. He also
represented Daniel Ellsberg, who was charged with theft in
connection with the Pentagon Papers, classified government papers
documenting the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; Julian
Bond, who was denied a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives
because of his opposition to the Vietnam War; and Benjamin Spock,
who was charged with conspiracy to violate the Selective Service
Act.
   Boudin also represented one-time union leader Jimmy Hoffa when
he was banned from labor activities as a condition of his release
from prison.
   He represented Cuba's interests in the United States for the
last 30 years and the Central Bank of Iran during the Iran hostage
crisis.
   Kathy Boudin, 46, is serving a 20-year term at a New York state
prison. She pleaded guilty to a murder charge for her involvement
in a 1981 Rockland County armored truck robbery in which a guard
and two police officers were killed.
   Before the robbery, Ms. Boudin was wanted for questioning about
a 1970 bomb explosion in the Greenwich Village neighborhood that
killed three members of the Weather Underground, a militant
offshoot of the Students for a Democratic Society.
   Boudin, a New York native, attended City College and St. John's
Law School, and joined the legal practice of his uncle, Louis
Boudin, a well-known constitutional lawyer and influential figure
in the Socialist Party.
   In the late 1940s, Boudin and another lawyer from the firm,
Victor Rabinowitz, started their own labor-law firm. They moved
into civil liberties law when a provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
forced union leaders to swear under oath they were not Communists.
   Boudin was a visiting lecturer at the law schools of Harvard,
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
   He is survived by his wife, Jean Roisman; his daughter; a son; a
brother, and four grandchildren.

   The former CIA agent whose Iran-Contra case was
dismissed last week said his supervisors approved his secret
efforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels, according to The New York
Times.
   Joseph F. Fernandez, who was the CIA's station chief in Costa
Rica, told the Times in an interview published in Sunday editions
that senior CIA officials who knew about his efforts remained
silent and let him take the blame for the agency's role.
   Fernandez said officials who knew of his activities included
Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for Central
America; Alan Fiers, former chief of the CIA's Central America Task
Force; and Clair George, the agency's former deputy director of
covert operations.
   Informed of Fernandez' statements, Abrams told the Times: ``I
was not his superior. In any event, I have testified fully on this.
I am just not going to get into denying and not denying.''
   Fiers declined to comment and George's wife said George was not
available to comment, the Times said.
   Fernandez was accused of four criminal violations, including
making false statements to CIA officials and to a presidential
review board when he was asked about his efforts in Central America
to help former National Security Council aide Oliver North.
   Fernandez helped North organize deliveries of weapons and
supplies to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time such aid was not
allowed by Congress.
   CIA officials told Congress before the Iran-Contra affair became
public that the agency was not helping the Contras. After
Fernandez' activities were disclosed, CIA officials told members of
Congress that they were unaware of the full extent of their agents'
activities in Latin America.
   Fernandez told the Times his CIA superiors had violated the
unwritten code of honor of ``loyalty up, loyalty down'' that
traditionally guided agents.
   Fernandez was the only CIA official indicted in the Iran-Contra
affair. The charges against him were dismissed Friday by a federal
judge who cited Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision not to
allow Fernandez to use classified material for his defense.

<HEAD>De Klerk Rules Out Transitional Government With Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African President Frederik W. de Klerk
has rejected the possibility of a transitional government that
would include blacks while a new, non-racial constitution is being
drafted, according to a published report.
   De Klerk, in his first newspaper interview since he became
president in September, for the first time ruled out a central
negotiating position presented by the African National Congress,
The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions.
   The ANC, the main black nationalist group fighting the
government and a key bargaining partner in future negotiations,
proposed that a multiracial interim government would share power
during the process of drafting the new constitution.
   ``We are not prepared to move into a situation where a lawfully
elected government will be suspended and interim governments will
come about,'' de Klerk said in Pretoria.
   However, he said that once a new constitution is negotiated with
blacks under the supervision of the white government, the existing
authority will have to accept it and give way to a new government.
   On other topics, de Klerk:
   _Made clear that whatever new political order evolves, power in
South Africa would be shared on the basis of racially defined
groups, not according to the principle of majority rules.
   _Ruled out the possibility of his government repealing the
aprtheid law that categorizes every South African in a racial group
at birth, saying the race law is ``fundamentally tied'' to the
existing constitution and that its repeal would have to go
hand-in-hand with the writing of a new constitution.
   _Said the release of imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela is
under ``constant consideration,'' but declined to say when he would
be freed.
   _Said he plans to lift the state of emergency ``as soon as
possible,'' if not all at once, then in stages.
   De Klerk, the Post said, conveyed a sense of urgency in removing
South Africa's 23 million blacks from the 4.5 million white
minority rule, but said an expectation by some U.S. officials that
the political system can be overhauled as early as next June is
unrealistic.
   ``I think we are involved in a process,'' he said. ``I don't
think you can put a time scale to it.
   ``If there is a conception that we will have a final solution in
six months, I think that's an expectation we cannot deliver.''

   New opinion polls published Sunday showed Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her governing Conservative Party in
deep trouble with the voters.
   A Harris poll in The Observer indicated two-thirds of voters
felt Mrs. Thatcher should quit before the next general election,
due by mid-1992.
   A survey by Market Opinion and Research International (MORI) in
The Sunday Times reported the opposition Labor Party could win 51
percent of the vote, the highest figure since Mrs. Thatcher came to
power 10 years ago.
   The Conservatives would get 37 percent support and minor parties
shared the remaining 12 percent.
   The figures mean that if an election took place now, the
Conservative majority of 100 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons
would be completely reversed in a Labor landslide.
   MORI also reported 23 percent of all Conservatives would like
their leader to stand down.
   Michael Heseltine, a former defense minister, was identified by
30 percent of all voters in the MORI survey as the Conservative
leader they would prefer to take them into the next election, while
Mrs. Thatcher had the support of 22 percent, a reversal of their
ratings two months ago.
   Both polls took place over two days last week among a national
sample of nearly 1,100 voters who were interviewed. Neither survey
reported any margin of error.
   The 64-year-old prime minister returned home on Saturday after
talks on Friday with President Bush at Camp David outside
Washington and a generally warm reception from Americans in
contrast to feelings about her back home.
   Labor moved ahead of the Conservatives in the polls in the
spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and
intended changes in the National Health Service.
   Mrs. Thatcher has won three general elections and is the
longest-serving British prime minister in this century. As
criticism of her leadership mounted within her party she said last
week she was prepared to lead it into a fourth and even a fifth
election.
   This week sees the first ballot for the Conservative leadership
since Mrs. Thatcher became leader in 1975.
   Sir Anthony Meyer, a constant critic of Cabinet policies and the
only Tory lawmaker to oppose Britain going to war with Argentina
over the Falkland Islands in 1982, said he will stand against her
to test feeling about the leadership among his fellow legislators.
   They are the only party members entitled to vote on the issue.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish historian Salo Wittmayer Baron, who
testified at Adolf Eichmann's trial and taught at Columbia
University for 33 years, died Saturday at his Manhattan home of
congestive heart failure. He was 94.
   ``He was undoubtedly the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th
century,'' said Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, a former student of Baron
who now holds the Salo Wittmayer Baron Chair of Jewish History,
Culture and Society at Columbia.
   Baron was a witness for the prosecution at Eichmann's trial in
Jerusalem in 1961, setting the historic framework for the Israeli
government's case against the Nazi official. The historian
testified about anti-Semitism, European Jewry and what the Nazis
did to Jews. Eichmann was convicted and was hanged.
   Baron's magnum opus was ``A Social and Religious History of the
Jews,'' which began as a series of lectures, turned into a
three-volume Jewish history and eventually grew into 18 volumes.
   ``He was equally at home in everything from ancient history to
the modern era, and the major father of Jewish historical studies
in the United States,'' said Arthur Hertzberg, another former
student.
   Baron was born in 1895 in Tarnow, which was now in Poland but
was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He learned chess at
3, wrote Hebrew poetry at 12 and added Yiddish, biblical and modern
Hebrew, French and German to his first language: Polish. He
eventually learned 20 languages, and could lecture in five
different tongues.
   Baron was ordained a rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary in
Vienna, Austria, in 1920. He also earned three doctorates from the
University of Vienna in philosophy, political science and law.
   In 1926, Baron was invited to teach at the Jewish Institute of
Religion in New York. In 1930, he began teaching at Columbia. He
retired from Columbia in 1963.
   Baron is survived by two daughters, a sister, seven
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

   Prosecutors are asking a federal appeals court
to revive the criminal case against a former CIA station chief in
Central America who was caught up in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va.,
dismissed criminal charges against Joseph Fernandez on Friday,
ruling Fernandez could not get a fair trial because the Justice
Department barred use of classified materials considered important
to the defense.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's office quickly filed a
notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
Prosecutors said the ruling places Fernandez outside the law.

   Ireland puts its male statues on
pedestals. The female images are displayed at street level, then
the wits go to work at shredding what dignity remains.
   Dublin's bronze women are familiarly known as ``The Tart with
the Cart,'' ``The Hags with the Bags,'' and ``The Floozie in the
Jacuzzi.''
   The statues, which have appeared in the past two years, are
accessible, street-level images intended to make amends for the
past male bias in the capital's public sculpture.
   The ``Hags,'' resting on a bench beside their bronze shopping
bags at the foot of the Ha'penny Bridge, are two anonymous shoppers.
   The ``Tart'' is a well-built lass inspired by sweet Molly
Malone, who ``wheeled her wheelbarrow, through streets broad and
narrow, crying `Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, o!'''
   The ``Floozie,'' recumbent in flowing streams, represents the
River Liffey, recalling James Joyce's ``Anna Livia.'' But
``Floozie'' she is, and much more.
   Ailbhe Smyth, writing in The Irish Review, catalogued other
aliases: ``Bidet Mulligan,'' ``The Skivvy in the Sink,''
``Anorexia,'' ``Anna Livia Plurability,'' and, scandalously, ``The
Whore (pronounced `hoor') in the Sewer.''
   Ms. Smyth, a lecturer at University College and head of the
Women's Studies Forum, detected ``a sign of difficulty and
fragmentation but also of possibility,'' and ``the singular
diversities and diverse singularities of Irish women.''
   ``Dubliners have appropriated the monument in their midst
through a multiple re-naming game, manifestly pleasurable, which
reverberates with a plurality of significations, often
contradictory (but `dreams go by contraries') infinitely
translating travesty,'' she explained.
   Anna Livia may be the most abused by the wits, but recent
letters to The Irish Times indicate Molly Malone, who stands at the
foot of the Grafton Street shopping strip and opposite Trinity
College, is more controversial.
   Letter of Sept. 21: ``Simply public sculpture at its worst.''
   Letter of Sept. 22, from the Dublin City Center Business
Association: ``Its unwelcome imposition ...''
   Letter of Oct. 2, from the sculptor Jean Rynhart: ``Breasts
would not have shocked 17th century Dubliners. ... Molly's healthy
diet of fish, and strenuous daily exercise routine pushing
approximately 3 hundredweight around, would have assisted her
development into a fine strong girl. ... She is a Restoration
citizen placed accurately in 17th century Dublin.''
   Letter of Oct. 7: ``Is not the design of Molly Malone's barrow .
.. completely wrong? Up to 10 years or so ago a coster's barrow was
of a design specific to Dublin. It was of wicker construction with
three wooden wheels with steel tires.''
   Letter of Oct. 9: ``A masterpiece in the classical mode.''
   Letter of Oct. 12: ``How do we know that Molly was Church of
Ireland and not Roman Catholic; how do we know that she was a
`Restoration citizen' and not of the 18th or 19th centuries?''
   Ms. Rynhart, the sculptor, has proposed statues of Joyce, W.B.
Yeats and Oscar Wilde. You can almost hear the brainwheels turning.

<HEAD>Striking Machinists Suffer Setback at Eastern, Win New Contract at
Boeing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Its tough stance was the same in both bruising
battles, but for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers the outcomes of strikes against Boeing Co. and
Eastern Airlines could not have been more different.
   Eastern's Machinists are walking picket lines alone after being
abandoned by pilots and flight attendants, who voted to return to
work this past week after more than eight months on strike.
   At Boeing, however, their fellow Machinists returned to work
after ending a 48-day strike and gaining what is considered a
strong new contract.
   ``It (Boeing) was much more of a traditional collective
bargaining experience, a much cleaner bargaining environment,''
Mark Kahn, an independent labor arbitrator, said Friday. ``Eastern
is at the other extreme ... It isn't just a matter of economics.''
   The Eastern pilots' and flight attendants' decisions to end
their strikes _ which were begun in sympathy with a Machinists
strike on March 4 _ was a stinging blow to the Machinists and a key
victory for Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
The hard-to-replace pilots had given the Machinists crucial support
in their battle against Lorenzo and their walkout had virtually
shut Eastern down in the early days of the strike.
   At Boeing, where the Machinists struck alone, a much shorter
walkout ended last Monday when 81.4 percent of the membership
ratified the new 3-year contract. Although the union failed to get
the full wage increase it sought, it scored other points _
including cost-of-living adjustments that will account for
virtually all inflation.
   The 57,000 Machinists at Boeing, the world's biggest commercial
aircraft maker, had secure jobs to go back to. Their prosperous
company, with a swollen backlog of orders, didn't attempt to
continue full production during the strike.
   Many of the workers who struck financially troubled Eastern, on
the other hand, have been replaced over the months as the
financially sagging airline has rebuilt itself on a smaller scale
under bankruptcy court supervision.
   Miami-based Eastern warned the pilots and flight attendants
unions Thursday that they won't necessarily get their old jobs back.
   The Eastern Machinists also have been seeking higher wages, but
the bitterly contested issues at the airline have gone beyond
economics. Eastern's unions have demanded the removal of Lorenzo,
charging him with trying to bust the union and draining assets from
Eastern to its sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   The financial conditions and economics of Eastern and Boeing _
as well as their unions _ also are vastly different.
   The 8,500 Eastern Machinists are about equally divided between
two distinct groups: relatively skilled aircraft mechanics and less
skilled ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle baggage and
drive motorized equipment on airport runways. After the strike
began, Eastern was able to contract out much of the ramp service
work.
   At Boeing, the union represents skilled production workers, who
perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring and plumbing in
aircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool maintenance. Their
skills make them difficult to replace.
   Another factor on the returning strikers may have been the pull
of the holiday season. Both the Eastern and Boeing workers decided
to end their walkouts the week of Thanksgiving. The prospect of
holidays punctuated by continued struggles to make ends meet could
not have been cheering for the employees and their families.
   In each case, there also was a specific catalyst that appeared
to trigger the end of the strikes.
   At Eastern, the catalyst was President Bush's veto last Tuesday
of union-backed legislation that would set up a blue-ribbon
commission to investigate the dispute. That directly precipitated
the action by the pilots and attendants.
   In the case of Boeing, however, the catalyst seemed to work in
the Machinists' favor. As some of Boeing's big airline customers
started to express public anxiety about further delays in jet
deliveries due to the strike, the company appeared more pressed to
make a deal with the union.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Economic reports pointed to continued sluggishness in the
nation's manufacturing sector and a small inflationary spurt in
October. Orders for durable goods dipped 0.6 percent while the
Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent.
   _A number of major airlines announced plans to raise fares on
most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by
business travelers.
   _Wall Street woes continued. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's
largest retail brokerage, announced a restructuring that it said
would include layoffs and other cost cutting, while Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. said it would cut stockbroker commissions for the first
time in 15 years.

   Wall Street analysts say the Federal Reserve
appears to have grown a bit more aggressive lately in its efforts
to cushion the impact of a slowing economy.
   The Fed gave evidence just before the Thanksgiving holiday that
it was taking further steps to relax its credit policy.
   For the second time this month, it engaged in maneuvers that
encouraged a decline in short-term interest rates.
   The earlier easing didn't cause much of a stir, analysts say,
partly because it didn't touch off any dramatic moves in the bank
prime lending rate. But the latest actions by the central bank
might ``make a bigger splash,'' said Douglas Schindewolf at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``If the Fed is trying to reduce general recession fears, the
policy move in early November seems to have fallen short,'' he
observed. ``In order to reach general psychology, the easing would
need to grab the headlines.''
   That may come soon, he suggested, in the form of a general
reduction in the prime rate. Talk also has spread on the Street
that the Fed might reinforce its message by lowering the discount
rate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions.
   The latest developments don't necessarily signal that Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has abandoned the gradualist style
that has become his trademark, observers say.
   Nor do Wall Streeters think the central bank has dropped its
campaign against inflation as economic enemy No. 1.
   But ``inflation _ the Fed's top priority _ is contained,'' said
Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc. ``Recession risks have
risen.''
   If all goes right, analysts say, the Fed will be able to bring
off the much-ballyhooed ``soft landing'' for the economy as 1990
begins, letting interest rates fall and setting the stage for
renewed expansion later on.
   But some doubts persist that it can achieve that tricky feat.
``Signs of a downturn are in view,'' contends Erich Heinemann at
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   ``Mr. Greenspan has responded to the softening in the economy.
He has also responded to heavy-handed pressure from the Bush
administration, which is worried about the prospect of further
Democratic gains in the congressional elections in 1990.''
   Whatever the motivations, stock and bond traders found a lot to
like in the Fed's latest actions.
   After getting off to a weak start, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 22.89 to 2,675.55 in the past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.01 to
190.29, while the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market slipped .09 to 456.63 and the American Stock Exchange market
value index fell .21 to 373.14.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 127.02 million shares a day
during the holiday-shortened week, against 147.69 million the week
before.
   ``The most recent economic reports confirm that business
activity is slowing,'' said analysts at Wright Investors' Service,
a Bridgeport, Conn., investment management firm, in their latest
appraisal of the outlook.
   ``A further easing of inflation pressures and lower interest
rates appear to be reasonable expectations for the months ahead.''
   That looks like a recipe for higher bond prices, at least among
top-quality securities such as Treasury bonds. But opinions remain
sharply divided on what it might mean for the stock market.
   ``Corporate earnings are forecast to decline,'' Wright said.
``We expect that earnings disappointments will increasingly
overpower the interest rate downtrend as a determinant of stock
prices, taking them lower in the process.''
