<HEAD>Large Dam Killing Off Chinese Sturgeons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese sturgeon, a 10-foot ocean fish, is in
danger of extinction because a Yangtze River dam is blocking it from
the breeding grounds it has used for 300 million years, an official
newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily said the number of mature Chinese sturgeons,
known scientifically as Acipenser Sinensis Gray, has fallen to 5,000
and at least 400 are being killed each year.
   There are even fewer of the smaller white sturgeon, it said.
   The fish, which weigh between 330 and 550 pounds when they lay
eggs, are unable to reach their breeding grounds in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze because of the newly completed Gezhouba Dam
in central China's Hubei province.
   The dam, under construction since 1974 and partially operating
since 1981, prevents the fish from reaching 19 of their 20 breeding
grounds 1,800 miles upstream in the Jinsha River, a Yangtze
tributary.
   The dam builders originally agreed to put in a passageway for the
fish around the dam, but abandoned the idea because of the expense.
Every year, about 30 dead sturgeons are found at the base of the dam.
   The newspaper quoted Ke Fuen, director of the Yangtze River
Aquatic Products Research Institute, as saying female sturgeons
reach maturity at age 13 or 14, when they begin their 20-month
journey into China's largest river.
   Because the fish eat nothing while they are in the river, they
are exhausted by the trip and are not ready to breed again for four
or five years.
   An average sturgeon, he said, lays about 18 pounds of eggs, or
about 450,000 fry. But 80 percent are eaten by other fish and most
of the young sturgeon do not survive their six-month journey to the
sea.
   Ke said about 370 sturgeon a year are caught at the mouth of the
river by fishermen unaware the fish is now under state protection.
   Ke's institute, which has a budget of only $6,750 a year for
sturgeon research, is now trying artificial breeding to save the
fish from extinction. It has been putting about 350,000 sturgeon fry
into the river a year.
   The dam, with a designed capacity of 2.7 million kilowatts, will
supply 20 percent of the central China network's electricity when it
is fully operating.

   An English-language movie won
the grand prize in the Pan African Film Festival for the first time
in the event's 20-year history.
   The filmmaker called on African governments to do more for the
medium.
   The film, ``Heritage of Africa'' was made by Ghanaian Kwah Ansah
and recounts the story of a Ghanaian civil servant who discovers
while moving up in the administrative system the British set in
place in Ghana that he has lost all cultural bearings.
   Previous winners of the film prize have been in African languages
or French.
   The prize, awarded Saturday night, includes about $13,000, twice
that given to the 1987 winner. The film also won the Organization of
African Unity prize.
   Ansah said he will use the money to pay bills incurred in making
the film, and added that it would be his last. ``It is about time
African governments saw the importance of filmmaking and try to help
filmmakers.''

<TEXT>
   Carnaby Street, which soared to fame as the fashion
pacesetter for Beatles generation of the Swinging Sixties, is
seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the
1980s.
   When Mary Quant's miniskirts and John Stephen's bell-bottom
hip-huggers clothed the flower children, London became the fashion
capital of the world and Carnaby Street the favorite haunt of the
Mods and Rockers.
   For about a decade, young people from New York to Sydney flocked
to boutiques called Tom Cat, Take 6, and Lord John to buy the latest
in hot pants, platform shoes, wide floral ties and psychedelic
shirts.
   But as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s,
Stephen and other designers moved out and Carnaby Street took on a
tacky down-market flavor.
   The street remains a microcosm of English fashion over the last
20 years: Shoppers can buy the '60s Mod look, '70s hippie and ethnic
fashions and '80s punk leather and sado-masochistic gear including
studded leather belts, Sex Pistols T-shirts and neo-fascist and
Nazi-symbol buttons.
   Now the Peachey Property Corp., the private real estate company
that owns about three-quarters of Carnaby Street, wants to restore
some fashion magnetism to the two-block thoroughfare tucked behind
Regent Street in the heart of central London.
   ``We're not trying to revive the '60s,'' said Peter Bourne,
Peachey's surveyor for Carnaby Street. ``What we are aiming to do in
Carnaby Street is cater to the better-off young market, the 15-30
age group who, like the young kids in the '60s, had no shops
catering to them, especially in central London.''
   Over the last two years, Peachey has replaced about half of the
shops that sold this fashion mish-mash with branches of pricier,
fashion chains like Benetton, Supreme, Capricorn, Confetti and Midas.
   The Nazi-insignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment
that the two main stores, on an alley off Carnaby Street, are being
forced out of business under pressure from Peachey, Westminster
borough authorities and anti-fascist campaigners.
   Mary Quant, who worked out of the King's Road in Chelsea in the
1960s, has opened her first shop on Carnaby Street, selling makeup
and accessories. She said she was lured by the revival of the
surrounding Soho area as a center for young people and young
industries.
   Bourne hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with
wine bars, restaurants and art galleries.
   ``It does take a long time to move a whole area around,'' he said
in an interview. ``Not only do we have to change tenents, but we
have to tell the world this area has changed.''
   Last June, Peachey relaunched Carnaby Street with balloons,
20,000 leaflets and the message that it was now ``synonymous with
chic and stylish London.'' This year, it hopes to start regular
street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows.
   Knitwear designer Marion Foale, who moved into Carnaby Street in
the early 1960s and did clothes for the Beatles, remembers when it
was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended.
   ``Now, it's beginning to come up again,'' she said. ``But it's
always different. ... The next Carnaby Street will have its own
incarnation.''
   But many shoppers, designers and storekeepers mourn the Carnaby
Street they say is gone forever.
   ``It's an interesting historic relic. It's where it all
started,'' said Los Angeles-born Giffi Fields, who started selling
hand-painted, made-to-measure men's clothes to Carnaby Street shops
in the late 1960s.
   ``Carnaby Street was a one-off (one-of-a-kind area) at its time
because it was a street devoted to youth culture,'' he said. ``Every
major city in the world today doesn't have only one street, but many
streets devoted to youth culture. So you just don't get the
uniqueness anymore and you won't get the uniqueness.''
   At Inderwick's pipe shop, a Carnaby Street landmark for at least
70 years and the only store left from the 1960s, owner Peter
Anderson doubted Peachey would succeed because the street is getting
the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in London.
   ``Most shops are multiple or franchises. Not one shop has
individual character except The Great Frog, because they make their
own jewelry,'' said the 64-year-old businessman.
   ``I can't see it ever becoming what they're aiming for. It's
still a street without any character.''
   Shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with Carnaby
Street's current clientele.
   Those at the top said the street was still attracting the same
customers it did in 1975 _ young people looking for cheap clothes.
But those at the bottom complained that the punks, Mods, skinheads
and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight
people in suits.
   Potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also
unimpressed.
   ``It's just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either
side,'' complained Allen Sawkins, 30, a student and motorcycle
courier. ``It's just a tourist trap. Most people from London
wouldn't come here.''
   Alan Tate, 20, a student from Manchester, said: ``It's gone
downhill. It's too respectable now. The businessmen have taken over.
It tries to be anarchic and anti-establishment, but it does it all
commercially so it's not unique.''

   At least 100 people, most of them poor
laborers, died and more than 200 others were battling for their
lives after drinking homemade liquor in the western city of Baroda,
news reports said Monday.
   Press Trust of India and said at least 100 of the 251 people
hospitalized after drinking the illicit brew Saturday were in
critical condition. United News of India said survival chances were
bleak for virtually all the patients.
   Both news agencies said the death toll was at least 100 and was
expected to rise.
   The mass poisoning in Gujarat, the only Indian state where sale
of alcohol is banned, was the country's worst known liquor poisoning
case, the news agencies said. Many victims are likely to go blind if
they live, doctors treating the patients said, according to United
News of India.
   Press Trust quoted doctors as saying some of the victims could
have been saved if they had sought treatment earlier. It said many
victims became dizzy and fell into stupors after drinking the
illegal brew in the city 560 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   United News said police arrested three people who had supplied
the liquor. A son of one supplier and the son of a prominent local
politician were among those killed by the poisonous brew, it said.
   Gujarat's chief minister, Amarsinh Chaudhary, ordered an
investigation and promised ``drastic action'' against the police
officials who failed to avert the tragedy, The Times of India
reported.
   The newspaper said most of the victims were poor laborers who
bought the liquor Saturday morning after receiving their monthly
wages. The first deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it
added.
   As news of the first deaths emerged, police fanned out across
Baroda with loudspeakers blaring warnings that anyone who had
consumed the liquor should seek medical help immediately.
   The liquor, known locally as ``lattha,'' is made from industrial
spirits and methyl alcohol.
   About 300 people have died in about seven illicit liquor
tragedies in Gujarat during the last decade, UNI said. Two of the
previous cases occurred in Baroda, with others reported in Ahmedabad
and Surat.

   No one in Britain outside of the Moslem community
has endorsed the Iranian death sentence against Salman Rushdie, but
some are supporting the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' through
gritted teeth.
   ``An insidious outbreak of `yes-but' has entered the public
debate on the rights and rightness of his case,'' the Observer
newspaper said in an editorial Sunday.
   The debate even popped up at a Writers' Day conference organized
by British Pen, the association of poets, essayist and novelists.
   Most wrote supportive greetings to Rushdie in a book that was
left open for messages, but one entry said: ``Personal freedom is
constrained by personal responsibility. You are shown to be wanting
in the latter.''
   Below it, another writer asserted: ``Freedom is freedom. It does
not imply restraint.''
   The liberal Observer said it was disturbed by statements by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
last week that the book was offensive, and by the opinion of Lord
Jakobovits, Britain's chief rabbi, that such books should be banned.
   They are not alone in their criticisms.
   ``Mr. Rushdie's life has to be defended at all costs, but not
necessarily his book,'' The Daily Telegraph, a conservative
newspaper, said in an editorial last week.
   A cartoon in The Sunday Express showed Rushdie dressed like
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with a flowing beard of pound
notes labeled ``my royalties,'' and threatening the foreign
secretary. ``Blasphemy, Sir Geoffrey,'' the caption said. ``I shall
call upon the authors of the world to spear you with their pens.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Khomeini sentenced
him to death. Iranian clergymen have offered a bounty of as much as
$5.2 million.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Saturday that Britain still insists Iran
repudiate the death sentence before diplomatic relations can be
normalized. Britain has withdrawn its diplomats from Tehran.
   The Majlis, Iran's legislature, has set Tuesday as a deadline for
breaking diplomatic relations unless Britain ``clarifies'' its
position on the book.
   Iran's official news agency said Sunday that ``the withdrawal of
all copies of `The Satanic Verses' and banning of its reprinting by
the British government would certainly bring London closer to the
implementation of the Iranian conditions.''
   Many of those in Britain who criticize the book stop short of
calling for it to be banned.
   Hartley Shawcross, a prominent attorney and a former chairman of
the Press Council, wrote to The Times that Rushdie had committed ``a
deplorable abuse of the freedom which he shares with the rest of us,
but which we must nonetheless defend.''
   ``The Rushdie book has done incalculable harm to the interests of
all people, not with any intention of contribution to scholarship
but in order to sensationalize a novel in the hope of securing its
better sale,'' Shawcross wrote.
   In its editorial, The Telegraph said that ``free speech to some
degree depends on responsibility in exercising it.''
   ``A civilized society is unwise to insist that all abuses of
freedom of expression within the law, regardless of the damage done,
form part of the ark of the covenant and so are sacrosanct,'' the
newspaper said.
   Auberon Waugh, fuming over Rushdie's past criticisms of British
imperialism and racial prejudice, wrote in The Spectator magazine:
   ``Perhaps the real debate is not so much whether Rushdie should
be executed ... but just how much we should exert ourselves, as
deeply stained white imperialists, to protect him from his own
people.''
   ``I really do not think it unreasonable in the circumstance of
Rushdie's having made several million pounds through insulting
Islam, to suggest that he should pay for any police protection he
may judge advisable,'' said Waugh, a columnist for The Spectator and
The Sunday Telegraph.
   A letter to The Times from Jeremy Treglown, editor of The Times
Literary Supplement, argued that Rushdie's critics might want a
broader revision of the literary canon.
   ``Milton's pamphlets and Dryden's and Pope's satires, which
caused deep and violent feeling in those they attacked, should
obviously have been toned down. Many readers have been made
uncomfortable by the moral insights of Jane Austen and Dickens _
clear cases for sensitive editing,'' Treglown wrote.
   ``Wouldn't we be easier in our minds if there were no books at
all?''

   Alphabetically speaking, Yuba City, Calif., was
used to being last on lists. But catching the caboose in Rand
McNally's ``Places Rated Almanac'' four years ago insulted residents
right down to their toes.
   At first, they fumed, they raged, they stamped their collective
civic feet. Then they got smart.
   City leaders decided ``there are only two places to be on the
list: the top _ and the bottom,'' said Mary Knapp, Yuba-Sutter
Chamber of Commerce executive vice president. ``It depends what you
make of both of them.''
   What Yuba Citians made from last place was a heap of first-rate
public relations hay.
   In the 50 years since one E.L. Thorndike created his ``goodness
index'' for American cities, academicians, special interest groups,
magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of
rankings identifying the best of all possible towns.
   Stressed out? Live in State College, Pa., says one survey; Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, says another.
   Best place for a hip, contemporary career woman? Seattle, Savvy
magazine says.
   Easiest place to make friends? San Francisco, Forbes magazine
says.
   No. 1 overall? It's Pittsburgh, says one survey; Danbury, Conn.,
says another.
   In a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants
to be one, where everyone says it doesn't matter what other people
think but no one believes it, city ratings have become a source of
indignation, elation, frustration and, always, fascination.
   Now, it's almost time for another edition of ``Places Rated,''
the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch. Like the
presidential election, it appears every four years _ and a lot of
people don't like the results.
   The fallout has included threatened lawsuits, map and magazine
burnings and, on a number of occasions, campaigns for civic
improvements.
   But ask researchers, city officials and municipal groups what
city rankings mean, and how seriously to take them, and the answers
seem to be not much, and not very.
   ``There's no best city, just like there's no best work of art,''
said Bert Sperling, a Portland, Ore., computer researcher who,
despite that opinion, created software that rates cities. ``Who's to
say Van Gogh's `Sunflower' is better than (da Vinci's) `The Last
Supper'?''
   And who's to say there are 328 better places to live than Yuba
City? Why, ``Places Rated'' authors David Savageau and Richard
Boyer, that's who.
   When Yuba City leaders reflected on how to make the best out of
being the worst, they decided to lighten up.
   ``If you screamed and ranted and raved, you made a fool of
yourself,'' Knapp said. ``We decided to make a fun thing of it.''
   First, 1,000 residents burned hundreds of Rand McNally maps at a
community pep rally, packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a
local mortician present them to a Rand McNally vice president, who
flew out from Chicago just for the occasion.
   Then the city helped a radio station in Pittsburgh _ rated No. 1
in the same survey _ award an all-expense paid trip to Yuba City as
a contest prize. The happy winners toured the city by limousine and
rode a float in the 105th Annual Bok-Kai Festival. A good time was
had by all.
   And at year's end, when Life magazine wrapped up 1985, it was
Yuba City, not Pittsburgh, that received a full page. ``And they
spelled the name right,'' Knapp mused, a little amazed.
   It took ``Places Rated'' to not only rocket Yuba City out of
obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the best-seller
list.
   The idea sprang from the authors' desire to move out of Boston
and their discovery that there was no single source for good, solid
data on life in U.S. cities. They decided to compile a comprehensive
American cities reference guide, and sold Rand McNally on the idea
in 1978.
   The first edition, with Atlanta at the top and Lawrence, Mass.,
in the cellar, came out in 1981.
   More than 300,000 book sales later, Savageau says he's a bit
disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail
party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended,
and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him.
   ``I wouldn't go out and buy a book that said Pittsburgh was the
best place in the country,'' he said, taking a rare break from his
computer and the latest edition of ``Places Rated,'' due out this
fall from Simon &amp; Schuster Inc., which acquired the series last year
from Rand McNally.
   When the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability
on Pittsburgh, a city once known as ``hell with the lid off,'' even
Rand McNally didn't believe it at first.
   The crowning of Pittsburgh illustrates the key difference between
``Places Rated'' and other city rankings.
   The Savageau-Boyer study gives equal weight to climate, housing,
crime, transportation, health care, recreation, education, the arts
and economics. That might tend to give an edge to larger cities,
which have more amenities, and doesn't take into account which
factors people think are most important.
   Other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life, such relief
from stress _ which the advocacy group Zero Population Growth found
in Cedar Rapids and a study in Psychology Today magazine found in
State College.
   Or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people,
as Money magazine does, polling 251 subscribers. In its 1987 survey,
Pittsburgh was 43rd; Nashua, N.H., was No. 1. Last year, Pittsburgh
moved to No. 20; Danbury, Conn., was top of the heap.
   A change from one year to the next in what the subscribers
consider most important _ say, education over leisure, or
transportation over weather _ plus even a small shift in a city's
vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation, said Sperling,
whose company, Fast Forward, has created a computer program called
``Places U.S.A.'' used by Money.
   ``Some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have
used it to say, `Oh, yeah?,' and show they have a strong community
support base,'' said Randy Arndt, spokesman for the National League
of Cities. ``It depends on the resourcefulness of the city.''
   The league wouldn't dream of ranking its 1,400 members. ``I don't
know who these surveys benefit, except the authors. Everybody
doesn't live in the perfect place, but it's home to us,'' Arndt
said. ``Whether you live in Scarsdale or Saginaw, life is what you
make of it.''
   The same can be said of city ratings.
   In the next ``Places Rated,'' Savageau and Boyer plan a section
designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain
conditions, using factors in the book, any burg can be a Pittsburgh.
   ``For instance, if the only thing you're interested in are cities
in California with a moderate climate and low cost of living,''
Savageau said, ``Yuba City would be the best place in the whole
country.''

<HEAD>Gun Lobby Fights Legislative Assaults On Semiautomatic Rifles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outrage over a schoolyard massacre led five California cities to
ban semiautomatic rifles, but legislative attacks on so-called
assault weapons elsewhere in the nation are facing stiff opposition
from gun advocates.
   Bills to ban or restrict military-style assault rifles have
surfaced or are planned for introduction in Congress, 11 states and
at least a dozen cities following the Jan. 17 shooting spree at an
elementary school in Stockton, Calif.
   Five children died, and 29 others and a teacher were injured,
when drifter Patrick Purdy opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle
on a crowded playground. He fired 106 bullets in two minutes, and
then killed himself.
   The shock and anger that erupted, combined with concerns over the
mounting use of assault weapons by drug gangs, prompted bans in the
California cities of Stockton, Los Angeles, San Diego, Carson and
Compton. Outside California, Cleveland has banned the weapons.
   But elsewhere, the outrage seems to be losing some of its
persuasive power.
   Bills to ban or restrict assault weapons have died in the
Maryland, Indiana and Washington legislatures; in Hutchinson, Kan.;
Summit County, Ohio; Los Angeles County, Calif., and New Orleans.
   In Hutchinson, city commissioners rejected a ban on assault
rifles after facing an angry crowd of 150, only one of whom spoke in
favor of the ban.
   The issue has revived familiar gun-control arguments. One side
says the bloodshed must stop, while the other says Americans have a
constitutional right to own guns.
   ``We think America is tired of picking up the newspaper or
watching TV and seeing kids and police officers lying in pools of
blood,'' said Jim Scutt, National Sheriffs Association spokesman.
   ``We share the grief of the tragedy in Stockton,'' said National
Rifle Association lobbyist James Baker. ``But the answer does not
lie in restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens. The answer
lies in getting the criminal off the street.''
   The NRA has challenged the California cities' bans in court,
arguing that only the Legislature has the power to regulate firearms
in California.
   The biggest legislative battles are still to come. Congress is
considering four bills to ban or restrict assault weapons. Bills are
pending or expected to be introduced in California, Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Rhode
Island.
   Debate on all the bills focuses on how to define assault rifles.
   An automatic weapon, or machine gun, fires bullets as long as the
trigger is pulled. A federal permit is needed to own one.
   Semiautomatic rifles, which can be bought over the counter in
nearly all states, fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger but
do not need to be cocked or loaded between pulls. Most states allow
such rifles in hunting but usually limit the size of the ammunition
magazine, or clip.
   Distinguishing assault rifles such as the Soviet-designed AK-47
from semiautomatic hunting rifles can be difficult.
   ``They all function the same way,'' said Tom Hill, spokesman for
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``All that
changes is you take off the wood stock and put on a plastic or metal
folding stock, or you put on a banana clip, rather than a small
hunting clip, or you put on a bayonet.''
   Some legislation would ban specific brands of guns, but the NRA
argues that is useless. ``The AK-47 this year will be the AR-48 next
year, and they'd be out from under the regulation,'' Baker said.
   While the debate bogs down in detail, the issue remains clear to
Janet Geng, a Stockton teacher whose leg has a hole ``the size of a
grapefruit'' from Purdy's shooting spree.
   ``These people against a ban _ I'd like to have had them standing
out there next to me,'' she said. ``I don't believe there is any
reason for that type of weapon to exist in our society.''
   Hill said imports of AK-47s, which at $250 to $350 are among the
cheapest assault rifles, have increased tenfold in the past four
years. More than 40,000 were imported during the 14 months ending
Nov. 30, he said.
   If anything, Hill said, debate over banning assault rifles has
boosted sales. Demand is reported especially high in California. And
when a store in Menomonee Falls, Wis., ran a ``get
'em-before-you-can't'' sale on AK-47s, it sold out and had to order
150 more.
   In Stockton, meanwhile, police are relying on the honesty of gun
owners to turn in their now illegal semiautomatic rifles. They've
received seven.

   Islam may surpass Judaism as the nation's largest minority
religion by the turn of the century, but American Moslems still are
struggling to find their place in a nation that has long defined
itself as ``Protestant, Catholic, Jewish.''
   The U.S. publication of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' _
a novel some consider blasphemous _ is to many of the nation's
estimated 3.5 million Moslems only the latest example of how
acceptable anti-Moslem prejudice has become in America.
   ``The eight years they lived under Reagan were not easy years.
The enemy moved from being the `evil empire' of the Soviet Union to
Islam,'' said Yvonne Haddad, a professor of Islamic history at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``I've seen the prejudice.
It's almost American to bash Islam.''
   Nor has their exclusion from the American religious landscape
ended with Reagan's departure, according to Moslem leaders. There
were neither Moslem participants nor any mention of Islam at an
interfaith National Prayer Service after President Bush's
inauguration.
   ``We felt a bit insulted but blamed it on their ignorance rather
than discourtesies,'' said Mohammed Mehdi, a co-chairman of the
North American Interfaith Network and secretary general of the
National Council on Islamic Affairs. The service was organized by a
National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving committee.
   Ever since interfaith support was drummed up for World War I,
with Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders showing unprecedented
cooperation, the portrait of the nation as consisting of three basic
faiths has been implanted in the public mind.
   Moslems have settled in America since the 19th century, but
tremendous growth did not take place until the 1960s and 1970s when
relaxed immigration rules and a jump in Islamic students related to
the oil boom coincided with a movement by blacks to Islam.
   No one knows how many Moslems there are in the U.S. _ estimates
range from 2 million to 10 million _ but many scholars and religious
leaders say Haddad's estimate of between 3 million and 4 million is
the most reliable.
   If that estimate is correct, there are more Moslems in the United
States than two of the nation's most influential denominations, the
3 million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the 2.5
million-member Episcopal Church.
   Because of higher rates of immigration, births and conversions
among Moslems, there also is substantial agreement with Haddad's
assessment that if current demographic trends continue the nation's
Moslem population will be larger than the Jewish population
``possibly by 2000, definitely by 2015.'' The nation's Jewish
population is estimated at 5.9 million.
   But growing numbers have not meant growing respect for Moslems,
who still must contend with public perceptions of them ranging from
``camel jockeys'' to more dangerous stereotypes fostered by American
anger over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran.
   ``The amazing thing about it is that they persist so
perversely,'' said Marston Speight, director of the Office of
Christian-Moslem Relations for the National Council of Churches.
``Everywhere I go, no matter what I say, people always come up with
the stereotype of Islam being a fanatically aggressive type of
religion.''
   Speight said the ethical principles of peace and mercy in the
Koran, the sacred book of Moslems, ``simply belie the negative,
militant, violent image.'' He said violent acts committed in the
name of Islam have parallels in Christian history, but ``morally and
ethically, Islam and Christianity and Judaism are on common ground.''
   Many religious groups have made improved relations with Moslems a
priority.
   John Borrelli, executive secretary of the Office for
Interreligious Relations of the U.S. Catholic Conference, said
Catholic-Moslem dialogue is going on in cities such as Los Angeles
and New York and he expects more meetings and discussions nationally.
   Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee said the ``the
test of American religion in the 21st century'' will be its ability
to integrate other religious groups such as Moslems.
   ``If we fail, if we cannot have a mutually respectful society,
then we can end up with religious, sectarian strife, and God
forbid,'' he said, adding that his organization has increased
efforts to have contacts with Moslems.
   Mehdi said that with the exception of unofficial, isolated
letters from Christian fundamentalists who label Moslems
``heathens,'' the ``overwhelming number of established religions
have been supportive.''
   But discrimination persists, he and others contend.
   Haddad said since 1985, mosques have been bombed in Philadelphia
and Indianapolis, and others have been desecrated.
   The publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' ``showed Moslems are
not perceived as being part and parcel of American society, and are
misunderstood,'' said Brother Ihsan Babgy, education director for
the Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield, Ind.
   Rushdie has said the book is a work of fiction that was not
intended to offend anyone. Viking Penguin, the book's U.S.
publisher, has said its position is ``freedom of speech, freedom to
publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed internationally.''
   But the turmoil caused by the book may have long-term benefits
for American Moslems, according to officials here.
   ``The atmosphere has changed remarkably in recent times. This
whole issue of `Satanic Verses' is pushing us together more,'' Babgy
said. ``I think there is a clear and dramatic unification of Moslems
in this country.''
   Since the controversy developed, Mehdi said, his office has
received about 20 calls from people who used obscene language to
express their point of view, and four times as many calls from
people wanting to find out more about Islam.

   Today is Monday, March 6, the 65th day of 1989. There are 300
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On March 6, 1836, the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, fell to
Mexican forces after a 13-day siege. All 187 defenders of the
mission compound _ including Davy Crockett and James Bowie _ were
killed.
   On this date:
   In 1806, poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning was born in Durham,
England.
   In 1834, the city of York in Upper Canada was incorporated as
Toronto.
   In 1853, Verdi's opera ``La Traviata'' premiered in Venice, Italy.
   In 1857, in its ``Dred Scott'' decision, the U.S. Supreme Court
held that Scott, a slave, could not sue for his freedom in a federal
court.
   In 1933, a nationwide bank holiday declared by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt went into effect.
   In 1935, retired Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
died in Washington.
   In 1944, U.S. bombers staged a daylight raid against Berlin
during World War II.
   In 1957, the former British African colonies of the Gold Coast
and Togoland became the independent state of Ghana.
   In 1967, the daughter of Josef Stalin, Svetlana Alliluyeva,
appeared at the U.S. Embassy in India and announced her intention to
defect to the West.
   In 1981, Walter Cronkite signed off for the last time as
anchorman of ``The CBS Evening News.''
   In 1982, author-philosopher Ayn Rand died in New York at age 77.
   In 1983, in a case that drew much notoriety, a woman in New
Bedford, Mass., said she had been gang-raped atop a pool table in a
tavern called Big Dan's. Four men were later convicted in connection
with the case.
   In 1983, the pro-environment, anti-nuclear ``Greens'' party won
seats in West Germany's lower house of parliament for the first time.
   In 1987, 189 people died when water rushed through the open bow
doors of the ``Herald of Free Enterprise,'' causing the British
ferry to capsize off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.
   Ten years ago: A jury was empaneled in Oklahoma City in the case
of nuclear plant worker Karen G. Silkwood, who was contaminated with
plutonium through what Silkwood's family charged was the negligence
of her employer, Kerr-McGee Corp., shortly before her death in a
1974 car crash. Although the jury ruled against Kerr-McGee, an
appeals court in 1985 ordered a re-trial.
   Five years ago: Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart won
Vermont's preference vote by a wide margin over Walter F. Mondale,
following victories over Mondale in the New Hampshire primary and
Maine caucuses.
   One year ago: The board of trustees at Gallaudet University in
Washington D.C., the world's only liberal arts college for the deaf,
chose a hearing woman, Elisabeth Ann Zinser, school president over
two deaf candidates. Outraged students shut down the campus, forcing
Zinser's ouster and the selection of a deaf president in her place.
   Today's Birthdays: TV personality Ed McMahon is 66. Conductor
Sarah Caldwell is 65. CIA director William Webster is 65. The
chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, is 63. The first
woman in space, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, is 52. Actor
Ben Murphy is 47. Opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa is 45.
Actor-director Rob Reiner is 42.
   Thought for Today: ``Caveat actor.'' Let the doer beware. _ Latin
proverb.

   U.S. officials are concerned that Afghanistan,
already a principal opium producer, could become an even greater
source of illicit narcotics in the wake of the Soviet troop
withdrawal.
   ``Afghanistan ... worries everyone who is interested in this
issue,'' said Ann Wrobleski, the assistant secretary of state for
narcotics affairs.
   Ms. Wrobleski, in discussing the department's annual narcotics
control report, said the problem is likely to be aggravated when the
estimated 3 million to 5 million Afghan refugees return to their
homeland.
   In the wake of the destruction caused by the nine-year war
against the Soviet occupiers, traditional agriculture has been made
nearly impossible in many regions.
   ``As we see refugees moving back into a war-torn country where
there is no strong central government, we see them returning to a
fairly easy, quick, profitable means of supporting themselves,'' Ms.
Wrobleski said.
   ``Therefore, the prediction is that output of opium will increase
out of Afghanistan, which then leads to a chain reaction of
increased heroin moving through Pakistan,'' she added.
   Throughout the opium-producing region that also includes Iran,
Burma and Laos, ``prospects are not good'' for any reduction in the
opium trade in the coming year, Ms. Wrobleski said.
   With some 700-800 metric tons produced last year, Afghanistan is
second only to Burma in opium production in Southern Asia, the
report said.
   ``Compounding U.S. government frustration at increasing worldwide
opium supplies is the fact that about 90 percent of the world's
opium production takes place in areas in which the United States has
little or no access _ such as Afghanistan, Lebanon, Laos and
Burma,'' the report said.
   The United States long warned the Mujahedeen rebels against
producing and smuggling drugs to support their war effort against
the Soviets. With the Soviets gone, the rebels are now attempting to
overthrow the communist regime of strongman Najibullah.
   U.S. officials are concerned that amid a possible struggle among
the various rebel factions, narcotics control might not be given a
high priority.
   ``Current agricultural production is roughly half of the prewar
level, insufficient to support the existing population, let along
the large numbers of returning refugees,'' says James Phillips, a
senior policy analyst at the conservative Washington think tank, the
Heritage Foundation.
   ``Drug production could be a major problem,'' he said in an
interview. ``But perhaps I'm just more pessimistic than others.''
   Another State Department Afghan expert, who spoke on condition he
not be identified by name, said the United States must wait for a
central government to be formed to start any kind of comprehensive
drug eradication or crop substitution program.
   But he took a more positive approach to the post-Soviet era.
   The Agency for International Development has been involved in a
pilot program near the city of Jalabad, encouraging farmers to
switch from poppy growing to wheat and vegetable production, he said.
   ``We're pleased with it,'' he said, claiming a ``quite
impressive'' success with the local farmers and expressing hopes the
pilot program could be used elsewhere once calm is restored.
   At present, however, cooperation can only be obtained in certain
areas where rebel leaders are in control and sympathetic to such an
approach, the official said.
   ``My sense is, the resistance leaders we work with are
exceptionally sensitive to this, aware that it is a domestic issue
in the United States,'' added the official.
   He predicted that fundamentalist rebel leaders intend ``to apply
the rigid tenets of Islam'' and police drug production if they gain
control.

<HEAD>Nearly Half of Police Forces Have Fewer than 10 Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement is a lonesome job in nearly a
thousand American communities with one-officer police departments,
according to a government study.
   Although some big cities and counties boast thousands of
officers, nearly half of all police and sheriff's departments have
fewer than 10 officers, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on
Sunday.
   Law enforcement agencies ranged in size from 34 police
departments and 12 sheriff's offices with more than 1,000 officers
apiece to the 987 departments with just one, according to the study,
the first detailed statistical analysis of local law enforcement
staffing.
   All state police agencies, 99 percent of sheriff's offices and 97
percent of local police agencies with 135 or more officers require
at least a high school diploma, the 1987 study found. A separate
analysis of police standards in 1967 found only 70 percent required
such a diploma.
   In fact, the new study found, about 10 percent of the larger
police departments and 6 percent of sheriff's operations are now
requiring prospective officers to have at least some college
education.
   The Justice Department report said that overall the nation has
11,989 local police departments, 3,080 sheriff's departments and 49
state police agencies. Hawaii has no state police, even though such
a department was once featured in the television show ``Hawaii
Five-0.''
   Nationally, law enforcement agencies had 757,508 employees
including 555,364 sworn officers.
   Of those agencies 52.6 percent of local police departments have
fewer than 10 officers and 79 percent have under 25, the report
found. Among sheriff's offices, 33.6 percent had under 10 deputies
and 67.3 percent had fewer than 25.
   Thus, of the 15,057 local police and sheriff's agencies, 48.7
percent had fewer than 10 officers.
   Sheriff's departments led the way in employing women, at 12.5
percent of their sworn deputies, the report found. Women constituted
7.6 percent of local police officers and only 4.2 percent of state
troopers.
   Blacks were more strongly represented on local police
departments, making up 9.3 percent of the officers. Sheriff's
offices reported 8.3 percent black deputies and state police lagged
with 6.5 percent.
   Average annual starting salaries for police officers ranged from
$13,768 in the smallest departments to $23,000 in cities of a
million people or more. Local police chiefs were paid salaries of
between $18,503 and $87,044.
   Salaries and wages accounted for six of every seven dollars spent
on police work by governments. Total police spending was $28.3
billion.
   Two-thirds of the departments that have 135 or more officers said
they allow collective bargaining.
   Nationwide, 31.7 percent of police agencies and 28.3 percent of
sheriff's departments said they participated in the 911 emergency
telephone system. The highest rate was 88 percent for police in
cities of between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Sheriff's offices
serving communities of under 10,000 reported that only 15.7 percent
had the 911 system in use.
   The responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies vary from
place to place in addition to regular peacekeeping functions.
   Nearly half of the departments are also responsible for animal
control in their communities, for example, and one in four handles
emergency medical services.
   Other special functions include court security, handled by 22
percent of the departments; civil defense, 21 percent; civil process
serving, 18 percent; jail operation, 12 percent; training academy, 6
percent; drug testing, 4 percent; and ballistics testing, 2 percent.

<HEAD>Organs of Homicide Victims Spur Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burgeoning homicide toll in the nation's
capital is providing doctors with a new source of organs for
transplant.
   ``There's always going to be tragedy and there are going to be
fatalities with young people,'' says Dr. John Macoviak, medical
director of the Washington Regional Transplant Consortium.
   ``And the one and only clear-cut benefit to society of that,
which didn't exist until recently, is the fact that other lives can
be saved as the result of these people that lose their lives
prematurely.''
   The District of Columbia and neighboring Prince George's County,
Md., and Fairfax County, Va., each had record homicide rates in
1988. In the district alone, more than 90 people have been killed
thus far this year. That is far above the 1988 rate.
   In the district and Prince George's County, many of the homicides
are attributed to drugs.
   The record homicide rates are ``absolutely'' increasing the
number of available organs and tissue for transplant, said Macoviak,
who performs heart transplants at the Washington Hospital Center,
the city's largest and most active trauma facility.
   ``I would say that probably about twice the number of donors are
being procured this year as were being procured last year,'' he said.
   Last August, the consortium received 14 referrals for organ
donations. Six months later, the number had risen to 27.
   In addition to the record homicide rates, the availability of
organs for transplants also has been assisted by a District of
Columbia law passed in January 1988 requiring that families be asked
to donate organs.
   Victims felled by a single gunshot wound to the head are the most
likely candidates for donation because their organs aren't damaged,
said Macoviak.
   When they can, doctors keep gunshot victims alive on a
ventilator. But if it's certain the person is brain-dead, hospital
and consortium officials ask the bereaved family to donate the
victim's organs.
   ``I'd say the families of drug victims are very supportive as a
rule,'' he said. ``They want to donate the organs.''
   ``It's solace,'' concurred John Bardi, a consortium executive
committee member and assistant administrator at George Washington
University Hospital. ``It's the way they deal with their grief, to
know the individual is alive in someone else, to know they've
touched someone else.''
   When dealing with homicide victims, hospital staff also must
cooperate with homicide detectives and the medical examiner, and
these delays sometimes make it impossible to perform transplants,
said Macoviak.
   Tests are run to ensure that the potential donor meets rigid
criteria. If there are signs of intravenous drug use or a history of
promiscuous homosexuality, transplants are ruled out because of the
AIDS risk to potential recipients, doctors said.
   When doctors are finished removing organs and tissue, the
respirator which has kept the victim alive is quietly turned off.
   As many as 16 people can benefit from a single person's death,
receiving the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and assorted tissue such
as bones, eyes and skin, said Macoviak.
   Recipients for the various organs are chosen from waiting lists
and summoned to the hospital within eight hours. About 20 people in
this region are waiting for new hearts and are likely to die in less
than a year without transplants, said Macoviak.
   Ninety percent of organs procured in the Washington area are used
for people on waiting lists here. Only those organs for which
there's no local match are sent elsewhere.
   The Washington Regional Transplant Consortium was created by six
area hospitals in 1986 to pool resources for heart transplantation.
It coordinates organ procurement in the metropolitan area and last
year was authorized to perform liver transplants.
   ``It's unfortunate that someone has to die to save another life,
but that's the way it is,'' said Bardi. ``It's a cycle.''

<TEXT>
   A group has threatened to blow up a
monument to Dante Alighieri because the medieval poet's famed
``Divine Comedy'' places the prophet Mohammed in hell, officials
said Sunday.
   Mayor Mauro Dragone said he ordered increased security around the
monument to the poet, who died in Ravenna in 1321, after receiving a
threatening letter from a group calling itself ``Guardians of the
Revolution.''
   ``It is an initiative taken in a prudent way because I am more
inclined to think that the letter, which also was sent to a local
newspaper, is a joke orchestrated in bad taste or a provocation,''
Dragone was quoted as saying by the Italian news agency ANSA.
   However, the mayor said he warned police and demanded stepped up
security because he believes the potential danger from such threats
should not be underestimated.
   He said the letter also demanded that he repudiate ``the false
poet Dante'' and declare publicly ``that Dante lied and that these
verses can no longer be read or studied.''
   The ``Divine Comedy'' is considered a literary masterpiece that
established the Tuscan dialect as the literary language of Italy.
The work, a poem of more than 14,000 lines in 100 cantos, recounts a
poet's journey through hell, purgatory and heaven. It places
Mohammed in the ninth pit of hell.
   It comes in the midst of the controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses'' by author Salman Rushdie, a native Indian now living in
Briton. Iranian clerics have offered a $5.2 million reward for
Rushdie's death because they say the book blasphemes Islam by
portraying Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting that
Mohammed, not God, was the source for the Koran, Islam's holy book.

<HEAD>Congress Critical of Bush Technology Delay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are voicing concern over
the Bush administration's delay in naming an official to head a
newly reorganized drive to assist U.S. industry with high-technology
innovation.
   In addition to the absence of a permanent appointee to the new
post of Commerce Department undersecretary for technology, the
effort also is being hampered by lack of money for a key program at
the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   ``I'm deeply concerned about it,'' said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.,
D-Calif., who closely follows technology issues on Capitol Hill.
   ``I would say that at this point the administration has not got
their act together: first, in terms of making the key appointments
that would be involved in policy in this area; and, of course,
establishing the policy framework necessary to be able to go ahead.''
   Brown is a member of the House science, research and technology
subcommittee, which is set to hear testimony Tuesday by Ernest
Ambler, who last December was named acting undersecretary for
technology but is planning to retire at the end of March.
   At his confirmation hearing in January, Commerce Secretary Robert
A. Mosbacher said the role of the undersecretary for technology ``is
an extremely high priority'' and that he was concerned about U.S.
capability in high technology.
   So far, however, Mosbacher has been unable find a willing
candidate for the undersecretary job, which pays $82,500 a year.
   Brown said a number of people _ including Mary L. Good,
chairwoman of the National Science Board, which oversees the
National Science Foundation _ had been offered the post but had
turned it down.
   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., said the failure to implement a pay raise
for Congress, the judiciary and top federal executives apparently
figured in the decisions by several people who would have had to
take a substantial cut from their private-sector incomes.
   Under a reorganization plan approved by Congress late last year,
Commerce's new Technology Administration includes:
   _The Office of Technology Policy, a policy analysis and
development organization;
   _The Office of Commercial Affairs, which promote cooperative
joint ventures with U.S. industry in areas of research and
technology development;
   _The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST,
which works in areas ranging from automated manufacturing,
electronics and materials research to computer science and
technology, building and fire research, and biotechnology;
   _The National Telecommunications and Information Administration,
responsible for developing federal telecommunications technology
policies;
   _The National Technical Information Service, which disseminates
the results of government-sponsored research.
   Ambler said in a speech last month that the office of the
undersecretary for technology ``is a catalyst, a friend, a forum, a
listening post and a voice in Washington for technology-based
industry.''
   At the same time, he emphasized that ``it is the job of the
private sector to develop and sell goods and services. Government
has never been successful in showing industry how to do its job, and
there is absolutely no reason to think that will change in the
future.''
   Legislation passed last fall also established within NIST an
Advanced Technology Program, intended to be a civilian counterpart
of the Pentagon's highly touted Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.
   The program is designed to coordinate development of
emerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; foster
industry, government and university partnerships, and monitor
cooperation between federal and regional agencies.
   However, so far the program has no funding either for this fiscal
year or in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   Brown said that in the absence of leadership by the
administration on issues related to civilian technology, ``we may go
ahead with proposed legislation which would compel them to start
focusing on this.''
   ``What we also need are some short-term decisions having to do
with selecting targets of opportunity and providing some funding for
civilian advanced technology projects this fiscal year,'' the
California Democrat said.
   Ritter, who serves along with Brown on the science, research and
technology subcommittee, said that after a meeting last Wednesday
with Mosbacher, he is optimistic about the longer-range prospects
for developing the Technology Administration into an effective
agency.
   ``I think that given the feelings of the secretary of commerce,
it's going to be an important new feature on the landscape,'' the
Pennsylvania Republican said. ``I think he's committed to it. He
just has to get people to work for him.''

   The Defense Department, in a test program
ordered by Congress, has begun reimbursing some of the expenses of
active-duty servicemen who adopt children.
   The unusual program, which provides up to $2,000 to offset the
expenses of legally adopting a child, is set to last through the end
of the current fiscal year _ or until Sept. 30 _ unless Congress
votes to make the benefit permanent.
   The adoption reimbursement program was formally launched by the
Pentagon's personnel chief, Grant S. Green, last September and as of
Dec. 31, the Army had processed 69 claims. The Air Force and Navy
lagged behind the Army in publishing their regulations and are only
now handling claims.
   The test was ordered in the Pentagon's fiscal 1988 budget bill
and was championed by Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   It was proposed not only as a morale-building benefit that might
play a role in keeping men and women in the military, but also as a
benefit for adoptive parents that parallels the cost of health care
provided to women bearing babies in military hospitals.
   The Defense Department nonetheless opposed the program, arguing
Congress wasn't providing any extra money for the payments and it
couldn't afford to tap other accounts.
   ``In the current fiscal climate, this program might negatively
affect the other personnel and family initiatives that benefit a
greater percentage of the military population,'' the Pentagon argued
unsuccessfully.
   The Defense Department has not requested any funding for the
program in the fiscal 1990 budget pending before Congress, but
promised it would ``look at the results of the test program to
determine further action.''
   The reimbursement payments are available to anyone on active duty
``who initiates adoption proceedings after Sept. 30, 1987, and
before Oct. 1, 1989,'' the Pentagon regulation states.
   ``Benefits paid under the test program may be paid only after the
adoption is final. The adoption of stepchildren does not qualify for
reimbursement under this program.''
   Service members who adopt more than one child can claim a maximum
$5,000 per year, the regulation adds.
   According to the National Committee for Adoption, a group
headquartered in Washington, the average agency adoption fee was
about $6,000 in 1987.

   A wiry-haired socialist with free market
notions has touched off a battle of ideas in the party that created
Sweden's welfare state _ challenging some of its basic principles.
   Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt, a five-foot-six dynamo, is at
the center of a reform movement in his Social Democratic Party,
which has governed for all but six of the last 56 years.
   Since the Social Democrats were re-elected in September, they
have loosened foreign currency exchange rules, outlined tax reforms,
reduced farm subsidies and warned the troubled textile industry that
government help is tapering off.
   By fighting entrenched interests in order to give socialism the
new direction he thinks it requires, the 57-year-old Feldt has
alarmed party stalwarts and the unions.
   The internal debate he has set off is known as ``the war of the
roses,'' after the party's red rose election symbol.
   ``We must stop slandering the market economy, defined as
decentralized economic decision-making, competition on free markets
and a free choice of consumer goods,'' Feldt wrote in a recent
edition of Tiden, the Social Democratic magazine. ``On the global
level, it is known that market economy in this form has won a
complete victory over its only known alternative, the planned
economy.''
   Feldt said a tax policy which takes half the wages of the average
worker _ as does Sweden's _ has made ``a historical contribution but
should now come to an end.''
   Although as finance minister he collects some of the highest
taxes in the world _ 72 percent as a maximum on high incomes _ Feldt
consistently ranks near the top in popularity polls.
   A quarterly survey published by PK Banken, a state-owned bank,
said Feldt's proposals amount to ``the introduction of a new
economic policy regime in Sweden.''
   In the draft budget presented last month, Feldt announced
measures to cool the overheated economy by stimulating supply rather
than lessening demand. Among the proposals were lowering trade
barriers and taxes.
   The debate he is stirring comes as the Social Democratic Party,
in its 100th year, reviews its platform. A party committee charged
with the task is to offer a new draft program by August.
   Although the Social Democrats espouse undiluted socialism, Sweden
is far from being socialist. About 90 percent of production is in
private hands, and big businesses like Volvo and the Ericsson
telecommunications group play by capitalist rules.
   While a few big companies drive Sweden's economy, the government
controls transportation, communications, health care and other
services.
   Advocates say the system gives Sweden one of the world's highest
living standards, with basic necessities provided for everyone.
   Critics say that while the country may seem rich, the individual
Swede, after paying taxes and high living costs, often has little
money left over to spend as he chooses.
   Feldt has said he wants to change the pervasiveness of the public
sector, which employs about half the work force and which he says
has grown fat and inefficient.
   An opening salvo in the ideological debate was fired in January
by Feldt's treasury officials, who drafted a working paper for a
closed meeting of the Scandinavian Labor Movement. It suggested
citizens be allowed to choose private alternatives to public
institutions such as day care centers and hospitals.
   The report met with such fierce opposition that the meeting tried
to suppress it. When it leaked last month, it created a furor among
traditionalists in the party.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson led a counterattack against what
he saw as a threat to the party's underpinnings. He likened the
reformists among his colleagues to rivals in the non-socialist
opposition.
   ``That the Liberals and Conservatives want to undermine the
general welfare is not so strange,'' Anderson wrote in the socialist
daily Arbetet. ``But now this has gained a foothold within the
workers' movement, disquieting me and others.''
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson was compelled to defend Feldt and
reassure his party.
   ``The general welfare policy will not move,'' Carlsson said in a
television interview. ``We managed to retain it during the difficult
years, and we're not abandoning it now.''
   He denied that a battle was being waged between Feldt's
pragmatists and socialist orthodoxy. ``In the government there is no
right wing. There is just the Social Democratic government, and that
is to the left,'' he said.
   However, Feldt's article attacked the argument that a free market
inevitably leads to social gaps and impoverishment of the worker.
   ``It is definitely misleading to describe capitalism _ not to
speak about the market economy _ as the source of all misery and
injustice, whereas the public sector is described as a perfectly
working idyll,'' he wrote in Tiden.
   The conservative newspaper Svenska Dagbladet called the article
``one of the most remarkable political pieces of recent years'' and
said Feldt ``has decided to start the fight for a modernization of
Swedish social democracy.''
   Aftonbladet, the popular tabloid owned by the blue-collar union
LO, accused Feldt of trying to throw the ``basic ideals on the
garbage heap of history and attack the soul of the party.''

   Sir Yehudi Menuhin, honored for
promoting German-Jewish reconciliation, made a plea for dialogue
between Israel and Palestinians.
   ``The chances for positive change are closer than we believe,''
the 72-year-old virtuoso violinist said Sunday during an address to
West Germany's Societies for Christian-Jewish Cooperation.
   Earlier, Menuhin was awarded the Buber-Rosenzweig medal for his
outspoken efforts to promote dialogue between Jews and Christians.
The award, established in 1968, commemorates the Jewish philosophers
Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig.
   The award cited his performances in Germany immediately after
World War II, including giving concerts for fellow Jews and others
who survived the Nazi Holocaust.
   Menuhin said he hoped talks between Arabs and Jews could produce
agreement on one state for both peoples.
   ``It may be the modest and lonely view of one man, but I believe
there are only two possibilities: either two independent states, and
that means a divided Jerusalem, or a united Jerusalem that would
mean at the very least a united, bi-national state.Israel must
follow this second path if it wants to survive.''

   President and Barbara Bush top this year's
list of the nation's best mannered people, but their predecessors _
the Reagans _ have been left off it for the first time.
   The Bushes ``exemplify the new age of kinder and gentler manners
that will prevail in the 1990s,'' said Marjabelle Stewart, who
speaks and writes about etiquette.
   Mrs. Stewart said nominations for the fifth-annual best-mannered
list came from journalists, television crew members, make-up
artists, chauffeurs, maitre d's and others.
   This year's list includes Oakland Athletics pitcher Dennis
Eckersley, who demonstrates ``good sportsmanship on and off the
field and is a fine example to the youth of our nation,'' she said.
   Others were CBS newsman Charles Kuralt; Dr. Andrew Ross of
Children's Square USA in Council Bluffs, Iowa, who started an
etiquette program at the orphanage; NBC's ``Today'' show weatherman
Willard Scott; talk-show host Arsenio Hall, and Secretary of State
James Baker III.
   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, dropped off the list
after topping it for the past four years.
   ``It's not that they are not beautifully mannered,'' said Mrs.
Stewart.
   She said they are no longer as highly visible as they were when
they were in the White House, adding, ``Isn't life fickle?''

   Isabelle Adjani read from ``The Satanic Verses'' in
an acceptance speech at France's 14th annual Cesar film awards in a
gesture of support for novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Ms. Adjani received the best actress award Saturday night for
playing the title role in ``Camille Claudel,'' the sculptress and
lover of sculptor Auguste Rodin. It was her third best actress
Cesar, France's Oscar.
   ``You should know what I have suffered. ... In the artist's
condition there is something extreme,'' she read from the novel in
her speech. ``Angels are easy to calm. Human beings ... can doubt
everything.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Great Britain since Ayatollah
Khomeini called for his death for the novel, saying it blasphemes
Islam.
   There was little overt reaction from the audience to the
recitation.
   ``Camille Claudel'' received five Cesars, including best film,
photography, decor and costumes.
   Jean-Paul Belmondo, who said in advance he would refuse an award,
was named best actor for his role in ``Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate''
(Itinerary of a Spoiled Child). Belmondo, 55, has said the audience
reaction to his work was enough reward.
   The West German film ``Baghdad Cafe,'' directed by Percy Adlon,
was voted best foreign film.

   Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of Emperor Hirohito,
celebrated her 86th birthday today with only a family luncheon
scheduled because of the mourning period for her husband, the Togu
Palace said.
   Those attending the luncheon were her eldest son, Emperor Akihito
and his wife, Empress Michiko; and the empress dowager's younger
son, Prince Hitachi and his wife, Princess Hanako, according to a
palace official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The imperial family is observing a year of mourning for Hirohito,
who died of cancer Jan. 7 at age 87, the official said.
   The official declined to discuss the health of the empress
dowager, who has used a wheelchair and has made few public
appearances in recent years. She did not attend her husband's
funeral last month.
   Quoting the Imperial Household Agency, Kyodo News Service said
the empress dowager is suffering from pains in the back and knees,
but her condition has remained stable and her appetite is good.
   Kyodo said she spends her days watching television and reading,
apart from observing prayers for her late husband twice a day.

   Entertainers including Tammy Wynette, Pia
Zadora and Ray Charles helped stir up pledges of more than $37
million to the National Easter Seal Society during its 18th annual
telethon.
   ``We found that the American public was very supportive. We had
an even stronger turnout than we expected,'' said John Garrison,
head of the non-profit organization. This year's pledges exceeded
the goal of $36 million and last year's mark of $35 million, he said.
   The 20-hour telethon was broadcast live on local television
stations nationwide over the weekend. Singer Pat Boone was host for
the ninth year and was joined by his daughter Debbie in singing a
medley of their hits.
   The star of the show was 10-year-old Joy Hall, the National
Easter Seal child. Joy, who was born with cerebral palsy, has
already appeared on the ``Today'' show and will be a guest star on
the NBC series ``Amen'' later this year.

   Once congressional pages together, Paul
Kanjorski and Bill Emerson both realized their dream of being
elected to the U.S. House.
   As if that were not unusual enough, both also were witnesses to
the rarest of events: an attack by gunmen on the Congress of the
United States.
   Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Emerson, R-Mo., stood together on the House
floor last Wednesday to mark the 35th anniversary of an event they
said will always seem fresh in their minds.
   The two were 16-year-old pages and roommates on March 1, 1954,
the day that four neatly dressed Puerto Ricans walked into the
public galleries, unfurled a flag, shouted ``Free Puerto Rico!'' and
began shooting randomly from large automatic pistols.
   House Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr. _ who had been counting heads
in a quorum call on a bill dealing with migrant laborers _ banged
the gavel.
   A few congressmen fell, bleeding. Some raced for the doors. Some
hid under the tables.
   ``As one who has never been particularly age-conscious, I stand
in awe of the fact that this event occurred 35 years ago, and I
remember it as though it were yesterday,'' Emerson said last week.
   Kanjorski had just gotten out of his seat on the Democratic side
in the rear of the chamber when the shooting started.
   ``When the shots started to be fired, they sounded like
firecrackers going off,'' Kanjorski said last week. ``There were a
lot of them and they were different-sounding because there were
several weapons that were being used. The only thing that made it
clear they weren't firecrackers is that I got sprinkled with some of
the marble that flaked off.''
   Emerson thought the noise was firecrackers, too, ``but when I
looked up, I could see fire coming out of the end of the barrels of
those guns.''
   Wounded were Reps. Alvin Bentley, R-Mich.; Ben Jensen, R-Iowa;
George Fallon, D-Md.; Kenneth Roberts, D-Ala.; and Clifford Davis,
D-Tenn. All recovered.
   Before it was over, a photographer snapped a picture of Kanjorski
and Emerson carrying one of them off on a stretcher.
   As bad as the moment was, the news photo gave Kanjorski and
Emerson temporary celebrity status among their peers, and linked
them together in time.
   ``All through our lives we have been very close friends,''
Kanjorski said. He classified the odds of both becoming congressmen
as ``remote,'' even though he said both dreamed about the
possibility.
   One of the attackers died in 1979, and the other three were given
presidential clemency the same year after 25 years in prison.
   Emerson was elected to Congress in 1980, Kanjorski four years
later.
   ``I might say it was a great pleasure for me personally when my
friend Paul Kanjorski joined us here two terms ago,'' Emerson said.
``He and I were roommates and colleagues of that era, and it was
great to see an old buddy come back to Congress.
   ``I have often thought it (the shooting) was a terrible thing to
have happened, but since it did, I was glad I was here to observe
that little anecdote in American history,'' Emerson said.

   The White House struggle to save John Tower's
nomination has turned into the first major test of President Bush's
political mettle and is being watched as a barometer of how he'll
deal with a Congress dominated by Democrats.
   Republican strategists say the stakes are high for Bush, in
office only six weeks.
   ``He's got to fight. To let the Democrats shove him around or to
knuckle under to them this early in his presidency would only give
them more feeling that they could go after him down the road,'' said
Lyn Nofziger, who was the first political director for President
Ronald Reagan.
   Mitchell Daniels, another White House political director under
Reagan, said Bush should make clear that there will be political
consequences for anyone who opposes the administration.
   ``If he just sort of smiles and forgets it, I think it's the same
as putting up a `kick me' sign,'' Daniels said.
   ``He's got to put this in the memory bank and, as he has
opportunities out of public view, he's got to get even'' as he makes
decisions and doles out political favors over the next four years,
said Daniels.
   While the White House still talked about victory, Nofziger and
Daniels said there was virtually no chance Tower could win
confirmation as secretary of defense, with the Democrats holding a
55-45 majority in the Senate.
   Even among Republicans, there is a feeling that the White House
has not done a good job with the Tower nomination. The former Texas
senator has been buffeted by accusations of excessive drinking,
womanizing and conflict of interest with defense contractors.
   ``Up until now, the Brits have had better scandals,'' said Rep.
Lynn Martin, an Illinois Republican. ``This one is understandable _
drinking and sex.''
   The White House has not tried to pressure Congress by drumming up
a groundswell of public support for Tower.
   ``The public's uncomfortable with the rumors,'' Daniels said.
``There's no pro-drunkenness caucus out there.''
   In a speech last week, Bush observed, ``This is a tough town _ a
lot of rumors out there.'' He has spoken out on Tower's behalf
numerous times, discounting the allegations against his nominee as
mere innuendo.
   A White House official said Bush is not trying to mobilize a
national campaign on Tower's behalf because it is not the kind of
issue that can generate much public support. Instead, he said, Bush
is struggling to find a few votes in the Senate.
   ``This is a battle with an audience of about eight people,'' said
the official, who declined to be identified by name.
   ``I don't see any point in making this personal,'' Bush said
recently. ``There's no point making this into a fight.''
   Looking ahead to relations with Congress after the Tower affair,
Bush said, ``We're going to have to work together on a lot of other
issues.''
   Andrew Card, a top lieutenant to Bush, said the president
``understands politics and he knows that most people don't hold
grudges and can move from one issue to the next without a lot of
bias.''
   By the traditional rules of politics, Tower's nomination should
have been safe. As a former senator, he was a member of the
congressional club, the beneficiary of special courtesies and favors.
   However, the normal scenario turned into chaos for Tower when
Paul Weyrich, a conservative activist, testified publicly about
Tower's drinking.
   ``What Paul Weyrich did was to present an uneasy group of
senators who really didn't like John Tower anyway with a fig leaf,''
said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution specialist on the
presidency.
   ``George Bush makes ethics and personal conduct almost a hallmark
of his administration and gets hoisted on his own petard,'' Hess
said.
   The White House has acknowledged shortcomings in handling Tower's
nomination, blaming some of the problems on incompetence and
inexperience among the new staff.
   Nofziger traces the mishandling back to December, even before
Tower was actually nominated.
   ``They let the naming of him dangle for two months. Secondly,
after they named him they didn't do anything. They just let it sit
there,'' Nofziger said.
   ``When the negative stuff came out they didn't seem to put
together a campaign to support him,'' Nofziger added. ``The only
support that I see is coming out of the White House and Republican
senators.
   ``Just as this thing is beginning to heat up,'' he added,
``George Bush goes off to the Far East and takes with him his chief
of staff and half his staff, leaving nobody to stay behind and fight
the good fight.''
   It was on Bush's first full day in Tokyo that the Senate Armed
Services Committee voted along party lines 11-9 against Tower's
nomination.

   John Tower and his formidable Washington
reputation are under siege in the Senate, but the once-pristine
reputation of his principal opponent, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, has
been assailed in the battle as well.
   Nunn, hailed for years as a principled, non-partisan,
hard-working Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, is now accused of making a purely partisan grab for power.
   ``There's a lot more going on here than meets the eye,'' says
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who characterizes allegations against
Tower of excessive drinking and suspect ties to defense contractors
as ``total character assassination.''
   ``It's a power struggle,'' Stevens says. ``John Tower's opponents
are contending he is not the person to head the Department of
Defense rather than admitting they disagree violently with his
policies.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas says Nunn is
``obviously'' partisan. He has said Republicans intend to examine
``the allegation that Sam Nunn has some motive'' in his conduct of
the Tower affair.
   In Nunn's case, what is under attack is the reputation he has
built as a highly regarded and respected architect of defense policy
who puts U.S. security interests ahead of other considerations.
   ``It is Sam Nunn's unique qualities of intelligence, thoroughness
and thoughtfulness that have, with good reason, made him one of the
most respected members _ if not the most respected member _ of the
Senate,'' Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said last week.
   Although many Republicans aim the ``power play'' charge against
Nunn and the Democrats, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the senior
Republican on the Armed Services Committee, walks a middle line.
   On the one hand, he implies there are partisan motivations behind
the assault on Tower. On the other, he absolves Nunn from complicity.
   ``It's not a power grab of trying to run the Pentagon from
Capitol Hill,'' he says.
   Nunn's Democratic colleagues are _ predictably _ even more
emphatic.
   ``There has been no power grab by Sam Nunn or anyone else; that's
hogwash,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a Tower opponent
who opened a counterattack of his own.
   ``There is no question about the partisan nature of Sen. Dole and
his assault on this body,'' he said.
   Nunn says developments have put him in a no-win situation.
   ``When you agree with them, they say, `He's a statesman,''' Nunn
says. ``If you disagree, they say, `How can he be so partisan?'
   ``Either I would be a scapegoat because I was taking on a
president, or I would be covering up the alleged transgressions of
the nominee.''
   Is he upset by the ``power play'' accusations?
   ``That's part of the process,'' Nunn says. ``They've got to find
something to throw at me. The only way to handle a situation where
you don't have the evidence on your side is to go after the person
who is making the case. The effort here is to basically destroy my
credibility.''
   Is he attempting to assert power over the Pentagon, to prevent a
strong-willed leader like Tower from taking over?
   ``Bob Dole knows better than that,'' Nunn says. ``It's
preposterous to think that anyone can run the Pentagon from Capitol
Hill.''
   As the battle over the Tower nomination raged in the Senate, The
Wall Street Journal reprinted a December 1972 article from The
Atlanta Journal reporting that Nunn had pleaded either guilty or no
contest in 1964 _ when he was 26 _ to leaving the scene of an
accident.
   The article implied Nunn had been drinking at the time and the
senator admits it.
   ``I pled guilty to leaving the scene, paid my fine, apologized to
all concerned and, at age 26, learned a valuable lesson which I have
not forgotten,'' he says.
   ``I don't know that this is relevant ... but I guess when you're
in this kind of fight everything is fair game.''
   Nunn likes to point out that before the presidential election he
and Warner sent a letter to candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis, emphasizing the importance of high-quality nominees for
Defense Department posts.
   They said the letter was sent ``principally to avoid any
suggestion of partisan motivation.''
   It hasn't worked out that way.

attend Tuesday's meeting of the party's governing Central Committee,
a newspaper reported.
   Vasarnapi Hirek (Sunday News) quoted party spokesman Laszlo Major
as saying Kadar would not attend because he has not fully recovered
from hand surgery _ but there is speculation he may be staying away
for other than health reasons.
   The 76-year-old Kadar, who now holds the newly created post of
party president, also missed the committee's last meeting.
   In the last years of Kadar's rule, Hungary's economy fell into
decline and independent groups agitating for multiparty democracy
began to gain wide influence.
   Reformers who advocate allowing opposition candidates to compete
in elections have now obtained a foothold in the heights of the
Communist Party.
   The reformers include politicians thrown out of the leadership
when Kadar was installed as party chief in 1956, the year Soviet
tanks quashed the Hungarian uprising.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen, while
share prices also lost ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the end
of the trading day Monday.
   The dollar opened at 127.55 yen and moved higher to peak at
127.68 yen before closing the day slightly lower at 127.63 yen. It
was down 0.49 yen from last Friday's 128.12-yen finish.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 73.63-point loser last week, also shed 123.24
points, or 0.38 percent, for 31,876.86 points by the end of the
trading day.
   Dealers said trading was directionless in the absence of major
market-affecting news, but concern over possible Japanese discount
rates hikes was sending the dollar and Nikkei lower
   ``There is talk of rate hikes here and market participants are
taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese
securities firm. ``Otherwise, trading is directionless.''
   He added that the currency fluctuated in wide ranges last week
because of technical adjustments and economic news, including a West
German decision not to raise its interest rates.
   ``This week, people are waiting for a conference Wednesday by
Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita and the release of U.S.
unemployment figures due out Friday,'' the dealer said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In stock trading, the Nikkei fell as investors moved to the
sidelines ahead of the settlement of March futures contracts
scheduled for Tuesday, dealers said.
   They said brokerage firms, including Nomura and Daiwa Securities,
were among the losers in the early trading.

<HEAD>Soviet Icebreaker Narrowly Averts Nuclear Disaster, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear-powered Soviet icebreaker came within 40
minutes of a meltdown last fall when an operator mistakenly drained
cooling water from a reactor, according to a Soviet newspaper.
   Vodny Transport, a state-run newspaper that covers shipping, said
the incident occurred Nov. 11 aboard the Rossiya while it was docked
at Murmansk, 1,000 miles north of Moscow in Kola Bay.
   It was there for routine changing of a filter in a reactor, the
newspaper said.
   The reactor was shut down, and cooling water was supposed to be
drained before changing the filter, the newspaper explained. But a
chief physicist aboard the ship gave incorrect instructions to an
operator, who opened a drainage valve on the ship's other reactor,
which was in operation, Vodny Transport said in its Saturday
editions.
   The main supply of cooling water was drained off mistakenly. Just
30 or 40 minutes' worth of backup water was left in a reservoir
before the reactor would have melted down and released radiation,
the newspaper said.
   It took four minutes to bring the problem under control,
according to Dmitri Tarakanov, the newspaper's Murmansk
correspondent. He did not provide details of what action was taken.
   Radiation could have spread from the ship to the city of 440,000
people, Tarakanov indicated.
   Vodny Transport comes out three times a week. There was no
explanation for the four-month delay in reporting the incident.
   A meltdown, the worst possible nuclear accident, occurs when the
reactor core overheats to such a degree that the fuel begins
melting, as happened at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979.
   If the fuel penetrates its protective housing, radioactive
materials are released into the environment.
   The Rossiya was launched from the Baltic Yard in Leningrad in
1983 and went into operation in 1986, according to Jane's Fighting
Ships. It is one of five ships in the Arktika class run by the
Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry.
   Two pressurized water reactors drive the Rossiya's steam turbines
to generate a total 75,000 horsepower, according to Jane's.
   In January, the ship made headlines when it rescued Soviet
researchers stranded on a drifting ice floe north of Greenland.
   On Thursday, the government daily Izvestia quoted a nuclear power
official as saying there have been no accidents aboard the Rossiya
or four other nuclear-powered icebreakers. A. Zhuravkov also said
the reactors on board the ships are a different design from those at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, where a reactor
exploded and caught fire April 26, 1986, killing at least 31 people
and spewing radiation worldwide.
   ``An operator cannot race it to a critical state, as happened at
the Chernobyl atomic power station,'' Zhuravkov told Izvestia.
   The article quoted M. Rabkanov, chief of the Vladivostok port in
the Soviet Far East, as saying safety of nuclear-powered vessels is
``very reliable.''
   Izvestia said people in Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean are
alarmed that a nuclear-powered ship, a sister of the Rossiya called
Sevmorput, was heading their way. Government authorities in another
Far East port, Nakhodka, supported residents' calls to close the
harbor to the Sevmorput.
   There was no indication the people quoted by Izvestia had heard
about the reported incident on the Rossiya.

<HEAD>Mouse Experiments Point Way to Possible Muscular Dystrophy Treatment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a finding hailed as an exciting step toward
treating humans for the most common form of muscular dystrophy,
scientists have corrected a muscle defect in mice by injecting
immature muscle cells.
   Mice that could not make a protein called dystrophin in their
muscles began to produce it after the injections, two teams of
researchers report.
   In humans, lack of the protein causes Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, the most common and severe form of the disease.
   The research represents ``the most exciting approach for human
therapy that, in my opinion, has ever come along,'' said Donald
Wood, director of research for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   Preliminary experiments in a limited number of Duchenne patients
may begin this summer, after researchers from several nations meet
in June to discuss the issues involved, Wood said.
   Those studies, focusing on single muscles or a few muscles, could
lead to larger human studies. It is too early to say when the
injection procedure could be made widely available, if it proves
useful, Wood said.
   One mouse study was performed by Louis Kunkel and Eric Hoffman of
Harvard Medical School, Childrens Hospital and the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute in Boston, and Terry Partridge and others at the
Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School in London.
   ``We basically have the first step toward a potential to do
therapeutics. It looks promising,'' said Kunkel said in a recent
interview.
   Their study is ``extremely exciting work,'' said Theodore Munsat,
professor of neurology and pharmacology at the Tufts University
Medical School and director of neuromuscular research at the New
England Medical Center Hospital in Boston.
   The other mouse research was done by George Karpati and
colleagues at the Neuromuscular Research Group of the Montreal
Neurological Institute.
   Both studies were presented at a recent meeting of muscular
dystrophy researchers in Perth, Australia.
   Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes
boys almost exclusively, appearing in about one in every 3,500 male
births in the United States. It causes a progressive weakening and
wasting of voluntary muscles. Most patients must use wheelchairs by
age 12, and most die in their early 20s.
   The experiments tested an experimental therapy using immature
muscle cells called myoblasts, which normally help repair muscle
fibers that have broken because of injury or strenuous exercise.
   Researchers injected myoblasts into mice that lacked dystrophin
and found that the myoblasts fused with muscle fibers. Once inside a
fiber the myoblast nucleus provided a gene that allowed the fiber to
begin producing dystrophin.
   The scientists could not demonstrate any impact on dystrophy
symptoms because, for reasons not well understood, mice that lack
dystrophin show no outward symptoms in the first place.
   Kunkel's team, which reported its results recently in the British
journal Nature, found that mouse myoblasts fused to muscle fibers in
39 of 70 mice that received injections in a leg muscle
   Those fibers produced up to 30 percent to 40 percent of the
normal amount of dystrophin, which probably would be enough to ease
muscular dystrophy symptoms greatly in humans, Kunkel said.
   Karpati's experiment involved injecting human myoblasts into the
thighs of about two dozen mice. Some dystrophin appeared in every
mouse, Karpati said.
   Segments of muscle fiber that began generating dystrophin
resisted degeneration, while other segments broke down, Karpati said.
   ``I'm very optimistic'' about possible use in humans, he said.
   Scientists still must determine whether the human body would
reject transplanted myoblasts, which probably would be taken from a
patient's brother or father, Karpati said.
   Injections would have to be spaced no more than about two-fifths
of an inch apart. Treating every muscle would be impractical, so
researchers would have to choose those that permit breathing, arm
motion and other key functions, Karpati said.
   He and Kunkel also said the injections probably could not treat
heart damage caused by Duchenne. Karpati said the heart damage
rarely kills or causes severe disability now, but if patients were
allowed to live to ages 30 or 40, it may have to be addressed.

<HEAD>Papers From Fired Professor Donated To University</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A professor's widow is donating his
scientific papers to the university that fired him in 1953 for
refusing to say whether he had been a member of the Communist Party.
   Alex B. Novikoff's personal and scientific papers will be
presented Tuesday to the University of Vermont where the professor
of biochemistry spent five years on the most important cancer
research of his career.
   ``Alex didn't have any animosity about the people of the
University of Vermont,'' said his widow, Dr. Phyllis Novikoff.
``Alex never lived in the past. If something happened, you just
forget it and go on.''
   Some are calling it a final act of forgiveness on behalf of the
professor, one of many faculty members to be fired during that
period in American history when the country was gripped by fear of
communism.
   Mrs. Novikoff said her husband, who died in 1987 at age 73, would
have wanted the papers where he began his most important work,
including development of a model for studying cancerous liver tumors.
   Mrs. Novikoff, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in New York City where her husband also worked,
collaborated with him on many of the later papers.
   On Tuesday, she will begin delivering shopping bags full of
manuscripts, photographs and personal correspondence dating to the
early 1940s. Among the material are two films showing Nobel
Prize-winning scientists repeating their most important experiments,
movies that Novikoff made for the U.S. Army.
   ``I think the papers belong there,'' Mrs. Novikoff said.
   Connell Gallagher, the university's curator of manuscripts, said
Novikoff's scientific papers will shed light on the development of
the university's medical school. The personal and political papers
also will document the events of the late 1940s and early 1950s,
including Novikoff's dismissal.
   ``These events should be studied by every generation of student
so that they can ward against these kind of things happening in the
future. That will be the lesson of the manuscripts,'' said Gallagher.
   As in many other cases during the anti-communist hearings of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, many prominent people stood silent when Novikoff
was called to Washington to testify before congressional committees.
   The hearings reached into campuses, with more than 100 faculty
members like Novikoff being fired for refusing to snitch on
colleagues, said David R. Holmes, a University of Vermont professor
who wrote a recently published book on Novikoff's case.
   Holmes said Novikoff and 25 of his colleagues at Brooklyn College
in New York City joined the Community Party in the 1930s, when
fascism was taking hold in Europe, and ``it was a matter of pride to
be a member of the Communist Party.''
   The group focused on improving the working conditions at the
school, said Holmes, and by 1945, three years before he went to
Vermont, Novikoff had left the party.
   But four years earlier, Novikoff's friend, Harry Albaum, whom he
had met at Brooklyn College, told a New York state committee about
Novikoff's party membership. Novikoff was pegged as a security risk
and was barred from service in World War II.
   Another colleague named him at a hearing in 1951, triggering the
proceedings that led the University of Vermont to fire him two years
later when he cited his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer
questions about his political affiliation.
   Holmes said Novikoff, approached about the book in the early
1980s, was still reluctant to reveal whether he had been a member of
the Communist Party.
   ``That was the fundamental point of principle. In 1953, he
wouldn't answer the question when they asked, `Are you a member of
the Communist Party?''' Holmes said. ``He felt that was a question
that was inappropriate.''
   Novikoff returned to University of Vermont to address a
conference at the medical school in 1973, the year Holmes cites as
the end of the ``inquisition'' for Novikoff because he was cleared
of being a security risk.
   He returned again in 1983 to receive an honorary degree.

   Five years ago, young Aimee
Fitzgerald penned a message of hope, stuffed it in a bottle and
dropped it in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``My name is Aimee,'' wrote the then-9-year-old girl. ``If
anybody finds this, please write me and let me know where and when
you found it. Thank you.''
   Last month, Aimee got a pen pal beyond the reach of most
childhood dreams.
   A Moroccan sailor named Elaroui Abdellatif found the aged bottle
and tattered letter Feb. 2 on the shore of Laayoune in Western
Sahara, on the Atlantic coast in northwest Africa.
   ``I didn't think it would go to Africa,'' said Aimee, standing
again at the shoreline where she launched her childhood wish March
12, 1984. ``I remember throwing it in. And I didn't think it would
go too far.''
   At first it didn't.
   On March 28, 1984, Aimee, back home in Gradyville, Pa., received
a letter from a Newfoundland couple who had vacationed just up the
shore from where the girl had stayed with her family. The couple had
found the bottle, popped the wax-sealed cork, read the note,
resealed it and sent it on its way again.
   Aimee said the couple wrote her anonymously with no return
address. She said they told her they had placed another note in the
bottle, asking the finder to write ``the little girl.''
   ``He said that he'd like to visit Florida and California and New
York,'' Aimee recalled.
   Her father, Charles, said the family will send Abdellatif a
package, with post cards of U.S. cities, a copy of The Tampa
Tribune, pictures of their home and maps of St. Petersburg Beach and
Philadelphia, near her hometown.

   Blind employees at a workshop established
to rehabilitate them say they're being exploited and are demanding
the same wages their sighted counterparts get for comparable work.
   But the founder of the Southwest Lighthouse for the Blind says
the workshop trains blind people for work in the private sector and
is not required to pay the minimum wage.
   The U.S. Labor Department is investigating the workshop's wages,
and Lighthouse officials are to appear next month before an
administrative law judge to defend the separate wage scales for
blind and sighted employees.
   ``I think they're trying to have more of a factory out there than
to do something for the blind,'' said David Rocco, a former
Lighthouse employee who led a workers' strike in August and was laid
off in January.
   The dispute comes at a time when the blind are increasingly
questioning their treatment at such organizations. About 100 similar
workshops employ 6,000 visually impaired people nationwide.
   Employees at workshops in Houston and Cincinnati have formed
unions in the wake of wage and labor disputes. Unionization efforts
by workers in Little Rock, Ark., were denied by an appeals court.
   ``Blind people have been exploited in workshops since workshops
came into being,'' said James Gashel, director of governmental
affairs for the National Federation of the Blind in Baltimore.
   ``When you're paying $2.10 an hour you're going to have a lot of
wage disputes,'' added the federation's president, Mark Maurer.
   ``It's not enough money to live on.''
   In Lubbock, 14 blind workers, carrying canes and wearing signs
reading ``Lighthouse wages are from the Dark Ages,'' walked off
their jobs in August to protest the $2.05 hourly wage and their
$65-a-month health insurance fee.
   They want the Lighthouse to pay them the same $3.35 minimum wage
other employees receive.
   The workers returned to work two weeks later, union cards were
distributed and the National Labor Relations Board has since ordered
a union election. Negotiations have begun with the Teamsters.
   The issue stems in part from a clause in the Fair Labor Standards
Act that allows sheltered workshops to pay subminimum wages.
   The provision bases a subminimum wage on how much the worker
produces compared with an experienced, non-impaired worker in the
same job.
   The national federation wants to change that provision.
   In the Ohio case, blind workers at the Cincinnati Association of
the Blind sought to unionize in 1982 and went to the U.S. Supreme
Court. The high court let stand a lower-court ruling ordering the
workshop to recognize the workers as a bargaining unit. The workshop
had contended the workers were clients receiving rehabilitation
rather than private employees.
   Lighthouse officials used the same argument in a NLRB hearing.
   ``We're a rehabilitative facility,'' said Lighthouse founder Bob
Crane. ``We like to take people, train them and place them in the
private sector.''
   He said, however, that most people who come to work at the
Lighthouse remain there because they aren't capable of working
elsewhere.
   The non-profit Lighthouse in Lubbock started in a garage in 1955
and now employs 55 workers _ about 40 of whom are blind _ and five
staff members, Crane said.
   It is under contract to the federal government to produce
military items such as helmet chin straps and pads, and supports
itself with the government contracts and donations.
   Rocco and Lighthouse worker Joe Morales dispute Crane's figures
on the number of employees, saying only 25 are blind.
   ``There are more sighted people there than blind,'' said Morales.
   Crane would not comment further.
   Maurer said that despite the workshops' benevolent origins, the
operators underestimate the capabilities of the blind.
   ``What they think is that if you're blind you can't really be
expected to do anything much,'' he said. ``They think that if
they're giving you $2 an hour they're being charitable to you. It's
unreasonable to expect someone to produce and then not be paid for
their production.''

<HEAD>Snake Expert Won't Receive Overseas Antivenins Unless Condition Worsens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A reseacher bitten by a deadly viper has
stabilized and won't receive antivenins obtained from Iran, England
and the Soviet Union with help from the White House unless his
condition worsens, doctors say.
   William E. Haast, 78, remained in serious but stable condition
today at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center. Spokesman
John Dwan said Sunday Haast had been moved out of intensive care
into a regular nursing unit.
   ``His condition has not changed,'' Dwan said. ``He's resting
comfortably, and he's had lots of friends visiting him.''
   Haast likely would remain hospitalized for at least two to three
more weeks, Dwan said. He checked into the hospital Wednesday.
   Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
university's Research Park, was bitten Tuesday on the left hand by a
Pakistani pit viper, also known as a saw-scaled viper.
   Haast has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the
venom of dozens, but he had no immunity to the viper. It is one of
1,000 poisonous snakes kept at his lab, where venom is extracted for
research and the manufacture of antivenins.
   The serpentologist's case drew the attention of Stephen Studdert,
special assistant to President Bush, who coordinated the acquisition
of antivenins from the three countries and expedited their shipment
to Utah. All the shipments had arrived by Sunday.
   ``None have been used, because there are sometimes serious
reactions to antivenins and (doctors) don't want to give them to him
unless they have to,'' Dwan explained. The reactions could include
lung and kidney problems, he said.
   Nevertheless, Dwan said ``we want to express our appreciation to
everyone who has worked so hard in obtaining the antivenins.''
   The viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to produce
fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation. A lack
of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
   Haast's fibrinogen level was near zero Wednesday. Doctors were
replacing it with transfusions and it appeared Haast's body had
begun to produce the substance.
   His fibrinogen level improved to about one-third of normal by
Sunday, still ``dangerously low,'' Dwan said.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from the San Diego
Zoo and from a lab in Los Angeles, but they did not work as well as
expected.
   Studdert said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations
with the United States. Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini has often
called the United States the ``great Satan.''

   Thousands of Soviet Pentecostals are leaving
their country for the United States under the guise of being Jewish
emigres, a newspaper reported.
   The emigration of Pentecostals, who claim to suffer
discrimination in their homeland, apparently has the blessing of
government officials in several countries who are assisting their
passage, The Buffalo News reported Sunday.
   ``We're not sure of the reason why the Soviets have allowed the
Pentecostals to leave,'' said Serge Duss, a refugee specialist with
the World Relief agency in Rome.
   ``The Soviets have turned a blind eye, the Israelis have turned a
blind eye, but the important thing is they are getting out of the
country.''
   ``It's not a secret,'' said the Rev. Alexander Shevchuk of New
York City, himself a Soviet emigre.
   Refugee workers say Pentecostals renounce their Soviet
citizenship in Moscow, obtain visas from the Dutch or American
embassy and come to refugee camps in Italy.
   A spokesman at the Dutch embassy in Moscow who spoke on condition
he remain anonymous denied to The Associated Press his country was
issuing visas identifying Pentecostals as Jews. Officials at the
U.S. embassy didn't comment immediately.
   The State Department's annual review of human rights last month
found signs of significant reform in Soviet policies during the past
year, including increased emigration for Pentecostals as well as
Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans.
   Shevchuk has traveled throughout the United States raising funds
to support Pentecostals in Italian refugee camps. He led a
contingent of American Pentecostals to Italy in late Feburary to
arrange sponsors for the refugees.
   One of the pastors accompanying him, Rev. Paul Schenck of New
Covenent Tabernacle Church in the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, said
he hopes to sponsor 100 refugees.
   ``We want to literally sponsor a colony,'' Schenck said. ``We
want to do for the Russian Pentecostals what Brighton Beach did for
the Russian Jews,'' he said, referring to the New York City
neighborhood where many Jewish emigres have settled.
   Up to 300 other Pentecostals will be placed in other churches in
upstate New York. About 120 Pentecostals are already living near
Rochester, he said.
   Refugee workers say more than 2,000 Pentecostals left the Soviet
Union last year and up to 10,000 may emigrate this year.
   Soviet Pentecostals, who number about 700,000, believe in
everyday manifestations of the Holy Spirit, speak in tongues and
practice faith healing. They claim to have been forced into the
Soviet countryside and denied good schooling and jobs.
   ``When we were singing Christmas carols, they caught us and put
us in jail,'' said Peter Malischuk, 27, an artist staying in the
Italian town Olevano Romano with his wife and two children.
``Everyone was fined and laid off from work.''
   Victor Povorzynk, 40, a furniture maker staying with his wife and
three children in the village of Ladispoli, said he was drafted into
the military and refused to take the military oath.
   ``They put me in a psychiatric hospital and then sentenced me to
four years in jail,'' Povorzynk said.

   Shelby Bush just wants a place to settle down
with his 100,000 plus collection of old tires, but residents of this
tiny southern Louisiana community don't want him to park them in
their town.
   ``The whole community is against me,'' Bush said. ``But I'm
staying right here and fighting for my rights. They ran the Indians
off several hundred years ago. But they're not running me off.''
   Bush, who has collected tires 18 years, began stockpiling them on
his property here in November after his Junkyard and Tire Land three
miles away was shut down by a court order.
   Now, Sun, a village of 500 about 40 miles north of New Orleans,
is moving to do the same thing.
   Mayor Nathan Wood, using the power of mayor's court, issued a
temporary restraining order preventing Bush from accepting more
tires within the village limits.
   The Rev. Walter Lumpkin, pastor of First Baptist Church of Sun,
near Bush's land, said the tires are an eyesore. He said they also
create a breeding ground for mosquitoes, a home for vermin, and pose
a fire threat.
   Bush has 7,000 tires on land he owns in the village. Two tracts
of his property wrap around the Sun post office on three sides. It's
there that Bush wants to stockpile more tires and begin shredding
them for recycling.
   Bush has a village occupational license for ``a junkyard and tire
land.'' No ordinance specifically outlaws junkyards or tire depots.
But Village Attorney William Magee said Sun can use state nuisance
codes to block Bush's efforts.

   Police in suburban Quezon City said
today that they had already hauled into jail about 300 violators of
a tough anti-smoking law that took effect a day earlier.
   Those arrested were locked in holding cells until charges could
be prepared against them. After a few hours, they were released
pending trial.
   The dragnet snagged not only scofflaws, but unwitting violators
as well.
   One 19-year-old youth arrived today at the police station,
puffing on a cigarette, carrying food for a friend arrested earlier
for unauthorized smoking.
   The teen-ager was thrown into the cell with his friend after
police explained the smoking ban applies in police stations too.
   The new ordinance bans smoking in most public places, including
buses, restaurants, government offices, hospitals and theaters in
the city of about 1 million, part of metropolitan Manila.
   Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated for
smoking face a $10 dollar fine, 10 days in jail, or both.
   ``No complaints so far,'' said Col. Rodolfo Garcia, police
station commander and a reformed smoker, speaking about the
crackdown. ``The people (of the city) are even pleased because we
are protecting them.''
   City officials said they will put up signs along municipal
boundaries warning people they are entering ``a non-smoking city.''
   Vendors selling cigarettes to drivers and passengers of jeeps,
the most common means of public transport, warned their customers to
stash the cigarettes if their vehicles enter Quezon City.
   But several people complained that they were unaware of the ban
until they were hauled off public transportation or detained in
public buildings.
   ``I just arrived from Cebu City, and I did not know that there
was an anti-smoking ordinance here in Quezon City,'' salesman
Cesario Ong told The Journal newspaper.
   He was among 13 people arrested Sunday during spot checks of
passenger jeeps along the city's Aurora Boulevard.
   The ordinance is part of a larger anti-smoking campaign which
Quezon City officials say will include a $10,000 media campaign
against cigarettes.
   A private health organization, the Tri-Chest Societies on
Cigarette Smoking and Health, said smoking causes about 85 percent
of lung cancer deaths in the Philippines.
   But some radio commentators complained that if city officials are
worried about public health, they should first crack down on
smoke-belching jeeps and buses which clog traffic in metropolitan
Manila.
   The Philippine Daily Inquirer balked, wondering if police should
not spend more time protecting Filipinos from more dangerous
criminals in a country with one of East Asia's highest crime rates.
   ``Residents may take comfort in the knowledge that while they may
fall into the hands of lawless elements, at least they will not die
of cancer,'' the paper said.

   A concert billed as an ``Aryan Woodstock''
for skinheads and white supremacists turned out to be ``boring and
uncomfortable'' because of rain, a lack of food and a court-ordered
ban on music.
   About 100 people representing half a dozen white supremacist
groups gathered Saturday at a private ranch about 40 miles north of
San Francisco, but were far outnumbered by about 400 protesters and
500 police officers.
   ``They talked about girls. They gropingly discussed `white
power.' They pranced about with Nazi flags and insignia, but they
never discussed the ideology of fascism or of anything else,'' wrote
Cherie Seymour, a former reporter who gained entrance to the event.
   Seymour, who did not specify how she managed to attend the rally
in the heart of California's wine country, described the event in an
article in today's editions of the San Francisco Chronicle.
   ``It was simply boring _ and uncomfortable,'' she said. ``The
great majority had brought neither rain gear nor food. Morale hit
bottom when police refused to let the daughter of white supremacist
Tom Metzger return with $100 worth of pizzas.''
   The event originally was touted as something to bring together
thousands of white supremacist youths. The skinhead bands Midtown
Boot Boys from Oklahoma, the Hammerheads from Wisconsin annd
Kakenkreuz from Detroit were expected to perform.
   But Napa County Superior Judge W. Scott Snowden ruled Friday that
rally organizers couldn't have music without a permit.
   So participants spent most of the day glaring at reporters and
protesters from a hill.
   The gathering was held out of view of the public, which was not
allowed entrance to the ranch. There were a few clashes between
white supremacists and protesters but no arrests or major violence.
   ``What you find is that the people of Napa rallied against this
group that has no purpose other than hate. I was real proud of the
way people stood up,'' said Mayor Ed Solomon.
   Early Sunday, the last five white supremacists left the property.
   Sheriff Gary Simpson estimated the cost of law enforcement at
about $400,000.

<DATELINE>DUISBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Greens Party has overcome
factional feuding, appears to have dislodged itself from the
political periphery and is on a course aimed at attracting voters by
projecting a more moderate image.
   During a weekend congress in Duisburg, the Greens elected a new
and diverse slate of leaders to replace a leadership long dominated
by radicals.
   There were also signs of moves within the party to consider the
prospects of a possible coalition government with the main
opposition Social Democratic Party if Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing Christian Democrats lose next year's federal elections.
   More than 600 Greens delegates came to Duisburg to try to put the
party of leftists, anti-nuclear activists, feminists and
environmentalists back on its feet after its radical leadership was
brought down in December.
   On Saturday night, the Greens elected new leaders who are less
controversial and more moderate than their predecessors _ an
important new change for parliament's most vocal party.
   But Otto Schily, a founder of the Greens and a respected member
of Parliament, says he fears the party that holds 41 of the 497
seats in parliament could still face problems in improving its voter
appeal.
   ``There are still Greens who insist on holding onto their
ideological and dogmatic ideas who could hinder our access to
citizens whose support we really need,'' Schily told The Associated
Press.
   For the first time in recent years, a member of the Greens'
moderate ``realos'' (realists) faction was elected as one of the top
three leaders _ Ruth Hammerbacher, a state lawmaker from Lower
Saxony.
   The two others are also completely new to the leadership: Verena
Krieger, who comes from the party's radical ranks, and Ralf Fuecks,
whose ideas fall somewhere between those of his two colleagues.
   The Greens tried to find a leadership that represents a wide
range of party interests and to avoid giving all power to a single
faction.
   Jutta Ditfurth, one of the radical leaders ousted in December,
stunned the congress by saying she plans to quit the party next
year. She blamed moderate Greens for her decision.
   But in an unusual show of party unity, several other Greens
rejected Ms. Ditfurth's attacks.
   The 39,000-member Greens Party, which sprang from protest groups
in the late 1970s, has long been divided by ideological
disagreements between radical and moderate elements.
   The disputes have pitted party members willing to work within
established political procedures against Ms. Ditfurth's radical
wing, the so-called ``fundis'' (fundamentalists), who see little
value in pursuing a pragmatic legislative course.
   After fundis took control of the party leadership in 1987, they
began returning the party to its radical roots and a highly
confrontational style of politics. That course stalled any effective
action by the party in parliament.
   In December, however, moderate Greens forced the fundis' ouster
from the party leadership with a no-confidence vote.
   Moderate Greens have an added morale boost from the strong
possibility that the Alternative List, the Greens' sister party in
West Berlin, will join with the Social Democrats to run the city's
government after the Christian Democrats were ousted from power in
last month's state elections.

<HEAD>Klan Holds Recruitment Rally in City of ``Mississippi Burning''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen Ku Klux Klan members marched
for ``white power'' and a Klan leader criticized the movie
``Mississippi Burning,'' about the slayings of three civil rights
workers here in the 1960s.
   About 100 spectators watched the march and recruitment rally with
a few people heckling the marchers. About 20 law enforcement
officers also kept watch.
   No incidents were reported in the march or during another march
by about 20 Klan members later Sunday in Meridian, about 40 miles to
the east.
   Jordan Gollub, the Grand Dragon for Mississippi, said the march
was held in Philadelphia because of the movie, which he said
presented a ``negative, hateful image of the Klan.
   ``Hollywood is run by Jews and integrationists,'' said Gollub, a
Jew by birth.
   The movie, which has received seven Oscar nominations, is loosely
based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers whose
bodies were found in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, a town of
about 7,500 in central Mississippi.
   James Earl Chaney, 21, who was black, and Andrew Goodman, 20, and
Michael Schwerner, 24, who were white, were shot to death. The
federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating
the civil rights of the three men, but no one was ever charged with
murder.
   The Klan marchers included 10 men and six women, with 10 wearing
purple, green, gold and white robes.
   Police cars preceded and followed the marchers through
Philadelphia's small downtown area and six patrolmen walked with the
group.
   Philadelphia Police Chief Arden Gentry said his entire 16-member
police force was on duty along with Neshoba County Sheriff Glen
Waddell, one deputy and two county constables. At least one FBI
agent from Meridian also was present.
   ``We knew we were probably one of the best known cities for our
size in the country, and we didn't know what to expect,'' Gentry
said.

   A correspondent for the U.S.

radio reported.
   That would make Hungary the first Soviet bloc country to accredit
an RFE reporter. Two years ago, only journalists from East European
countries were allowed as permanent correspondents based in Budapest.
   RFE, headquartered in Munich, West Germany, broadcasts in all
east European languages and has frequently been the target of strong

   According to the Hungarian radio broadcast Sunday, 18 Western

   The American Academy of Pediatrics today for the
first time noted evidence of medical benefits of circumcisions for
newborns, but the 37,000-member organization stopped short of an
all-out endorsement.
   The academy said the decision is best made by parents in
consultation with their physicians.
   ``In addition to the medical aspects, other factors will affect
the parents' decisions, including esthetics, religion, cultural
attitudes, social pressures and tradition,'' the group said in a
statement.
   Circumcision, removal of a band of skin encircling the tip of the
penis, is the nation's most commonly performed surgical procedure,
but it appears to be on the decline.
   The practice is a controversial issue worldwide. The first
International Symposium on Circumcision was held last week in
Anaheim, Calif., sponsored by the National Organization of
Circumcision Information Resource Centers and the Institute for the
Advancement of Human Behavior.
   The symposium concluded that the medical need for circumcision is
very rare and that ordinarily it should not be done, said Billy
Boyd, a participant and co-founder of The Victims Speak, a group
working against circumcision.
   ``Parents do not have the right to consent to unnecessary medical
procedures on their children,'' and physicians have an obligation to
refuse to remove normal body parts, the symposium said in a policy
statement presented to the California Medical Association.
   The right to an intact body supercedes religious or cultural
practices that include circumcision, said Donna Macris, vice
president of the board of directors of the Circumcision Information
Resource Centers.
   Since 1971, when the pediatrics academy first took a stand on the
issue, it had maintained that no absolute medical necessity existed
for routine circumcision of newborns.
   But in its statement today, it said the procedure ``has potential
medical benefits and advantages.''
   It recommended that physicians explain and discuss the benefits
and risks of circumcision with parents.
   Informed consent should be obtained before the procedure is done,
said the academy, based in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   The group said it was influenced partly by studies at Army
hospitals in 1985 that concluded that among the 200,000 males
studied, there was an 11-fold increase in urinary tract infections
in uncircumcised as compared with circumcised infants.
   However, the academy said all-out endorsement was not merited, in
part because the study may have been flawed, thus ``conclusions
regarding the relationship of urinary tract infection to
circumcision are tentative.''
   The academy also addressed the issue of pain caused by
circumcision.
   It said infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia appear
to experience pain.
   But, the academy said, ``reported experience with local
anesthesia in newborn circumcision is limited, and the procedure
(anesthesia) is not without risk.''
   More studies are needed before routine local anesthesia can be
endorsed, the group said.

   Travelers snared in the Eastern Airlines strike winced at the
sour taste of labor wars _ no matter if it was a honeymooning couple
trapped at New York's LaGuardia Airport or an unhappy mother leaving
her marriage behind.
   Eastern Airlines severely underestimated the impact of organized
labor's effort to bring business to a halt and thousands of
travelers paid the price, acknowledged Eastern President Phil Bakes,
whose apologies were little consolation on those caught in the labor
unrest.
   Carlos and Ileana Rodriguez of Fairlawn, N.J., got married
Saturday night and had planned to take a Sunday morning flight to
Puerto Rico.
   They spent the first day of their honeymoon in the LaGuardia
terminal because there were no pilots to fly the plane.
   ``This is ridiculous,'' said an angry Rodriguez. ``I'm very
disappointed and disgusted with the whole ordeal.''
   Amid the chaos of Miami International Airport, Alana Riley sat
disconsolately on the carpet as her 3-year-old son, David, played
nearby. She said she was in the process of moving from Jamaica to
New Orleans.
   ``I picked a hell of a time to move,'' she said. ``I'm divorcing
on top of it all. It's just real hectic to be traveling with a
3-year-old.''
   The frustration and confusion was replayed at airports around the
country on the second day of the Machinists union strike, supported
by nearly 95 percent of pilots.
   A few kept their sense of humor.
   Salomeja Valukas, of New Haven, Conn., was trying to depart
LaGuardia for Miami, and came to the airport despite warnings it
would be bad.
   ``What can I do?'' she wondered. ``There are worse things in
life. I went through the war in Europe.''
   Lou Garber, vice president of Garber Travel in Brookline, Mass.,
said his agency had rerouted hundreds in recent days.
   ``It's becoming increasingly difficult to find alternative
routings, but we've been working on it for days and are
accomplishing the task,'' he said.
   Most airlines offered varying degrees of help, except for TWA,
said Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock.
   ``TWA is not helping at all; American takes passengers on
standby; Pan American takes passengers on standby; United has been
helping depending on availability of space, either booking them on
or placing them on standby; Delta ... USAir and Piedmont have the
same policy,'' he said.
   Eastern targeted some of its high-profile routes, but was unable
to muster the pilots to fly many planes. Continental planes made
special trips to Puerto Rico to pick up stranded cruise tourists.
   ``We are placing the emphasis on protecting the cruise
passengers, the Caribbean routes and the Northeast Shuttle,'' said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   He admitted the airline was not finding lodging for all those
left behind.
   ``We've been able to put many in hotels, but this is Grand Prix
weekend and the hotels are totally booked,'' said Matell in Miami.
   Other events this weekend during a peak of South Florida tourist
activity were the Honda Classic PGA event in neighboring Broward
County, the Florida Derby and baseball spring training.
   At Miami International Airport, the strike advanced the confusion
to a new dimension, with anxious travelers peppering harried Eastern
employees in Spanish, French, English and Haitian Creole.
   ``Nobody knows nothing,'' complained 33-year-old Charlie Rink of
Philadelphia. ``There's nobody walking around, talking to people to
explain things. They need a trouble shooter.''
   Bakes apologized at a news conference Sunday.
   ``We want to apologize for the inconvenience you've
experienced,'' he said. ``It's been a mess.''
   Nobody had to tell Alana Riley, plopped on the floor at Miami
International, her efforts to move far away from Jamaica quite
stymied.
   ``I feel for the employees at Eastern,'' she said. ``But I've not
cared for Eastern Airlines' service for the last two years.''

   Afghan guerrillas attacked a
Kabul-bound emergency convoy and set fire to 15 vehicles, but the
rest of the trucks arrived safely in the Afghan capital over the
weekend, Radio Kabul said.
   The more than 550 trucks with 6,000 tons of food and fuel from
the Soviet Union were hit as they traveled south on the strategic
Salang Highway from Hairatan, a village on the Soviet border, the
state-run radio Sunday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said 13 tank trucks and
two trucks carrying wheat were set on fire by attacking rebels.
   ``The opposition continued to launch attacks on convoys of food
and fuel, snatching the bread from the table of our innocent
people,'' Radio Kabul said.
   ``Heavy losses and casualties were inflicted on the criminals,''
the radio broadcast said without elaborating.
   A spokesman for the rebel force Jamiat-i-Islami, which claims
control of much of the area on either side of the Salang Highway,
said today that he knew nothing of the weekend convoy.
   However, the spokesman said his group's policy is to allow
emergency food, but not military hardware, to pass.
   The Soviet Union withdrew the last of its forces Feb. 15 after
nine years of military intervention. More than 100,000 Soviet
soldiers were sent into the central Asian state to prop up the
Marxist government.
   Western analysts and guerrilla leaders headquartered in Pakistan
say Afghan President Najib's government will soon fall to the rebels.
   In weekend fighting around the country, Radio Kabul said 68
rebels were killed by government troops and scores injured and
captured. It gave no casualty toll for government forces.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Release of 188 Sikhs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge today ordered the release of 188
Sikhs jailed in a northern city since a 1984 army raid on the
holiest Sikh shrine during which 1,200 people were killed, a senior
government official said.
   Among those to be freed is Gurcharan Singh Tohra, head of the
Sikh temple management committee. The body, which controls most Sikh
shrines and temple funds, is considered the most powerful Sikh
organization.
   The prisoners' release is part of a package announced last week
by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to try to end ethnic violence that
has wracked the northwestern state of Punjab for seven years.
   Militants are fighting for an independent homeland.
   In June 1984, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered the army
to raid the Golden Temple in Amritsar to rout Sikh militants inside.
   Four months later, she was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in
retaliation for the raid.
   Most of those killed in the raise were Sikhs and authorities
arrested about 300 people, many of them pilgrims held for
questioning but never charged.
   Jodhpur District Judge Khemchandra Sharma, acting on a request by
prosecutors, today ordered the release of 188 of the prisoners
jailed in Jodhpur, said a Home Ministry official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The prisoners will be taken back to Amritsar
on Tuesday, the official said. Jodhpur is in Rajasthan state,
southwest of Punjab.
   Authorities had already released 118 prisoners, the official said.
   At least 2,400 people were killed by Sikh militants last year,
more than double the number in 1987. More than 340 people have died
this year.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population, but they are a
slight majority in the northern Punjab state. Militants claim Sikhs
are discriminated against by Hindus, who comprises 82 percent of the
national population.

<HEAD>Gov't Orders Schools To Reopen, Sporadic Gunfire Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared it has regained
control after the country's bloodiest riots in decades and ordered
elementary schools to reopen today. It also gave a new, lower death
toll.
   A nighttime curfew remained in effect in the capital and the
country was still under martial law, which allows soldiers to search
houses without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely without
charge.
   Isolated gunfire was heard in the capital early Sunday, but there
have been no significant disturbances since Friday.
   The rioting, which began Feb. 27, was sparked by increases in bus
fares and other price increases mandated under an austerity plan
demanded by foreign creditors.
   In a nationwide television broadcast, an aide to President Carlos
Andres Perez revised downward the government's tally of the number
of dead and wounded from the rioting, which began Feb. 27.
   He said 246 people were killed _ down from Perez's previous
estimate of at least 300. Figueredo said 1,800 people were injured,
compared to earlier reports of at least 2,000.
   No explanation was given for the new figures, which were much
lower than newspaper reports putting the death toll as high as 600
and the number of wounded at several thousand.
   Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating 2,300.
   Figueredo said during Saturday night's broadcast that the
government was starting to reopen schools because unrest has ``been
controlled and the situation ... has returned to complete
normality.''
   He said classes would resume today for kindergarten through sixth
grade and begin later in the week for older students.
   It was unclear when universities would reopen. Universities have
traditionally been centers of protest of government economic
policies.
   The riots and looting broke out after sharp rises in bus fares,
gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services.
   With its oil-based economy, Venezuela enjoyed prosperity during
the 1970s but saw its fortunes sharply decline with the price of oil
in 1981.
   The country's $33 billion foreign debt makes it Latin America's
fourth-largest debtor nation behind Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   People filed into the Caracas central morgue Sunday trying to
find missing relatives.
   Azucena Correa, spokeswoman for a newly formed Committee for the
Missing, said her group had a list of hundreds of people who could
not be located. She said many were assumed to be in military
custody, and she accused authorities of holding back information.
   ``We've gone to the interior minister, we've gone to the police,
but so far nothing,'' she said.
   ``We even have the names of children, some under the age of 7,
who haven't been seen in their homes since the violence began,'' Ms.
Correa added.
   The auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of Caracas, Monsignor Jorge
Sabino Uroza said Sunday that the riots were a product of poverty
and frustration, and said powerful business interests and government
leaders shared the blame.
   Celebrating Mass at Caracas' Central Cathedral, Uroza said
``there are those that sacked stores, and they should seek pardon;
but there are also those, especially economic and political sectors,
that have sacked the country for years. They should also seek
pardon.''

   Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford enters
Tuesday's Democratic primary runoff with a historic bid: to become
the state's first black congressman this century, and in a district
that is three-fourths white.
   Ford is considered the underdog in seeking to become the 25th
black in the 435-member U.S. House and the first from a Deep South
district where whites are in the vast majority.
   ``The members are watching it very closely,'' said Amelia Parker,
executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington,
D.C. A Ford victory, she said, ``would be an extraordinary message
at this point in the history of our country.''
   Despite the symbolism, Ford and his opponent, Secretary of State
Glen Browder, have sought to keep race out of the campaign for the
3rd Congressional District seat in mostly rural east Alabama.
   The runoff winner will face state Sen. John Rice of Opelika, who
was a Democrat until he switched to Republican ranks last year.
   Ford, 46, worked for Robert Kennedy's ill-fated 1968 presidential
campaign, but he later formed political ties to then-President Nixon
and former Gov. George Wallace, supporting Wallace in his 1974
gubernatorial bid. Ford has enlisted the aid of Jesse Jackson in
seeking a strong black voter turnout, but has said repeatedly that
race is not an issue.
   ``I am very confident we will win support from people of both
races who are interested in the best qualified candidate regardless
of the color of the candidate's skin,'' he said.
   Browder, also 46, a former professor who narrowly led Ford in a
splintered Democratic field Feb. 14, is considered the frontrunner.
He has the support of organized labor and has gained recognition for
advocating campaign finance reform. He has not targeted Ford or made
race a factor in the three-week campaign.
   ``Both candidates realize that going into such a short time-frame
there is no advantage in going after your opponent,'' said Browder's
campaign manager, Dave Cooley. ``Race is certainly not an issue in
our campaign.''
   ``Race is not as much an issue as it has been in the past,'' said
state Sen. Jim Preuitt of Talladega, a conservative who ran a close
third in the primary and has since blasted Browder as a liberal who
``sold his soul to big labor bosses.''
   ``He doesn't want to be known as just a black candidate,'' said
Robert Anderson, a white high school principal from Notasulga who is
co-chairman of Ford's campaign. ``But he understood that just to
make the runoff was historic.''
   The last time a black reached a Democratic runoff for a
congressional seat in the state was in 1978, but Chris McNair lost
to Richard Shelby in west Alabama's 7th District. Shelby now sits in
the U.S. Senate.
   In the House, Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and Alan Wheat, D-Mo.,
are the only blacks to represent districts with majority white
populations on the scale of Alabama's 3rd District. In the Deep
South, Rep. Mike Espy won a Mississippi district that was about
evenly split racially in 1986 and won re-election easily last year
with strong white support.
   Robert Bush, Espy's administrative assistant, said Ford entered
the race with ``a proven track record with white politicians that
Mike Espy didn't have.''
   Ford has been mayor of Tuskegee since 1972 and helped found state
and national conferences of black mayors as well as a multi-racial
organization called the World Conference of Mayors.
   The 3rd District seat was vacated by the death in December of
Rep. Bill Nichols. He had kept the seat Democratic for 22 years with
generally conservative, defense-oriented politics.
   Rice, 37, is expected to get support from white conservative
voters who backed Nichols, but he is a relative newcomer in state
politics.

<HEAD>Arafat Offers Truce With Israel In South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat has offered to revive a
1981 cease-fire with the Israelis in south Lebanon and to visit
Israel if Arab governments approve, newspapers said today.
   He said Israel was negotiating with the Palestine Liberation
Organization through the United Nations for a halt to guerrilla
operations from south Lebanon, the papers reported.
   Israel has said it will not talk to the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
   Arafat was quoted as saying that reviving the short-lived 1981
cease-fire, which was mediated by U.N. peacekeepers, ``should only
take place according to our conditions.''
   In an interview with editors of several Kuwaiti dailies, he
stressed that the PLO would agree to a truce only if Israel ``stops
its raids in the region, ends its deportation of Palestinians and
stops using arms against the uprising'' in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Under the 1981 accord, the PLO suspended operations across the
Lebanese border as diplomatic efforts were made to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict. The truce fell apart when the Israelis
invaded Lebanon in 1982.
   Arafat's reported offer came after Israeli claims that recent
guerrilla operations in Israel's self-designated ``security zone''
in south Lebanon violated the renunciation of terrorism Arafat made
last December, when he also recognized Israel's right to exist.
   The United States lifted a 13-year-old ban on direct talks with
the PLO following Arafat's declaration and has said guerrilla raids
on Israel could have a negative effect on the U.S.-PLO dialogue that
began three months ago.
   The Israelis regularly retaliate for the cross-border raids from
Lebanon with air strikes and ground assaults.
   Arafat was quoted today as saying: ``I can go to Israel only if
my trip is endorsed by all Arabs.'' He was also quoted as predicting
that ``an independent Palestinian state will be set up within two
years.''
   During the 15-month rebellion against Palestinian rule in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli authorities have shot to death
more the 380 Palestinians and deported dozens. More than 15 Israelis
have died.
   Arafat, who arrived in Kuwait Saturday, presided over the annual
meeting of the Palestinian National Fund.

<HEAD>NATO Urges Moscow To Cut Tanks, Artillery By Two-Thirds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO today urged Moscow to cut its tanks
and artillery in eastern Europe by two-thirds to give impetus to new
talks aimed at reducing congressional forces on the world's most
heavily armed continent.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze countered with
demands for percentage reductions by East and West of troops,
tactical nuclear weapons and combat aircraft as well.
   Shevardnadze proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and
``the main categories of arms'' by 10 to 15 percent over the next
two to three years.
   In a second phase of two to three years, further cuts of about 25
percent, or half a million men, should be made by each side, he said.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will enter the
negotiations, which formally open Thursday, with a call for lopsided
Warsaw Pact reductions of weaponry excluding missiles and combat
aircraft.
   The Western military alliance maintains the Warsaw Pact has
almost a 2-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery.
   Along the East-West divide in Europe, Shevardnadze said, the two
blocs should agree on areas where they would reduce, limit or
withdraw ``the most dangerous, destabilizing kinds of arms.''
   ``Tactical nuclear arms would also be withdrawn from those
zones,'' he told foreign ministers gathered in Vienna's historic
Hofburg palace for a three-day, 35-nation meeting preceding the
opening of negotiations.
   Shevardnadze also proposed separate talks on ``reducing and
completely eliminating tactical nuclear arms in Europe'' as soon as
possible.
   His speech ran counter to U.S. aims to keep short-range nuclear
weapons in West Germany, which has asked NATO to delay any decision
on modernizing such forces for at least two years.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain, speaking after
Shevardnadze and outlining NATO's proposals for the new talks,
stressed the need to maintain a nuclear presence in Europe.
   He said Shevardnadze's proposals, while differing from the
West's, were worthy of serious study.
   ``The Vienna negotiations must not become a competition for who
can put forward the more radical proposals,'' Howe said. ``They are
a serious quest for stability and security and not a competitive
striptease.''
   Howe proposed an overall ceiling of 40,000 tanks, 33,000
artillery and 56,000 armored personnel carriers in Europe. Those
totals should be equally divided on each side _ the 16 NATO nations
and seven Warsaw Pact countries.
   He also proposed a limit of 3,200 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces
and 6,000 armored troop carriers stationed outside national borders
on each side.
   That would significantly slice the Soviet armored presence in
Eastern Europe. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in
December a unilateral withdrawal of six tanks divisions and 50,000
men from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the next two
years.
   But the Soviet Union currently has some 10,000 tanks stationed
outside its borders, meaning further cuts would be needed to meet
the NATO proposals.
   Howe said NATO is seeking a two-thirds reduction ``in the massed
ranks of Soviet tanks and artillery in Europe, and by well over half
in armored troop carriers.''
   This would not threaten Soviet security, he stressed, because
``the Soviet Union will still have more tanks within the area than
the United States and West Germany combined.''
   Shevardnadze, by contrast, said he was not proposing any concrete
numbers, arguing that the fixing of such ceilings should be left to
experts.
   The 35 foreign ministers meeting in Vienna are from the nations
that signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act _ the superpowers, Canada
and all European nations bar Albania.
   Those 35 nations agreed in mid-January to launch two sets of arms
control negotiations to enhance security in Europe.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact will discuss how to reduce the
conventional forces and weapons massed from the Atlantic to the Ural
mountains deep inside the Soviet Union. All 35 nations will also
hold separate talks on measures to build confidence and security
across Europe.
   Howe said NATO would propose at that second forum an annual
exchange of information about the size, location and equipment of
armed forces and urge ``random checking'' to verify that data.
   Shevardnadze said the new Vienna talks should not become bogged
down in sterile arguments about data _ a key factor in the failure
of 15 years of Vienna talks on reducing troops and tanks in central
Europe.

<TEXT>
   Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi called in an
interview published today for a national ban on Salman Rushdie's
``The Satanic Verses,'' saying the novel threatens Moslem-Jewish
relations and world peace.
   Militant Palestinian leader Ahmed Jibril vowed Sunday to make
every effort to kill Rushdie ``in defense of religion, God, and his
prophet (Mohammed).'' Speaking in Damascus, Syria, Jibril said he
would use his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command to carry out the threat.
   Jibril said Rushdie's book was ``a new conspiracy ... a desperate
attempt to defame God and his prophet.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen born into a Moslem family in India,
has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini said he should be killed because his novel was blasphemous.
Iranian clerics have put a $5.2 million price on his head.
   The threat prompted the 12 European Economic Community nations
and several other countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Iran.
The Iranian Parliament voted Tuesday to break relations with Britain
unless Britain within a week reversed its stand.
   Nineteen people have died in Pakistan and India in violence
related to the book. The novel is banned in Pakistan, India and
several other nations.
   Israel's Rabbi Avraham Shapira made his statements in an
interview published today in the Hebrew-language newspaper Maariv. A
spokesman confirmed that Shapira wanted the book banned in Israel.
   ``Every man of religion must see himself as hurt by a publication
like this,'' Shapira was quoted as saying. ``If there had been an
attack, for example, on our forefather Moses or on the prophets,
would we not be shocked?
   ``Here we are not talking about criticism, but an attack on the
honor of a religion,'' he said.
   Shapira acknowledged he lacks the power to order an end to the
book's distribution in Israel. He also criticized the death threat
of Khomeini, saying, ``His fanaticism worries me.''
   Shapira is one of Israel's two chief rabbis. He leads the
Ashkenazi Jews, who are of European heritage and comprise almost
half the country's Jewish population. Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu
represents Jews of Middle Eastern heritage. He was unavailable for
comment.
   Rabbi Zalman Quittner, the spokesman for Shapira, said, ``Ties
between Jews and Moslems in this country are very tenuous, and we
shouldn't do anything that jeopardizes them.''
   ``The book causes conflicts between different communities and
even threatens world peace,'' Shapira told Maariv.

   Officials investigating computer
spies who passed information from Western computers to the Soviets
believe the hackers did not make a major security breach, a
spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor said today.
   Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann called last week's breakup
of the spy ring a ``major blow'' to the Soviet KGB. He said Friday
the hackers were ``an extremely dangerous new threat'' to security
but that further inquiry would be needed to determine the extent of
the damage.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for chief federal prosecutor Kurt
Rebmann, said today: ``The information obtained by the hackers does
not appear to be that sensitive.''
   Prechtel made the comment when asked about news reports saying
the hackers had mainly obtained access codewords for the computers.
   He said eight West Germans are still under investigation. Three
men were arrested last week.
   West Germany's ARD television network said the hackers tapped
into information from the U.S. Defense Department and computers
handling sensitive research on nuclear weapons.
   It said the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included
the Defense Department's general databank, and a NASA and ``Star
Wars'' research computer.
   The television report said three hackers handed over information
from the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland
and West Germany at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East
Berlin.
   The report said authorities believe West German hackers were
recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and ``were paid
with cash and drugs.''

<HEAD>Authorities Arrest 52 Undocumented Aliens</HEAD>

   Fifty-two illegal immigrants, many of them
holding plane tickets, were arrested at a suspected ``drop house''
where they apparently were waiting out a crackdown on immigrant
smuggling, authorities said.
   The action Sunday night brought the number of undocumented aliens
arrested over the weekend to 89. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service has been concentrating its efforts for the past week on
stopping the use of commercial airlines for smuggling illegal aliens
to destinations nationwide.
   Officers discovered the immigrants after receiving an anonymous
tip from a caller who alleged a diabetic woman was being kept at the
house against her will, Lt. Roger Fox said.
   The report turned out to be false, but police discovered the
group of adult aliens, mostly from Brazil, and notified the INS, Fox
said.
   The aliens were holding airline tickets for destinations
including Chicago, New York and St. Louis, Fox said.
   The aliens were taken to INS detention facilities downtown, Fox
said.
   Authorities estimated there are between 30 and 40 ``drop houses''
where paid smugglers keep illegal aliens in the Los Angeles area
before sending them on to residences elsewhere.
   ``We're looking for all the drop houses in Los Angeles, so we can
put the local end of the operation out of business,'' said John
Brechtel, assistant INS director for investigations.
   Twenty-six aliens were arrested at Los Angeles International
Airport and 11 were arrested at Ontario International Airport 30
miles east of here in sweeps staged late Saturday and early Sunday,
according to an INS official.

<HEAD>Murder Charge Dropped Because Police Can't Produce Informant</HEAD>

   The man that detectives most want to bring to trial
for allegedly killing one of their colleagues is free because police
played fast and loose in getting a search warrant for a drug raid,
prosecutors say.
   Three detectives have been suspended while perjury charges are
considered.
   The case has focused attention on how easy, and tempting, it is
for police officers to obtain search warrants by citing fictitious
informants.
   Defense lawyers contend the practice, though illegal, is routine
in Boston and many other cities across the nation. But prosecutors
and police say if the use of confidential informants is curbed, they
will lose a key weapon in the war against drugs.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who has spent 22 years on the U.S.
District Court bench in New York City, said judges have little
choice but to trust police when they say they have an informant.
   ``Assuming that they were trying to trick me, how would I know
it?'' Weinstein said. ``The informant isn't subject to cross
examination, I don't even see the informant. I have to rely on the
U.S. attorney and the law enforcement agencies. If they wanted to
deceive me, it would be easy to do so.''
   In the Boston case, a Superior Court judge dismissed all charges
against Albert Lewin two weeks ago after police failed to produce a
mysterious informant _ identified only as John _ who supposedly
tipped them off to a cocaine dealer in the city's Dorchester section.
   On Feb. 17, 1988, as four detectives prepared to break into the
dealer's apartment, two shots were fired from inside the apartment.
One pierced the door and felled 36-year-old detective Sherman
Griffiths, a veteran member of the elite anti-drug task force.
   When the detectives finally knocked down the steel-reinforced
door,the apartment was empty. They rushed down a back staircase and
arrested Lewin and three other people on a lower floor.
   Prosecutors later dropped charges against the other three in
return for testimony against the 33-year-old Lewin, who maintains he
is innocent.
   From the outset, a weakness in the prosecution's case was that
Lewin did not match the informant's description of the crack dealer
who occupied the apartment and presumably fired the fatal shot.
   According to the affidavit police submitted to obtain the search
warrant, John said the dealer was Hispanic and about 5-foot-6. Lewin
is a 6-foot Jamaican.
   In pretrial hearings last month, Lewin's attorney said John was a
vital defense witness, and Judge Charles M. Grabau ordered
detectives Carlos Luna, Hugo R. Amate and Paul G. Schroeder to bring
him into court.
   When the detectives said they were unable to find the informant,
Grabau threw out the charges and lambasted the detectives, saying he
believed they had willfully disobeyed his orders.
   Last week, Francis O'Meara, assistant district attorney for
Suffolk County went back into court to make an extraordinary
accusation. He said the detectives had lied to him and the court
about the informant, either to strengthen the case against Lewin or
to protect the search warrant.
   And O'Meara contended the charges against Lewin should not be
dropped. He said the actual informant was not John _ who may or may
not exist _ but another man, identified in court as ``Y.''
   Lewin's lawyer maintains that ``Y'' is still not the right man.
   The judge is scheduled to consider reinstating the charges this
week. In the interim, the state attorney general is considering
perjury charges against the suspended detectives.
   None of the three officers could be reached for comment. One is
on vacation in South America and the other two did not respond to
repeated messages asking them to call.
   Deputy Superintendent James W. Wood, supervisor of the three, has
repeatedly said he accepts full responsibility for the actions of
the team.

<HEAD>Teen Scholarship Winner Awaits Trial for Husband's Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eva Garcia was praised as a model student last
December whose perserverance over inner-city hardship won her a free
college education that was to make her a teacher.
   But police allege the 18-year-old senior lived a secret life that
came to a head just weeks before when she secretly married and then
conspired to murder a man more than 20 years her elder.
   ``She seemed to be the kind of kid we were meant to help,'' said
Frank Raispis, a fellow of the Foundation for Excellence in
Teaching, a private Chicago institution that awarded Ms. Garcia and
14 other teen-agers college scholarships.
   ``She was overcoming all this adversity and putting on a bright
face. ... We said if we could only help one kid, this has to be the
one.''
   Now, Ms. Garcia is in Cook County Jail, facing charges of
conspiracy and murder and a possible death sentence.
   The young woman burst into tears last November when she learned
she was named one of the Academy of Educators Scholars, whose
members get a free college education, good summer jobs and up to
$10,000 after college in exchange for returning to teach in
inner-city schools.
   But police suspect they were tears of frustration over her secret
marriage just days earlier to 41-year-old Louie Weber. Police say
Ms. Garcia feared her marriage was an impossible hurdle to her
future as a scholarship student and teacher. They say Ms. Garcia
also had a 19-year-old boyfriend in Mexico she was considering
marrying.
   Police say the young woman and her husband, with whom she had
never lived, went to dinner on Nov. 26. Then, investigators believe,
she suggested a walk in a park on Chicago's South Side.
   Minutes later, they say, two men appeared. One of them raised a
handgun, fired once and killed Weber with a shot in the head, police
say.
   Paul Rutherford, 18, and Richard Rubalcava, 25, have been charged
with conspiracy and murder along with Ms. Garcia. Police allege that
the young woman offered Rutherford $1,000 to kill Weber and that
Rutherford hired Rubalcava as the triggerman.
   ``These people looked like they were in love,'' said Jerry
Colhane, 37, a friend of Weber's. ``I'll never figure it out. I
can't see a person being married this short amount of time and this
happening. I mean, there's always divorce. This is America.''
   Despite her secret marriage, Ms. Garcia had continued to live at
home with her strict great-aunt and great-uncle. Her mother as a
teen-ager handed Eva over to the relatives to raise, friends say.
She never met her father.
   Ms. Garcia always did well in school, getting mostly A's and B's,
despite her fractured home life.
   Then she met Weber, a self-employed truck driver, in November
1987. In order to carry on the secret romance, Ms. Garcia began to
skip classes, missing 50 days in one semester.
   To explain her absences, Ms. Garcia told one teacher her father
had been murdered in Cuba and she had flown to Miami for the burial,
and that her great-aunt later died of an illness so she had to stay
home to care for her great-uncle.
   The teacher later cited to the scholarship committee these family
deaths as examples of the adversity Ms. Garcia had to overcome.
   Ms. Garcia gave up her scholarship after her arrest Jan. 21.

<HEAD>Group To Import Unapproved Drugs For AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS patient-advocacy group plans to import
prescription drugs that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for treatment of AIDS patients, according to a
report published today.
   The New York-based People with AIDS Health Group plans to get the
drugs from sympathetic doctors in England, West Germany, France and
Japan, according to the report in The New York Times.
   The group will then distribute the drugs to any U.S. patient with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome who has a note or a prescription
for the drug from a doctor in this country, the newspaper said.
Patients' costs would be limited to the cost of the drug.
   Derek Hodel, executive director of People with AIDS, estimated
that hundreds of thousands of AIDS patients may take advantage of
the program.
   Last year, the FDA announced a policy that allows people with
life-threatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved
drugs. Until now, those taking advantage of the policy had to find
doctors in other countries to prescribe the drugs or else import
only over-the-counter remedies, the Times said.
   Dr. Frank Young, commissioner of the FDA, told the Times he could
not say whether the FDA would try to stop the People with AIDS
effort.
   AIDS patient advocates have criticized the FDA, saying it has
been overly cautious about approving AIDS drugs. AIDS patients say
they do not have time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed
controversial by the FDA, but the federal agency says it has a
responsibility to protect Americans from drugs that could be useless
or harmful.
   The health group said the drug that is most important to them is
fluconazole, a product of Pfizer Inc. that is used to treat
cryptococcal meningitis afflicting about 10 percent to 15 percent of
AIDS patients. The company is seeking FDA approval of the drug,
which has been approved for sale in England, France, Denmark and
Ireland.

   A Namibian soldier wounded eight
students after the youths barred him from entering a girls' high
school dormitory, police said today.
   Police spokesman Kirie du Rand said police were seeking Robert
Siungu, a member of the South African-led territorial army, after
Friday night's incident at a high school in Rundu, a town 440 miles
north of Windhoek on the Angolan border.
   Julius Hambduga, a student, said the soldier spent several hours
Friday night trying to enter the girls' dormitory but was forced
away by a group of male students.
   The soldier returned Saturday morning and sprayed the outside
walls of the boys' dormitory with rounds from his semi-automatic
rifle, he said.
   Du Rand said the wounded students, males aged 15 to 21, suffered
slight injuries and had been discharged from the hospital.

<HEAD>Sudanese War Refugees Flee Into Uganda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 Sudanese refugees have
crossed into Uganda recently, driven south by fierce fighting
between rebel and government troops, a United Nations official said
today.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi of Sudan decided Sunday to bow to
pressure from politicians and army officers, and declared he will
form a new government to negotiate an end to the nearly 6-year-old
war in the south.
   William Young, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in Uganda,
said that by Sunday 17,000 refugees had arrived at Bibia and another
6,000 at Kitgum, communities just south of the Ugandan border.
   ``The refugees, who include a small number of soldiers, abandoned
the border town of Nimule on Friday after learning that (John)
Garang's forces were about to storm the town,'' Young said.
   Garang is leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,
which wants greater autonomy for southern Sudan's Christians and
animists. They are a majority in the south but are far outnumbered
by the dominant Moslems of the north who control the government and
economy.
   The clandestine rebel radio Saturday said its fighters overran
Nimule Friday. Early last week, the rebels appealed to government
troops in Nimule and other southern towns to evacuate or join the
rebels.
   Nimule straddles the Ugandan border and controls the main road
leading north to Juba, besieged capital of the southernmost Sudanese
province of Equatoria.
   Last week, the U.N. refugees' organization completed evacuating
3,000 Sudanese refugees who had been camping at Kitgum since
October. The earlier arrivals were transferred to Adjumani, 300
miles northwest of Kampala, because of fighting between Ugandan
rebels and government forces.
   Young said his organization is meeting Ugandan officials this
week to determine whether the new arrivals also should be
transferred to a safer location.
   Sudanese soldiers among the new refugees were taken to a separate
camp, he said. He declined to say how many military personnel were
among the refugees.
   Young said the new refugees will need 10 tons of food a day. The
French government has chartered a plane to bring in food, he said.

   Kitty Dukakis is ``raring to go''
following four weeks of treatment at a Rhode Island alcoholism
center, according to a former aide.
   ``I understand that she'll be back in Boston later in the week,''
said Paul Costello, press aide to Mrs. Dukakis during the the
presidential campaign of her husband, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, entered Edgehill Newport in Newport, R.I., on
Feb. 5 because of excessive drinking following the governor's failed
presidential bid, Dukakis said Feb. 6. Most patients undergo a
28-day rehabilitation program sometimes followed by three days of
observation on the premises.
   ``She's in good physical shape, in terrific spirits and she's
raring to go,'' Costello, who is now a public relations executive in
Washington, told the Boston Sunday Herald.
   Costello said Mrs. Dukakis will probably share her efforts
against alcoholism with the public because ``she likes to use her
life as a way to help others.''
   ``And I think she'll do that, through her book or in her speaking
engagements, which she'll resume rather rapidly,'' he said.
   Costello said the governor has talked with his wife every night
during her stay at Edgehill. He has visited her every weekend.
   Exhaustion, stress and the letdown of the campaign loss caused
Mrs. Dukakis' underlying chemical dependency to flare into episodes
of excessive drinking, the governor has said.
   When she entered the Newport facility, Dukakis saluted her
courage and asked the public to respect her privacy and support her
recovery.
   S. Stephen Rosenfeld, the governor's chief of staff, declined to
comment Sunday on when Mrs. Dukakis is expected to return home,
saying the family wanted privacy.
   Edgehill, a 160-bed facility, was founded in 1980 by businessman
Chester Kirk, a recovering alcoholic. It serves more than 1,000
patients a year.

   American pop art sculptor Claes Oldenburg has
won the $100,000 Wolf Prize in the Arts, the Israel-based Wolf
Foundation announced today.
   It praised the artist's works ``for all the simplicity of their
subject matter ... (which) invite the observer to reflect on life's
processes.''
   Oldenburg, 60, explores the ironic and humorous aspects of common
objects that he grossly distorts in scale and shape. He is noted for
his soft sculptures of stuffed cloth and giant objects of such
everyday items as electrical plugs, baseball bats and clothespins.
   The Swedish-born sculptor became an American citizen in 1953.
   Israeli President Chaim Herzog will present the prize in the
Knesset, or parliament, in May, the foundation said.
   The Wolf prizes for medicine, chemistry, mathematics, physics,
agriculture and the arts were established by Ricardo Wolf, a
German-born chemist who emigrated to Cuba before World War II. He
was Cuban ambassador to Israel and lived here until his death in
1981.

   Soldiers fatally shot two Palestinians today,
and 10 others were reported wounded in clashes today with
stone-throwing protesters during a general strike in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It was the highest daily death toll in nearly a month in the
15-month Palestinian uprising and brought the total number of
Palestinians killed in the rebellion to 390. Seventeen Israelis have
also died.
   A Palestinian security prisoner also died in a Gaza prison today
and police were investigating the circumstances, army radio
reported. Some Arab reports suggested the 32-year-old victim had
been ill.
   A hospital official said 19-year-old Ahmed Ramadan El Azani of
Gaza's Beit Lahiya village died at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City after
being struck in the chest by a bullet.
   Arab reports said the gunfire was in response to stone-throwing
riots in the area. Soldiers placed a curfew on Beit Lahiya's 7,000
residents after the violence.
   The second Palestinian killed today was Ibrahim Mohammed Al
Jaber, 24, from Salem village near the West Bank city of Nablus, who
was shot three times in the face during a search and arrest raid by
troops, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed two fatalities in Beit Lahiya in Gaza and
Salem and the wounding of one youth in the West Bank as he threw
rocks at an Israeli bus bringing Palestinian workers to Israel. The
other reports were being checked, the army said.
   The army also confirmed the Salem raid but said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   Ten Palestinians aged 15 to 30 were wounded in the legs during
stoning riots that erupted in Salem and four other places in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Arab reports said.
   The clashes came as Palestinians shut shops, stayed home from
jobs and halted public transportation in a strike called by
underground leaders of the Palestinian revolt.
   A small bomb exploded at a soldiers' post north of Tel Aviv,
Israel radio reported. No one was injured and 20 Arabs in the area
were detained for questioning, the radio said.
   The Israeli army said it freed 130 Palestinian detainees from
Ketziot prison in southern Israel in honor of this week's Moslem
Holiday, Isra Al Meraj. The day marks prophet Mohammed's holy
pilgrimage from Mecca to Jerusalem, where Moslems believe he
ascended to heaven.
   Earlier reports said 150 detainees would be freed.
   In Tel Aviv on Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir defiantly
rejected a U.S. claim that Jewish settlements constructed in the
occupied lands are an obstacle to Middle East peace.
   In a speech to colleagues in his right-wing Likud bloc, Shamir
also denounced Israeli activists of the Peace Now movement for
meeting with Palestinians in the occupied territories. Shamir
accused the activists of sabotaging Israel's political and security
interests.
   Peace Now activist Zeev Sternhell today told army radio that
Shamir's remarks were ``vulgar defamation.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away an appeal
by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to
crack downn on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by
smokestacks in other states.
   The court, without comment, refused to order the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to take steps to limit interstate
air pollution.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said last July 22 that the
EPA acted properly in dismissing bids by Pennsylvania and Maine
officials to force federal action against pollution originating in
other states.
   The appeals court ordered the federal agency to restudy a
petition by New York officials in light of newly available data.
   Officials from Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Jersey
joined those from Maine and Pennsylvania in asking the Supreme Court
to overturn the appeals court ruling. New York officials did not
join the appeal to the high court.
   The case acted on today stems from petitions filed with the EPA
in 1980 and 1981 by Maine, New York and Pennsylvania claiming that
soot, smoke and sulfur dioxide were blowing in from hundreds of
miles away.
   They argued that pollutants from coal-burning utility plants and
factories in seven other states made it impossible for them to meet
federal air quality standards.
   The seven states complained about are Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.
   The northeastern states said federal law requires the EPA to
force the other states to revise their air pollution control plans.
   Federal clean air laws give the EPA broad power to enforce state
air quality programs. If a state's program is inadequate, federal
officials can order industries to clean up or face stiff fines or
closing down operations.
   But in the case acted on today, EPA officials said there was
insufficient evidence to prove that air pollution in the Northeast
originated hundreds of miles away. The agency also argued that
federal law is not designed to cover such long-range pollution.
   The appeals court here gave deference to the agency's expertise.
   ``This court is being asked to second-guess the scientific
judgments of the EPA,'' the appeals court said. ``We cannot say that
the EPA's assessment of the scientific evidence was unreasonable.''
   The case is Maine vs. EPA, 88-684.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left unresolved whether
public school students enjoy any constitutional protection against
paddling or other corporal punishment by teachers and administrators.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Texas law that allows
the use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force,
in the state's public schools.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas law in
dismissing a lawsuit filed in behalf of two kindergarten girls
paddled severely for ``snickering.''
   Other federal appeals courts have made it easier to win such
suits. For example, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled
in a New Mexico case that, ``at some degree of excessiveness or
cruelty,'' such punishment violates constitutional rights.
   The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary
measures involving physical force never can amount to the ``cruel
and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth
Amendment.
   The decision barred students from suing teachers and school
administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment
violations, but left them free to sue in state courts under state
laws.
   In the 1977 decision, however, the court said it was leaving
undecided whether corporal punishment ever may violate ``substantive
rights under the (14th Amendment's) due process clause.''
   The case acted on today came from Jacksonville, Texas, where on
May 6, 1987, Crystal Cunningham, 5, and Ashley Johnson, 6, were
paddled twice _ once by their school principal and once by their
teacher.
   Mary Sue Bruno, the principal at Westside Kindergarten School,
saw the two girls snickering in the hall, and gave each child two
swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle.
   When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher Rosa Cook saw
them still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gave
each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle.
   Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in their
behalf said the reason for their absence was ``severe pain'' and
fear over returning to school.
   According to court documents, both girls were taken to a child
welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling
bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse.
   The federal lawsuit, seeking monetary damages, alleged that Ms.
Bruno, Ms. Cook and other school officials violated the girls'
constitutional rights with conduct ``excessive, brutal,
disproportionate to the circumstances (and) shocking to the
conscience.''
   The suit said the paddlings violated the girls' due-process and
equal-protection rights.
   A federal trial judge threw out the suit, relying on past 5th
Circuit court rulings that corporal punishment generally does not
violate any constitutional rights.
   The 5th Circuit upheld the dismissal last Oct. 26.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the girls cited
Department of Education studies indicating that 30,000 American
schoolchildren are physically injured each year ``because of the
infliction of corporal punishment to a degree that requires medical
treatment.''
   The appeal said those studies estimate at ``at least 100,000
children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive
and inappropriate school punishment each year.''
   The girls' appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court''
brief submitted jointly by the American Medical Association and the
National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse.
   The case is O'Connor vs. Beavers, 88-1181.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Inmate Rights on Anti-Psychotic Drugs in Washington
State Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether prison inmates are entitled to a court hearing and other
safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Washington state
officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the
professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors.
   The Washington Supreme Court ruled last July that convicted
robber Walter Harper must be given a court hearing before he is
forced to take anti-psychotic drugs.
   The state court also said that prison officials must show a
compelling state interest for giving Harper the medication, and show
the drugs will be effective.
   The state's compelling interest can be demonstrated by a need to
preserve life, to protect other individuals who might be harmed by
Harper, to prevent his suicide and to maintain ``the ethical
integrity of the medical profession,'' the state court said.
   Harper was imprisoned in 1976, and for the next four years was
incarcerated primarily in a mental health unit where he agreed to
take anti-psychotic drugs.
   He was paroled in 1980 on condition he agree to receive
psychiatric treatment.
   His parole was revoked after he attacked two nurses at Saint
Cabrini Hospital in Seattle.
   Back in prison, Harper was placed in a unit for offenders with
serious behavioral or mental disorders. He agreed to take
anti-psychotic drugs until November 1982, when he refused to take
the medication any longer.
   A committee of prison officials decided Harper should be given
the drugs against his will, and that decision was upheld by the
prison superintendent.
   Harper filed a civil rights suit in 1985, seeking to block
officials from giving him the medication and to win monetary damages
for violations of his rights.
   A state judge dismissed the suit. But the state Supreme Court
revived it, ruling that ``competent adults have a right to determine
what shall be done to their bodies.''
   The state court said treatment with anti-psychotic drugs is no
less intrusive than electro-shock therapy.
   While the drugs are beneficial to acutely ill patients, they also
can have serious side effects _ ranging from involuntary spasms to
permanent brain damage, the state court said.
   It noted that a court hearing will ensure the prisoner the right
to be represented by a lawyer, to cross-examine witnesses and to
examine the state's files. Such a hearing also will guarantee other
due-process protections, the state court said.
   State officials said the state court's ruling improperly will
``insert the state and federal judicial systems into medical and
institutional administrative decisions.''
   The case is Washington vs. Harper, 88-599.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Demonstration in Latvia; 30 Arrests Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police today broke up a demonstration
for greater access to state-run media in the Baltic capital of Riga,
tearing down banners and arresting 30 people, an activist said.
   Dozens of protesters gathered in front of Communist Party Central
Committee headquarters in Riga to protest restrictions on Latvian
state television, said Boris Sokolov, a member of the Democratic
Union, an independent political party.
   ``The Central Committee had spoken out against allowing the free
access of informal groups to the television,'' Sokolov said,
speaking in a telephone interview from Riga.
   Access to television is considered especially important because
of the nationwide campaign before March 26 elections to the Council
of People's Deputies, a new national assembly that is to chose the
country's president and Supreme Soviet parliament.
   One group, the Latvian People's Front, is seeking greater
autonomy for the republic. Some of its members are candidates in the
election, and the group is supporting other candidates.
   Sokolov said the Central Committee, the Latvian Communist Party's
policy-making body, was scheduled to meet today to discuss who
should be allowed to go on television.
   He said demonstrators had assembled outside party headquarters
for a half hour before ``several hundred officers and men from the
police went into the crowd. They ripped down banners and confiscated
cameras. At least 30 people were arrested.''
   Banners destroyed by police called for ``freedom of the press''
and ``a press without censorship,'' he said.
   The protesters screamed at police that they were violating the
Soviet Constitution by breaking up a legal demonstration, Sokolov
said.
   He said the police's action ``was unprecedented in recent
months.''
   In January, the Latvian Communist Party chief, Janis Vagris,
expressed alarm over rising tension in the republic, saying even the
party was feeling the effects of ``ethnic stratification.''
   Of Latvia's 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are Latvians, and
33 percent ethnic Russians.
   On Jan. 7, a group was formed to challenge the Latvian People's
Front. Latvian activists and nationalists said the new group was
Russian-dominated.
   Latvia and the other Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia
were absorbed by the Soviet Union in 1940, one year after the
Hitler-Stalin pact consigned the area to the Kremlin's sphere of
influence.
   Political ferment has increased in the Baltic states under the
liberalized atmosphere fostered by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Some residents say they want to regain their homelands' independence.

<TEXT>
   Authorities said today at least 130 people
died and 151 were critically ill after hundreds of laborers drank an
illegal home-made liquor in the only Indian state where the sale of
alcohol is banned.
   Doctors said hospitals were unable to cope with the rush of
victims, and that there was little chance the most seriously injured
of the 251 hospitalized victims would survive.At least 25 people
were blinded by the tainted brew.
   The local government announced police arrested three people who
supplied the liquor. Several policemen were suspended for failing to
avert the tragedy, the government said.
   Baroda is a major industrial center in Gujarat, the only Indian
state where it is illegal to sell alcohol. The city, 560 miles
southwest of New Delhi, is home to 2.5 million people.
   According to the United News of India, the son of one supplier
and the son of a prominent local politician were among those killed
by the moonshine.
   The boot-leg liquor is normally a mixture of ethyl alcohol, alum
and natured spirits. But this time, industrial methyl alcohol was
mixed to the brew known locally as ``lattha,'' which is sold in
plastic sacks for the equivalent of 10 cents. Methyl alcohol
paralyzes the central nervous system.
   Most survivors were too ill to speak, but one told the Press
Trust of India news agency the only difference he noticed was that
the liquor was ``sweeter than normal.''
   Press Trust said many of the victims became dizzy and complained
of nausea and stomach aches before losing consciousness.
   A doctor at the state-run Sir Siyaji General Hospital, which was
treating most of the victims, said conditions at the facility were
precarious, with groaning victims crowded against each other on the
floor, on stretchers, and occasionally three to a bed.
   ``We do not have enough bottles of glucose to even administer
first aid to the victims,'' the doctor said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``There are no free stretchers to bring in more
patients, because people are already sleeping on them.''
   Gujarat's chief minister, Amarsinh Chaudhary, ordered an
investigation and promised action against the police officials who
failed to avert the disaster, the Times of India reported.
   The newspaper said most of the victims were poor laborers who
bought the liquor Saturday morning after receiving their monthly
wages. The first deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it
said.
   As news of the deaths emerged, police fanned out across Baroda
with loudspeakers blaring warnings about the liquor.
   About 300 people have died in seven illicit liquor cases in
Gujarat during the last decade, United News said. Two of the
previous cases occurred in Baroda, with others reported in Ahmedabad
and Surat.

<HEAD>Court Will Review Housing Desegregation Fines Imposed Against Yonkers
Councilmen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review the
stiff fines imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y., councilmen for
defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation
plan.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the judge
exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines.
   The case attracted national attention last summer as the defiant
councilmen were threatened with jail as well as fines and the city
faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey U.S. District Judge
Leonard Sand's order.
   Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council
voted last Sept. 10 to comply with Sand's order to build 1,000
low-cost homes to desegregate middle-class areas of the city.
   But Yonkers, located just north of New York City, had to pay
$819,000 in fines. Each of the four councilmen was ordered to pay
$3,500 for being in contempt of a desegregation order issued the
previous Aug. 2.
   The case stemmed from a Justice Department lawsuit begun in the
Carter administration's waning days in 1980.
   Sand in 1985 ruled that Yonkers officials intentionally and
unlawfully promoted racial segregation through the city's housing
and school policies.
   He ordered the city to desegregate the school system and build
subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city.
   City officials agreed in January 1988 to build 200 units and make
plans for 600 more. They later sought to back out of the agreement.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August said Sand acted
properly in holding the city and the four councilmen in contempt
after the council voted 4-3 against a package of financial
incentives designed to attract development of 800 low- and
moderate-income homes.
   Sand imposed fines against the city starting at $100 a day and
doubling daily until officials lived up to their desegregation The
appeals court put a cap of $1 million a day on the fines, and upheld
the judge's $500-a-day fine for each councilman.
   The councilmen's jail terms were blocked temporarily by a Supreme
Court order last September, and the threat of imprisonment was
lifted after the council relented and adopted the desegregation plan.
   The four councilmen are Nicholas V. Longo, Edward J. Fagan Jr.,
Peter Chema and Vice Mayor Henry Spallone.
   The appeals court said the four are not protected by legislative
immunity against the contempt order and fines because the city
government previously consented to abide by a court-approved
agreement to desegregate.
   ``No litigant, least of all public officials sworn to uphold the
Constitution of the United States, may be permitted to avoid
compliance with solemn commitments they have made in a consent
judgment entered by a federal district court to remedy
constitutional violations,'' the appeals court said.
   The 2nd Circuit court also rejected arguments that the
free-speech rights of the councilmen were violated. They ``remain
free to express their views on all aspects of housing in Yonkers''
but not to violate lawful court orders, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also turned back the city's argument _ in
effect, one made in behalf of the city treasury and the taxpayers _
that it was powerless to compel the council members to adopt the
housing desegregation plan.
   ``The city cannot view itself as an entity separate from the city
council for purposes of complying with the consent judgment'' to
build the homes, the appeals court said.
   The justices today granted the appeals of the four councilmen but
rejected an appeal filed in behalf of the city.
   The cases are Spallone vs. U.S., 88-854; Yonkers vs. U.S.,
88-855; Chema vs. U.S., 88-856; and Longo vs. U.S., 88-870.

<HEAD>Court Bars Lawsuit Against Former New York Federal Prosecutor in
Shooting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred a lawsuit
against a former federal prosecutor who refused police protection to
a witness gunned down before she could testify.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed
in New York City along with three CBS employees who tried to come to
her aid.
   Former assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Schlessinger was sued by
the family of Lena Margaret Barbera.
   She was abducted from a rooftop parking area in Manhattan on
April 12, 1982, and later was shot to death along with the CBS
workers.
   Irwin Margolies, president of Candor Diamond Corp., was convicted
of murder along with the hit man, Donald P. Nash.
   The government had been investigating alleged fraud in Margolies'
business. Ms. Barbera, an accountant there, agreed to cooperate in
the investigation.
   Prosecutors agreed to allow her to plead guilty to one count of
fraud and recommend she not serve any jail sentence.
   In December 1981, Schlessinger allegedly told Margolies' lawyer,
Henry Ostericher, that Barbera and another unnamed woman working at
Candor were cooperating with the government.
   Court papers suggested Schlessinger was trying to put pressure on
Margolies to confess to fraud.
   Soon after the Schlessinger-Ostericher conversation, another
former Candor employee, Jenny Soo Chin, disappeared. Ms. Chin, a
close friend of Ms. Barbera, apparently was suspected by Margolies
of being the other witness cooperating with prosecutors.
   Ms. Chin's body never was found but there was testimony that Nash
displayed a photograph of her corpse to Margolies as proof he had
killed her.
   Ms. Barbera then requested police protection for herself for the
second time, and Schlessinger again denied it.
   The suit against Schlessinger accused him of violating her rights
by negligetly and recklessly denying her protection that could have
saved her life.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the suit in
December 1987.
   The appeals court said prosecutors have qualified immunity from
suit when their conduct does not violate clearly established rights
of individuals.
   ``We cannot say that it was clearly established that the
government had created or assumed a special relationship with
Barbera,'' the appeals court said. ``It would have been speculative
at best to conclude that Barbera was entitled to police protection
or that the government was otherwise obliged to safeguard her from
those against whom she was going to testify.''
   Just last month, the Supreme Court ruled in a Wisconsin case that
the government has no constitutional duty to protect individuals
from private violence or abuse.
   The New York case is Barbera vs. Schlessinger, 87-2034.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Libel Award Against Six Newspapers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $90,000
libel award won against six American newspapers serving
Korean-American readers.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the
newspapers should not have been legally liable for accurately
reporting an announcement made by a South Korean government agency.
   At issue was the scope of the legal immunity a news organization
enjoys when accurately and fairly reporting about government reports
or public proceedings despite their defamatory nature.
   In the case acted on today, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the so-called fair report privilege does not apply to
reporting about acts by foreign governments.
   Two intelligence agencies of the South Korean government issued a
62-page ``press release'' on Sept. 9, 1985, announcing the
disruption of two North Korean spy rings operating in the United
States and West Germany.
   The government agencies said one of the spy rings was run by
students at Western Illinois University, and identified Chang-Sin
Lee as one North Korean agent.
   Lee, who emigrated to this country from South Korea in 1975 and
graduated from Western Illinois in 1984, now lives in New York City.
He recently became a U.S. citizen.
   Lee sued six newspapers and a Virginia television station in
federal court in Virginia, alleging that their reports libeled him
by reiterating the South Korean government's announcement.
   A federal trial judge threw out the suit, noting that Virginia
law includes a fair report privilege. The judge said that Lee could
not win his libel suit because he could not prove the newspapers and
television station acted with malice.
   The 4th Circuit court reinstated Lee's suit last June 20, ruling
that the fair report privilege should not have been invoked.
   The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, said the privilege never should
apply to a news organization's reporting on information received
from foreign governments.
   ``Because we find that foreign governments are not necessarily
more reliable than domestic non-official sources, we are not willing
to enlarge the scope of the (fair report) privilege to include
information from such governments,'' the appeals court said.
   It added, ``Some countries may take advantage of our liberal
First Amendment rights in order maliciously to defame or, carelessly
and without adequate inquiry, excoriate private parties.''
   The ruling meant Lee could win his libel suit against the news
organizations by proving the government report about him was false
and made negligently.
   The ruling also cleared the way for a libel trial, in which a
jury earlier this year awarded a total of $90,000 against the six
newspapers. The television station, WNVC-TV, was found not to have
libeled Lee.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the six newspapers
argued that the fair report privilege for reporting on foreign
goverments sometimes should be available.
   The newspapers are The Korea Herald, The Dong-A Iblo, Joong-Ang
Ilbo, The Chosun Ilbo, The Korea Times and The Sae Gae Shinbo.
   The case is The Dong-A Ilbo v. Lee, 88-1145.

<HEAD>Court Orders More Hearings in Pennsylvania Sexual Abuse Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered more hearings
in the case of three Pennsylvania school officials sued by a former
student who says she was sexually abused by her high school band
instructor.
   The justices said a federal appeals court should review its
ruling that the school officials sued by Kathleen Stoneking, a
former student at Bradford Area High School, are not entitled to
qualified legal immunity.
   The justices said the appeals court ruling should be restudied in
light of their Feb. 22 decision in a Wisconsin case that government
has no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private abuse
or violence.
   Whether that decision controls the Pennsylvania case is not
clear, however, since the lawsuit alleges that a state employee _
not a private citizen _ administered the abuse.
   Ms. Stoneking was graduated from high school in 1983. Her 1987
lawsuit contends that school principal Frederick Smith, assistant
principal Richard Miller and school district superintendent
Frederick Shuey violated her rights by failing to protect her.
   The suit alleges that beginning in Ms. Stoneking's sophomore
year, band instructor Edward Wright sexually harassed and abused
her, and forced her to engage in various sex acts with him.
   The suit alleges that the school officials named as defendants
knew of complaints against Wright involving other female students.
It states that the school officials either knew or recklessly failed
to discover that Wright was sexually abusing female band members.
   Wright was suspended in 1986, and later resigned. He pleaded
guilty to criminal charges, including indecent assault, that same
year.
   The three officials sued by Ms. Stoneking sought to have the case
thrown out before reaching a trial. They said they were entitled to
qualified immunity _ a legal doctrine shielding public officials
from liability when their conduct ``does not violate clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable
person would have known.''
   A federal judge refused to throw out the case, and that ruling
was upheld on a 2-1 vote by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last Sept. 12.
   The school officials then sought help from the Supreme Court.
   The case is Smith vs. Stoneking, 88-802.

   Police opened fire today on Tibetan
pro-independence protesters and reportedly killed at least four in
the second day of violence in the Tibetan capital, foreign travelers
said.
   The sound of automatic weapons fire and exploding tear gas
canisters could be heard over the telephone late in the night.
   The reports from Lhasa were not immediately confirmed by official
media, which reported 11 people killed in street clashes and more
than 100 wounded in the Tibetan capital Sunday. Efforts to reach
government officials in Lhasa were unsuccessful.
   An American traveler said Tibetans put Sunday's death toll at
closer to 30, but that could not be confirmed.
   The fighting was the fourth violent clash between Tibetans and
Chinese in 18 months, and occurred on the first anniversary Sunday
of one of the previous clashes.
   Tibet remains largely closed to journalists and the only
independent reports came from travelers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity for fear of police reprisals.
   Police stationed on rooftops in Lhasa's main square fired down
into crowds of Tibetans at about 5 p.m., a traveler from New Orleans
said in a telephone interview.
   He said he arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and
was told by Tibetans that at least two people were killed.
   Other travelers confirmed hearing gunshots and seeing police on
the roof.
   Another American, also speaking on condition of anonymity for
fear of police reprisal, said he saw police open fire several hours
later on about 40 Tibetans who were marching toward the main square.
   He said he did not see marchers fall, but said Tibetans told him
two were killed.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said earlier that one
policeman and 10 Tibetans were killed Sunday in clashes in Lhasa,
while 40 police and more than 60 Tibetans were injured.
   Earlier today, foreign travelers in Lhasa said police showed
restraint as thousands of Tibetans marched through the streets
chanting pro-independence slogans and hurling goods looted from
Chinese-owned stores onto bonfires.
   Protesters today stoned any Chinese who tried to bicycle through
the area and dragged some from their bikes, the witnesses said.
   At about 7 p.m., hundreds of police moved from the Chinese sector
into the Tibetan part of Lhasa on foot and in jeeps, firing
occasionally, the witnesses said.
   About 40 stone-throwing protesters shouting ``Free Tibet!''
marched toward the city's central market soon afterward and were met
by police gunfire, said one American witness.
   The American, coughing from tear gas, said he saw about 10 police
beating three Tibetans nearby.
   Sunday's protest was begun by Buddhist monks and nuns who
apparently were marking the anniversary of a daylong battle in which
24 people were killed. At least 40 were killed in the earlier
clashes in the remote southern region.
   They paraded illegally through the market and were joined by
several hundred people, who stoned a nearby police station.
   A Swedish traveler, who gave his name only as Pontus, said he ran
to the roof of the Jokhang Temple for a better view.
   ``There were six people to the left of us taking pictures of the
crowd ... Then they dropped their cameras and started firing with
handguns into the crowd,'' Pontus said. He said no warning was given.
   He said he and four companions, some of whom took pictures of the
shooting, had their cameras and passports confiscated.
   At about 3 p.m., a group of Tibetan youths carrying the banned
pre-Communist Tibetan flag began north of the market, said travelers
who watched from a hotel on the street.
   Hundreds of Tibetans joined them, but police fired tear gas and
bullets, the travelers said.
   Xinhua said the protesters fired at police, and that police
``were forced to fire as no other means could stop the rioters.'' It
did not make clear which side began shooting first.
   However, none of the nearly one dozen travelers interviewed
reported seeing Tibetans with guns.
   ``Old people were picking up stones to give to the young people
to throw,'' said one of the Americans.
   China claims its sovereignty over Tibet dates to the 13th century.
   However, many Tibetans dispute the claim and demand independence
under their former spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama. He
fled to exile in India during a failed uprising in 1959, nine years
after the region came under communist control.

<TEXT>
   A judge who gave a rapist a
lenient sentence because he said he didn't want to keep him from his
goal of becoming a police officer has provoked outrage in this
normally peaceful Upper Peninsula community.
   Two weeks ago, Visiting Alger County Circuit Judge Charles Stark
set aside his original verdict in the rape case and instead
convicted David Caballero under a youthful offenders act for
attacking a fellow college student.
   The move spared Caballero jail time. He was ordered to spend
three years on probation and pay $975 in court costs and $200
compensation to the victim. If he complies with the terms, his
record will be expunged. His court file has been suppressed.
   Stark said he took the action partly because Caballero, 21, was a
criminal justice major and the conviction would have prevented him
from achieving his goal of becoming a police officer.
   The judge issued the original rape conviction Jan. 10, after a
bench trial. If the judge had not revised it, Caballero would have
faced a minimum five-year prison sentence for two counts of
first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
   Chippewa County Prosecutor Patrick Shannon said he will appeal
the sentence.
   Stark's action has prompted more irate calls to the Sault Ste.
Marie Evening News editorial offices than any story in recent
memory, said the newspaper's editor, Ken Fazzari.
   ``I think they would lynch the judge if they had him right
here,'' Fazzari said.
   The victim was hospitalized for emotional stress after the
incident and transferred from Lake Superior State University to a
college out of state. She said she was devastated by the lenient
sentence.
   The state Holmes Youthful Trainee Act allows for special
treatment of a defendant whose crime occurred before age 20.
   Stark convicted Caballero Jan. 10 of two counts of rape in the
Dec. 18, 1987, attack. Stark said he couldn't convince prosecutors
to consider a lesser charge that would have allowed for reduced jail
time. He invoked the youthful offenders act even though Caballero
already was 20 years old when the rape occurred.
   ``This was a very unhappy choice for us,'' the judge said.
   Caballero has left Lake Superior State and is studying criminal
justice at the University of Michigan at Dearborn, said his
attorney, David Goldenberg.
   The victim said Caballer followed her around at a small campus
party and insisted on walking her back to her dormitory room at 3
a.m.
   When they arrived, Caballero placed himself ``so that as soon as
I unlocked and opened the door, he could get in.''
   ``I said, `I appreciate your walking me back here, but you're not
allowed in here,''' the Detroit Free Press quoted her as saying.
Caballero then followed her into the room, forced her onto her bed
and tore off her clothing, she said.

   City officials hope to close a pornographic movie
house and six other theaters along a sleazy strip of West 42nd
Street around the corner from Times Square by buying out their
leases, according to a report published today.
   The conversion is part of the long-delayed plan by the city and
state to clean up the crime-ridden block with office towers, arts
facilities and a merchandise mart.
   New York Newsday said it learned that the board of the Public
Development Corp. is scheduled to vote March 22 on a tentative
agreement in which the city would pay about $2 million for leases on
the theaters.
   The city had planned to seek control of the property through
condemnation proceedings because the leases have 71 years to run.
But officials said that by buying out the leases, the city will get
control of the theaters sooner and be able to convert them to such
uses as drama and dance rehearsal halls.

<HEAD>Court Orders Pa. Beating Death Award Reconsidered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered a federal
appeals court to consider freeing a Pennsylvania city and one of its
police officers from paying a $66,000 award over a 1981 beating
death.
   The justices said the appeals court should restudy the case in
light of their Feb. 22 decision in a Wisconsin case.
   In that ruling, the high court said government officials have no
constitutional duty to protect individuals from private violence or
abuse.
   In the Pennsylvania case, a federal jury awarded $66,000 to Mamie
Horton, whose son Douglas Powdrill was beaten to death at the Cash
Club in New Kensington, Pa., on Nov. 10, 1981.
   The jury found that the city and Police Sergeant William Dlubak
violated Powdrill's right by failing to protect him.
   The Cash Club, a private social club, was managed by Charles
``Pope'' Flenory, a retired New Kensington policeman and a friend of
Dlubak.
   Flenory allegedly summoned Dlubak to the club to frighten
Powdrill into confessing that Powdrill stole some records from the
club's disc jockey.
   Powdrill tearfully pleaded with Dlubak to take him out of the
club but the officer refused, according to court records.
   Dlubak allegedly told Flenory, ``I guess you can take care of
this yourself.''
   After Dlubak left, Powdrill and Milton Patrick, who also was
suspected in the theft of the records, were beaten severely by club
employees. Patrick survived but Powdrill died.
   While the beatings were going on, friends of Powdrill arrived at
the club and then went to the police station a block away to ask for
help.
   The two officers who arrived at the club to investigate left
within a few minutes, after talking to Flenory.
   Mrs. Horton alleged that the police department for years had
failed to investigate beatings and other criminal activities at
Flenory's club.
   She sued the city and Dlubak under a federal civil rights law,
and the jury awarded $65,899 to Mrs. Horton.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the award
last August, noted that New Kensington had a ``hands-off'' policy
toward complaints of drunkenness at the city's private clubs.
   The policy said, ``When a call is received from a private club,
where the complaint is intoxication, the club should be tactfully
encouraged to handle its own problem. Such a club is not a public
place and arrests are invalid.''
   The 3rd Circuit court said Dlubak's handling of the case was in
line with that policy, and therefore the city can be held liable for
violating Powdrill's rights.
   The appeals court said city officials argued that ``although
Dlubak could reasonably foresee serious harm befalling Powdrill, he
owed Powdrill no duty. We disagree.''
   The Supreme Court has ruled that cities may be sued successfully
in such cases when someone's rights are violated in accord with a
municipal policy or custom.
   In the appeal acted on today, New Kensington officials said
Dlubak ``did not create or exacerbate the allegedly dangerous
condition. At most he can be charged with failing to exercise due
care in investigating a crime, the burglary at the Cash Club.''
   The city's appeal said there was no evidence Dlubak relied on the
so-called hands-off policy toward private clubs when he left the
matter in Flenory's control.
   In a criminal case stemming from the incident, Ronald DeVaughn, a
disc jockey at the club, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced
to 15 to 20 years in prison.
   The case is New Kensington vs. Horton, 88-816.

   The trial of a retired librarian will hinge
on whether a jury believes he was temporarily insane when he fired
on children, shoppers and police officers during a seven-hour siege,
killing six people.
   Lawyers for William B. Cruse, 61, planned to argue that alcohol
and psychiatric problems caused him to open fire with a
semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a revolver outside his home in
the coastal community of Palm Bay and at two adjacent shopping
centers.
   Jury selection began today, with Circuit Judge John Antoon
convening a pool of more than 100 people from which to select a
12-member jury and several alternates.
   The shooting spree April 23, 1987, led to 36 felony charges that
could send Cruse to the electric chair: six counts of first-degree
murder, 28 of attempted murder and two of kidnapping.
   The trial was moved 75 miles west to Bartow after a telephone
survey suggested that many people in central Florida's Brevard
County believed Cruse guilty.
   In a videotaped interview after his arrest, Cruse calmly told
police he believed neighbors, strangers and supermarket employees
were constantly spreading rumors that he was homosexual. He said he
had to stop it.
   ``I just wanted people to leave me alone,'' he said in the tape
shown publicly for the first time Thursday during a hearing. ``I had
to do something to stop them. I know I'm not queer.''
   But he added, ``I was drunk and crazy and I just don't remember
hurting anyone.''
   Seemingly meek, Cruse has a reputation as an arrogant demanding
prisoner at Brevard County Jail, where he has been held without bond
since his arrest.
   He quit eating at one point, claiming that jailers were trying to
poison him, and he had to be force-fed through a tube in his nose
for several days.
   Most of the time, he was kept in the jail's medical unit, not ill
or suicidal, but because officers feared he might be killed by other
inmates.
   ``He is not a very likable person,'' said Sheriff Jake Miller.
   A court-appointed attorney announced an insanity defense early
on, and lawyers for the public defender's office now handling the
case have been proceeding along those lines. Cruse was found
competent to stand trial.
   Under Florida law, a person can be found innocent by reason of
insanity if they are unaware of their actions or unable to
distinguish between right and wrong at the time.
   Investigators have said Cruse confessed shortly after his arrest.
In the videotape of his interrogation, Cruse acknowledged firing his
guns, which he seaid he took to the shopping centers to make people
stop talking about him.
   ``I just suppose I wanted to scare some people,'' he said. ``I
hope I made an impression on them.''
   Prosecutors say that after cooking dinner for his wife, Malahat,
who suffers from Parkinson's disease, he left their modest home and
fired on neighborhood children, wounding a teen-age boy playing
basketball.
   As investigators later reconstructed the crime, the gunman then
drove to the nearby Palm Bay Shopping Center and opened fire, first
with one weapon and then another, leaving the parking lot of a
supermarket littered with bodies.
   Three shoppers were killed and others wounded in the first
outburst.
   The gunman then drove across a busy highway to the Sabal Palm
Square shopping center, left his car and killed the first police
officer to arrive. He wounded a second policeman, reloaded his
revolver and fatally shot that officer between the eyes.
   The gunman then moved to the another supermarket, blasted out the
storefront glass and burst in, spraying the store with bullets as
some 100 customers and employees ran from the store or hid. One
customer was killed.
   He found a clerk hiding in a store restroom and took her hostage.
   Police closed in and tried to persuade him to surrender. After
the clerk escaped, police fired tear gas and stormed the store.
Cruse stumbled out and was captured as he tried to flee, authorities
said.

   A fierce winter storm spread up to 16 inches of snow and ice from
the Plains to the Northeast today, stranding travelers along
highways and in airports. Damaging tornadoes struck in Alabama and
Georgia.
   Schools were closed by snow in six states.
   The weekend snowstorm developed from a cold front out of the
Northwest and sent heavy snow to the southern Plains. Today, the
wintry weather stretched from eastern Oklahoma to southeastern New
York state.
   Severe thunderstorms along a cold front raked the Southeast with
rain and golf ball-size hail and produced tornadoes that destroyed a
Georgia motel and killed one person in a mobile home Sunday night.
   The bad weather also was blamed for 11 other deaths, including
two children killed in an house fire in Alabama ignited by lighting.
   Heavy rain caused flooding in Tennessee and West Virginia.
   The heaviest snowfall was in Oklahoma, where 16 inches fell in
the Pauls Valley area south of Oklahoma City. Pauls Valley police
chief Robert Nichols said the snow had ``drifted halfway up the
door.''
   Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow, the heaviest snow
since a 10-inch snowfall in 1958 and the fourth heaviest on record.
   The Missouri State Senate canceled today's session, motorists
were stranded and the roofs of four businesses collapsed in Noel,
near Springfield.
   Up to 11 inches fell in northern Texas and part of the roof of
the fire station at Bowie, 70 miles northwest of Fort Worth,
collapsed when wind piled the snow into drifts of up to 7 feet.
   Schools were closed today in parts of Arkansas, Indiana,
Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Ohio.
   Heavy rain caused flooding that forced the evacuation of more
than 300 people in Tennessee, including 200 Girl Scouts who were
moved from their camp in Cheatham County as a precaution, said
County Executive Vernon Knight.
   The rain also pushed streams out of their banks across southern
West Virginia today, closing roads in 10 counties, canceling school
in three and forcing some evacuations in Kanawha and Lincoln
counties, state and local officials said.
   Temperatures dipped to record lows early today in Port Arthur,
Texas, 24; Shreveport, La., 24, and Wichita Falls, Texas, 15.
   Blowing snow brought traffic to a crawl or made travel nearly
impossible in many areas.
   In Ardmore, Okla., 328 motorists spent the night in the National
Guard Armory and the city's civic auditorium after being unable to
travel any further on Interstate 35, said Civil Defense Director
James Mercer.
   ``I've got a lobby full of people wanting rooms, and I'm full and
it's blowing like crazy,'' said Mary Martin of the Green Country
Motel in Sallisaw, Okla. ``They can't hold their trucks and vehicles
on the highway.''
   Crews worked around the clock at Dallas-Forth Worth International
Airport, where snow cut Sunday's air traffic by about 50 percent.
Flights were being returned to normal today, said American Airlines
spokeswoman Mary O'Neil said.
   At St. Louis, Mo., Trans World Airlines canceled all of its
flights, incoming and outgoing, at Lambert airport this morning.
Since TWA represents more than 85 percent of the traffic at the
airport, the move virtually shut it down.
   Tulsa (Okla.) International Airport closed every 20 minutes so
plows could clear the main runway, said operations coordinator Roger
Blickensderfer.
   One of three tornadoes that touched down southwest of Atlanta
late Sunday heavily damaged about five houses, destroyed an Econo
Lodge motel in Newnan and damaged a Holiday Inn, the weather service.
   Coweta County Sheriff's Capt. Ross Henry said 23 people were
taken to hospitals, about 10 from the motel. Several people had
broken arms ``but we were very fortunate no one was killed,'' Henry
said today. He said one woman was trapped in the wreckage for a time
and had internal injuries.
   One man was killed when the storm overturned a mobile home near
Franklin, Ga., said Heard County Coroner Larry Hooks.
   The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said two motorists died in a
collision on the slippery Will Rogers Turnpike. Two men were found
dead outside in Oklahoma City and a woman was found dead in an
unheated house in Tulsa.
   Two women died in a collision on an icy road near Sandusky in
northern Ohio, the state Highway Patrol said. Two Arkansas deaths
were blamed ont the weather, one by exposure and one in a traffic
accident.
   Lighting was blamed for a Sunday fire that killed a 14-year-old
girl and her 7-year-old brother in Russellville, Ala. The children's
parents and two younger children escaped through a second-floor
window.
   Five tornadoes struck central Alabama, with most reports of
damage in Talladega County, including several mobile homes.

<HEAD>Veterans March On Art Institute To Protest Flag On Floor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state senator vowed to have a museum official
arrested and 600 people marched on the Art Institute of Chicago to
protest an exhibit featuring an American flag spread on the floor.
   Republican Sen. Walter Dudycz of Chicago said he will go to Cook
County Circuit Court on Tuesday to press charges of desecrating the
flag against Joyce Fernandez, director of exhibitions and events at
the art institute. County courts were closed today for a state
holiday.
   Veterans and relatives from Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and
Michigan sang patriotic songs and carried signs with such messages
as ``Freedom of speech does not include desecration of the American
flag'' during the demonstration Sunday.
   Officials closed the exhibit at the Art Institute's school early,
the second time in a week the controversy has closed it down.
   A man who tried to return to the exhibit a second time to pick up
the flag and refused to leave and a woman who would not come down
from a police barricade were arrested for disorderly conduct, police
said.
   Neither Fernandez nor Art Institute officials could be reached by
telephone at the institute's school today.
   The flag is part of a work by art student ``Dread'' Scott Tyler
titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' Besides
the flag on the floor where viewers might step on it, it features
photos of flag-draped coffins and South Koreans burning the flag,
and a book inviting viewer comment.
   The exhibit was closed to the public Feb. 24 after veterans
groups complained that it was an insult and sued. The show reopened
Thursday after a circuit judge ruled the exhibit is ``as much an
invitation to think about the flag as it is an invitation to step on
it.''
   Chicago Republican mayoral candidate Edward Vrdolyak also
attended Sunday's rally, and pledged to lobby the corporations that
support the Art Institute to reduce their financial support if the
flag is not removed. Dudycz and Republican state Rep. Linda
Williamson want to try to cut off state funds.
   On Saturday, a tourist from Alexandria, Va., art teacher Susan
Willhoft, was arrested on a felony flag desecration charge after she
stepped on the flag. Her lawyers said it was an accident. She was
released Sunday on bond.

   Roger Tamraz, a Lebanese international
banker, has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom, an
associate reported today.
   However, some Beirut newspapers say the 48-year-old Tamraz fled
after a run on his bank and amid accusations he embezzled $200
million. Police said they know nothing about his reported
disappearance.
   Tamraz's spokesman in West Beirut could not be contacted by
telephone.
   Until recently, Tamraz was chairman of Bank Al-Mashrek, Lebanon's
second largest bank, which is involved in a liquidity crisis with
several subsidiaries, including banks in Switzerland, France, Jordan
and Qatar.
   The associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
believes the kidnappers are acting for an individual or individuals
who lost money when Bank Al-Mashrek collapsed in December. He said
he was not sure of their identities.
   The associate said Tamraz was kidnapped Feb. 19 when he went to
attend a meeting in Chtaura, a town in the Bekaa Valley. He said a
$1.5 million ransom was paid several days later after Tamraz
contacted family and friends by telephone.
   The banker was not released, and kidnappers now have asked for
$1.5 million more to secure his freedom, the associate said.
   Tamraz is the son of a Maronite Catholic Lebanese businessman and
was educated at the American University in Cairo, Cambridge
University, England, and at Harvard Business School.
   He worked for a period in the 1960s for the investment firm
Kidder, Peabody in New York and Beirut. In 1974 he set up his own
investment firm, First Arabian Corp. to invest the money of Middle
East clients.
   Among his better-known business moves were a bid to buy the
Lockheed Aircraft Co., which was vetoed by the U.S. government, and
the successful purchase of the Commonwealth Bank of Detroit.
   In 1983 President Amin Gemayel appointed Tamraz chairman of the
Intra Investment Co. in which the Lebanese state is a large
shareholder and which, in turn, owns a large share in Bank
Al-Mashrek.
   Trouble started after Gemayel's term expired last September with
no successor elected because right-wing Christian deputies boycotted
parliament.
   A run on Al-Mashrek deposits began in December.
   Tamraz was arrested in Christian east Beirut pending an
investigation, but fled to Moslem-controlled west Beirut in January,
where he lived in a seaside hotel until shortly before his reported
kidnapping. The hotel said he checked out to stay with a friend.
   Tamraz has been feuding with central bank governor Edward Naim,
whom he accused of undermining Bank Al-Mashrek to get rid of him.
   Naim has not replied publicly. But Lucien Dahdah, who succeeded
Tamraz as Al-Mashrek chairman, accused Tamraz of improperly
transferring $200 million from the bank to his own companies.

   President Bush remains opposed to intervening
in the Eastern Airlines strike, his spokesman said today as a
congressional committee made plans to hold a hearing on Bush's
refusal to head off the walkout.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked by reporters
whether Bush had second thoughts about refusing to invoke the
Railway Labor Act to stop the strike, said: ``We have no indication
of any change.''
   But Fitzwater also said Bush was receiving ``daily briefings'' on
the situation and said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner had
met with the president on the situation Sunday night.
   Skinner said today that he and Bush were pleased that the strike
by Eastern's Machinists union had not spread to other airlines and
to railroads. The union called off plans for secondary picketing
after a New York federal judge ordered employees of other airlines
not to honor any Machinists picket lines.
   ``We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has
occurred,'' Skinner said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``That's an act
of responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are very
appreciative.''
   Fitzwater said Bush still firmly believes that the labor dispute
can best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations,
rather than through direct government intervention.
   But the Eastern strike looms as the second major confrontation
this week between Bush and a Democratic Congress already battling
over John Tower's nomination as defense secretary.
   The aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works Committee
will hold a hearing Tuesday on Bush's refusal to intervene hours
before 8,500 striking Machinists union members with support from
pilots and flight attendants virtually shut down the nation's
seventh largest airline.
   Bush on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators
and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board and order a 60-day
cooling-off period that would have forestalled the strike.
Administration officials said Bush would not allow unions to wage
``economic blackmail.''
   That decision _ which had been sought by the management of
Eastern and the head of its parent company, Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo _ was the first time in the 63-year history of the National
Mediation Board that a president has rejected its advice.
   Anticipating Bush's decision, Reps. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., and
James Oberstar, D-Minn., respectively chairmen of the Public Works
Committee and its aviation subcommittee, introduced a bill last
Thursday directing the president to empanel an emergency board and
order the strikers back to work.
   ``I think the president got bad advice and his organization just
misjudged the circumstances,'' Oberstar said Sunday. ``Some outside
force needs to be brought to bear to resolve this. The Machinists
would be constrained to accept the recommendation of even a George
Bush board.''
   Instead, Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
the administration would ask Congress to outlaw secondary boycotts
in the transportation industry if Machinists put up picket lines at
other airlines and railroads to cripple them as well.
   Skinner said the administration is opposed to congressionally
imposed contract settlements. The last time Congress did was two
years ago when track maintenance workers threatened to expand a
strike against the Maine Central railroad into a nationwide walkout.
   President Reagan twice asked Congress to outlaw secondary labor
boycotts at airlines and railroads _ they already are illegal in
other industries under the 1947 Taft-Hartley law _ but on both
occasions, the legislation was never even considered by the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Buoyed by their success in allowing fewer than 100 of Eastern's
1,000 scheduled flights to take place on the first day of the
strike, the Machinists said they would not try to spread the walkout
to railroads and other airlines on Monday. But they did not rule out
secondary boycotts later.
   Meanwhile, more than 37,000 union pilots at other airlines have
vowed to launch a work-to-the-rule slowdown on Tuesday in support of
the Eastern Machinists. Skinner said that could ``inconvenience
millions and millions of people.''
   Oberstar said Democratic congressional leaders have decided to
let the House take the lead in opposing Bush's stance in the Eastern
strike while the Senate maintains a second battle front on Tower.
   ``The Senate is really waiting to see what the House does;
they're waiting for us to move,'' he said.
   Tower on Sunday repeated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmed
by the Senate as secretary of defense but said he saw no reason to
do so otherwise and accused his detractors of ``hypocrisy.''
   He also said he would relish a chance to appear on the Senate
floor this week to defend himself, as suggested by the Senate
Republican leader, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, has not responded to Dole's suggestion.
   Appearing Sunday on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' Dole promised ``a lot more debate,'' indicating a final
confirmation vote might not come for another week.
   Congress will continue hearings Tuesday through Friday on Bush's
proposal to bail out depositors in savings and loan associations who
sought federally insured high interest rates under deregulation from
now insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   The Congressional Budget Office last week put the 10-year cost to
taxpayers of Bush's S&amp;L plan at $84 billion to $110 billion,
compared to the $1.5 billion government stake in bailing out the
Chrysler Corp. in 1980.
   However, unlike the federal loan guarantees that were repaid by
Chrysler when it again turned profitable, no one ever expects the
government to recoup the money that Bush is asking taxpayers to
shell out for the S&amp;L depositors.
   Another skirmish between the administration and Congress will
occur Wednesday when the Senate Labor Committee is scheduled to
write a new bill to raise the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an
hour to $4.65 over three years.
   The bill is identical to one proposed last year by the
committee's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that failed
last summer in the face of a Republican filibuster.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole _ the wife of the Senate
Republican leader _ said Friday that Bush would support annual
raises of 30 cents an hour to a $4.25 minimum wage in three years,
but only if employers can keep paying new hires a sub-minimum $3.35
the first six months they are on their payrolls.

   People accused of driving under the influence
of alcohol generally are not entitled to jury trials, a unanimous
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court, in a case from Nevada, said states are not required to
hold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms are
six months and other penalties are not particularly severe.
   The court left open the possibility the Constitution might
require a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could be
sentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of driving
under the influence more than once.
   In another case, the court turned down an appeal by northeastern
states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid
rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other
states.
   The court, without comment, refused to order the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to take steps to limit interstate
air pollution.
   The justices rejected an appeal by two Nevada men, Melvin R.
Blanton and Mark D. Fraley, who said the penalties for being
convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) are serious enough to
warrant jury trials.
   Lawyers for the two said Nevada is one of only five states that
do not permit jury trials in such cases. They listed the other
states as Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and New Mexico.
   While there is mounting national concern over the seriousness of
drunken driving, Justice Thurgood Marshall said for the court Monday
that Nevada classifies driving under the influence as a petty crime.
   The demarcation line for petty crimes is a maximum sentence of
six month in jail, Marshall said. The fact that Nevada prescribes
other penalties does not raise the offense to a serious crime, he
said.
   Nevada law provides that a first-time DUI offender can be
sentenced to 48 hours of community work rather than jail. The
offender must be dressed as a DUI offender while doing the work.
   The state law also imposes a maximum fine of $1,000, requires
offenders to attend alcohol abuse edcuation courses and suspends
their drivers' licenses for 90 days.
   Also, first-time offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in
jail.
   Marshall said, ``Primary emphasis must be placed on the maximum
authorized period of incarceration.'' Generally, he said, ``a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial whenever the offense for which
he is charged carries a maximum authorized prison term of greater
than six months.''
   Blanton was arrested in North Las Vegas on July 18, 1986, and
Fraley was arrested in the same town on June 29, 1986. Blanton has
not been tried. Fraley was convicted and was sentenced to two days
in jail and fined $310.
   The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that they were not
entitled to jury trials. The state court said jury trials would
place an expensive burden on the municipal court system.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four Yonkers,
N.Y., councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a
housing desegregation plan.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the judge
exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines.
   _ Said federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal
court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair
treatment.
   The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the
employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge
with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   _ Agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a court
hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take
anti-psychotic drugs.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Washington state
officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the
professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors.
   _ Barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor who
refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she could
testify.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed
in New York City along with three CBS employees who tried to come to
her aid.
   _ Turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine
accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities
law.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force
The Stock Market Magazine to tell readers whether companies featured
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for
other services.
   _ Said a contract dispute between Stanford University and a
computer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration.
   The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for Stanford and a setback
for Volt Information Sciences Inc., which had asked the justices to
compel arbitration.
   The drunken-driving case is Blanton vs. North Las Vegas, 87-1437.

<TEXT>
   Channel One, the widely criticized
commercial television news program aimed at teen-agers in schools,
debuted today in several high schools complete with ads for candy
bars, dandruff shampoo and blue jeans.
   The 12-minute daily program is being produced by Whittle
Communications, a Knoxville-based media company, and is being tested
over the next two months in six schools around the country. The
first program included coverage of the show itself and the
controversy surrounding it.
   Before the first show was even aired a number of education groups
objected to the idea of allowing advertisers to pitch their products
to students in the classroom.
   Central High School on the north side of Knoxville is one of the
test schools and the 20 students in Connie Wilkes' homeroom appeared
to pay close attention to the program.
   The program featured stories on students' reaction to the
continuing death threats against author Salman Rushdie and life for
a teen-ager in the Soviet Union, in addition to the one on the
controversy involving the launch of Channel One.
   Also included in the program were 30-second television ads for
Snickers candy bars, Head and Shoulders shampoo, and Levi's 501
jeans.
   If the test proves successful and advertisers can be persuaded to
make a long-term commitment, Whittle Communications LP hopes to make
the program available to 8,000 or more schools in fall 1990.
   The program is being produced by Whittle, a fast-growing company
that has specialized in creating magazines and sponsored posters
that enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences.
   The audiences for its magazines, for instance, range from new
mothers in doctor's waiting rooms to travel agents to high school
students. Its advertiser-sponsored posters hang in offices and
school lobbies.
   The Channel One test is expected to cost about $5 million.
Whittle estimates the hardware alone required to take the program
nationwide will cost more than $100 million.
   Each of the test schools was given about $50,000 worth of
television monitors, video recording equipment and a satellite dish
that Whittle promises to maintain.
   The system will be used to receive and record the show, which
Whittle is producing in Los Angeles, and to televise it once during
the school day. Included in each show are up to four 30-second
commercials.
   In exchange for the equipment and the programming, the schools
agreed to run the show once each school day in every classroom.
   The launching of Channel One came amid growing criticism by
children's advocates and educators, including the National
Association of Secondary School Principals and the National
Parent-Teachers Association.
   They say such programs inappropriately thrust paid advertising
messages at a captive audience in the classroom.
   But Christopher Whittle, who heads the company bearing his name,
argued that someone has to pay the bill for the topical daily news
program and the equipment needed to show it. He said since most
schools cannot afford to pick up the tab, it is reasonable to get
advertisers to pay it in exchange for two minutes of commercials
each day.
   Whittle said that as of late last week, eight advertisers had
signed up for 80 percent of the available commercial time in the
test.
   One of the sponsors is jeans maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Marketing
manager Dan Chew said Levi was monitoring the debate about
advertising and would decide after the test whether to stay with it.
   Officials of the test schools said critics should wait until
after the test is completed in late April.
   ``This is a program that appears to have merit and absolutely
should get a chance to be seen before people make up their minds
about it,'' said John Katsoulis, an assistant school superintendent
in Billerica, Mass.
   Billerica Memorial High is one of the six test schools. The
others are Central High School in Knoxville, Tenn., Mumford High
School in Detroit, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, Gahr High
School in Cerritos, Calif., and Eisenhower Middle School in Kanasa
City, Kan.

<HEAD>Gordon Humphrey Won't Seek Third Senate Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gordon Humphrey, one of the most vocal
conservative voices in the U.S. Senate, said today he will not seek
a third term.
   ``I'm here today to announce that two terms is plenty. Twelve
years in the Senate seems like a good place to round it off,''
Humphrey said at a crowded news conference at his office in Concord.
   Humphrey, 48, sat on the edge of his desk and held up a large No.
2 as he announced that he will return to private life at the end of
his second term in January 1991.
   ``I do not want to spend 18 years in Congress,'' the Republican
said. ``It becomes a career at that point and I don't believe people
should make a career in Congress.''
   Joking, Humphrey suggested a half-mile line of politicians would
queue up at the secretary of state's office to file candidacy papers
for his job.
   His wife, Patricia, who attended the news conference with the
couple's two young sons, said she had mixed feelings about the
announcement.
   ``I'll be glad to have him home, but I think he should have run
again,'' she said. ``I think he was just hitting his stride.''
   Before making the announcement, Humphrey phoned his supporters to
confirm early signs that pointed to a retirement message.
   Humphrey had scheduled his announcement at his office, not at a
public rally where a re-election bid surely would have drawn a
cheering crowd. And his campaign coffers are fairly bare, containing
but $4,108, according to the secretary of state's office.
   Humphrey has maintained that no single reform would do more good
than limiting senators and representatives to 12 years in either
body, but he said because that is not the rule now, it was not
reason enough to retire.
   An outspoken conservative voice in the Senate since upsetting
Democrat Thomas McIntyre in 1978, Humphrey has been a leader in the
fights to aid Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet troops and outlaw
abortion.
   At last summer's Republican national convention, Humphrey
orchestrated a campaign to pressure then-nominee George Bush to name
a conservative running mate.

<HEAD>Will European `Pure Beef' Movement Spread to US?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temporary truce has been declared in
America's trade war with Europe, but there is a gnawing worry for
the U.S. beef industry that all is not quiet on the home front.
   The question is whether American consumers will alter their
tastes as a result of the highly publicized dispute over the
European Community's ban on imports of hormone-treated beef.
   Several consumer groups suggest that Europe's demand for beef
free of growth hormones could give a greater sense of urgency to a
similar movement in this country.
   ``There has been a kind of slow-moving trend to meat that is free
of any kind of chemical residues. But it had kind of died down as a
major national issue. I think all this does is sort of add some
momentum,'' says Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the
Community Nutrition Institute.
   A similar view is held by Ellen Haas, executive director of
Public Voice for Food and Health Policy.
   ``I think it coincides with growing concern among consumers in
the way that our food is produced,'' she says.
   The beef industry and the U.S. government maintain there are no
health or safety risks for humans from the hormones used on beef to
make them gain weight quickly at a lower cost to producers.
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of growth
hormones in cattle. The government tests and inspects meat and
poultry for a variety of drugs, including certain hormones. FDA also
establishes standards requiring producers to stop administering
drugs to animals for a specified period before slaughter.
   However, industry officials are keeping a close watch on the
reaction of American consumers. So far, they see no signs that the
European ban has planted seeds of anxiety among red meat eaters in
the United States.
   ``I really think that by and large the focus has been on the
trade aspects of it. There have been panels certifying to the safety
of the hormones in question. So I don't see that broad-based concern
across the country,'' says Mike Copps, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat
Institute.
   Nevertheless, the industry was relieved when the trade dispute
moved out of the headlines. Two weeks ago, U.S. and European
negotiators agreed to a 75-day cooling off period to study the issue
of hormone use and conduct more talks to find a permanent solution
to the ban.
   ``We are concerned that this EC directive and the hormone issue
is somewhat of a complex trade issue that when you talk about it in
simplistic terms it could be a problem and consumers could be
concerned,'' says Tom Cook of the National Cattlemen's Association.
``We're very conscious of that possibility.''
   The United States contends the Europeans have offered no
scientific evidence casting doubt on the safety of growth hormones
and have implemented the beef ban as a political tactic to protect
their own livestock industry and appease vocal environmental
movements in their countries.
   ``We have the healthiest beef in the world,'' says U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills. ``We cannot let countries impose bans
that have an exclusionary effect without a medical or scientific
basis.''
   The European Community represents a $100 million market for U.S.
beef, mostly cuts such as heart, tongue and kidneys which are not
favored by American consumers. But far more is at stake in the
dispute.
   Mrs. Hills, in a recent interview, expressed concern that the
European beef ban could encourage a new round of global
protectionism. Nations could erect new barriers to their markets by
imposing restrictions on U.S. farm products for alleged health
reasons, such as pesticides on grain.
   Such actions abroad, she concedes, also could alarm American
consumers.
   ``You can drum up an awful lot of emotion among the consumers on
those sorts of ground,'' says Mrs. Hills.
   As Haas and Leonard point out, there has been a simmering debate
about the safety of residues in food from pesticides and from drugs
administered to livestock to promote weight gain and treat disease.
For example, antibiotics have been widely used as a food supplement
for hogs to help them gain weight and prevent infections.
   Consumer demand for ``natural'' or organically grown products has
already led some supermarkets to offer hormone-free beef as well as
fruits and vegetables certified to be free of chemicals.
   Haas notes that the beef industry has responded to health
concerns about fat and cholesterol by promoting lean cuts of meat.
She and Leonard suggest that as a matter of ``consumer choice,''
hormone-free beef could find its way on more shopping lists in the
United States.
   ``There is a much greater public sensitivity to health. People
are looking more carefully at their diet than they did 10 years ago
or 20 years ago,'' says Leonard.
   ``These questions of what we add to foods and the reason we need
to add chemicals to foods need to be re-evaluated and I think that's
what is happening.''

   Poland and Israel will begin regular
airline service between their countries for the first time since
Israel was founded, a spokesman for the Polish airline LOT said
Monday.
   LOT this month starts once-a-week flights to Tel Aviv, while the
Israeli carrier El Al will expand from charters to scheduled
service, said LOT spokesman Jerzy Wojdyllo.
   Before World War II, LOT planes flew to Lod in what was then
Palestine. Service was suspended when Israel was created in 1948.
   The El Al service will start March 28 and the first LOT flight
will be March 30, Wojdyllo said.
   The round-trip fare will cost about $500, Wojdyllo said.
   El Al has run charter flights to Poland for more than a year.
   ``We see it as just keeping things normal. It is normal that two
countries have air links,'' an Israeli diplomat said.
   There were about 5,000 Polish visitors to Israel in 1988, and
about 10,000 Israelis visited Poland, the diplomat said.

   An Army warrant officer admitted at the opening
of his court-martial today that he was involved in a five-year
conspiracy to provide classified military information to Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Warrant Officer James W. Hall III, 30, of New York City, pleaded
guilty to all 10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage and
failing to obey Army regulations that were lodged against him after
his arrest last December in Georgia.
   Col. Howard C. Eggers, the military judge presiding at the court
martial at Fort McNair here, did not immediately accept Hall's
guilty plea. Under Army regulations, he will hear the prosecution's
case against Hall and defense witnesses before deciding Hall's guilt
and punishment.
   Court officials said Eggers' final verdict and sentence probably
will not come before Friday.
   Under a defense-initiated pre-trial agreement disclosed during
the court martial today, Hall pleaded guilty to all charges against
him in exchange for the government agreeing not to seek the death
penalty.
   The rest of the government's agreement on a sentence for Hall was
not disclosed, including the maximum sentence Hall will receive.
Under Army procedures, Eggers will not see the sentencing agreement
until after he pronounces sentence on Hall, and if his sentence is
more severe than the agreement, the agreement will prevail.
   Vaughan E. Taylor, Hall's civilian attorney, said Hall would not
``comment at any time now or in the future.''
   ``He has authorized me to inform you that he is truly sorry for
whatever damage he may have done to national security and to tell
you that he has taken every imaginable step to now minimize thgat
damage,'' Taylor said in a statement.
   ``His family was totally uninvolved and unaware of his activities
and Hall will spend the remainder of his life working to prove that
he eventually deserves to be reunited with his wife and children,''
the statement said.
   Taylor said Hall intends to tell Eggers, during the closed
portion of his court-martial, ``all the actions he has taken to
neutralize this situatiuon and then throw himself on the mercy of
the military judge.''
   Taylor said through a military spokesman that the defense would
have no comment on Hall's motivation for passing classified
information to representatives of East Germany and the Soviet Union
until after he is questioned by Eggers.
   Hall was arrested Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., after admitting to
an FBI undercover agent that he has been passing intelligence
information to the Warsaw Pact countries.
   Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security
clearance, was accused of delivering exposed film and documents
dealing with communications intelligence and war plans.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in 1976 and spent most of
his career in Europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and
telephone traffic and coded messages.

   Two commuter trains collided today
outside Glasgow, and Scotrail said two people were killed and 44
injured.
   It was the second rail collision in Britain in 48 hours. A crash
Saturday on the outskirts of London killed five people and injured
94.
   Willie Caldwell, a spokesman for state-owned Scotrail, said one
person was believed trapped in the wreckage two hours after the
accident, and most injuries were believed minor.
   Scotrail said the two trains were traveling in opposite
directions between the Glasgow suburbs of Springburn and Milngavie
when they collided just before 1 p.m. outside Bellgrove station, two
miles from the center of Glasgow.
   ``We were all sitting down in the train, and suddenly there was a
large bang. People were thrown about all over the place,'' said
Colin Smith, a student who was on one train.
   ``I helped drag one old woman out. She was covered in blood and
eventually taken to hospital,'' said Anthony McVey, who had been
walking his dog near the tracks.
   The two trains, carrying about 70 passengers, were going less
than 30 mph, Scotrail said. At least two cars derailed.
   Firefighters swarmed over the wreckage to free trapped
passengers, while ambulances stood by to evacuate casualties.
   Scotrail is a branch of state-owned British Rail, whose safety
procedures are under severe criticism following two serious
accidents in the London area in less than three months.
   The Scottish crash ``confirms ... that we have been putting
insufficient resources into preventing these accidents,'' said
legislator John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party's transport
spokesman. ``The government's policy is clearly on trial,'' he said.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon denied that government
budget-cutting was a factor, but told the House of Commons: ``The
fact that there have been two serious accidents on British Rail and
now a third within three months is naturally a cause for concern.''
   After Saturday's crash outside London, investigators found signs
the driver of one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal
before his train struck another London-bound train.
   Gordon Pettitt, general manager of British Rail's Southern
Region, said Sunday that driver David Morgan made ``a severe brake
application'' long before his train passed the red signal.
   Morgan was one of 94 people injured when his train, traveling
from Littlehampton to London, hit a train traveling from Horsham to
the capital. Police said today that 31 people remained hospitalized,
10 in serious condition.
   Six cars rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash, and
several came to rest in the yards of homes.
   Authorities said the Horsham train was crossing from a slow track
onto the main line when it was struck from behind near Purley
Station on London's southern outskirts.
   Morgan ``has told us that the signal at the end of the platform
at Purley Station was red, yet he went through it,'' Pettitt said.
``He has not been able to offer any explanation for that.''
   Morgan was hospitalized with two broken legs, Pettitt said.
   ``The safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on
drivers stopping at red lights,'' he said.
   ``We have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application
was made prior to the collision and long before the signal,''
Pettitt said. He did not detail the evidence.
   The possibility of driver error ``is not uppermost in my mind at
the moment, though it is obviously a main area of inquiry,'' he said.
   Pettitt said the train's braking system was being examined.
   He said there was no evidence of sabotage and the signaling
equipment at Purley appeared to be working properly.
   Three trains crashed near a busy south London junction during
rush hour Dec. 12, killing 35 people. Railway officials believe a
malfunctioning signal caused that crash.

   To recapitulate: Bryant ripped Willard and Gene
in a memo which surfaced mysteriously while Bryant was on vacation.
Willard was hurt; Jane, not mentioned in the memo, stood by
stoically.
   On Monday, host Bryant Gumbel returned to NBC's ``Today'' show
and joked about the controversy that had engulfed the nation's
top-rated breakfast show in his absence.
   Weatherman Willard Scott was not there; he was starting his own
one-week vacation. An attempt to ease tensions by telephoning Scott
on the air foundered embarrassingly when the connection was lost,
and Gumbel and co-host Jane Pauley were forced to ad-lib through the
show's final moments.
   ``A very unusual Monday _ in many ways best forgot,'' said Gumbel.
   It all started last week, when someone leaked to New York Newsday
a memo Gumbel had written to ``Today'' producer Marty Ryan. In it,
Gumbel criticized reviewer Gene Shalit, consumer reporters David
Horowitz and Betty Furness and medical reporter Dr. Art Ulene. The
harshest words were reserved for Scott's hokey, homey shtick,
including his endless recitations of centenarians' birthdays.
   Scott at first made light of the memo, but later said Gumbel's
comments were hurtful and hinted he might leave.
   ``If it's not real, and if there isn't an honest, genuine
reconciliation, I don't think I belong there,'' Scott said.
   Exit Scott and Shalit, on vacation. Enter Gumbel.
   ``Good to be back after what should have been a quiet vacation,''
said Gumbel at the top of Monday's show. ``The fact that it wasn't
is something we'll get into a little bit later, but first things
first.''
   Pauley welcomed him back. ``You were never far from our
thoughts,'' she said wryly.
   Later on, Gumbel thanked callers for expressions of support,
saying ``Jane, Willard, Gene and I are very grateful.''
   ``We do appreciate your concern, and despite what you may have
heard or read in recent days, we are together and hopefully we're
going to be with you for many years to come,'' said Gumbel.
   ``Now that may come as sad news for those who have tried to
capitalize on our differences, but rest assured, that `Today' family
is intact and still smiling, albeit through some pain,'' he
continued.
   ```We'll still be here long after the recent headlines are
forgotten. Enough said.''
   Of course, it is not possible to say enough about the ``Today''
imbroglio. Midway through the show, Gumbel managed a crack after a
news story about secret government documents found in discarded safe.
   ``You've got to be careful where you put documents these days,''
said Gumbel, to peals of laughter.
   Then, at the show's end, came the phone-call fiasco. Gumbel said
he intended to talk with Scott ``about vacation plans and onto some
other things.'' He said he had talked to Scott several times since
Saturday and before the show.
   ``This was going to be our little surprise before going off,''
Gumbel said, and he wished Scott happy birthday.
   Tuesday is Scott's birthday. His 55th, not his 100th.

   A 6-year-old playing with his father's handgun
Monday shot and killed a taxi driver, a news agency reported.
   The child was waving his father's 9mm pistol outside the window
of his family car when the gun went off, fatally wounding taxi
driver Zecharia Krobim, 53, of Ashkelon, in the head, the Itim news
agency said.
   The father and son were not identified, and the father was
charged with negligence, Itim said.
   The father said he did not realize his son had removed the pistol
from a front-seat compartment, the agency reported.
   When the child was questioned by police, all he said was, ``I was
playing with the gun, I was playing with the gun.''
   The agency said the shooting occurred in the parking lot of
Kaplan hospital in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rehovot.

   Gov. Evan Bayh suspended a state
prison-release program after an inmate who was in prison for beating
his ex-wife was charged with killing her while on an eight-hour pass.
   ``Clearly, mistakes were made, there's no doubt about that, and
I'm good and mad about it,'' Bayh said.
   ``I understand proper procedures were not followed, and we're
going to find out why that happened, discipline those who were
involved, re-evaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense,''
Bayh said.
   Fred Nation, Bayh's press secretary, said no inmate involved in
the furlough program will receive a pass for the next four weeks
while corrections officials review the policy and report to the
governor.
   Alan Matheney, 38, was charged with murdering his ex-wife, Lisa
Marie Bianco, 29, on Saturday in this town near the Michigan state
line, authorities said. He was being held Sunday at the St. Joseph
County Jail in South Bend.
   Matheney, who was serving an eight-year sentence for beating
Bianco two years ago, had been in a work-release prisoner at the
camplike Correctional Industrial Complex. Prison officials said he
was released into his mother's custody Saturday morning.
   The pass was supposed to limit his travel to the Indianapolis
area, 40 miles southwest of the prison, but Matheney instead went to
Mishawaka, 120 miles north of Indianapolis, authorities said.
   Matheney was arrested Saturday afternoon after neighbors reported
seeing Bianco bludgeoned in the head with the butt of a shotgun,
police Capt. Ross Deal said.
   ``There were several witnesses,'' said police Cpl. Kevin
Lockhart. ``It's kind of the low-rent district, so nobody probably
wanted to get involved ... There's a lot of elderly people.''
   Charles Miller, superintendent of the light-medium-security
correctional complex, said Matheney was eligible for a 48-hour pass.
Correction officials made his first pass shorter to gradually expose
him to freedom and to ensure he could handle it, Miller said.
   Bayh said that as he understood the situation, ``if proper
procedures had been followed, the victim would have been notified,
and in this particular instance that was not done.''
   State policy requires such notification only if the crime victims
request it, said Christopher Meloy, supervisor of work-release
services for the Indiana Department of Correction. He said he did
not know if Bianco had made such a request.
   Nation said the furlough program, one of three in which inmates
are allowed limited freedom, was in effect when Bayh, a Democrat,
took office earlier this year. Inmates also can receive work release
and ``special assignment'' to interfaith housing.
   ``We are going to re-evaluate this program because we're not
convinced that it is a program that serves the best interests of the
department or the people of the state of Indiana,'' Nation said.
   President Bush made prison furloughs allowed by Gov. Michael
Dukakis the focus of a soft-on-crime attack on his Democratic rival
in the 1988 campaign. Bush cited the case of Willie Horton, a
Massachusetts prisoner who bludgeoned a Maryland couple, raping the
woman, after escaping during a weekend furlough.
   The federal government has a prison furlough program, also, but
only for prisoners within two years of their release date.

<HEAD>Private Group Urges More Federal Money for Climate Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of scientists concerned about
threatened changes in the Earth's climate called Monday for more
federal spending on research.
   ``Given the enormous momentum in the Earth's climate system, we
delay response actions at our peril,'' said the report from the
Climate Institute, a private group which seeks to coordinate
interests of public and private researchers and officials.
   A committee convened by the institute recommended approval of
President Bush's proposed $190.5 million request for global change
research, plus federal support totaling about $170 million for a
series of additional efforts.
   The panel cited the recent series of unusually warm years, which
some believe are a result of a greenhouse effect on Earth's
environment.
   ``If this strong warming trend is, as some very credible
scientists believe, the beginning of a significant and rapid
greenhouse warming, humanity may soon be faced with some vexing
challenges,'' the committee concluded.
   The greenhouse theory contends that increasing levels of carbon
dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are causing the planet's
climate to warm up, by trapping the sun's heat in somewhat the way a
greenhouse traps heat inside.
   Scientists disagree over whether the recent warm years are the
result of normal variations in climate or the first signs of a
greenhouse effect.
   If the warming turns out to be a trend, it could pose such
problems as changes in the regions where agriculture succeeds,
relocation of forests, melting of polar ice and raising sea levels,
stronger hurricanes and other weather and climate changes.
   ``Unfortunately, the nations of the world are woefully short of a
clear understanding of fundamental processes at work in the
atmosphere, oceans and biosphere,'' reported the committee headed by
Gordon J. MacDonald of the Mitre Corp.
   Among the projects that the committee urged, in addition to the
Bush budget recommendations for climate research, were:
   _A $14 million program to accelerate the phase-out of
chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals blamed for damaging the protective
ozone layer and which also add to the greenhouse warming.
   _Studies of the impact of sea-level rise, totaling $25 million.
   _Some $1.5 million for health impact studies.
   _Upgrading the volunteer weather network and setting up regional
climate centers, $12.2 million.
   _A $14 million national greenhouse gas monitoring system.
   _Forest Service research on global change totaling $17 million.
   _Some $21 million for international studies of climate warming
impact.
   _A $20 million United Nations program for climate research in the
Third World.

<TEXT>
   Four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson
was the first sled-dog racer to reach the highest checkpoint in the
grueling race as leading mushers made their way through the rugged
Alaska Range early today.
   Swenson, driving 18 dogs through the darkness, arrived at Rainy
Pass checkpoint at 5 a.m. He was followed four minutes later by Joe
Runyan of Nenana. Three-time champion Susan Butcher arrived at 5:22,
and DeeDee Jonrow of Bethel arrived four minutes later.
   The weather plagued mushers early today. In some spots, wind had
blown the trail clean of snow and the ice underneath was wearing the
dogs' feet.
   None of the four leaders has taken the 24-hour layover required
during the race.
   Three other mushers were on the trail from Finger Lake to Rainy
Pass, which is 226 miles into the race and at 3,400 feet elevation.
   Martin Buser, who was out front when the first mushers pulled
into Finger Lake late Sunday, declared his 24-hour layover and had
not moved by early today.
   Under the rules of the race, mushers are required to make a
24-hour stop at one of the race's 24 checkpoints; at the others,
they take whatever length of rest they believe they and the dogs
need. However, mushers are allowed to use the strategy of declaring
a 24-hour layover, then leaving after a couple of hours, in hopes of
getting a jump on their competitors.
   The 1,168-mile race began Saturday when 49 mushers left Anchorage
amid 46 mph gusts and a wind-chill reading of 22 degrees below zero.
Two mushers, Roger Roberts and Jan Masek, dropped out 151 miles into
the race.
   From Rainy Pass, the mushers have 942 miles to go before reaching
the finish on Nome's historic Front Street.
   The trail out of Rainy Pass contains dangerous dogleg descents on
icy trails clinging to steep embankments.
   Several mushers complained that parts of trail were difficult to
navigate. Reddington said getting over a bluff past the Yentna River
was virtually impossible.
   ``You need an elevator to get over that one,'' said Reddington,
who injured his two rear dogs Sunday when his sled crashed into them
and opted to take a 24-hour layover at Finger Lake.
   Inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a diphtheria
outbreak in 1925, the Iditarod was founded in 1973. The winner this
year is to get $50,000 of the $250,000 purse. The remainder is
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from Alaska. Others are from
Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, Georgia, New York, France and Japan.

<HEAD>Newcomers Want Town Clock Silenced At Night</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HATFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The clock in the Congregational Church has
sounded the hours, day and night, for most of two centuries. Now, a
couple new in town has asked selectmen to turn it off at night so
they can sleep.
   This little farming town of 3,000 people is not so sure it wants
to give up the tradition.
   Richard Carnall said Monday that he and his wife moved from
Northampton to a home next door to the church this summer while the
clock was broken and the chimes didn't sound.
   ``It's not just loud. At midnight it rings 12 times and at five
in the morning it rings five times,'' Carnall said. ``We're about 40
feet away and it's as loud as a car pulling into the driveway.''
   But Carnall said before a Monday night public hearing that he has
gotten mixed reactions to his proposal to silence the bells between
midnight and 6 a.m.
   ``Those bells have been ringing for about 200 years and I don't
think too many people want them changed,'' said Selectman Thomas
Hurley, adding that town officials got an earful from residents
during the months the bells didn't ring. Although the clock is in
the church, built in 1668, the town has been maintaining it for more
than a century.
   ``You get used to it,'' said Selectman George Zgrodnik Jr., who
has lived across the street from the clock for most of his 47 years.
For years, he said, it was the only way his father and other farmers
had of knowing the time when they were working in the fields.
   ``I remember my folks would tell me to be home at a certain time
and, like most kids, running like hell when I heard the clock in
hopes I'd get home before the chimes stopped,'' Zgrodnik said.
   ``It's sort of comforting to hear,'' said his wife, Marion.
   ``Most people in town that I've talked to feel its no different
from moving in next door to Big Ben in London and asking that it be
shut off at night. And they don't much like people coming in and
upsetting their applecart,'' Zgrodnik said. ``One fellow told me
that if we do agree to shut down the clock, we'd better be prepared
to move the town dump, because he doesn't like having that near his
house.''

<HEAD>Oil Transfer Halted Amid Rough Seas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rough seas forced crews to suspend work early
today on removing the remainder of the 90,000 barrels of crude oil
left aboard a damaged tanker that spilled 33,000 gallons of oil last
week.
   Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard said crews stopped work
shortly after midnight, and would decide later today when to resume
pumping what is left of the 3.7 million gallons of oil from the
800-foot Exxon Houston to its sister ship, the Exxon Yorktown, in
waters 14 miles off Oahu Island.
   Less than 10 percent of the oil remained aboard the damaged ship
when the transfer was suspended, Hubbard said.
   Once the oil is abord the Exxon Yorktown, Exxon Shipping Co. can
decide what to do with the Exxon Houston, which was torn from its
offshore mooring buoy in rough seas and high winds Thursday while
unloading crude oil, said Carrie Chassin, an Exxon spokeswoman.
   The stormy weather drove the ship aground on a coral reef about
1,500 yards off a little-used shoreline about 15 miles from Honolulu
and its famed Waikiki Beach.
   Cleanup crews spent their third day removing oil from a two-mile
stretch of coastline Sunday.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said there were no reports of
birds or marine life being harmed by the oil.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank J. Iarossi said the company
will spend whatever is needed to clean the beaches and ocean.
   Despite the wind and seas, the Exxon Houston was within safety
standards for unloading its cargo of Alaska North Slope crude oil at
the Hawaiian Independent Refinery, Iarossi said.
   About 25,200 gallons of crude oil spilled when floating hoses at
the mooring buoy separated, and about 8,400 gallons of fuel oil
spilled from a ruptured tank when the ship ran aground, according to
revised estimates Saturday by Coast Guard officials. Earlier
estimates were that 117,000 gallons of oil had spilled.
   The tanker floated free of the reef on the rising tide Friday
night after its ballast water was pumped out.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUNKEN DRIVING
   
   People accused of driving under the influence of alcohol
generally are not entitled to jury trials, a unanimous Supreme Court
ruled today.
   The court, in a case from Nevada, said states are not required to
hold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms are
six months and other penalties are not particularly severe.
   The court left open the possibility the Constitution might
require a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could be
sentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of driving
under the influence more than once.
   The case is Blanton vs. North Las Vegas, 87-1437.
   
   ACID RAIN
   
   The court turned down an appeal by northeastern states seeking to
force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other
pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states.
   The court, without comment, refused to order the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to take steps to limit interstate
air pollution.
   The case is Maine vs. EPA, 88-684.
   
   YONKERS DESEGREGATION
   
   The court agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four
Yonkers, N.Y., councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to
adopt a housing desegregation plan.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the judge
exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines.
   The cases are Spallone vs. U.S., 88-854; Yonkers vs. U.S.,
88-855; Chema vs. U.S., 88-856; and Longo vs. U.S., 88-870.
   
   FEDERAL WORKERS
   
   The court said federal workers do not have a right to sue in
federal court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair
treatment.
   The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the
employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge
with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   The case is Karahalios vs. National Federation of Federal
Employees, 87-636.
   
   PRISON INMATES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to
a court hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take
anti-psychotic drugs.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Washington state
officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the
professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors.
   The case is Washington vs. Harper, 88-599.
   
   POLICE PROTECTION
   
   The court barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor
who refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she
could testify.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed
in New York City along with three CBS employees who tried to come to
her aid.
   The case is Barbera vs. Schlessinger, 87-2034.
   
   FREE SPEECH
   
   The court turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial
magazine accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal
securities law.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force
The Stock Market Magazine to tell readers whether companies featured
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for
other services.
   The case is Wall Street Publishing Institute vs. SEC, 88-982.
   
   ARBITRATION
   
   The court said a contract dispute between Stanford University and
a computer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration.
   The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for Stanford and a setback
for Volt Information Sciences Inc., which had asked the justices to
compel arbitration.
   The case is Volt Informational Sciences vs. Stanford, 87-1318.
   
   MINORITIES
   
   The court today reinstated a challenge to a Miami affirmative
action plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned by
women or minorities in building a rail transit system.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ordered a lower court to reconsider
its dismissal of the challenge in light of their Jan. 23 decision
striking down a similar affirmative action ``set aside'' program in
Richmond, Va.
   The case is Porter vs. Metropolitan Dade County, 87-1001.
   
   AGE BIAS
   
   The court, in a case stemming from Delta Air Lines' takeover of
Western Air Lines, today refused to let Delta force the retirement
of a group of flight engineers over 60.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Delta is
bound by an age bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against
Western.
   The case is Delta vs. Criswell, 88-1138.
   
   CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
   
   The court left unresolved whether public school students enjoy
any constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal
punishment by teachers and administrators.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Texas law that allows
the use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force,
in the state's public schools.
   The case is O'Connor vs. Beavers, 88-1181.

<HEAD>Le Crocodile Rates Third Michelin Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Le Crocodile restaurant in Strasbourg was promoted
Monday to three-star status in the Michelin guide, giving owner-chef
Emile Jung the ultimate accolade in French gastronomy.
   His was the only restaurant to be raised to the highest level in
the Michelin galaxy, which this year lists only 19 three-star
restaurants in France.
   The red Michelin, known to gourmets the world over as the ``bible
of gastronomy,'' awards three stars only to those restaurants with
``exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.''
   Four two-star restaurants lost one or both stars this time,
including the Beau Rivage in Condrieu near Lyon, which went from two
stars to one; the Chantecler at the Negresco Hotel in Nice, which
dropped a star; the Cote d'Or at Nuits St. Georges in Burgundy which
lost both its stars and Point in Vienne which disappeared from the
guidebook.
   Twelve famous Paris restaurants lost their sole star, including
Chez les Anges, La Flamberge and Olympe.
   ``I was suprised and thrilled,'' said Le Crocodile's 47-year-old
chef in a telephone interview from his restaurant in Alsace. ``Of
course, I've been aiming for the highest quality for years. I'm
constantly giving myself grades, not always awfully high.''
   ``His food is superbly creative, with a strong basis in the local
produce and traditions,'' said Michelin director Bernard Naegellen.
   Outstanding dishes include fresh ``sandre,'' a kind of pike
cooked with juniper berries, with a delicate stuffing of sauerkraut,
an Alsatian specialty. The first course jellied consomme with foie
gras dice, another Alsatian specialty, is presented in a crown shape
with a puree of leeks and potatoes in the center.
   ``Jung's cellar is fabulous, not only in Alsatian wines but in
wines from all over France and the whole world, which is very
rare,'' said Naegellen.
   Celebrating its 80th anniversary _ it did not publish for nine
years during the two world wars _ the 1989 Michelin guide is
accompanied by a quaint facsimile of the original 1900 little red
book. In those days, the book was aimed not at gastronomes but at
pioneers whose ``tin lizzies'' were subject to frequent breakdowns.
   Today, the guide bases its choices on good food on the many
visits by anonymous inspectors, and it is considered the most
serious hotel and restaurant guide in a country obsessed with food
and wine. Last year, 720,000 copies were snapped up by drivers and
epicures.
   ``The little free booklet was offered to buyers of Michelin tires
and was aimed at helping drivers change a tire, repair their cars or
find garages,'' said Naegellen.
   There were no restaurants listed then, only hotels with
restaurants in cities other than Paris.
   ``The guide was aimed at drivers going from Paris to the
provinces,'' said Naegellen.
   The top grade of three stars signaled the most expensive hotels
offering rooms with relative luxury, such as electricity, including
all meals with wine. It also indicated the eventual presence of a
doctor or pharmacy in every town, no matter how small.
   This information was vital in days when drivers needed more than
a week to get from Paris to the south of France.
   The legendary Michelin stars, which look like rosettes, were
first awarded for gastronomy in 1926. They now are the ultimate in
prestige for restaurants, and the 1989 guide lists 619 starred
establishments.
   Among this year's demotions, Olympe's fall from one-star grace is
particularly disappointing to those who root for women chefs.
Olympe's owner, Dominique Nahmias, is popular among gastronomes. She
still retains her three ``toques'' and rating of 18 out of 20 in
another popular guidebook, the Gault-Millau guide.
   ``We have nothing against professional women cooks,'' said
Naegellen, noting that several women have stars and the chef of the
two-starred Le Restaurant in Lille is Ghislaine Arabian, wife of the
owner, Jean-Paul Arabian.
   Naegellen said that for the first time a special listing is
provided for restaurants with menus of $25 or less.
   Michelin has consistently enlarged its scope with the times, and
now travelers can note which establishments don't allow pets, honor
credit cards, have views and beach facilities or offer terrace or
garden dining.
   The guide still covers the driving essentials, including distance
between towns, repair garages, dealers, and night breakdown
facilities.

<HEAD>Pravda Attacks Superministry of Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda Monday joined
other Soviets criticizing the ministry in charge of agriculture,
reprinting citizen comment that it is ineffective and useless.
   Commonly known as ``Gosagroprom,'' the governmental committee
that oversees the agencies that run the nation's state-owned and
collective farms has recently been broadly criticized in the press.
   Rumors swept Moscow last week that the Kremlin leadership is
planning to abolish the committee, which was formed under Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985 when five agricultural
ministries and some other state agencies were merged.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee will meet this month
and is expected to make reforms in agriculture to remedy chronic
food shortages.
   An article published in Pravda on Monday said the paperwork
produced by Gosagroprom indicates the ministry isn't overlooking
serious problems, but that a closer look reveals ``it's possible to
say it did not solve any big problems.''
   People attending a party conference in Kharkov, a Ukrainian city
400 miles south of Moscow, wrote a letter to the Supreme Soviet
parliament calling for the dismantling of ``this monopolistic,
ineffective, bureaucratic organization'' that hinders effective
forms of farming, the article said.
   Pravda said Gosagroprom has made certain the farmer's dream of
living as well as non-farmers who work in food processing remains
just a dream. The most common words to Gosagroprom from farmers are:
``Give us resourses, and don't bother our work,'' Pravda said.
   The government daily Izvestia also printed an article Monday by a
doctor of economic sciences, I. Buzdalov, that indicated there is
consensus at least on the need to drastically cut back the size of
Gosagroprom, starting with the regional organizations responsible
for agriculture, known to the Soviets by the Russian-language
acronym of RAPOs.
   ``The judgment on whether Gosagroprom, starting with RAPO, is
necessary in its present form is no longer subject to debate, it
seems,'' the economist wrote.
   The Politburo published a report Saturday saying it supported the
creation of various types of farms to help alleviate the Soviet
Union's food shortage.
   The 12-member ruling body made no direct reference to abolishing
Gosagroprom, but said new forms and methods of management were
needed in the country's agricultural management.
   The Central Committee has announced it will hold a plenum March
15-16.

   An Air Force retiree who helped fly weapons to
the Contras described today how an associate of Oliver North's
pulled him into the Iran arms initiative.
   North co-defendant Richard Secord ``asked me to assist in the
transportation of arms to Iran,'' said Richard Gadd, a retired Air
Force lieutenant colonel.
   In January 1986, Gadd said, ``I was told they desired to move
classified cargo from the United States to Iran.'' Secord, he said,
``asked if I could arrange that.''
   ``You must figure this out,'' Gadd said Secord told him. ``You
must convince Southern Air Transport to do the job. This could lead
to the release of the hostages.''
   Gadd handled the covert program to ship arms to the Contras in
early 1986, when that was illegal, and ran flights with humanitarian
aid when that became legal.
   Gadd also testified how North and Secord decided that one of
Secord's companies should get title to the aircraft being used to
secretly supply the Contras.
   Gadd testified at North's trial that ``I objected somewhat
strenuously'' when Secord, one of North's co-defendants in the
Iran-Contra case, summoned him to a meeting in January 1986 at a
McLean, Va., restaurant. Secord announced that he had ``changed his
mind'' and that one of Secord's companies would get title to the
aircraft rather than a company Gadd controlled.
   After Gadd complained, Secord called North aside, the two spoke
briefly, returned to the table and Secord ``told me that is how it
would be. Colonel North seemed to agree,'' Gadd testified.
   The C-7 Caribou aircraft had been purchased with funds generated
by Secord's secret resupply operation to the Contras.
   Eventually, the Contra leadership ``felt the planes belonged to
them,'' related Gadd, who described how Secord and North held
another discussion about ownership during a plane trip to Central
America.
   ``North agreed'' once again that the planes belonged to one of
Secord's companies, Udall Corp., and that the ``Contras did not
exercise total control,'' Gadd said.
   Gadd, who retired from the Air Force in 1982 as a lieutenant
colonel, also described North's involvement in other details of the
Contra resuply operation. Gadd said a crewmen, Ian Crawford,
described ``what went wrong and what went right'' with an airdrop of
military supplies to the Contras in southern Nicaraguan near the
Costa Rican border in April 1986.
   Gadd also said that he billed one of Secord's companies, Lake
Resources, $392,000 for construction of an airstrip in Costa Rica
that was designed to help supply the Contras on the Southern Front
in Nicaragua.
   Gadd said North enlisted him to help build the airstrip for
secret military supply missions to the Nicaraguan Contras while
Congress had banned U.S. aid to the rebels.
   Among the 12 criminal charges against North are four counts of
lying to Congress by denying his involvement in the Contra resupply
operation.
   Gadd testified Thursday that North enlisted him to help build a
secret airstrip in Costa Rica to support a ``southern front'' for
the Contras in their guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government.
   Gadd described how he was summoned on a Sunday by Secord to a
meeting with the White House aide, who pointed on a map to a remote
section of the country's west coast.
   ``Secord and North asked if I could build'' the airstrip,
recalled Gadd.
   ``Not being in the business of building airfields,'' Gadd said,
he retained some consultants and eventually the runway was built.
   North at one point accompanied Gadd to a meeting with Ambassador
Robert Duemling and urged him to award Gadd an air delivery contract
to help distribute $27 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras,
Gadd said, adding that Duemling agreed to the request.
   One of the government's key witnesses against North, former
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, was sentenced Friday for
his role in the Iran-Contra affair and is to be called later by the
prosecution.

<HEAD>Pro-Government Newspaper Calls for Botha to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-government newspaper
known for its staunch support of President P.W. Botha joined other
leading publications that called Monday for the resignation of the
ailing leader.
   Botha, 73, is recovering from a stroke suffered Jan. 18, but he
announced last week that he will return to office in April and plans
to remain at least until his term expires in September.
   Botha, who has been head of government for more than 10 years,
left open the possibility he may seek another five-year term as
president.
   ``There is a time to come and there is a time to go,'' said the
pro-government daily Beeld in an editorial, quoting the words of
D.F. Malan, a prime minister in the 1940s and 1950s and Botha's
political mentor.
   ``May we suggest that (Botha) again reads these words
attentively,'' the editorial said. ``(Malan's) voice from the far
past still has much to say to us all.''
   There had been speculation Botha would return to office only long
enough to step down with dignity and ceremony, making way for
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, the heir apparent as president.
   De Klerk was elected leader of the governing National Party last
month after Botha resigned from that post. Traditionally, the party
leader has been head of government, and de Klerk has found himself
in an awkward position because he has no formal power over
government decision-making.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said Monday
the country had been ``reinvigorated'' by de Klerk's initial
speeches since becoming head of the National Party.
   The lengthy editorial made no mention of Botha, but said de
Klerk's calls for race reform had drawn an ``enthusiastic response''
from opposition groups that have refused previously to negotiate
with the government.
   De Klerk has yet to declare any major policy differences with
Botha, but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic, and
thus more capable of breaking South Africa's political stalemate. He
has made vague proposals to soften the impact of existing
segregation laws.
   Several leading newspaper in recent days have predicted a power
struggle in the governing National Party if Botha attempts to remain
in charge.
   ``There is now a strong possibility that after the meetings of
... (National Party) organizations this week, a delegation could be
sent to Mr. Botha to ask him to stand down,'' the independent Star
newspaper, the country's largest selling daily, said in a front-page
story.
   Calls from Botha's resignation have come from liberal and
far-right opposition parties, as well as from some National Party
members.
   ``Botha, unable to relinquish high office gracefully, has put
himself into an untenable position,'' said Business Day, the leading
financial daily. ``Nobody in his personal entourage is likely to
tell him ... he is the most disliked leader the (National) Party has
ever had.''
   Botha has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at
his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting
president, Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Board Attorney Says Enforcement Efforts Could Suffer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for the Federal Reserve Board said
Monday that bank law-enforcement efforts could suffer because a
federal appeals court vacated a board order that had barred a former
chairman of Michigan National Corp. from the banking business.
   ``It creates a certain problem when someone can resign and
therefore elude jurisdiction,'' said Douglas Jordan, an attorney for
the board.
   In January 1988, the Federal Reserve Board removed Stanford
Stoddard as officer and director of the Detroit-area bank-holding
company and barred him from engaging in banking activities.
   However, in July 1984, Stoddard had resigned as head of the bank,
leaving the company nearly a year before the comptroller of the
currency began steps toward removing him. The comptroller,
recommending action against Stoddard, said the bank officer used
some of the institution's funds for improper purposes.
   Saying ``one cannot remove what isn't there,'' a federal appeals
court here, in a ruling Friday, vacated the board's order and agreed
to review the case.
   The board had argued that Congress intended the removal provision
as a way of barring people who engaged in midconduct from returning
to the banking business.
   ``It is not an uncommon occurrence for someone who has been
suspected or accused of misconduct to resign voluntarily or to
resign as a result of pressure from his institution,'' Jordan said.
   Stoddard's attorney, Keith Fisher, said his client ``seriously
wants to get back into the banking business.''
   ``In the current climate of troubled institutions all over the
country, someone of his enormous experience and talents would be
quite useful to any number of institutions,'' Fisher said.

   The State Department condemned on Monday a
threat by a radical Palestinian leader to carry out the orders of
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to kill British author Salman
Rushdie.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said the statement by Ahmed
Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, ``highlights the menace'' posed by that
group and its association with Iran's state-sponsored terrorism.
   ``This terrorist group is based in Damascus and therefore the
government in Syria has an obligation to exercise control over the
group's actions,'' Redman said.
   ``We call on Syria to take appropriate action to ensure the
PFLP-GC does not follow through on this threat,'' he added.
   Jibril said Sunday that Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,''
was a conspiracy to defame Islam and had been written at the behest
of ``arrogant'' Western forces.

<HEAD>Baker Urges Soviets To Abandon Brezhnev Doctrine</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS 5th graf ``Ost said today...'' by removing reference
to summit.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today called on the Soviet Union to abandon the so-called Brezhnev
Doctrine used to justify military intervention to block reforms in
communist countries.
   In his first speech to an international forum, Baker also
announced that President Bush is exploring ways to accelerate the
removal of U.S. chemical weapons from West Germany.
   He said the Soviet Union had enormous stocks of such weapons
threatening Europe, and called on Moscow to join the United States
in mutual destruction of ``these frightening weapons.''
   Baker called West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sunday night to
advise him of Bush's plans on chemical weapons, West German
government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told reporters in Bonn.
   Ost said today that the United States has decided to withdraw the
weapons ahead of the 1992 deadline agreed to previously, but Kohl
made no mention of such a reported decision in a later statement.
   Kohl applauded what he called a U.S. pledge to explore
possibilities for the early removal of chemical weapons from West
Germany.
   A spokesman for the government press office said the discrepancy
between Kohl's and Ost's statements could not be immediately
explained.
   Baker spoke at a meeting of 35 foreign ministers gathered in
Vienna's Hofburg palace to launch talks on reducing conventional
weapons across Europe.
   In a largely conciliatory speech, he urged the Soviet Union to
put into practical use the ``new thinking'' guiding Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies.
   ``New thinking and the Brezhnev Doctrine are in fundamental
conflict,'' he said.
   ``We call today upon General Secretary Gorbachev to renounce the
Brezhnev Doctrine _ beyond any shadow of a doubt,'' he said.
   Baker told his fellow ministers that all Europeans should have
the freedom ``to have a say in decisions which affect their lives''
and to express their political differences, as well as the freedom
``to be safe from military intimidation or attack.''
   ``Those in the East,'' he said, ``should be free of the fear that
armed Soviet intervention, justified by the Brezhnev Doctrine, would
be used again to deny them choice.''
   The doctrine, named for the late Soviet President Leonid I.
Brezhnev, was invoked by Moscow to justify the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia to crush the liberal communist reforms of
then party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Baker's speech made favorable references to the change Gorbachev
has instituted. ``The rhetoric of Soviet foreign policy is being
reshaped with less emphasis on the use of force,'' he said.
   At another point, he said that as Europe approaches the end of
the decade, ``new horizons are beckoning'' and that ``realism has
begun to triumph in the Soviet Union.''
   Baker began his three-day visit to the Austrian capital on Sunday
with meetings with the foreign ministers of Hungary and Poland,
setting a signal that the Bush administration wants to encourage
those countries' increasing political and economic reform.
   Baker said in his speech that ``people want freedom, freedom of
the mind, freedom in the home'' behind what has become ``a rusting
Iron Curtain.''
   He said while the East should be free of the prospect of Soviet
intervention, those in the West should be free of the fear of Warsaw
Pact forces pointed in their direction.
   ``We shall never be able to set East-West relations on an
irreversible course toward enduring improvement unless we deal with
the huge conventional military imbalance in Europe,'' he said.
   Baker called Gorbachev's offer in December to withdraw six tank
divisions and 50,000 men from eastern Europe ``a very good start.''
   But even after such a pullout, he said, the Warsaw Pact would
retain a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery.
   Baker said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would propose
once the negotiations begin Thursday an overall limit of 40,000
tanks among the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact countries.
   However, he said, ``change in the military balance is only one
part of the process. Only when the causes of the historic division
of Europe have been removed ... will it be possible to eliminate the
military confrontation.''

   President Bush declared today that he is ``sick
and tired of the rumors and innuendos'' blocking John Tower's
confirmation by the Senate as defense secretary.
   Using the beginning of a speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars
audience to get something ``off my chest,'' Bush demanded that
members of the Senate ``put aside partisanship'' and approve Tower's
nomination.
   ``I've asked them to use their own experience with John Tower as
an expert on defense issues, as a former colleague and as a tough
hard-nosed negotiator to guide them as they move towards a vote on
this nomination,'' the president said.
   With the Senate preparing to resume debate at midday, Bush called
the former Texas senator ``a fellow veteran, a lifelong public
servant'' and ``a fighter.'' Tower was not present for the speech,
although the White House had said he would be. Officials said later
that Tower had had a previous commitment.
   ``I stand by this man,'' Bush told his wildly cheering audience
today. ``I stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the
right man to take charge of the Pentagon. ... ''
   ``Enough for that now,'' the president said. ``Going to get it
off my chest. I'm getting sick and tired of some of the rumors and
the innuendo that are used against this decent man.''
   As debate resumed on the Senate floor, Republican Whip Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming labeled the accusations against Tower as ``so
obviously flimsy,'' and urged his colleagues not to base their
decision on such information.
   ``John Tower is a scrapper,'' Simpson said. ``I would never walk
away from innuendo and petty people and goofy witnesses trying to
bring me down.''
   Earlier today, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
reiterated that administration officials are not searching for a
substitute nominee and plan to carry the Tower fight all the way to
a Senate floor vote.
   ``We aren't thinking of fallback positions,'' he told reporters.
``We're supporting the candidacy of Senator Tower.''
   Tower said Sunday that his ``excessive drinking'' in the past
does not indicate any long-term problem and he would welcome the
chance to defend his nomination on the Senate floor.
   Appearing on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation,'' Tower said
he would not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn, arguing that
the dispute over his selection has escalated beyond consideration of
his qualifications.
   The former senator repeated his pledge to stop drinking if
confirmed as defense secretary, and he accused his detractors of
hypocrisy.
   Tower sought to deflect the most common criticism against him by
drawing a distinction between the past heavy drinking he has
acknowledged and an alcohol ``abuse'' problem that would disqualify
him from sensitive military positions.
   ``I still have sip of wine now and again,'' Tower responded when
asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to
do so if confirmed by the Senate. ``Once confirmed, I will give it
up altogether.''
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., has said Tower would fail to qualify for a sensitive
military position because of his history of drinking.
   Tower denied that, and said ``I would be disqualified if you
could prove alcohol dependency or chronic alcoholism. ... In the
final analysis, it is a decision to be made by the commanding
officer that should be based on hard evidence. In my particular
instance, the president of the United States is the commanding
officer.
   ``The fact is I am not alcohol-dependent,'' Tower said. ``There
is no conclusive proof to the effect. As a matter of fact, the
weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise.
   ``I've admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s,'' Tower said.
``I've said excessive drinking, not alcohol abuse. ... There's a
difference.''
   Tower said he would relish a chance to appear on the Senate floor
to defend himself, as suggested by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   The full Senate must approve before a non-member can address the
chamber. Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has not said how
he would react to such a move.
   Dole, appearing on the ABCTV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' vowed ``to fight this to the end.''
   ``John Tower is the best-suited man in America. President Bush
has said so, and he has the right to make the nomination because he
won the election,'' Dole said.
   The Tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations
between the White House and Congress at the outset of the Bush
administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 11-9
against Tower on Feb. 23, splitting on partisan lines with Democrats
in favor and Republicans against.
   Democrats, led by Nunn, say they are troubled by reports of
Tower's excessive drinking, extramarital affairs and his ties to
defense and aerospace contractors.
   One Democrat, Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, said on CNN that
although many of the accusations against Tower had proved untrue, he
decided to vote against the nomination because ``it's risky to have
someone with his background and the problems he has had in that
office.''
   Tower said that the real issue is politics, not his personalit.
   ``Senators are quite capable of changing their minds. I think
there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this
situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be
more thin,'' said Tower, who served 24 years in the Senate,
including a 1981-84 stint as chairman of the Armed Services
Committee.
   Tower discounted the results of a public opinion poll released
Sunday by the Los Angeles Times, showing that 44 percent thought the
Senate should reject Tower, 35 percent thought he should be
confirmed and 21 percent were unsure. The survey of 1,046 adults
last Wednesday and Thursday had a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.
   A Time magazine-CNN poll released Sunday found similarly weak
public support for Tower, with just 31 percent favoring
confirmation. The poll of 504 adults on Thursday had a sampling
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
   While Bush is publicly refusing to discuss possible successors
should Tower be rejected, administration aides and congressional
sources said the president was mindful of the odds against the
nomination. They said some Republicans in Congress have been
pressing Bush to give the job to his national security adviser,
Brent Scowcroft.
   Others mentioned as possible successors have included Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former
Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, former Rep. Jack Edwards of
Alabama, and Norman Augustine, chief executive officer of
Martin-Marietta Corp.

   Ringo Starr feels right at home doing
children's television because he's with the same audience he had
when he was a Beatles.
   ``Kids and mothers were my crowd'' during the glory years as
drummer with the British singing group, Starr said in an interview
in TV Guide's March 11 issue.
   Starr said he does not think his current job is an anti-climax to
his years as a Beatle. Starr, 48, plays a train conductor in the new
PBS British import, ``Shining Time Station.''
   ``John had the intellectuals, Paul had the teenies (teen-age
girls), and George had the mystics. I always had the mothers and
babies,'' Starr said.
   He said mothers used to hold up their youngsters and yell to him,
``His first words were `Yeah, yeah, yeah,''' lyrics from the Beatles
hit ``She Loves You.'' Now, mothers lift up their kids saying
``There's Thomas,'' referring to his new character.
   ``So, I've got it all over again,'' he said.

   Former ABC White House correspondent Sam
Donaldson, who calls himself a native son of New Mexico, plans to
build a ranch west of here.
   ``We're not speculating or trying to subdivide the area. We want
a working ranch,'' he said. ``I grew up in a ranching area and I
like it.''
   Donaldson, who was born in Texas and grew up in New Mexico,
bought 7,300 acres in the central part of the state last week.
   Donaldson, 54, said he and his wife, Janice, will eventually put
cattle and horses on the ranch.
   ``We've still got to fix the fences and the windmills,'' he said.
``And while the wind will be pumping water at the ranch, I'll be

   Where's George?
   That question could be asked at the meetings of the Board of
Regents of the newly formed University of Maryland system about the
absence of political columnist George F. Will.
   Will, who is also a network television commentator, has not shown
up for any of the seven regents' meetings held since Gov. William
Donald Schaefer appointed him in July.
   Will also is a member of the board's educational policy
committee, but he has failed to attend any of those meetings, too.
The policy committee is setting directives for each of the 11
campuses in the system.
   University of Maryland Chancellor John Toll said he has been in
contact with Will by telephone.
   ``He has been very busy,'' Toll told The (Baltimore) Evening Sun.
``There have been scheduling conflicts. The role of a regent is to
guide us on issues and perform services, and he is doing that.''
   Will's assistant in his Washington office told the newspaper that
Will was unavailable to comment on his attendance record as a
regent. Several calls to Will's office Monday went unanswered.
   Will has indicated he will attend the board's next meeting, April
5.

<HEAD>Two Officials Arrested in Stock-Profiteering Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   TOKYO AP) _ Authorities on Monday arrested two former senior
officials of Japan's largest corporation on suspicion of bribery in
a spreading stock scandal that has prompted calls for Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita to resign.
   Prosecutors said they arrested Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., and a senior aide, Kozo Murata.
   Investigators alleged the two officals were bribed with 10,000
shares of unlisted stock that Murata was offered by Recruit Co., an
information conglomerate. Murata, 63, reportedly made $170,000 in
profits when the stock was publicly traded and rose quickly in value.
   Shinto, 78, was known as an advocate of clean government and
business until he resigned from NTT in December after acknowledging
that $70,000 of the profits had ended up in his personal bank
account.
   The remaining $100,000 allegedly was used for illegal political
lobbying.
   The arrests followed the bribery indictments Saturday of four
other businessmen _ the founder of Recruit, Hiromasa Ezoe, another
Recruit executive and two former NTT officials.
   Justice Ministry officials said prosecutors added another count
Monday to the charges against Ezoe _ offering bribes to Shinto and
Murata.
   Ten people have been arrested in the scandal, of whom five have
been indicted. Three Cabinet members also have resigned because of
Recruit links.
   Takeshita, who acknowledged an aide bought 2,000 shares of
Recruit stock, has denied any personal involvement and pledged
Sunday to restore public confidence in his government by pursuing
political reform.
   Takeshita told Parliament Monday he was willing to turn over
documents related to his aide's purchase of the shares, ``but it
affects third parties and banks used by my secretary, so I feel I
need to consult with them.''
   Opposition parties have demanded officials implicated in the
scandal testify in Parliament under oath.
   The three largest opposition parties have united in demanding a
full parliamentary investigation into the scandal. The opposition
Socialists and Communists have demanded that Takeshita resign or
dissolve the lower house.
   Newspapers reported members of the governing party have begun
considering a caretaker government should additional arrests or
public pressure force Takeshita to resign.
   Some party leaders also are discussing the possibility of a
dissolution of the lower house, requiring new elections, if
Takeshita does not resign soon, news reports said.
   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadily in
the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government plans
to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in commercial
transactions, according to media polls.
   Party members want to hold off elections as long as possible,
said Seisaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University.
   An election loss for the party could force Takeshita to step down
as governing party president and prime minister before his two-year
term ends this fall.
   Rei Shiratori, dean of the department of political science and
economics at Tokai University, said: ``If you look at opinions of
voters, things are changing, but that only has an effect if there's
an election. So if Takeshita is able to hold off having an election,
there won't be much direct effect on politics.''

<HEAD>U.N., Aid Donors Will Seek Cease-fire for Food Distribution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations and Western aid donors
will seek an April truce in Sudan's civil war to distribute food and
medicine that could save hundreds of thousands of lives, U.N.
officials said Monday.
   They said about 625,000 of the 2 million to 3 million people
displaced by the six-year war in the south may die of startvation
during the April-December rainy season unles something is done. The
pledge of a ``month of tranquility'' will be sought during a two-day
conference that begins Wednesday in Khartoum.
   Relief workers would use the cease-fire to send food and medicine
south by plane, train and Nile River barge to create stockpiles
against famine and disease, said the officials, all of whom demanded
anonymity under orders from their agencies.
   ``We want to pre-position food and medicine and clothes so people
won't be caught between the conflict and the famine,'' one official
said. ``They need a massive operation.''
   Both the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army of
former army Col. John Garang have used food as a weapon. Western
relief officials estimate that in 1988 alone, more than 560,000
people died of starvation or while fleeing the fighting.
   U.N. and aid officials said they would use the conference to
pressure both sides to accept the temporary cease-fire, but rebel
claims of victory and political uncertanity in Khartoum could upset
their plans.
   A U.N. official said the conference would set goals and initiate
plans for stockpiling food and medicine. It is to be attended by
U.N. representatives, Western donors and the government.
   Rebel radio, broadcasting from neighboring Ethiopia, said
Garang's forces had overrun two garrison towns, Nimule and Parajok,
in the Equatoria region along the border with Uganda.It warned
foreigners to leave Juba, the regional capita., where 15,000 rebels
have 5,000 soldiers beseiged.
   Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office said
20,000 civilians and army soldiers fled into northern Uganda in the
past two days and emergency help was being flown to them. Up to
5,000 other Sudanese have crossed into Uganda.
   Garang's rebel army began fighting in 1983 for autonomy and more
favorable economic treatment in the south, whose people are
predominantly black Christians and animists. The government is
dominated by the northern Sudanese, most of whom are Moslem Arabs.
   Several rebel military victories have been reported in the past
few months. Western military sources say the insurgents have better
arms than government troops and now have about 55,000-57,000
fighters facing a Sudanese army of 65,000 men.
   The Western sources said the army's situation could grow worse in
the rainy season, when the rebels usually have the battlefield
advantage.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, whose 3-year-old regime just survived
a crisis caused by pressure from the military, politicians and the
public to end the war, consulted with other parties Monday about
forming a broad-based government.
   Government sources said privately Mahdi would visit Libya on
Tuesday despite the delicate political situation. The Western
military sources said Libya had offered its southern neighbor $280
million worth of weapons.
   Sources close to the aid conference, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the intention was to send up to 100,000 tons of
supplies to the three southern regions of Africa's largest country.
   ``There is no problem with the food; we have it,'' one source
said. ``It is transportion which is a problem.
   ``Ideally we would have liked both the government and the rebels
to be at this conference, but the United States and the donors are
holding contacts with SPLA (rebels) and hope to put enough pressure
on it and the government to reach an agreement,'' he said.
   The United States has put pressure on Mahdi's government for
peace talks and has urged other doners to do the same.

<HEAD>President of Uzbekistan Fired on Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of Uzbekistan fired the Central
Asian republic's president after charges surfaced that he promoted
relatives of former government and party leaders, Tass said.
   It was the latest blow against officials accused of corruption in
the republic, which has been the focus of sensational articles in
the Soviet press.
   The Uzbek Supreme Soviet, meeting in the capital of Tashkent in
an emergency session, relieved Pulat Khabibullaev from his duties as
chairman of the parliament's executive body, the presidium, the
official news agency said.
   Khabibullaev had been in his post for less than a year but
recently new information was revealed about previous jobs he held,
Tass said.
   ``When occupying executive posts at the republican Academy of
Sciences,'' Tass said, ``Khabibullaev promoted by illegal means the
careers of relatives of the former republican party and government
leaders who have compromised themselves.''
   The dispatch did not say whether Khabibullaev faces criminal
charges.
   The news agency listed the former leaders with ties to
Khabibullaev as Sharaf Rashidov, Inamzhon Usmankhodzhaev and
Normakhamandi Khudaiberdyev.
   Rashidov, Uzbek party chief for 22 years, died in 1983 and has
been criticized harshly for allowing rampant corruption.
Usmankhodzhaev succeeded Rashidov and carried out an extensive
anti-corruption campaign but was retired ostensibly for health
reasons in January 1988.
   No identification was available for Kudaiberdyev.
   At Monday's Supreme Soviet meeting, deputies chose as the
republic's new president Mirzaolim Ibragimov, a 61-year-old teacher
who represented Uzbekistan at the Council of Ministers in Moscow.
   The Soviet press has published many articles on a colossal
embezzlement and bribery scheme centered in Uzbekistan and involving
the republic's cotton industry. It reached all the way to the
Kremlin's first family. In December, after a four-month trial,
former President Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law Yuri Churbanov was
sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp for taking about $145,000 in
bribes. He was accused of taking the bribes while one of the
country's top law enforcers.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Right to Jury Trial in Drunken Driving Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that people
accused of drunken driving usually have no right to a jury trial if
they face a jail term of no more than six months.
   Despite mounting national concern over the seriousness of
intoxicated motorists, the court said unanimously in a Nevada case
that states do not violate fair-trial rights by treating drunken
driving as a petty offense not warranting trial by jury.
   The court said imposing other penalties _ such as suspending
driving privileges or requiring community service _ generally does
not require a jury trial as long as six months remains the maximum
jail term.
   In other action, the court:
   _Left intact a Texas law that allows public school officials to
use all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force. The
court turned down the appeal of two kindergarten girls who were
severely paddled for ``snickering.''
   _Rejected an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution
they say is caused by smokestacks in other states.
   _Agreed to review the fines imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y.,
councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing
desegregation plan.
   In its drunken-driving decision, the court left open the
possibility it might be unconstitutional to deny jury trials if a
repeat offender could be sentenced to more than six months in jail
when convicted more than once.
   The justices rejected an appeal by two Nevada men, Melvin R.
Blanton and Mark D. Fraley, who said the penalties for being
convicted of driving under the influence are serious enough to
warrant jury trials.
   Blanton was arrested in North Las Vegas on July 18, 1986, and
Fraley was arrested in the same town on June 29, 1986. Blanton has
not been tried. Fraley was convicted and sentenced to two days in
jail and fined $310.
   Nevada is believed to be one of five states that do not permit
jury trials in such cases. The others are Louisiana, Mississippi,
New Jersey and New Mexico.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the Nevada
Legislature classifies first-time drunken drivers as petty offenders
by limiting the jail term to six months. Other possible penalties do
not raise the offense to a serious crime, he said.
   Nevada law provides that a first-time offender can be sentenced
to 48 hours of community work rather than jail. While doing the
work, the offender must wear a black and white striped shirt that
has the word ``offender'' written on it along with a picture of a
liquor bottle bearing a skull and crossbones on the label.
   ``Even assuming the outfit is the source of some embarrassment
... such a penalty will be less embarrassing and less onerous than
six months in jail,'' Marshall said.
   The state law also imposes a maximum fine of $1,000, requires
offenders to attend alcohol abuse education courses and suspends
their drivers' licenses for 90 days.
   First-time offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in jail.
   State officials said jury trials in all drunken-driving cases
would place an expensive burden on the municipal court system.
   In other action, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously in a Kansas case that states may regulate
natural gas production by imposing ``use-it-or-lose-it'' rules
designed to stimulate production.
   _Took steps against two affirmative action programs, citing its
ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in
the award of public works contracts in Richmond, Va.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling
a Miami plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned
by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system.
   And the court declared unconstitutional a Michigan law requiring
that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minority-owned
businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Washington state whether a
prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other
constitutional safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic
drugs.
   _Left intact a $90,000 libel award against six American
newspapers serving Korean-American readers for accurately reporting
an announcement made by a South Korean government agency.

   No elk showed up, but it wasn't for lack of trying
as 43 contestants growled, grunted, chirped and squealed through
what was billed as the world elk-calling championship.
   The contestants each had one minute to give their best rendition
of bull and cow elk calls, while a panel of seven judges listened
intently behind a wooden partition at the Washington State
Convention and Trade Center.
   About 1,000 people attended Sunday's finals of the contest,
officially called the Anheuser-Busch World Wapiti (Elk) Calling
Championships.
   Many of the callers, or ``buglers,'' heaved their shoulders and
gyrated as they blew through two-foot long sections of rubber pipe
that directed their screeching calls to all parts of the room in the
convention center.
   One bugler brought a small tree and an armful of brush that he
ripped apart to simulate the sound of an animal tramping through the
woods. All but two of the callers had small rubber diaphragms in
their mouths that they blew on to create the wide range of noises an
elk makes.
   Wayne Carlton, who has 25 years experience calling everything
from alligators to turkeys, said most of the people who call elk do
it so they can hunt them, but others are photographers or those who
want excitement, he said.
   ``Imagine standing by a tree or just being out in the woods and
if you can imitate that, out walks a 700-800 pound bull elk looking
for you to run you away,'' he said. ``The excitement builds up when
you see the antlers walking through the trees at you.''

   If justice is blind, it could
still follow the aroma down the halls of the Clay County Courthouse
to find Circuit Judge Giles P. Lewis cooking a daily gourmet lunch.
   ``He's the only person I've ever known who can spend the least
time and with the least amount of space and ingredients and turn out
such good food,'' said Circuit Judge William A. Wilkes, a regular at
Lewis' luncheon gathering.
   Each day in his courthouse office, Lewis takes off his robe and
whips up one of his many specialties, such as navy beans with smoked
sausage and ``lots of onions,'' with the help of a two-burner hot
plate and a microwave oven.
   His kitchen is neatly arranged along one wall of his office,
every nook and cranny of which doubles as a pantry.
   Lewis, 62, said he has loved to cook for years.
   ``I've been cooking for 40 years. I pulled so much `KP' in the
Army that I decided I might as well learn to cook.''
   Lewis, who has been a judge for 11 years, said he sometimes
thinks about switching careers.
   ``I could always be a cook,'' Lewis said. ``I'm afraid they don't
make much money, but they always eat.''

<HEAD>Death Penalty, Land Preservation Tops Issues for Town Meeting Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington voters on Tuesday will replace
socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders, who is stepping down after eight
years in hopes of seeing his movement broadened with the election of
a like-minded candidate.
   ``I'm no Bernie Sanders,'' Progressive Coalition candidate Peter
Clavelle, has said. ``Our backgrounds are different, our styles are
different, but our political visions are the same.''
   Mayoral elections in Burlington and other Vermont cities are part
of the yearly Town Meeting Day, when residents of all 247
municipalities debate civic issues and have their say about how
their towns and schools will run. In at least 35 towns, residents
will be voting on a non-binding resolution asking the state
Legislature to reinstate the death penalty.
   The mayor's race is expected to draw a large number of
Burlington's 25,000 registered voters to the polls.
   ``I think (turnout) is going to be high, higher than normal,'' Jo
Lamarche, secretary to City Clerk James Rader, said Monday. She said
her office has already received more than the usual amount of
absentee ballots for a mayor's race.
   Clavelle, 39, is the former community development director in
this city of 38,000 people and a former city manager in nearby
Winooski. He lacks Sanders' rhetorical flair and national reputation
for bashing corporate capitalism, but has support from the local
chapter of the National Organization for Women.
   Clavelle's main competition is Alderman Nancy Chioffi, 46, a
Democrat and clothing store owner who has support from both
Democrats and Republicans. The GOP didn't field a candidate.
   An anti-development candidate, Sandra Baird, 48, is running on
the Vermont Greens ticket, claiming Clavelle and Chioffi both have
``sold out'' to business interests.
   The move to put the death penalty question to voters came from
four Republican legislators who say there is strong support for
putting capital punishment back on the books for the first time
since the 1960s.
   Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and
two-thirds voted for reinstatement, Rep. Nancy Sheltra said.
   At least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental
conservation commissions. Nine communities already have such boards,
which are volunteer groups created to protect a town's natural
resources.
   Proponents say the commissions help towns preserve and protect
wetlands, streams and other natural resources at a time when
overburdened town planning commissions are struggling to manage
growth.
   ``It makes people aware of what's going on in their town. They
begin to spark each other. It's amazing what an educational process
it is,'' said Justin Brande, the first executive director of the
Vermont Natural Resources Council.
   In several other communities, voters may authorize selectmen to
create funds with local taxes to protect land resources, such as
farmland, waterfront property and scenic areas.

   Two more men have been arrested
in connection with the death of one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards,
police said Monday.
   The arrests bring to at least five the number of suspects held
for the stabbing death of Maxwell Madondo, 19, whose body was found
last month in the sprawling Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   Madondo was a member of a group of youths who served as
unofficial bodyguards for the wife of imprisoned African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela. They are known as the Mandela United
soccer club.
   Police spokesman Ruben Bloomberg did not disclose the names of
the two men arrested, but said they would appear in court soon.
   Former Mandela United member Andrew Ekaneng already has been
charged with Madondo's murder.
   His death is one of four killings this year directly or
indirectly linked to Mrs. Mandela or her bodyguards.
   Anti-apartheid leaders have accused the bodyguards of waging a
``reign of terror'' in Soweto, and have renounced Mrs. Mandela. They
stress they still support Mandela, the country's best known black
leader.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any wrongdoing, but has not given a full
account of her role in the controversy.

<HEAD>104 Sikhs Freed, Arrive in Amritsar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge freed 188 Sikh political detainees
Monday, but police immediately rearrested 84 of them to face charges
related to militancy that prompted a 1984 army raid on the holiest
Sikh shrine.
   Witnesses said those released from more than four years' jail
without trial arrived under heavy guard Monday at the scene of their
arrests _ northern Amritsar city and its Golden Temple.
   Their freedom is part of a reconciliation drive Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi announced last week to try to end ethnic violence that
has wracked the prosperous northwestern state of Punjab for seven
years.
   ``The 104 men are free to go where they want,'' Punjabi police
chief K.P.S. Gill said at Amritsar as 300 police guards released the
detainees.
   Some of those freed shouted radical Sikh slogans demanding an
independent homeland, witnesses said.
   They were among about 300 men and women arrested in June 1984
when former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered the army to raid
the Golden Temple and rout Sikh militants who had taken sanctuary
inside.
   At least 1,200 people died in the operation. Many of those
arrested in the temple complex were pilgrims who were held for
questioning but never charged.
   Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards four months
later in retaliation for the raid.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population but are a slight
majority in the rich farming state of Punjab. Militants claim Sikhs
are discriminated against by the Hindu majority who comprise 82
percent of the population. They have waged a bloody secessionist
insurgency since 1982.
   In May 1987 the federal government dismissed the state government
and brought Punjab under direct federal rule in an effort to curb
the violence.
   But killings of Hindus and moderate Sikhs escalated. At least
2,400 were killed by Sikh militants last year, more than double the
number killed in 1987. More than 340 people have died this year.
   On Friday, Gandhi announced a peace initiative.
   In addition to the release of political detainees, Gandhi said
foreigners now can travel to Punjab without special government
permission. He also said elections will be held, starting May, for
village committees to supervise development work and law and order.

   More than 260 inmates at San Quentin
State Prison were under lockdown Monday after prison officials
discovered five homemade weapons during weekend searches, officials
said.
   Residents of a parole violators' unit were confined to their
cells after weapons made out of plastic dining utensils were
discovered Saturday in two hiding areas on the roof of a shower
area, said Vernell Crittendon, the warden's administrative assistant.
   Investigators planned to question all prisoners in the unit about
the weapons, Crittendon said.
   The weapons each measured six to seven inches long and were made
from plastic utensils that had been heated until pliable, sharpened
and submerged in cold water to harden the material, Crittendon said.
   Crittendon predicted the lockdown may last up to 10 days.

   Jury selection began slowly Monday in the
murder trial of William B. Cruse, who contends he was ``drunk and
crazy'' during a 1987 shooting rampage that killed six people and
wounded 12 in Palm Bay.
   The trial was moved from the Atlantic Coast town to central
Florida after a court-ordered survey indicated that mostresidents of
the county where the shootings occurred believe Cruse is guilty.
   The first prospective juror called for questioning on pretrial
publicity offered a similar assessment when asked if she believed
she could deliver an impartial verdict.
   ``I truthfully do not think so,'' she responded. She said she had
a ``firm belief'' about the defendant's guilt, based on newspaper
stories and television news reports, which she did not think she
could put aside.
   Circuit Judge John Antoon dismissed her.
   Another of the six potential jurors questioned by noon Monday was
former Sheriff Louie Mims, who said he had formed an opinion about
the case but could put it aside to consider the facts as presented
in court.
   State Attorney Norm Wolfinger and Assistant Public Defender
Marlene Alva said they hoped to seat a jury by the end of Tuesday.
   The long-haired and bearded defendant is charged with six counts
of first-degree murder, 28 counts of attempted murder and two counts
of kidnapping.
   Public defenders for the 61-year-old former librarian are
prepared to argue that he was temporarily insane when he shot
students, shoppers, motorists and two police officers in two
shopping centers on April 23, 1987.
   Cruse kept his eyes closed much of the time. The gaunt-looking
former librarian sat quietly at the defense table. At times, he
seemed to doze.
   Cruse told police shortly after his capture _ following a
seven-hour standoff in a supermarket _ that he believed neighbors,
store employees and strangers were spreading rumors that he was
homosexual.
   ``I just wanted people to leave me alone,'' he told investigators
the morning after the shootout. ``I had to do something to stop
them.''
   However, he said he didn't remember hurting anyone.

   Riot police clashed Monday with
protesters demanding the U.S. Air Force stop bombing practice on a
site near a residential area. Three women were injured in the
demonstration, press reports said.
   About 1,000 protesters from eight villages in Hwasung, 10 miles
south of Seoul, clashed with police during the four-hour rally,
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Yonhap said the protesters demanded U.S. military authorities
stop bombing practice near their villages or pay financial
compensation.
   The protesters pushed through a human wall of about 1,200 riot
police as well as barbed wire fences to demonstrate near a control
tower inside the field, the agency said.
   Demonstrators carried signs calling for safety measures to
protect the residential areas located near the bombing site, Yonhap
said.
   There was no immediate comment from either U.S. or South Korean
authorities.

<HEAD>Government May Help Pay for Efforts to Assist Its Workers to Quit
Smoking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is considering helping
pay the costs of programs that assist government workers in their
efforts to quit smoking, officials said Monday.
   If the rule takes effect, the government will be following in the
footsteps of many businesses, which have combined anti-smoking
programs with workplace rules banning tobacco, according to the
American Cancer Society.
   The federal Office of Personnel Management is circulating the
proposal, which would allow agencies use available funds for such
programs, officials announced.
   ``Smoking cessation programs, particularly for federal employees,
are long overdue. This is a positive step,'' OPM Director Constance
Horner said in a statement. Ms. Horner is a former smoker.
   The plan would require that employees get advance approval for
reimbursement in the anti-smoking programs.
   The regulation is being prepared in the wake of a ruling by the
comptroller general that funding could be approved because smoking
is a major contributing cause of illnesses such as cancer, heart
disease and emphysema.
   The growth of both government and business rules banning smoking
in many workplaces has spurred many companies to contribute to
programs to help workers quit, said Joann Schellenbech, assistant
vice president for media relations at the Cancer Society in New York.
   ``We think it's an excellent idea. Our surveys show that most
smokers want to quit and need something to help them do that. The
incentive of having program paid for may make a difference,'' she
said.
   Costs for the programs range widely, she said, from free clinics
conducted by non-profit groups to $200 and more for more-structured
systems.
   The expense of the anti-smoking efforts can be justified by the
savings in insurance costs, cuts in sick time and reductions in lost
productivity, she said.
   Brennan Dawson of The Tobacco Institute said that organization
would have no immediate comment on the proposal.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Decide Case of Man Held Without Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether state officials can be sued for damages in federal court by
people involuntarily held at state mental hospitals without hearings
required by state law.
   The justices voted to review a ruling that would allow such a
federal lawsuit by a man held in a Florida state hospital for five
months without a hearing that state law said he should have had
within 48 hours.
   Florida authorities contend the man should be limited to suing in
state court.
   Darrell Burch was found wandering along a Florida highway on Dec.
7, 1981. He was taken to a Tallahassee community health services
center where he was held for three days.
   During that time, Burch was hallucinating. He said he believed he
was in heaven.
   After his stay at the center, Burch was transferred to the
Florida State Hospital, where he remained until May 7, 1982.
   Despite a state law that entitled him to a hearing within 48
hours to challenge his detention and treatment, Burch did not
receive a hearing.
   His federal suit alleged that various officials and employees of
the Florida State Hospital acted ``with willful, wanton and reckless
disregard of and indifference to'' his due-process rights.
   The suit invoked a much-used federal civil rights law.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that Burch was barred
from filing it because he could win adequate relief _ including
monetary damages _ by suing under personal-injury law in state court.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal, but the entire appeals court voted 8-5 last
March 18 to reinstate the suit.
   The trial judge and three-judge appellate panel had relied on a
1981 Supreme Court decision in which the justices limited federal
civil rights lawsuits when certain state court remedies exist.
   But the full 11th Circuit court ruled that the 1981 decision
``does not apply to procedural due-process violations when the state
is in the position to provide pre-deprivation process.''
   Because Burch could have been given a hearing before his right to
liberty was deprived, the appeals court said, ``post-deprivation
remedies cannot provide due process.''
   The 1981 ruling also dealt with prison inmates who alleged they
wrongly had been deprived of their property rights, not their right
of liberty.
   The case is Zinmermon vs. Burch, 87-1965.

Pay Hike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   FCC Commissioner James H. Quello on Monday said
``exorbitantly paid'' television journalists and entertainers
carried out an unconscionable campaign against the recent attempt in
Congress to raise the pay of high-level federal officials by 51
percent.
   Quello, who as a member of the Federal Communications Commission
would have gotten the pay hike had it cleared Congress, said it was
``the ultimate in unconscionable self-appreciation for TV and cable
personalities, news anchors and talk show hosts, many of whom make
10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman, to indulge in a
Messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep pace with
inflation for congressmen, key government officials and judges.''
   ``Are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize
government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest
for ratings, money and power really performing more valuable service
than those that grant and manage communications licenses, pass laws
and govern the nation? I think not,'' Quello said in a speech for
the New York chapter of the Federal Communications Bar Association.
   A copy of the speech was released in Washington.
   Quello said the pay plan, which would have raised congressional
salaries to $135,000, had been proposed by ``an impartial,
well-qualified, non-political commission of civic leaders'' and had
been supported by President Bush and then-President Reagan. He said
Congress and the news media ``failed to emphasize enough that this
was a catch-up increment'' recommended by the panel ``to keep
government pay abreast of inflation.''
   Quello's salary is $80,700 and he said that ``with a moderate
lifestyle, I have no problem living well on my government salary.
... But the salary level simply does not reflect the complexity or
importance of commission responsibilities.''
   He said that killing the salary proposal did not serve the public
interest ``because it doomed much-needed reforms on eliminating
congressional honoraria, limiting outside income and changing
campaign fund laws.''
   On another issue, Quello also repeated his view that it is
essential that free, over-the-air television survive in any future
scenario in which telephone companies are allowed to carry TV
signals on fiber-optic networks.
   ``Only broadcasting, not cable or phone fiber, has a government
licensed obligation to provide TV service to the public,'' Quello
said, adding that broadcasting is the ``principal source of local
news and government affairs, of vital local services like traffic,
road, weather, school closing reports and emergency bulletins. And
only broadcasting has a program-issues public file requirement for
license renewal and for public inspection.''
   He said it may be necessary for the FCC to require telephone
companies to provide a basic antenna service to transmit local
broadcast signals at no charge.
   The FCC is considering proposing that Congress lift
cross-ownership restrictions that prevent telephone companies from
competing with cable TV systems in the phone company service area.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Massachusetts Catholics Disagree With Vatican</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholics responding to a statewide newspaper
poll gave Cardinal Bernard F. Law a favorable rating, but disagreed
with a papal warning that dissenters should not be considered ``good
Catholics.''
   Sixty-one percent of the respondents to a Boston Herald poll of
Massachusetts Catholics held a favorable opinion of the Boston
archbishop, who supports the Vatican's position on social and moral
issues.
   But 71 percent of the poll respondents said they should be able
to dissent from official teachings and be considered good Catholics,
the Herald reported Sunday.
   Twenty percent disagreed, and 9 percent said they did not know
whether dissent meant one could not be a good Catholic.
   During the pope's U.S. visit in 1987, he told the nation's
bishops, ``It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the Magisterium
is totally compatible with being a `good Catholic' and poses no
obstacle to the reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error.''
   Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee warned the pope then
that an authoritarian style is counterproductive in the United
States. ``The faithful are more inclined to look at the intrinsic
worth of an argument proposed by the teachers in the church than to
accept it on the basis of the authority itself,'' he said.
   The poll of 302 Catholics around the state was conducted Thursday
and Friday for the paper by Opinion Dynamics Corp. of Cambridge. The
Herald said it had a margin of error of 5.6 percent.
   ``Nothing is going to change because of a poll,'' Cardinal
Bernard F. Law said Friday.
   ``His (the pope's) teaching authority doesn't rest on whether or
not people agree with him. Therefore, whatever a poll might show has
no relevance as far as his teaching responsibility and the message
that he teaches.''

<HEAD>Bootleg Liquor Kills 130 in India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARODA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people were arrested for supplying
home-brewed liquor that killed at least 130 people and left 251 ill
in the only Indian state that bans alcohol, authorities said Monday.
   Doctors said 151 of those 251 hospitalized were critically ill
and probably would die. At least 25 people have been blinded by the
lethal moonshine.
   In addition to the three arrested, several policemen have been
suspended for failing to avert the tragedy in the city of Baroda,
the local government said.
   Baroda is a major industrial center in Gujarat, the only Indian
state where alcohol is banned. The city 560 miles southwest of New
Delhi is home to 2.5 million people.
   United News of India said the son of one supplier and the son of
a prominent local politician are among those killed.
   The liquor normally is brewed from ethyl alcohol, alum and
matured spirits. But this time, industrial methyl alcohol was mixed
to the brew called ``lattha,'' which is sold in plastic sacks for 10
cents. Methyl alcohol paralyzes the central nervous system.
   Press Trust said many victims became dizzy and complained of
nausea and stomach aches before losing consciousness.
   Most survivors were too ill to speak, but one told the Press
Trust of India news agency the only difference he noticed was the
liquor was ``sweeter than normal.''
   A doctor at state-run Sir Siyaji General Hospital said groaning
victims crowded against each other on the floor, on stretchers, and
occasionally three to a bed.
   ``We do not have enough bottles of glucose to even administer
first aid to the victims,'' the doctor said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gujarat's chief minister, Amarsinh Chaudhary, ordered an
investigation and promised action against the police officials who
failed to avert the disaster, the Times of India newspaper reported.
   It said most victims were poor laborers who bought the liquor
Saturday morning after receiving their monthly wages. The first
deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it said.
   As news of the deaths emerged, police fanned out across Baroda
with loudspeakers blaring warnings about the liquor.
   About 300 people have died in seven illicit liquor cases in
Gujarat in the last decade, United News said. Two previous cases
occurred in Baroda.
   In Norway, meanwhile, a court arraigned two alleged moonshiners
Monday after police raided the largest illegal still ever found in
the country.
   Police discovered a modern facility capable of producing 1,000
liters of high-grade alcohol a day hidden in stalls on a horse farm
in eastern Norway, NTB news agency reported.
   Small-scale bootlegging is not uncommon in Norway, where the
government has imposed a high alcohol tax to discourage drinking.
   A fifth of the cheapest scotch costs $32 and gin $27.60 at state
stores which have a monopoly on alcohol sales.
   The moonshine sells for about a third of the state price.

   A Palestinian prisoner died in an interrogation
room of Israel's Shin Bet security service, and two other Arabs were
killed in a bloody day of clashes in the occupied lands Monday,
authorities said.
   Soldiers reportedly shot and wounded 17 other Palestinians as
residents of the occupied territories staged a general strike,
closing shops and staying home from work.
   Monday's death toll was the highest in nearly a month in the
15-month Palestinian uprising, bringing the total of Arabs killed in
the rebellion to 399. Seventeen Israelis have also died.
   Police launched an investigation into the death of Mahmoud
Youssef Masri of the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. Masri, arrested
several days ago, had been kept in the Shin Bet interrogation room
of Gaza prison since the arrest, a Prison Authority official said.
   The official said Masri, 32, suffered an ulcer attack in prison
and was given medical help shortly before he died early Monday.
   ``We don't know what caused the death,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity. ``He was both very sick and also under
intensive interrogation.''
   Leftist legislator Yossi Sarid demanded a ``full and thorough''
investigation. He said authorities told him that the prisoner died
of an ulcer, but ``these circumstances are very worrying. He was
undergoing interrogation.
   Sadrid said the prisoner may have suffered from an ulcer, ``but I
have to be convinced'' that he died of it.
   National police spokesman Ron Yishayahu said police launched an
investigation into the death, and the Prisons Authority official
said his organization was conducting a similar inquiry.
   In 1984, two Palestinian bus hijackers were beaten to death
during a Shin Bet interrogation. The former head of the Shin Bet,
Avraham Shalom, resigned two years later over the resulting scandal.
   A 1987 judicial commission report prompted by the incident
concluded the Shin Bet was allowed to use ``some means of physical
pressure'' during interrogations.
   In other developments in Israel on Monday, a small bomb exploded
at a stop near Tel Aviv, Israel radio reported. No injuries were
reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attack. Police
detained 20 Arabs for questioning.
   In the West Bank village of Salem near Nablus, troops conducting
a search-and-arrest raid fatally shot 24-year-old Ibrahim Mohammed
Jaber, Arab reports said. Hospital officials in Nablus said he was
shot three times in the face. The army confirmed Jaber's death and
the raid, but said it was investigating the circumstances.
   In the Gaza Strip village of Beit Lahiya, soldiers killed Ahmed
Ramadan Azani, 19, during ``a gathering and a riot,'' an army
spokesman said.
   The army spokesman said two other people were wounded in Beit
Lahiya and the army placed a curfew on the village of 7,000.
   Fifteen other Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, hospital officials said. The army
command confirmed one injury and said it was checking further.
   The army said it freed 130 Gaza detainees from the Ketziot prison
in southern Israel to mark this week's Moslem holiday of Isra Al
Meraj. It marks prophet Mohammed's pilgrimage from Mecca to
Jerusalem, where Moslems believe he ascended to heaven.
   The army also told four Gaza families that their relatives are to
be deported and offered the families a last meeting Wednesday in
Gaza prison, Arab reports said.
   The four _ Abu Abu Karsh, Nabil Tamous, Mohammed Saadi Muduh and
Riyadh Wajih Ajour _ are likely to be deported on Thursday or
Sunday, the reports said. Their deportation was ordered in August
for alleged anti-Israeli activities.
   The army declined comment on the report.
   The deportations, if carried out, would bring to 53 the number of
Palestinians expelled since December 1987. The policy has been
condemned by the United States and other Western nations.

   A conservative group is mounting a last-ditch
effort to drum up support for Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
with a public relations campaign in several states, a spokesman said
Monday.
   Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Conservative Victory Committee,
said the organization raised $100,000 from supporters to take out
newspaper advertisements and conduct television interviews by
satellite.
   Bozell said the group's lobbying campaign came after President
Bush last week urged conservatives to generate political heat for
Tower, whose nomination has so far failed to garner much enthusiasm
around the nation.
   ``The momentum has clearly swung,'' Bozell said. Bush, meanwhile,
said Monday he was ``sick and tired of the rumors and innuendos''
blocking Tower's confirmation.
   Bozell said his group plans to take out advertisements in
newspapers in Washington and in Dallas.
   It will also arrange for Tower's daughter, Penny Tower Cook, to
appear on televised question-and-answer sessions with reporters in
Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Virginia.
   Those are states with Democratic senators who conservatives think
might be persuaded to vote for Tower on the Senate floor, Bozell
said.
   One conservative who has criticized Tower, Paul Weyrich, says he
thinks the Senate has not treated Tower fairly in not allowing him
to confront his accusers.
   Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, has publicly
criticized Tower's drinking habits and personal conduct.
   ``As much as I want to see him defeated, I don't want to see him
ruined,'' Weyrich told The New York Times in an interview over the
weekend.
   As for support for the nomination, a Los Angeles Times poll taken
last Wednesday and Thursday said 44 percent of those questioned said
the Senate should reject Tower, 35 percent thought he should be
confirmed and 21 percent were unsure. The survey of 1,046 adults had
a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
   But Bozell said he believed ``there is a growing disgust with
Sen. (Sam) Nunn's shenanigans.'' Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, has spearheaded the campaign against Tower
in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority. A vote could
come this week.

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of a typical
American family to buy a home dropped in January, reflecting
increases in housing prices and mortgage interest rates, a real
estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its affordability index
was at 108 in January, down from 111.2 in December. It was the
largest month-to-month drop since a similar decline in January 1988.
   The new January number means that a family earning the median
income of $32,207 annually had 8 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.
   The median price for an existing home in January was $91,500,
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. January's
median was up $2,800 from the previous month.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 9.61
percent in January from 9.59 percent, representing a composite of
fixed and adjustable rates.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the real estate group, said
rising interest rates are likely to dampen home buying for much of
the spring, particularly for first-time buyers.
   ``When rates are up, the first people shut out are borderline
buyers,'' said the group's president, Ira Gribin. ``Having to spend
even a few dollars more a month for mortgage payments can keep them
out of the market altogether.''
   The affordability index has been above 100 since June 1986.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Calls for Seizing Vessels Owned by Convicted Ocean Dumpers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking a page from the ``zero tolerance''
policy of seizing boats from drug possessors, a congressman on
Monday called for seizure of vessels owned by convicted ocean
dumpers.
   ``Under current law, it is almost worth the risk to dump
illegally because the fines and penalties are small compared to the
cost of compliance,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   The ocean dumping of municipal solid waste or hazardous waste
carries a maximum $50,000 fine. Congress enacted legislation last
year that makes the dumping of medical waste a felony with fines up
to $250,000.
   Gejdenson said his legislation, introduced in the House on
Monday, would give the federal government ``additional muscle'' by
allowing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice
Department to recommend permanent seizure of vessels used to
illegally dump waste in the oceans or the Long Island Sound.
   Under the bill, the Coast Guard would seize the ship if the
dumper is convicted and the judge in the case approves seizure as a
sentencing option.
   Unlike the controversial ``zero tolerance'' policy, a
dumping-connected seizure could only take place following a
conviction, Gejdenson said. The administration's anti-drug policy
allows the Coast Guard to seize most recreational vessels
immediately if any amount of drugs is found on board.
   ``This bill would protect the rights of boaters while sending a
strong message to illegal dumpers that their actions will no longer
be tolerated,'' Gejdenson said.
   The Connecticut Democrat said while East Coast beach closures
triggered by the illegal dumping of medical waste captured the
public's attention last summer, ocean dumping has much broader
economic and environmental effects. He pointed to the impact on
shellfish and commercial fishing.
   The administration has not announced a position on the
legislation, although President Bush vowed during the campaign to
push for stronger anti-dumping measures.

killed two people in the second British Rail accident in 48 hours,
and the government came under pressure to investigate safety on its
state-owned tracks.
   More than 40 people suffered mostly minor injuries in the 1 p.m.
accident when the two trains drove into each other two miles east of
Glasgow center, said Scotrail.
   The last two injured _ a train driver and a passenger _ were
taken from the wreckage about four hours after the accident, said
Billy Caldwell, a spokesman for the state-owned company. Killed were
the other driver and a passenger.
   The 44 injured were taken to hospitals, where five were admitted
for the night, Caldwell said.
   On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured in a collision
of two British Rail trains near Purley Station on London's southern
outskirts. The ``preliminary conclusion'' of an investigation into
that crash said human error was the cause, the company said.
   Scotrail is a division of British Rail, whose safety records have
been under assault since December when a three-train crash killed 35
people at Clapham Junction near London.
   In the House of Commons, the opposition Labor Party's transport
spokesman and other lawmakers attacked the government Transport
Secretary Paul Channon on the railroad's safety record.
   The Scottish crash ``confirms ... that we have been putting
insufficient resources into preventing these accidents,'' said
lawmaker John Prescott, Labor's transport spokesman.
   ``The government's policy is clearly on trial,'' he said.
   Scottish National Party lawmaker Jim Sillars said, ``it is time
we did not have single inquiries into accidents of this kind, but a
comprehensive review of the standing of BR (British Rail) in
relation to government policy as it relates to safety,'' he said.
   Channon acknowledged concern but denied government budget-cutting
was a factor.
   ``The fact that there have been two serious accidents on British
Rail and now a third within three months is naturally a cause for
concern,'' Channon said.
   He said inquiry boards into the latest two accidents will be
ordered to report quickly, and he added: ``I agree there is public
concern about British Rail and about safety on the railways.''
   He said investment in the state-run railway is at a record $963
million this year due to rise to an average $1.29 billion annually
for the next four years.
   In the Glasgow accident, the two short trains carrying about 70
passengers were traveling between the suburbs of Springburn and
Milngavie when they collided. Each was going about 30 mph, he said.
   A warning explosive went off on the track before the accident,
apparently triggered by a signalman in a box at the side of the
track, but ``it was too late,'' said Caldwell.
   That section of the track had been converted several years ago
from a double to a single track to save money, said Scotrail, but it
insisted it should have been safe.
   ``We were all sitting down in the train, and suddenly there was a
large bang. People were thrown about all over the place,'' said
Colin Smith, a student who was on one train.
   After Saturday's crash, investigators found signs the driver of
one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal before his train
struck another London-bound train.
   British Rail said Monday a technical examination supported ``a
preliminary conclusion that the accident was caused by human error
on the part of the driver.''
   The driver was one of 94 people injured when his train, traveling
from Littlehampton to London, hit a train traveling from Horsham to
the capital. Police said Monday that 31 people remained
hospitalized, 10 in serious condition.
   Six cars rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash, and
several came to rest in the yards of homes.
   On Dec. 12, three trains crashed near busy Clapham Junction
during rush hour, killing 35 people. Railway officials believe a
malfunctioning signal caused that crash.
   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Channon saying she was
``greatly distressed'' to learn of the third accident Monday.
Princess Diana, wife of Prince Charles, visited survivors of the
Purley crash at a London hospital.

<HEAD>Former Klan Leader Apologizes For Picture With Nazi</HEAD>

   State Rep. David Duke apologized to the
Louisiana House on Monday for newspaper photos of him shaking hands
with a Nazi, saying it was an attempt to discredit him.
   ``Because of my controversial background, the media saw it as an
opportunity to discredit me,'' Duke told the House, saying he found
the ideology of Nazis ``abhorrent.''
   Duke shook hands with Art Jones, vice chairman of the American
Nazi Party, after he spoke Saturday at the Chicago convention of the
right-wing Populist Party of America.
   About 200 people attended the convention, some of whom identified
themselves as Klansmen and neo-Nazis.
   Duke, elected as a Republican last month, told his colleagues
that he did not know Jones and had no idea he was affiliated with a
Nazi movement.
   Duke's Nazi ties were an issue during the legislative race he won
by a narrow margin Feb. 18. His opponents noted that his 1988
presidential campaign, in which he ran as the Populist Party's
candidate, was managed by a former Nazi leader.
   Only after shaking hands with Jones did the lawmaker discover
that the man was ``a Nazi kook,'' Duke told the House.
   ``My politics in this House will be on a high plane. I call for
equal rights, for non-discrimination. I'm deeply sorry for the
embarrassment this may have caused you,'' he said.
   The House had no reaction to his comments.

<HEAD>Bush Supports Arms Cutbacks, with Nuclear Backup, in Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, voicing skepticism about
changes in the Soviet Union, said Monday he supports ``lower levels
of armaments'' in Europe but with a continued backup by nuclear
weapons.
   ``For America and its allies, a survivable nuclear force will
remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression,'' Bush told a
conference of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   He made the comments as the Soviet Union proposed heavy
reductions in troops and armor in Europe and urged negotiations to
eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the continent.
   The president also used his appearance before the veterans group
to reiterate support for his embattled nominee for secretary of
defense, calling John Tower ``a fellow veteran'' and ``a fighter.''
   ``And now he and I are fighting for what I think are some very
important principles _ principles that the American people
understand, like fairness and truth,'' Bush said.
   He also told the VFW, which boasts a national membership of 2.3
million, that he wanted to enlist its help to fight ``a threat no
less real than the adversaries you have battled'' _ drug abuse.
   ``Your nation needs you again,'' Bush said. ``Meet with other
leaders in your community _ church, clergy, law enforcement
officers. Tell them the VFW volunteers are ready to help.''
   Standing before a giant American Flag, Bush told his audience:
   ``You have my word. As long as I am president, America will stand
fast on the front line in defense of freedom.''
   On the ``key issue of change within the Soviet Union,'' Bush
said, ``there are still far more questions than answers.''
   He suggested that there remains great uncertainty on ``the
ultimate outcome of the events unfolding in the USSR.''
   ``America and her allies must recognize that, even in light of
the military cuts proposed by President Gorbachev, the Soviet Union
remains the most formidable military power facing the free world.''
   In Vienna, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called
Monday for percentage reductions of troops, tactical nuclear weapons
and combat aircraft in Europe by both the East and the West.
   Shevardnadze proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and
``the main categories of arms'' by 10 to 15 percent over the next
two to three years, and by larger amounts thereafter.
   The Soviet proposal went far beyond the reductions NATO plans to
suggest at conventional arms talks beginning Thursday. Bush did not
specifically address Shevardnadze's comments in the speech to the
VFW.
   Bush called for ``an active effort in arms control to strive for
increased stability at lower levels, lower levels of armaments.''
   But he said he would oppose any attempt by Congress to withdraw
U.S. troops from Europe unilaterally.
   ``Imprudent unilateral reductions are not the path to peace and
security and freedom,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Warrant Officer Pleads Guilty to Spy Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army warrant officer pleaded guilty to 10
espionage charges at the opening of his court-martial Monday under
an agreement that prohibits the government from seeking the death
penalty.
   Warrant Officer James W. Hall III, 30, of New York City, admitted
that he participated from 1983 to 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver
classified military information to representatives of East Germany
and the Soviet Union.
   Hall's civilian attorney, Vaughn E. Taylor, said Hall is ``truly
sorry for whatever damage he may have done to national security''
will ``throw himself on the mercy of the military judge.''
   Col. Howard C. Eggers, the military judge presiding at the
court-martial at Fort McNair in southwest Washington, did not
immediately accept Hall's guilty plea.
   Under Army regulations, Eggers will hear the prosecution's case
against Hall and defense witnesses before deciding guilt and
punishment. Court officials said the final verdict and sentence
probably will not come before Friday.
   Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security
clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., and accused of
delivering exposed film and documents dealing with communications
intelligence and war plans to Warsaw Pact nations.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in 1976 and spent most of
his career in Europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and
telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Under the plea agreement, Hall waived his right to a grand
jury-type hearing to determine if a court-martial was warranted. He
also agreed to be tried by a single military judge, rather than a
panel of officers.
   Hall also agreed to submit to ``unlimited debriefing'' and
polygraph examination by government officials and to testify, if
called, at grand jury proceedings against Huseyin Yildirim, a
Turkish-born, naturalized citizen to whom Hall allegedly passed the
classified information.
   Taylor said through a military spokesman that the defense would
have no comment on Hall's motivation for passing classified
information until after he has been questioned by Eggers during the
closed part of the court-martial.
   The maximum punishment Hall could receive, since the Army agreed
not to seek the death penalty, is life in prison, forefeiture of all
pay and allowances, dishonorable discharge and a fine.
   The plea agreement, however, outlines the sentence that Hall will
receive, unless the presiding judge, who is not permitted to see the
sentencing agreement, imposes a lighter sentence. If the judge
imposes a sentence that is harsher than the one in the agreement,
the agreement will prevail.
   Taylor said Hall will not ``comment at any time now or in the
future'' on the espionage case or his involvement with classified
materials while in the Army. Part of the plea agreement requires
that Hall sign away any profits that might accrue to him in the
future from any publication based on his involvement in the
espionage case.
   A statement of the facts in the espionage case, which Hall told
Eggers was ``mostly written by myself,'' was included in the plea
agreement, but it was not made public.
   Hall's father, James W. Hall Sr., his wife, and one of his
children were in the military courtroom when the court-martial
began. They are expected to testify later in the week in Hall's
behalf.
   ``His family was totally uninvolved and unaware of his
activities,'' Taylor said, ``and Hall will spend the remainder of
his life working to prove that he eventually deserves to be reunited
with his wife and children.''

   President Bush won't push yet for a bill
banning secondary picketing but is ready to move quickly if the
strike against Eastern Airlines spreads, a White House spokesman
said Monday.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of a House aviation subcommittee
scheduled a hearing for Tuesday and said he hoped for quick action
on separate legislation to force Bush to appoint an emergency board
and end the strike for 60 days.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., suggested his legislation ``might
give cover to the administration'' for the emergency action Bush
refused to take on Friday before the strike began.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that as long
as Eastern's striking members of the Machinists union refrain from
picketing other airlines or railways, ``we wouldn't find it
necessary to send up the legislation'' barring such secondary action.
   But Fitzwater said the administration is prepared ``to move
rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.''
   The million-member International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers has said it would picket other airlines and
railways but called off the secondary actions, at least temporarily,
after a New York court ruled that other workers mustn't honor such
picket lines. The union is appealing.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said he and Bush were
pleased that the strike by Eastern's Machinists had not spread.
   ``We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has
occurred,'' Skinner said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``That's an act
of responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are very
appreciative.''
   Skinner met with Bush in the White House Sunday night, Fitzwater
said.
   Asked if the president had second thoughts about refusing to
invoke the Railway Labor Act to stop the strike, the spokesman said:
``We have no indication of any change.''
   Fitzwater said Bush was receiving ``daily briefings'' on the
situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the
company and the union in negotiations rather than through government
intervention.
   In Congress, the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works
Committee announced a hearing Tuesday on Bush's decision against
intervening before 8,500 Machinists union members walked off the job
at Eastern. Most pilots and flight attendants refused to cross the
picket lines, and Eastern was reduced to a relatively few flights
during the weekend.
   Bush on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators
and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board, which would have
delayed a strike for at least 60 days.
   Union president William Winpisinger, on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said it was ``incomprehensible to me'' that Bush did not
step in and stop the strike.
   Winpisinger said Bush's action supported Frank Lorenzo, head of
Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp., whom the union accuses of
wanting to shut down and sell off money-losing Eastern.
   The union president said the administration threat to go to
Congress in an effort to end secondary picketing rights ``is
absolutely pro-Lorenzo, pro-company and pro-management, and it's a
continuation of the Reagan administration attitude. That's union
busting.''
   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Rep. Oberstar said Tuesday's
hearing would look into both sides in the strike, and he promised
quick action on his bill to force a resolution by a presidentially
appointed mediation board.
   Oberstar did not contend that the strike has reached
``emergency'' proportions. But he called it part of ``a long-term
problem with broad implications for the airline industry. If not an
emergency, this is a matter of great public interest.''
   Skinner and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland are to appear at the
hearing.

   The government on Monday said
Switzerland's prosecutor general has resigned effective Sept. 1, the
second top official to step down in a political scandal involving
allegations of wrongdoing in drug investigations.
   Prosecutor General Rudolf Gerber also was granted an immediate
leave of absence as authorities investigated whether he slowed a
drug inquiry that led to the resignation of former Justice Minister
Elisabeth Kopp.
   Justice Minister Arnold Koller announced the decision based on a
preliminary report by a special investigator, former Supreme Court
Chief Justice Arthur Haefliger.
   The investigator was appointed shortly after Mrs. Kopp's Jan. 11
resignation. Mrs. Kopp was accused of tipping her lawyer husband
about a drug investigation involving the company of which he was
vice president.
   The scandal led to speculation that drug traffickers and certain
companies were protected by government officials.
   The report found Swiss efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking
were 10 to 15 years behind those of its neighbors and cited
shortcomings in the Justice Ministry. Gerber was accused of several
mistakes, including an apparent slowness in the Kopp affair.
   But Haefliger said there was insufficient evidence to suggest
Gerber toned down internal reports on the involvement of Mrs. Kopp's
husband in the affair. Apparently responding to media allegations,
Haefliger said nothing pointed to punishable or ``scandalous'' deeds
in the Justice Ministry.
   Gerber, 61, has denied any wrongdoing and asked for the
investigation to clear his name, Koller said.

   Eastern Airlines laid off 5,000 workers and shut
down nearly all its operations today, saying it couldn't continue to
fly while pilots honored a 3-day-old Machinists walkout.
   ``We cannot run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said in Miami. ``We cannot continue to
inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford the steady financial
drain.''
   He said Eastern would concentrate on operating its most
profitable routes _ its Northeast shuttle and flights between Miami,
Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile.
   Earlier, Eastern asked a federal judge to bar pilots from taking
part in the Machinists' strike and order them back to work.
   Eastern filed the request with U.S. District Judge Edward B.
Davis, who did not immediately schedule a hearing. The strike has
nearly shut down the airline, which says it had expected more pilots
to stay on the job.
   The airline asked that the judge order the Air Line Pilots
Association to cease ``any strike, any concerted refusal to report
to work, (or) disruptive behavior in any manner interfering with
(Eastern's) normal operations.''
   Eastern said the pilots, under the Railway Labor Act, must
continue negotiating a contract and may not strike until after an
official 30-day cooling-off period, as the 8,500-member Machinists
union had.
   ``We knew that was coming,'' pilots spokesman Rick Chapman said.
He said the pilots union attorneys would study the motion.
   The pilots union contends it's not on strike but is merely
honoring Machinists' picket lines.
   The walkout crippled the airline's top-priority Northeast shuttle
this morning as the work week got under way, but a court order
prevented rush-hour chaos for a half-million rail commuters. On
weekdays, the lucrative and highly competitive hourly shuttle serves
primarily business travelers.
   On Sunday, the airline told the pilots they were committing
``economic suicide'' by honoring the Machinists' strike, which began
Saturday.
   ``You can't fly without pilots,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell
said at a morning news briefing, before the lawsuit was filed.
``It's an hour-by-hour evaluation.'' Snow in New York City delayed
the few flights that were ready.
   Most of Eastern's 3,500 pilots and 5,900 flight attendants
honored the strike by the airline's 8,500 mechanics, baggage
handlers and ground crew. The strike began over Eastern's demand for
contract concessions and escalated a 17-month battle at the nation's
seventh-largest airline.
   The effects of the strike could spread Tuesday if the nation's
pilots followed their union's request to strictly observe aviation
rules starting that day.
   Only 92 of Eastern's 1,000 daily flights took off Sunday, said
Matell. The pilots' union put the figure at 68.
   The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of Eastern's
usual 100,000 daily passengers at airports around the country.
   Eastern is aiming at getting about 100 flights into the air
today, focusing special attention on its hourly Northeast shuttle
service, Matell said. Eastern is awaiting federal approval to sell
the lucrative shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   As of 10 a.m. today, six out of the normal 16 shuttle flights had
gone out, Matell said.
   ``Terrible weather has not helped,'' Matell said.
   A morning snowfall in New York forced cancellation of several
Eastern flights on the shuttle between Boston, New York and
Washington. Before the snow began, Pan Am had announced it was
doubling service on the same routes, but Eastern said it could not
immediately report the impact on its boardings.
   Tim Cook, an Eastern spokesman in New York, said the man who
usually tracked such figures was ``out throwing bags'' as airline
managers were pressed into airport duty.
   The strike had threatened to spill over into a sympathy action
today against 12 commuter railroads around the country. The
Machinists called off their plans Sunday after a judge in New York,
with its 320,000 railway commuters, issued a temporary order banning
railroad workers from honoring Eastern picket lines there.
   The same judge signed an temporary order Monday barring unionized
Amtrak workers from staging a sympathy walkout until at least 3 p.m.
Wednesday, when he will consider a longer-term stay.
   No commuting problems were reported during the morning rush hour
at New York or other cities that faced possible rail labor problems.
But the union held out the possibility it would ask the railroad
workers to walk out if a planned appeal upheld the legality of such
a sympathy strikes.
   In public appearances Sunday, Eastern President Phil Bakes
admitted that the carrier had miscalculated when it had assured
travelers there would be no major disruptions.
   Charles Bryan, negotiator for the Machinists', also apologized
for the inconvenience to travelers, but added: ``This is probably
the purest classic case of evil vs. good that's been seen in the
history of organized labor. ... These people were not workers who
were greedy or doing anything wrong.''
   By honoring the pickets and virtually shutting down the carrier,
pilots threatened Eastern's ``very existence,'' Matell said Sunday.
   ``By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economic
suicide,'' he said.
   The company late Sunday sent pilots a letter telling them to
return to work before noon Tuesday or be classified as being on
strike. Pilots who are placed in that classification and later go
back to work will be required to sign a ``preferential recall
list,'' according to the letter from Frank Causey, Eastern's chief
of pilot operations.
   The wording appears to refer to last week's U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that allowed Trans World Airways Inc. to reward flight
attendants who crossed picket lines during a strike by moving them
up the seniority list over attendants who refused to work.
   Thousands of anxious passengers holding tickets on canceled
Eastern flights spent hours in lines that snaked around airport
terminals, hoping to find seats on other airlines or get refunds.
   ``I'm not flying this stinking airline again!'' yelled John
Vannua of New York's Long Island, who had been waiting three hours
at Miami International Airport to have his ticket validated for
another carrier.
   Pickets chanted and baggage piled up at airports from San Juan,
Puerto Rico, to Los Angeles and from Miami to New York. Some Eastern
planes were stranded on Caribbean islands without crews, the company
said.
   Jesse Jackson joined pickets at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport today, and told them they should be allowed to take control
of the airline in an effort to save it. ``If Lorenzo can't fly it,
let the workers buy it,'' Jackson told cheering strikers and
supporters.
   In Washington, Air Line Pilots Association President Henry Duffy
said his union was asking all pilots nationwide to strictly follow
aviation rules starting Tuesday ``to ensure the safety of the (air
traffic) system,'' which he said had been weakened by the Eastern
disruptions.
   Duffy said the action would slow air traffic, but insisted that
was not the intent.
   Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the
deregulated airline business, Eastern has racked up nearly $2.5
billion in debt and claims daily losses of more than $1 million. It
wants $150 million in concessions from the International Association
of Machinists over four years; the union wants $50 million in raises.
   Matell said his tough remarks were not a threat that pilots could
be laid off. But Eastern may retaliate with firings. Frank Lorenzo,
who controls Eastern through his giant Texas Air Corp. holding
company, sacked striking Continental Airlines employees in 1983 and
put the carrier into bankruptcy.
   Lorenzo is the main target of the strikers' anger. He is widely
mistrusted by Eastern workers because of what they call his
triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier Continental.
Many accuse him of provoking the strike to do the same at Eastern.

   The Bush administration will seek an extra $300
million from Congress for Veterans Administration medical care this
year, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Monday.
   Edward Derwinski, the new head of the VA, had sought additional
money for the VA's medical services branch, which agency officials
have said for months is $600 million to $1 billion short of what it
needs this year.
   Derwinski, who joins the Cabinet as veterans affairs secretary on
March 15, said last week he doubted that the Office of Management
and Budget would approve a request for more money this year.
   Murkowski's announcement came at a hearing of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee on the VA's budget for the next fiscal year, which
begins Oct. 1.
   Barbara Clay, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said she was unable to confirm what Murkowski had announced
about the current year. ``The issue has been the timing of such a
request,'' she said.
   Former President Reagan had requested $29.96 billion for the VA
in the coming fiscal year, not much above the $29.77 billion in the
current year. Of those totals, $10.99 billion would be devoted to
medical care in the new year, up from $10.8 billion this year.
   The House Veterans Affairs Committee has asked the Budget
Committee to add $1.3 billion to the agency's budget for next year,
of which $1.1 billion would be for medical care.
   Derwinski has sought an additional $607 million for next year, of
which $512 million would be for medical care. Ms. Clay said it was
premature to discuss final figures for next year, which will depend
on the administration's negotiations with Congress on the overall
budget.
   Agency officials have complained to Congress they have been
forced to raid equipment and supplies accounts to keep paying
salaries.
   As an example of this process, the VA's medical director, Dr.
John Gronvall, told Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., that a new
nursing care installation at Prescott, Ariz., wouldn't open for now
even though complete.
   At the insistence of congressional appropriations committees, the
VA had ``borrowed'' $46 million in funds earmarked for equipping new
facilities to maintain ``a higher level of staff than would
otherwise be the case,'' Gronvall said.
   ``If we get a supplemental appropriation we'll pay that back,''
and the Prescott unit should be able to open later in this fiscal
year, Gronvall said.

<HEAD>Court Extends Custody for Palme Suspect Despite Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court extended the custody Monday for
a man suspected of the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme amid
charges that his continued detention was aimed at winning a
confession.
   It was the sixth time that Stockholm's district court granted
prosecutors' requests to hold Christer Pettersson, who was arrested
Dec. 14.
   Pettersson, 41, who has a history of violent crime and mental
problems, is suspected of shooting the four-term prime minister in
downtown Stockholm. Prosecutors have said they have circumstantial
evidence against him but they need further evidence to file charges.
   Astrid Holgersson, an expert in witness psychology at Stockholm
University, charged that Pettersson's detention in solitary
confinement for nearly three months was a ``psychological assault''
that could lead to a ``false confession.''
   Holgersson wrote in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that such
treatment ``can after a few days lead to serious psychological
disorders ... and a `confession' aimed at getting out of a
psychologically unbearable situation.''
   She said it appeared to be an example of ``malpractice against an
individual by the Swedish judicial system.''
   Pettersson's lawyer Arne Liljeros, who objected to previous
detention orders, raised no protest against the latest court
decision.
   ``The conditions for my client are OK,'' he told Sweden's TT news
agency. ``He is not subjected to any psychological assault.''
   ``We must accept that he is forced to be in jail for a while.
After all, there are circumstances against him,'' Liljeros was
quoted as saying.
   The search for Palme's killer produced the largest manhunt in
Swedish criminal history, centered at first on a suspected
international conspiracy. An $8 million reward offer produced no
breakthroughs.
   Pressure to solve the case prompted senior officials to sidestep
Swedish laws. The former head of the investigation, Hans Holmer, was
dismissed in 1987 amid a dispute with prosecutors over who was in
charge of the case.
   Former Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon quit in June when it
was revealed she had supported a private investigation into the
case, which included illegal wiretapping and unauthorized access to
classified documents.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Begins Family Literacy Foundation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush began her own literacy
foundation Monday, saying its goal is to break the generational
cycle of illiteracy by involving parents as well as children in
learning.
   ``It's become very clear to me that we must attack the problem of
a more literate America through the family,'' Mrs. Bush told guests
at a White House luncheon to launch the Barbara Bush Foundation for
Family Literacy.
   Mrs. Bush has been a leading advocate of reading and literacy
programs for many years. She will serve as honorary chairman of the
foundation but will not be involved in raising or spending funds.
   The premise of the new foundation is that since parents who can't
read often raise children who can't read, both generations need help
to break the cycle.
   Joan Abrahamson, chairman of the foundation board, said the group
hopes to add an ``intergenerational dimension''' to existing
successful literacy programs; provide seed money for family literacy
programs; support training for volunteers and teachers; and honor
successful volunteers, teachers and students. The foundation also
plans to publish a book highlighting successful family literacy
programs.
   President Bush made a cameo appearance at the luncheon, calling
himself ``a fly on the wall'' regarding his wife's project.
   Bush said the foundation fits with ``the concept of outreach, the
concept of 1,000 points of light, the concept of one American
helping another'' that he has tried to stress in his administration.
``I really can't think of anything that is more important than this
focal point,'' he said.
   The luncheon participants, about 80 in all, included literacy
experts from the corporate and voluntary sectors; Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan; Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos; Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole; Republican Party chairman
Lee Atwater; and James Billington, the librarian of Congress.
   Also attending were three little girls and their mothers who had
participated in family literacy programs in North Carolina, Kentucky
and Washington. The programs and families were featured in a
videotape shown at the luncheon.

   More than 5,000 parents of children
attending private schools marched through the city center Monday to
protest an education bill that could severely limit the independence
of private schools.
   Protesters Shouting ``down with the anti-constitutional and
anti-democratic bill,'' marched to the Parliament building, where
they spoke against the proposed legislation.
   If passed, the bill will strengthen the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement's hold over management, financing and day-to-day
running of private schools.
   The legislation, which would also affect foreign private schools
operating in Greece, is slated for discussion in Parliament before
the end of the month, Education Ministry officials said.
   Education Minister George Papandreou, the son of socialist
Premier Andreas Papandreou, has denied the bill aims at abolishing
private schools.
   More than 100,000 pupils attend 486 private institutions in
Greece.

   An Italian human rights worker said
Monday he was kidnapped and tortured with lighted cigarettes by
three men who identified themselves as members of a ``death squad.''
   Luis Tenderini, head of the Justice and Peace Commission of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Recife and Olinda, 1,500 miles
northeast of Rio, said he was driving home Saturday night when a car
with three men forced him to stop.
   Tenderini, 46, said the men took him to an isolated area and for
two hours burned him with cigarettes on the chest and forehead and
threatened to kill him.
   Tenderini, who has lived in Brazil for 20 years, said he believed
he was targeted because the commission has been pressing the state
government to investigate the death squad's activities.
   The death squads, made up of off-duty and retired policemen,
first appeared in Brazil during the 1964-85 right-wing military
government. They summarily executed known or suspected criminals and
political opponents of the regime.
   Since 1987, death squads have executed about 500 people in
Recife, according to church estimates.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Monday proposed huge
reductions in troops and armor and recommended that the Warsaw Pact
and NATO negotiate to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from
Europe.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevarndadze's proposals went far
beyond the reductions NATO plans to suggest at conventional arms
talks that begin Thursday.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity,
said Shevardnadze's purpose in proposing the missile talks was ``to
see whether possible fissures in the alliance could be developed.''
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as one of the most positive
characteristics'' of Shevardnadze's speech, the official said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told 35 foreign ministers
gathered in a baroque palace that the West's goal, at least
initially, is to reduce the Warsaw Pact's current advantage in
conventional forces.
   Estimates vary but give the Soviet-led alliance at least a 2-1
advantage in tanks.
   ``The Warsaw Pact's conventional military preponderance,
especially in the spearheads of attack, is what makes an invasion
possible,'' Baker said.
   He urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to implement the
``new thinking'' that guides economic and political reform in the
Soviet Union by renouncing the Brezhnev Doctrine ``beyond any shadow
of a doubt.''
   That doctrine permits military intervention in a Soviet bloc
country in the event of a liberal insurrection. The late President
Leonid I. Brezhnev introduced it after the Red Army crushed the
liberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Those in the East should be free of the fear that armed Soviet
intervention, justified by the Brezhnev Doctrine, would be used
again to deny them choice,'' Baker said.
   He also said Australia would organize a conference to prevent the
spread of chemical weapons and the Bush administration was exploring
ways to speed the removal of U.S. chemical weapons from West Germany.
   Baker added, however: ``Unilateral action is not enough. The
Soviet Union has enormous stocks of chemical weapons threatening
Europe. We therefore call on the Soviets to join us, to accelerate
the destruction of their enormous stockpile of these frightening
weapons.''
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: ``I welcome this intention
to explore ways for the early removal of chemical weapons from the
Federal Republic.''
   Kohl's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, said earlier Baker
telephoned the chancellor Saturday night and told him the aging U.S.
chemical weapons would be withdrawn by 1992.
   Shevardnadze countered a NATO proposal to retire at least 25,000
Warsaw Pact tanks, then reduce armor, artillery and personnel
carriers on both sides by 5-10 percent with a three-phase plan for
radical cuts.
   The foreign minister's arms reduction program went far beyond
NATO's by adding missiles, combat aircraft and soldiers.
   ``Let me ask what kind of reductions are these if they do not
affect the main component of armed forces _ their personnel?'' he
said. ``And surely airplanes and helicopters can be used for a
surprise attack.''
   In the Soviet second phase, 500,000 men on each side would be
demobilized.
   According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private U.S.
research group, the Warsaw Pact has 3.09 million soldiers and NATO
more than 2.13 million. NATO spends about $300 billion a year to
defend Western Europe, where 326,000 Americans are stationed.
   As Shevardnadze explained it, the Soviet plan's progression would
be:
   _ First phase, two to three years: Eliminate the imbalance in
troops and arms, cutting 10 percent to 15 percent from the current
lowest numbers.
   _ Second, also two to three years: Reduce forces by another 25
percent and withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons to a safe distance
from ``the line of contact'' between the military alliances. That
would make much of West Germany, along with East Germany and
Czechoslovakia a nuclear-free zone.
   _ Third: Convert remaining forces to ``a strictly defensive
character.''
   While the reductions are made, Shevardnadze said, negotiations
should be conducted on eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   His proposal conflicts with the 40-year-old U.S. policy of
deterring the Soviets with with a mix of weaponry incuding
battlefield nuclear arms, which have a maximum range of 300 miles.
   Kohl wants to delay modernizing U.S. Lance missiles in West
Germany for up to three years, with the support of Norway and
officials of other West European governments. Baker is trying to
change the chancellor's mind.
   In December, Gorbachev announced a unilateral withdrawal of six
Soviet tank divisions and 50,000 men from Eastern Europe and said
Soviet forces in Europe and Asia would be reduced by 500,000.
   How Shevardnadze's three-phase reduction fits into that is not
clear. The foreign minister provided few details of an obviously
complicated proposition.
   Baker said in his speech the Warsaw Pact has 3-1 advantages in
tanks and artillery and more than 2-1 in armored troop carriers.
   He said Gorbachev's offer was ``a good start,'' but the Warsaw
Pact would retain a 2-1 edge in tanks and artillery even after the
Soviet leader's reductions.

   An avalanche in the French Alps on Monday
killed two men, including a ski instructor, who were skiing off the
trail near the Val d'Isere resort, police said.
   The instructor, Georges Simon, and an unidentified companion were
killed in the avalanche near Tignes, eight miles from the Val
d'Isere ski resort, police in Grenoble said.
   A third man was hospitalized in critical condition, said the
police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A woman skiing with the group was found uninjured about 10
minutes after the avalanche by rescue workers who saw her ski
sticking through the snow, police said.
   The group had been off trail and was ignoring elementary safety
rules, police said.
   Seven avalanches reported over the weekend left two skiers dead
and dozens injured. French authorities have advised skiers to stay
on the alpine trails, especially during the warm afternoons.

   The U.S. government said Monday it regrets a
Laotian decision to postpone a joint excavation of the site of the
crash of an American plane that went down during the Indochina war.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said he understood the
delay was related to a U.S. government report last week which
criticized Laos' performance in international efforts to curb drug
abuse.
   ``I don't have the exact text of what they said, but I think
that's the sense,'' he said.
   A team of U.S. experts had been scheduled to fly to Laos over the
weekend for the excavation, but Laotian officials delayed the
project, which was part of the U.S. effort to locate the remains of
missing U.S. military personnel.
   ``We regret that the Lao government has temporarily postponed
plans for a joint crash-site excavation, which had been scheduled to
start March 4th,'' Redman said.
   ``The US and Laos have been working together closely to
accelerate cooperation to resolve the issue of Americans still
missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Laos,'' he added.
   Redman noted that four excavations have already been conducted,
going back to February 1985.
   ``We hope that the delay of this fifth excavation will be brief,
and are prepared to send our team of technical experts to Laos
immediately, once the Lao reschedule this important humanitarian
effort,'' he said. ``We also look forward to expanding our dialogue
and cooperation on narcotics matters.''
   The annual U.S. international narcotics control report said there
had been no reduction in opium production in Laos in the previous
year and that heroin refining continues.
   ``And there continues to be information that the extensive
involvement of ... military and civilian government officials in the
narcotics trade suggests this is a matter of de facto government
policy,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Report 3,500 Mozambicans Starved to Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic missionaries say 3,500
people have starved to death this year in the remote northeastern
part of war-torn Mozambique, the national news agency AIM reported
Monday.
   It was the first indication of mass starvation in the isolated
coastal district of Memba. AIM quoted the missionaries as saying all
the deaths occurred in Memba, 240 miles south of the border with
Tanzania.
   Widespread food shortages affect Mozambique, and an estimated 6
million of the country's 15 million people need food aid.
   AIM's report of starvation deaths could not be confirmed
independently. An AIM reporter who visited the region last week
wrote that he witnessed five deaths from starvation in one town on a
single day.
   The region has been hard hit by the country's 12-year-old civil
war and a yearlong drought.
   Threats of attacks by rightist rebels, combined with poor roads
and transportation have made it difficult for the government and
relief agencies to provide regular supplies to the remote region,
AIM said.
   The agency also reported an estimated 600,000 people, most
children, have died as a result of the war.
   Citing a report produced jointly by UNICEF and the Mozambican
government, AIM said the overall casualty figure includes deaths of
494,000 children ``from causes directly attributable to malnutrition
associated with the war.''
   Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries. Two of every
10 babies born here die before their first birthday, according to
the UNICEF report. As many as 375 children out of 1,000 die before
the age of five, among the highest rates in the world, the report
said.
   The war pits the Marxist government against guerrillas of the
Mozambique National Resistance, whose hit-and-run attacks on
civilian and military targets have severely disrupted the country's
economy.
   South Africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s, but says it
has ceased assistance despite Mozambican claims that Pretoria's
support continues.
   Rebel attacks shut down 822 health clinics between 1982 and 1987.
Only 567 of those have been rebuilt, the report said.
   ``Some preventive activities, such as vaccination campaigns, have
to be organized almost clandestinely in order to prevent them from
becoming a target,'' the report added.
   A U.S. State Department report last year estimated that 100,000
people were killed in the war from 1985 to 1987.

   About 600 people Monday rallied at the
Environmental Ministry to protest a power plant on the Danube River
that critics say will destroy unique wildlife and threaten water
supplies.
   The protest was held two days before parliament was likely to
reopen debate on the issue.
   At least 120,000 Hungarians opposed to building the Nagymaros
power plant on the Danube River have signed a petition calling for a
referendum on the project, the government MTI news agency said.
   Laszlo Vit, a spokesman for Danube Circle, the main opposition
group to the dam, told demonstrators the petition was sent to
parliament and demanded the government publish costs of the dam
project.
   Representatives of Danube Circle launched their campaign in
November, a month after parliament decided to go ahead with the
project.
   The government, citing prior contractual obligations to
Czechoslovakia and Austria, has said construction will continue. A
halt would trigger huge penalty payments and a loss of prestige, the
government has said.

<TEXT>
   Government and opposition negotiators had a
stormy session Monday over a Solidarity proposal to reduce 60
percent inflation by tying wages to the cost of living, opposition
economists said.
   The ``round table'' talks on economic and political reform
entered their fifth week with delegates from both sides under
pressure from their leaders to reach agreement by late this month.
   Lech Walesa, who founded Solidarity in 1980 and is trying to get
the union made legal again, said he probably will have his second
meeting with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak in less than a week
about problems in the talks.
   Members of the Communist Party Central Committee and leaders of
provincial party organizations convened to hear reports on progress.
The meeting was called a ``consultation,'' not a formal party
session, but was expected to produce advice for the government
negotiators.
   Walesa has said he expects new ``political decisions'' intended
to move the talks forward.
   About the indexing question, opposition economist Andrzej
Wielowieyski said: ``We had the impression today the government side
blocked itself. ... We are going to face a very difficult situation
tomorrow. I think the situation is very difficult and very
dangerous,''
   Wielowieyski, a member of the working group on economic issues,
said officials feared indexing would limit the authority of managers
who control pay decisions.
   He said Solidarity leaders decided Sunday the government must
agree to a form of indexation if it expects union agreement to a
package of reforms that includes opposition membership in Parliament.
   ``Our demand for indexing is the indispensable condition,''
Wielowieyski said.
   Solidarity believes wages must be indexed to inflation, at least
temporarily, to give workers some sense of security while economic
reforms are introduced.
   Deputy Premier Ireneusz Sekula said on state television the
government believes some indexing is needed, but ``it has to be
introduced in a prudent manner so it does not disturb ... the
motivating function of pay.''
   Walesa came to Warsaw by train Monday from Gdansk, where he works
as a shipyard electrician, and he met with opposition delegates to
the talks, said Piotr Konopka, a spokesman for the union leader. He
would not give details.
   Working groups on trade union problems and youth issues also
reported no progress Monday.
   Although the union has resolved the issue of how to legalize
Solidarity and other unions, it is stalled on the mechanics of
organizing.
   The youth subgroup had no problems with a proposal to make the
Independent Students Association legal again, but government
negotiators said they want a broader agreement under which the
opposition would endorse a statement on values in rearing children.
   ``Today's discussion of the youth table resembled a mental
hospital rather than negotiations,'' said Andrzej Celinski, leader
of the opposition team.
   Slawomir Wiatr, a government delegate, said it was possible no
agreement would be reached in the youth talks, but added that the
decision to legalize the student association might be made at a
higher level.
   Walesa has expressed optimism in recent days about the
unprecedented talks between communist authorities and the opposition
movement led by Solidarity.
   The talks are aimed at producing a compromise under which the
government would legalize Solidarity and other banned groups in
exchange for their help with a reform program.
   Solidarity, the first independent union movement in the Soviet
bloc, was banned after martial law was imposed in December 1981.

   Security forces have arrested a Palestinian who
allegedly made numerous anonymous telephone calls falsely claiming
he kidnapped a missing Israeli soldier, a military spokesman said
Monday.
   He said the suspect, an unidentified resident of Gaza Strip's
Mughazi refugee camp, made calls to ``several elements'' in which he
demanded the release of all Palestinian prisoners in exchange for
the soldier's freedom.
   Avi Sassportas, 21, has been missing since Feb. 16 when he
disappeared on his way from the army to his home in the coastal city
of Ashdod.
   ``An investigation showed the caller has no connection to the
missing soldier,'' said the military spokesman. ``He made the calls
with the intention of trying to release a friend of his who is in
jail in Israel.''
   He declined to identify the suspect, against whom no official
charges have been filed.
   An anonymous caller last week telephoned prominent Palestinian
lawyer Fayez Abu Rahmeh in Gaza City, the Agence France Presse news
bureau in Jerusalem and Israel Radio. He said Sassportas had been
kidnapped by a group called the Palestinian Arab Army, and promised
to deliver a cassette proving they are holding the soldier.
   No cassette was delivered. The group the caller identified has
not been heard of previously.
   The military spokesman, who by custom is not named, said it was
not yet clear whether the suspect made all the telephone calls.
   ``The matter is still under investigation,'' he said.

   Paid pitches for jeans, a candy bar and
dandruff shampoo were mixed in with a fast-paced menu of current
events Monday as Channel One, the televised news show for
teen-agers, had its first school day.
   The paid advertising on the show, which is produced by
Knoxville-based Whittle Communications LP, has enraged some
education groups who want Big Business barred from making sales
pitches to students inside the classroom.
   The fourth 30-second commercial was a public service announcement
for the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.
   Students, teachers and parents who witnessed Channel One's debut
at Central High expressed few reservations about the ads.
   `It's fine with me,'' said Shelley Bible, a 14-year-old freshman.
`You get more pressure from other students than you do from the
commercials.''
   Toi McCane, a 17-year-old senior, said the commercials ``are just
the same thing you get on the news at night.''
   The 12-minute program included two minutes of commercials.
   Whittle Communications is a media concern that has developed
magazines and posters that can be used by advertisers to reach
narrowly defined audiences, such as people in doctors' waiting rooms.
   Channel One is Whittle Communications' first venture into
television, and groups such as the National Parent-Teacher
Association and the National Association of Secondary School
Principals are opposing sending commercials into school along with
the news show.
   `They are trying to make it a part of every school day, and this
medium has a much stronger impact than any other,'' said Tari
Marshal, a spokeswoman for the National PTA.
   Christopher Whittle, the company's chairman, said schools can't
afford the equipment and level of programming he is providing as
part of the Channel One project.
   The company has provided each of the six test schools with about
$50,000 worth of television monitors, video recording equipment and
a satellite dish on which they can receive the daily show.
   In addition to Central, the show debuted Monday at Billerica
Memorial High School in Billerica, Mass., Mumford High School in
Detroit, Gahr High School in Cerritos, Calif., and Eisenhower Middle
School in Kansas City, Kan.
   The sixth test school, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, was
closed Monday by bad weather.
   If the test proves successful, Whittle hopes to expand it
nationally to as many as 8,000 schools in the fall of 1990.
   In exchange for the equipment, the schools agree to run the news
show once each school day.
   After the show began with flashy graphics, two youthful anchors
read headlines illustrated with purchased film footage about the
Eastern Airlines strike, the battle over John Tower's nomination as
secretary of defense and life as a Soviet teen-ager.
   The show's last segment dealt with the controversy over Channel
One itself.
   In Connie Wilkes's senior homeroom class, all 20 students
appeared to follow the show intently, fidgeting only during the
shampoo commercial.
   Whittle gave the show high marks for content, but said the
broadcast's pacing needed some work and his anchors needed to
``loosen up a bit.''
   He said the complaints had not deterred any advertisers who have
signed up for the test run which will involve 25 shows over the next
seven weeks.
   Eight advertisers have signed up, he said, and he is courting
four more. No show will have more than two minutes of commercials,
Whittle said.
   Earl Hoffmeister, superintendent of the Knox County public school
system, said he thinks the show's educational value was worth two
minutes of paid ads. Besides, he said, ``kids don't pay a lot of
attention to commercials anyway.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says Republican Group Trying to Sway Vote on Wright</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Texas Democrat said Monday that Republican
``propaganda terrorists'' are trying to intimidate GOP members of
the House ethics committee into voting against House Speaker Jim
Wright and ought to be punished.
   Rep. Ron Coleman of El Paso said the ``righteous right'' is
operating its lobbying effort from within the House and is behind
``a mailing insisting Republicans have to be unified and anything
short of censure or expulsion would be a whitewash.'' He said, ``It
sounds like a vigilante group ... out of the last century with a
`hang him regardless of the evidence' mentality.''
   The ethics committee has been meeting behind closed doors over a
series of ethics charges against Wright, including allegations he
used his office for personal financial gain. An independent counsel
has spent nine months investigating the charges.
   Wright has denied violating any law or rule of the House,
although he has conceded he might have done some things differently
if given the chance to do them over.
   The panel, evenly split with Republican and Democratic members,
met to consider the independent counsel's findings last week, and
the outcome of the investigation may be known sometime this week.
   Speaking on the House floor Thursday, Coleman decried the actions
of a number of Wright's Republican opponents, including Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
   Recent news accounts ``make it clear this small band of
propaganda terrorists has been plotting all along, on a series of
conspiracies to discredit Speaker Wright and other Democrats,''
Coleman said. ``Moreover, they are cynically trying to intimidate
Republican members of the ethics committee into finding some
complaint against the speaker to be valid.''
   Coleman said the group's efforts are ``tantamount to jury
tampering and it's criminal.'' He is proposing the House adopt
sanctions, such as censure or expulsion, for members found to have
improperly influenced members of the ethics committee.
   Gingrich did not respond immediately to requests to his office
for an interview.

<TEXT>
   Helicopter gunships and navy gunboats of
the army's Christian command patrolled Lebanon's territorial waters
under Druze rocket fire Monday to prevent foreign merchant ships
from using illegal port facilities operated by feuding militias.
   The move, aimed at choking off the main revenues of Christian and
Moslem private armies, has triggered a political crisis in the
Moslem camp.
   Police said neither of the army's two French-built Gazelle
gunships was hit when militiamen of Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt
fired rocket launchers near the port of Jiye, 15 miles south of
Beirut.
   To underscore Moslem objections to the Christian patrols, the
Moslem army command ordered the closing of a Green Line crossing
point linking the capital's Christian and Moslem sectors only one
week after rival military forces reopened it.
   A communique issued by the command of Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, who
heads Moslem army units in west Beirut, said the decision to close
the crossing at Beirut port was made on orders from Acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss' Moslem cabinet.
   The communique said the Christians' sea and air patrols were
``provocative acts.''
   The makeshift harbor at Jiye has been the main sea outlet for the
Druze community, a Moslem sect based mainly in the Chouf mountains,
since they captured it from the Christians in 1985.
   A Defense Ministry communique said foreign ships heading for
Lebanon have been warned not to enter any of the militia-controlled
harbors along the Mediterranean country's 110-mile coastline.
   The ban was ordered Sunday by Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the
Christian military cabinet vying for power with Hoss' Syrian-backed
government.
   It was part of Aoun's campaign to restore state authority, eroded
by 14 years of civil war in which Christian and Moslem militias took
over many government functions.
   The militias use the ports to bring in arms and supplies as well
as imported goods sold in the areas they control, depriving the
state treasury of an estimated $100 million a year in customs duties.
   ``We're not forcibly shutting militia harbors or blockading them.
... We are merely blocking foreign ships from going there,'' a
Defense Ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   ``If a ship insists on violating the ban, it will be seized and
forced to sail into Beirut port to question its captain before
beginning legal procedures,'' said the spokesman.
   He listed five legal ports _ Beirut, Jounieh and Tripoli north of
the capital and Sidon and Tyre to the south.
   To supervise the new ban, Aoun revived a maritime authority made
up of representatives from the public works ministry, the navy, air
force, police and the customs department.
   Hoss said Monday that the ban could undermine ``the positive mood
that has lately emerged about a possible end to Lebanon's plight.''
   He was referring to mediation efforts by an Arab League committee
set up in January to help resolve a constitutional crisis that has
left the country without a president for 162 days and threatens to
formalize its de facto partition into Christian and Moslem cantons.
   President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to head an interim cabinet
when his 6-year-term expired Sept. 22 without a successor being
elected.
   Moslems refused to accept Aoun's appointment and pledged
allegiance to Hoss, who governed during the Amin presidency.
   In another development Monday, an associate of Roger Tamraz, a
Lebanese international banker, said Tamraz was kidnapped Feb. 19 and
is being held for ransom.
   But some Beirut newspapers say the 48-year-old Tamraz fled after
a run on his bank and after accusations he embezzled $200 million.
Police said they know nothing about his reported disappearance.
   Tamraz's spokesman in West Beirut could not be contacted by
telephone.
   Until recently, Tamraz was chairman of Bank Al-Mashrek, Lebanon's
second largest bank, which is involved in a liquidity crisis with
several subsidiaries, including banks in Switzerland, France, Jordan
and Qatar.

<HEAD>Soviet Coal Miners End Five-Day Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 coal miners ended a five-day strike
Monday after the government agreed to correct their pay system, a
dissident reported.
   Sergei Grigoryants, a Moscow-based journalist, said sources in
the Ural Mountain city of Vorkuta reported that 115 miners had been
striking while underground since Thursday and began a hunger strike
two days ago.
   Vorkuta, with a population of 90,000, is 1,200 miles northeast of
Moscow. It is in the Pechora Basin, one of the Soviet Union's major
coal mining regions that in 1985 produced 28 million metric tons of
bituminous coal.
   Workers in the Northern Mine began the strike to protest
increased work orders, to demand replacement of the facility's
director and chief economist and a reduction of the management
staff, according to Grigoryants. He said the strikers also demanded
changes in the salary disbursement system.
   A group of supporters, who called their organization Solidarity
after the independent union movement in Poland, pressed the miners'
case with authorities while the strikers remained underground,
according to Grigoryants.
   He said Soviet Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov arrived in
Vorkuta Saturday, negotiated with the strikers and promised to
partially meet their demands including paying them 158,000 rubles
($254,800) to compensate for problems in the salary system.
   Grigoryants said the miners announced the end of the strike on
Monday.
   The Soviet government has traditionally claimed that strikes are
inconsistent with the Communist system that places priority on the
interests of workers. But last year there were strikes of an
unprecedented scale and length in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the
dispute over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum urged the Justice
Department to review the antitrust implication of the Time-Warner
merger because he said cable television customers could be big
losers in the merger between the media giants.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said there were ``strong indications'' that
the $18 billion merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications
could substantially reduce competition and diversity in the
communications and entertainment field, particularly in the cable
television industry.
   ``Such a development is especially disturbing in light of a
continuing trend toward further concentration and reduced
possibilities for meaningful competition in cable television,''
Metzenbaum said in a letter to Charles Rule, the assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
   ``I...urge you to undertake a careful and thorough review of this
proposal,'' said Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   Vickie Togans, a staff assistant in Rule's office, said the
letter had not been received there Monday.
   Metzenbaum said the merger, which was announced Saturday, would
link two of the world's leading media and entertainment
conglomerates, creating a company worth $18 billion.
   Time publishes Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune
magazines, and owns Home Box Office, the nation's largest pay cable
service, along with HBO's sister cable service, Cinemax. Time also
owns American Television and Communications Corp., the nation's
second largest cable system.
   Warner Communications owns the Warner Bros. movie and television
studios, Warner Records and Lorimar Telepictures Corp., along with
Warner Cable Communications, the fifth largest cable system in the
nation.
   Metzenbaum said less than 1 percent of the 8,000 communities
nationwide served by cable have more than one cable system. ``Cable
is an unregulated monopoly throughout the entire country,'' he said.
   He said a Time-Warner merger could extend the dominance of the
larger multisystem cable operators over small cable companies.
   ``With the acquisition of Warner Cable systems, there is an even
greater incentive for Time to deny competing technologies its
existing programming _ and the new programming which Time-Warner is
expected to create.''
   ``It is this ability to control both the conduit for programming
(the cable wire) and the content of the programming (through MSO
equity interest in programming ventures) that poses the greatest
threat to consumers,'' Metzenbaum said.
   ``The absence of competition in the delivery of cable programming
means that consumers have no protection against unrestrained rate
hikes. The de facto editorial control which MSOs can exercise over
new programming threatens diversity of information and entertainment
sources available to cable viewers,'' he said.

   Police detained some of Latvia's leading
actors Monday after they protested an anticipated crackdown on
independent-minded journalists.
   In response, the actors canceled at least one performance.
   Ulolis Dumpis, one of those detained, said they demonstrated for
an hour outside Communist Party headquarters in Riga, capital of the
small Baltic state the Soviet Union absorbed in 1940 along with
Estonia and Lithuania.
   As the protest was ending, a police officer told the group of
about 50 people it was illegal because they had no permit, Dumpis
said.
   He said the officer gave them three minutes to disperse, but
other police moved in almost immediately and started taking people
away in two groups.
   About 15 were in his group but he could not tell how many were in
the other, the actor said. They were held for about two hours and
released without being charged, he said.
   Actors of the Latvian National Theater, Youth Theater, Theater of
Opera and Ballet and the Artistic Theater met after the detentions
to decide whether to perform.
   Aivars Bogdanovics told about 200 performers in the small hall of
the National Theater of the day's events, and they decided to cancel
the performance there.
   Dumpis spoke to about 700 people in the theater's cream-and-red
large hall and said the actors decided the play in that hall should
go on.
   Those attending the meeting were in 17th century garb for the
performance of ``Once Upon a Time There Was a Rider'' about a
struggle for peasant rights 300 years ago.
   Members of the Latvian People's Front, a grassroots group
campaigning for greater autonomy, said scheduled performances also
were given at the other theaters.
   Actors who protested outside headquarters said they expected the
authorities to act this week against up to 16 journalists working
for state television who have been accused of creating ill-feeling
between ethnic Latvians and ethnic Russians.
   Of Latvia's 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are Latvian and
33 percent Russian.
   Two television journalists, Velta Purinya and Mara Grunte, said
they were told privately they would be disciplined.
   Ms. Purinya, a member of both the Communist Party and People's
Front, said she was told the nightly public affairs program Panorama
``whips up bad feelings between Russians and Latvians'' by showing
film of demonstrations and reading letters from viewers.
   Editors of the People's Front weekly Atmoda said censors would
not let them publish an article Monday about the arrests of young
Latvians who protested conscription into the army. Atmoda appeared
Monday with pictures of scissors pasted where the article would have
been.
   Several hundred people gathered at downtown Riga's Freedom
Monument on Monday for a rally by the Movement for the National
Independence of Latvia. The rally honored Oscars Kalpaks, who
commanded the army of independent Latvia between the two world wars.
   Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania were taken over by the Soviet Union
one year after Stalin's pact with Hitler assigned the region to the
Kremlin sphere of influence.
   In January, Latvian party Janis Vagris expressed alarm about
tension in the republic, saying even the party felt the effects of
``ethnic stratification.''
   Political ferment in the Baltic states has increased in the more
liberal atmosphere fostered by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Some residents say openly their want their homelands to be
indpependent again.

   Two Air Force retirees who helped supply the
Nicaraguan Contras testified Monday they also got involved in the
Iran arms deals through an Oliver North associate, the first mention
of Iran in North's month-old trial.
   The testimony by Richard B. Gadd _ and later by Robert Dutton _
brought a quick reaction from U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
who reminded lawyers in the case, ``I asked you not to go into the
hostage situation.''
   Charges involving diversion to the Contras of profits from the
Iran arms deals were dropped earlier after the administration
complained that too much damaging classified material would have to
be disclosed in connection with those counts.
   Gesell called lawyers to the bench Monday and said bringing up
Iran and the hostages ``will extend the trial unnecessarily.''
   However, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan continued to dwell on
the Iran issue in his questioning.
   With the jury out of the courtroom, he told Gesell that the
arms-to-Iran initiative is mentioned in four of the 12 counts
remaining against North and that prosecutor John Keker repeatedly
referred to Iran in his opening statement to the jury.
   Said the 78-year-old Gesell: ``I'm simply trying to limit proof
so we could end this trial while I'm still alive.''
   Gadd testified he was brought into the Iran deals by former Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord, who told him, ``This could lead to the release
of the hostages in Lebanon.''
   ``General Secord asked me to assist in the transportation of arms
to Iran,'' Gadd testified.
   Dutton, who followed Gadd to the stand, said he went to work for
Secord the day after he retired after 20 years in the Air Force on
May 1, 1986, and was put to work on the Contra supply operation,
which was suffering from disorganization.
   He said he had worked with Secord in the 1980 attempt to rescue
the 52 American hostages held in Iran and was called by the retired
general again to help in 1986.
   Dutton was asked Monday if he believed the new effort was to be
under the authority of the president.
   Yes, he said.
   When Dutton first joined the Contra resupply operation, he said,
none of the airdrops had been successful. Signal fires that pilots
expected weren't there, radio communications didn't happen. By
September, he said, things had been whipped into shape and there had
been 15 successful missions.
   Dutton was so proud of the progress that he put together an album
of pictures and showed them to North.
   ``He said he would like to take it with him and show it to his
top boss,'' said Dutton.
   ``Who did you understand he was talking about?'' asked Michael
Bromwich, one of the prosecution lawyers.
   ``The president of the United States,'' said Dutton.
   He said North told him ``I know I ca't get you a medal, but some
day the president will shake your hand and thank you.'' But that
never happened, Dutton said.
   Dutton said the supply flights stopped after Oct. 5, 1986, when
one of the planes was shot down. The pilot, co-pilot and a Contra
were killed and the loadmaster, Eugene Hasenfus, bailed out and was
captured.
   At day's end Monday, conservative fund-raiser Carl ``Spitz''
Channel had begun testimony that was to be resumed Tuesday.
   Gadd, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, helped handle the
covert effort to ship arms to the Contras in early 1986 _ when
official U.S. military aid was barred _ and ran flights with
humanitarian aid when that was legal.
   In January 1986, Gadd said, ``I was told they desired to move
classified cargo from the United States to Iran.'' Secord, he said,
``asked if I could arrange that.''
   Secord told him, Gadd said, that flights ``must leave from the
United States, no one must know the cargo and no one must know the
ultimate destination. It could not land in Europe and could not go
through customs. And he said it was possible the aircraft and crew
could be detained in Iran and not released.''
   Gadd testified Secord became impatient while he was trying to
figure a way to meet the requirements. He quoted the former general
as saying once, ``You must figure this out. You must convince
Southern Air Transport to do the job. This could lead to the release
of the hostages.''
   Southern Air Transport, which once was CIA-owned, by that time
had been turned over to private ownership and had been used to fly
aid to the Contras.
   The company did become involved in Iran arms flights, but Gadd
was not asked that specific question.
   Gadd said Secord also asked him in 1986 to make the arrangements
to fly North and his boss, National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, to Iran.
   McFarlane earlier pleaded guilty to charges in connection with
the Iran-Contra affair and was sentenced Friday in a separate
federal court to a $20,000 fine and probation but no prison term.
   After Congress in October 1985 authorized $27 million to be spent
for humanitarian aid to the Contras, Gadd said he contracted with
the State Department to haul supplies to Central America.
   Once, lethal weapons were added to the supplies by Contra
officials when a plane stopped in El Salvador to refuel on the way
to Hondurs, Gadd said.
   Later at a meeting at the State Department, Gadd said, ``they put
it to me this should never have been done...the mix should not
exceed 10 percent'' arms and ammunition.
   Among the 12 criminal charges against North are four counts of
lying to Congress by denying his involvement in the Contra resupply
operation.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh left Monday
for Latin America to talk with the leaders of three nations about
how to curb the flow of drugs from their countries.
   A political assassination in Bogota last week prompted Thornburgh
to delay, until the end of his trip, a visit with Colombian
President Virgilio Barco, department officials said.
   Thornburgh had originally been scheduled to leave Washington on
Sunday for Columbia, the first stop on his fact-finding trip that
also includes visits to Bolivia and Peru.
   But the U.S. ambassador in Bogota recommended that Thornburgh
delay his visit to Colombia following Friday's assassination of the
leader of a leftist political party and subsequent street rioting,
said officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   David Runkel, the attorney general's spokesman, acknowledged that
security concerns prompted the schedule change.
   Thornburgh is now scheduled to visit Colombia on Thursday but the
stop in Bogota will depend on ``how things settle out'' there, said
one official.
   Thornburgh, accompanied his executive assistant, Robert S. Ross
Jr., and Jack Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, is
scheduled to meet Tuesday with Bolivian President Paz Estenssoro.
   While in Bolivia, Thornburgh is scheduled to address a meeting of
the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse and Control.
   On Wednesday, Thornburgh is set to meet in Peru with President
Alan Garcia and interior minister Armando Villanueva.
   The meeting in Colombia, originally set for Monday, will include
discussions with leaders of that nation's defense department and the
national police.
   ``This trip has been scheduled to allow me to talk directly with
leaders of these nations about our cooperative drug law enforcement
efforts,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``As the United States steps up our efforts to reduce demand for
illegal drugs, we must also push ahead with the reduction of
supply,'' Thornburgh said.

   Venezuela lifted a nationwide curfew on
Monday but kept martial law in effect after riots that officials
said killed at least 247 people and injured nearly 2,000.
   Newspaper reports have put the death toll from last week's riots
over price increases as high as 600 and the number of injured at
several thousand. Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating
2,300 people.
   Police recovered at least five more bullet-riddled bodies on
Monday in one of the slum areas ringing Caracas, and officials said
the search for more bodies continued.
   The riots were the bloodiest in this nation's modern history.
   The defense minister, Gen. Italo del Valle Alliegro, said the 8
p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew _ Venezuela's first in 25 years _ was lifted
in view of the ``normality prevailing all over the country.''
   The curfew was imposed Feb. 28, one day after riots and looting
broke out. The unrest was touched off by steep increases in bus
fares, gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services _ part
of a government austerity plan.
   Independent reports said many people were killed by stray bullets
during battles between security forces and snipers. Heavy fighting
went on until Friday, and sporadic gunfire was heard over the
weekend.
   The five bodies found Monday were of victims 20 to 25 years old
and were discovered in the San Jose area, scene of fierce fighting
Thursday and Friday. The neighborhood is a mile north of the
government's Miraflores Palace.
   Army units were deployed in west and east Caracas to quell any
snipers.
   About 15,000 troops joined police in guarding main avenues,
supermarkets and government buildings throughout the capital as long
lines of people waited to buy food.
   Under martial law, soldiers can search houses without warrants
and detain suspects indefinitely without charge.
   Student leaders said at least 100 Caracas students were under
arrest and 12 were missing.
   ``Many were taken from their houses by police and national guards
and the only explanations their parents received was that civil
rights had been indefinitely suspended,'' said Jazmin Jaimes, a
member of the University Students Federation of Caracas' Central
Univesity.
   Ms. Jaimes said police tortured one student, Vanessa Davis.
   ``She was arrested Monday, and witnesses have told us she hasn't
eaten anything since,'' she said.
   There was no official comment on the claim.
   But the defense minister denied on TV the reports of missing
people, saying the armed forces went onto the streets ``not to
repress but to re-establish the order which had been altered.''
   Primary and kindergarten schools resumed classes Monday, and
secondary schools were expected to reopen this week.
   When universities would reopen was not clear. Universities have

foreign debt.

   Police opened fire on Tibetan protesters who
marched through Lhasa and burned Chinese businesses Monday in a
second straight day of violence. Four Tibetans were reported killed.
   Security forces moved into the city's Tibetan section and pulled
people from their homes, taking some away in jeeps, American
tourists said. Chinese troops also beat Tibetans, said the
travelers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of police
reprisal.
   ``One boy's face was completely bloodied,'' said a man from New
Orleans. ``He was no older than 10. Blood was coming from his ears,
his eyes.''
   The Americans and other tourists were contacted by telephone in
the Tibetan capital from Beijing. As they spoke, automatic weapons
fire and exploding tear gas canisters crackled in the background.
Bonfires burned in the streets, they said.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported one Tibetan was killed
and eight others, including two policeman, injured in the violence
Monday.
   Xinhua had said 10 Tibetans and one Chinese policeman were killed
in anti-Chinese demonstrations Sunday. Western travelers quoted
Tibetans as saying that many more had died on Sunday and that at
least four Tibetans had been slain Monday.
   The U.S. State Department on Monday deplored the use of weapons
on pro-independence protesters in Tibet and called for a restoration
of order.
   ``We have made clear to the Chinese both publicly and privately
in the past our concern for human rights in Tibet,'' said spokesman
Charles Redman in Washington.
   In New York, a representative for the Dalai Lama, the Tibetans'
spiritual leader, issued a message from the leader saying he was
``deeply saddened'' by the latest bloodshed.
   ``I have always tried to find a peaceful solution to the tragic
situation in my country,'' the Dalai Lama said.
   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.
Many Tibetans say Tibet should be independent and led by the Dalai
Lama, who fled in exile during the aborted uprising in 1959.
   Police in Lhasa fired from rooftops near the city's main square
late Monday afternoon, killing at least two Tibetans, an American
tourist quoted Tibetans as saying.
   Several hours later, security forces fired on a group of 40
independence activists as they threw rocks at a building near the
Jokhang Temple, another tourist said. He quoted Tibetans as saying
at least two protesters were killed in that incident.
   On Monday morning, thousands of Tibetans flooded the old city,
breaking into the small Chinese- and Moslem-run stores that fill the
area, pulling out their contents and burning them in bonfires along
the main thoroughfare in the city.
   The crowd, made up mostly of young men, blocked off parts of the
old city, barricading it with metal tables and garbage cans,
witnesses said. Xinhua said many people were unable to go to work.
   Tibetans stoned Chinese who tried to bicycle through the area,
foreign witnesses said.
   One tourist said he saw a policeman dragged from his bike and
chased down the street at knifepoint. Xinhua said the crowd
``tortured'' a policeman, but gave no details.
   Police guarded the Chinese section of town, but later Monday they
moved across a broad road into the Tibetan-held area.
   The Americans saw hundreds of police, armed with Chinese-made
AK-47s, move in. The armed troops met up with another 100 helmeted
troops, carrying only shields and sticks.
   ``The troops charged up the street at a half-trot,'' said the
tourist from New Orleans. ``A lot of tear gas came into the hotel.
They were firing up the street pretty fiercely.''
   At one point, soldiers banged on the window of the hotel's
restaurant where several foreign tourists were eating dinner.
   ``They pointed their guns at our faces,'' said the New Yorker.
``All of us hit the deck.''
   Troops also burst into Tibetan homes and grabbed occupants,
Americans said. ``Some of them were taken away,'' the New Yorker
said. ``Others were beaten on the spot.''
   Soon after the troops disappeared down the street, the angry
Tibetan crowd regrouped and burned a Chinese-owned shop.
   The city had quieted by midnight, but bonfires still smoldered,
said an American.
   The protests began Sunday when 13 Buddhist monks and nuns started
marching near the Jokhang, shouting ``Independence for Tibet.''
Police opened fire. A crowd of Tibetans then began ransacking
Chinese buildings.
   The bloodshed occurred days before the 30th anniversary of a
failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese on March 10. It marks
the fourth violent outburst in 18 months against Chinese rule.
Scores have died in the earlier protests.
   In New Delhi, India, about 100 Tibetan refugees, some raising
banners that said ``Stop massacres in Tibet'' and ``Tibet is ours,''
demonstrated in front of the Chinese Embassy.

<HEAD>Heflin No Stranger To Partisan Battles Over Presidential Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In becoming the first Democrat to support John
Tower, President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense, Alabama
Sen. Howell Heflin followed the rule he always applies to
presidential appointments.
   ``My general approach is that the president is entitled to have
his appointments'' unless it can be proved ``that the person is
flawed or that he would be a detriment to the country,'' Heflin said
last week after meeting with Bush to discuss the Tower nomination.
   In the case of Tower, Heflin said he was not convinced after
reading the FBI reports that the former Texas senator has a drinking
problem that would disqualify him from serving in the nation's top
defense post.
   Had Tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship, Heflin might
well have voted against confirmation. But he said the fact that the
secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president makes
Bush responsible and accountable for Tower's conduct.
   ``It is the president's cabinet,'' Heflin said, ``not Congress'
cabinet.''
   Being at the center of a partisan battle over a presidential
appointee is nothing new for Heflin, a 67-year-old ex-Marine and
former Alabama chief justice who was former President Reagan's most
consistent Democratic support in the Senate.
   As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Heflin frequently
found himself holding the balance of power when controversial Reagan
appointments divided the panel along partisan lines.
   His vote in committee against Reagan's nomination of Robert H.
Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987 helped persuade other Southern
Democrats to oppose Bork, who eventually was rejected by the full
Senate.
   Heflin also cast the deciding vote on the only other Reagan
appointees rejected by the Judiciary Committee, the nomination of
William Bradford Reynolds to the third-ranking post in the Justice
Department and the nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions III to a
federal judgeship in south Alabama.
   Heflin was widely criticized in his home state for opposing both
Bork and Sessions, but his popularity does not appear to have waned
in Alabama despite the increasingly tendency in recent years of the
state's voters to support Republican candidates.
   During his first Senate campaign in 1978, Heflin was so popular
that then-Gov. George C. Wallace decided not to challenge him.
Heflin carried all but five of Alabama's 69 counties in the
Democratic primary, and won move than 90 percent of the general
election vote.
   He was re-elected in 1984 with 63 percent of the vote over a
conservative Republican congressman. His only announced challenger
in 1990 is state Sen. Bill Cabiness of Birmingham, a businessman who
chaired the state's delegation to the Republican convention that
nominated Bush for president.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian trade fair has successfully
introduced merchandise from the Islamic state to the Lebanese
market, drawing 100,000 visitors and selling $60,000 worth of goods
a day.
   ``Many deals have been struck between Iranian companies and
Lebanese businessmen, both Christian and Moslem,'' said Abbas
Zaferian, director of the ``Second Trade Exhibition of the Islamic
Republic of Iran.''
   ``I cannot give you a final figure, but I can assure you that the
number is large,'' he added.
   Zaferian said 70 companies are participating in the fair that
opened Feb. 20 at a hotel in a Syrian-controlled district of west
Beirut. It ends Tuesday.
   He refused to say whether the fair had political motives, such as
supporting the 1 million Shiite Moslems who make up Lebanon's
largest single sect. ``I only answer questions related to the
commercial aspect,'' Zaferian said.
   Iran and its mainly Shiite Moslem population back the Hezbollah,
or Party of God, militia which seeks to set up an Islamic state
modeled on Iran in southern Lebanon.
   Hezbollah intermittently fought fierce battles from April until
January against Amal, its Syrian-backed rival. After 500 people were
killed, Iran and Syria brokered a truce that currently is holding.
   At the entrance to the fair, Iranian flags and huge portraits of
revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini contrast sharply
with other events at the seaside hotel: a cheese and wine party and
a Greek night.
   Cheap prices make the Iranian goods attractive not only to
Shiites, but also to other low-income and middle-income groups.
   People flock to the exhibition, where an air conditioner is
priced at $90, a gas stove at $39 and a pair of tennis shoes costs
$2.
   The fair may mark a breakthrough for Iranian-made products in
Lebanon, despite their mediocre quality.
   Nobody seemed to mind the long wait to park in the hotel's
spacious grounds, or meticulous security checks.
   ``It's worth it. I cannot afford to pay $40 for a pair of jeans.
Here, it's only $7,'' said a woman who identified herself as Soha, a
Sunni Moslem. ``The quality may not be the same as French designer
ones, but we're living through hard days and jeans are jeans.''
   A fair salesman said Iran's first trade exhibition in Lebanon
last year provided an opportunity to assess the market.
   `That was just an exhibition. People could not purchase any of
the products. But it helped make this year's exhibition
successful,'' said the salesman, who refused to give his name.
   Cars assembled in Iran were popular, with prices ranging from
$4,200 for a Renault 5 to $13,000 for a Range Rover.
   A government education stand was one of the fair's biggest,
boasting a bookshop, a children's corner and a video room playing an
Iranian film, ``The Eagles.'' The film showed Iranian jets mounting
an attack against bases in Iraq. Jubilant crowds watching the movie
shouted ``Allaho Akbar!'' (``God is Great!'') as the jets unleashed
their bombs.
   Wealthier people also attended the fair, but for different goods.
   ``I came here to look at the silk carpets and buy some caviar and
pistachio nuts,'' said a woman whose hand glittered with diamond
rings. These luxuries are the only Iranian goods imported to Lebanon
regularly, although the trade is minimal.
   A silk carpet runner measuring a bit more than 5 feet by 3 feet
cost $1,827, and two pounds of caviar sold for $200.
   ``The caviar shelves were wiped (clean) during the first few
days,'' said Zaferian. ``People would buy it here for $200 and sell
it outside for at least double the price.''

<TEXT>
   Prince Charles appealed Monday for a ban on
ozone-depleting chemicals and said it is up to developed countries
to help repair the damage those chemicals have caused to the Earth's
environment.
   The heir to the British throne said people around the world are
looking to their leaders to take bold decisions to save the
environment ``and not to put off those critical decisions that will
ultimately cause our grandchildren to curse us.''
   He welcomed decisions by the United States and the European
Economic Community to try to ban chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by
the end of the century but said ``I fear even that will be 10 years
too late.''
   Earlier Monday, the Soviet Union said it needed more scientific
evidence that CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it would agree to
speed up its phaseout of such chemicals.
   ``We think that any decisions taken ... should be well-grounded
and should have a firm scientific basis,'' said Vladimir Zhakarov,
head of the Soviet delegation at a 120-nation conference on the
ozone layer.
   ``If we take a decision which is not well-grounded we can
interfere and destroy the economies of the eveloping countries,'' he
said.
   Sherwood Rowland, an atmospheric chemist from the University of
California at Irvine, said, ``They (the Soviets) sound very much
like people from the European Community a year ago and from the
United States two years ago'' before they became aware of the
problem.
   Most Western scientists agree that chlorofluorocarbons, commonly
used in refrigerators, aerosols and fast-food packaging, are
gradually depleting the ozone shield that protects the Earth from
the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   The compounds also trap heat, warming the Earth's surface and
causing potentially major climate changes, a process known as the
``Greenhouse Effect.''
   Scientific expeditions to the Antarctic have pinpointed the
compounds as the cause of an ozone hole about the size of the
continental United States.
   Preliminary Soviet data suggests an ozone depletion of about 25
percent over parts of Europe and as far into the Soviet Union as
Siberia, said Zhakarov, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozone
protection.
   The Soviet delegation could not provide a map showing the
boundaries of this area, which it said was caused by cyclones, not
the compounds. Zhakarov said the area could not be described as an
ozone hole.
   The Soviet Union is among the 31 nations that have signed the
1987 Montreal Protocol agreeing to halve the compounds by 1999.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Economic Community
have said they will try for a total ban by that time.
   ``If there is proved scientific data that we should phase out
these substances, we will support this idea,'' Zhakarov said. ``We
don't have such proof yet.''
   However, Zhakarov's interpreter said the Soviet delegate
personally favors quicker action.
   The Soviet Union now produces 130,000 tons of the compounds a
year, he said, about 10 percent of total world production.
   His country remains committed to halving that by 1999, Zhakarov
said, acknowledging ``it will cost a lot of money.''
   Liz Cook, ozone campaign chairman for the Friends of the
Earth-USA environmental group, said the Soviets were trying to ``buy
themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy. ...
The science is clearly there. ... It's not certain to me how they
don't have a clear picture when the rest of the world seems to be
quite convinced that we need to go for a phase-out.''
   Both China and India called for the industrialized countries,
which use the vast majority of the compounds, to establish a fund to
help developing nations acquire the technology to replace the
compounds.
   Z.R. Ansari, India's environment minister, said the fund should
not cut into aid to fight poverty.
   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reason would mean
that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for the
promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' he said. ``Today, the
poor are no more prepared to wait and there will be social upheaval
if they are asked to wait any longer.''

<HEAD>Claim Japanese Fuel Headed to Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group charged Monday that
spent nuclear fuel from Japanese research reactors is en route to
the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in violation of a U.S.
moratorium on such shipments.
   But the Department of Energy said the waste fuel shipment was
authorized while the agency still had a policy of accepting the
shipments.
   The group, Greenpeace, said the secret radioactive shipment
violates a six-month moratorium on reactor fuel shipments to the
United States, imposed by DOE on Jan. 1 to assess environmental
risks.
   ``If it was too dangerous on Jan. 1, it is too dangerous on March
1,'' Greenpeace spokesman Damon Moglen said in a statement from the
organization. ``At a time when the roof is falling in on the DOE
weapons facilities, it should not bring more waste into the United
States through the back door.''
   The United States supplies Japan and several western European
countries with highly enriched uranium for civilian research
reactors. Until Dec. 31, in order to prevent weapons proliferation,
it required that the waste fuel be returned.
   DOE spokeswoman Chris Sankey said the department let that policy
expire so ``we could expand on an environmental assessment of our
fuel receipt policy'' at the Savannah River complex. She said the
spent fuel left Japan on Nov. 26.
   ``We will have no further shipments approved after Dec. 31.
Anything not authorized before Dec. 31 will not proceed until we
have a new policy in effect,'' she said. She said she did not know
how long the moratorium would last.
   According to Greenpeace, the spent fuel is on board the
British-owned Pacific Sandpiper and is due in Hampton Roads, Va.,
after a two-week voyage from Britain. The waste ultimately is bound
for DOE's Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in Aiken, S.C., where
it will be reprocessed.
   Moglen said Greenpeace will track the shipment to its destination
``to let the communities along the route know what the DOE won't''
tell them.
   Safety and environmental problems at Savannah River last spring
led to the shutdown of the nation's only reactors that produce
tritium and plutonium. Safety and management at all 17 nuclear
weapons facilities in the country have drawn severe criticism, and
the General Accounting Office has estimated it will take $155
billion over three decades to clean up and modernize DOE's weapons
complexes.

   Britain wants the Soviet Union to take a
stronger position against Iran for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
calls for the death of novelist Salman Rushdie, the British foreign
secretary said Monday.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe said he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze discussed the matter during private talks Monday in
Vienna, where both are attending East-West talks on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``I left Mr. Shevardnadze no doubt of our view that the
principles involved in that problem are of universal application,''
Howe told a news conference.
   Howe said he told Shevardnadze ``there can be no justification
for (Iran's) incitement to murder ... and no justification for
seeking to impair the freedom of speech in a country like ours.''
   Howe said he also told Shevardnadze ``that that view was a view
which should commend itself to both halves of a common European
house.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has used the term ``common
European house'' to portray Western Europe and the East bloc as
having common interests because of their geographical proximity.
   Howe said, ``There was no question of any mediation discussion on
either side,'' indicating the question of a possible Soviet
go-between role did not come up.
   The 12 European Community nations, angered by Iran's threats,
have recalled their ambassadors from Tehran.
   Rushdie is a British citizen. Many Moslems charge that his novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemes their faith. Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary and religious patriarch, urged Moslems to hunt down
and kill Rushdie.
   Howe did not say how Shevardnadze responded at their talks on
Monday.
   However, his remarks indicated he is not satisfied with the
Kremlin's stance on the threats against Rushdie.
   Moscow has said Western countries are justified in their
``indignation'' over the matter. But Soviet officials, while not
condoning the death decree, also said Khomeini may have felt he had
to denounce Rushdie under Islamic teachings.
   Shevardnadze last week met with Iranian officials in Tehran, and
later the Soviets offered to help cool the strife between Iran and
Western nations.
   In a midday speech on Monday, Shevardnadze mentioned the dispute
and said no nation should try to gain an advantage from the rift.
   He said, in calling for international cooperation to improve
conditions in the Middle East: ``There should be no playing on any
contradictions _ whether it is Israel's conflict with the Arabs or
the difficulties in the West's relations with Iran.''
   Sweden's ambassador to Iran, Hakan Granqvist, said after
returning to Tehran that Rushdie's novel was a serious insult to
Moslem beliefs, state-run Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus,
reported Monday.
   Granqvist was recalled for consultations after Khomeini's death
threat against Rushdie.
   The radio quoted Granqvist as saying at a meeting with Deputy
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani, ``In the West, the
consciousness is gradually arising that the publication is a serious
insult to Moslem beliefs, and many (Western) writers and politicians
now realize this.''
   The Swedish Embassy also represents British interests in Iran.
   Iran is due to announce Tuesday whether it will break off
relations with Britain over the Rushdie affair.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Larijani as telling Granqvist, ``The only solution to
this crisis is respect in the West for Moslems and their belief.''
   In Jerusalem, in an interview published in the newspaper Maariv
on Monday, Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi, Avraham Shapira, asked
for a national ban on Rushdie's book, saying it threatens
Moslem-Jewish relations and world peace.
   Ashkenazi Jews are of European heritage and comprise almost half
of Israel's Jewish population. Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu
represents Jews of Middle Eastern heritage. He was unavailable for
comment.
   On Sunday, Palestinian extremist Ahmed Jibril vowed in Damascus,
Syria, to make every effort to kill Rushdie ``in defense of
religion, God, and his prophet (Mohammed).'' He said he would use
his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command to
carry out the threat.

<HEAD>Extradition Approved of Argentines Accused of Stealing Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court issued extradition
orders Monday for two Argentine couples accused of taking four
children from parents who were arrested and presumed executed by
security forces a decade ago.
   During nearly two years of house arrest in Asuncion, the couples
appealed lower court rulings and argued they were victims of
persecution by the Argentine government of President Raul Alfonsin.
   The court ruling said: ``It was not proven that both couples are
persecuted politically, and in accordance with the extradition
treaty signed by Paraguay in 1889 in Montevideo, the appeals are
rejected.''
   ``After two years, this is very good news,'' said Raul Quijano,
Argentina's ambassador.
   In a domestic political development, Paraguay's main opposition
party filed documents Monday seeking recognition that would allow it
to enter national elections set for May 1.
   Domingo Laino, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party,
indicated it still might boycott the elections unless the
provisional government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez changes voting laws
and procedures. Rodriguez overthrew President Alfredo Stroessner, a
general who had ruled since 1954, in a coup Feb. 3.
   The kidnapping case strained relations between the neighboring
South America countries. Ambassador Quijano was recalled for for
several months last year after Attorney General Clotildo Jimenez
Benitez urged the Supreme Court to deny extradition.
   Jimenez was dismissed Friday, a month after the coup against
Stroessner.
   Argentine justice and human rights officials accused Maj.
Norberto Bianco and retired police official Samuel Miara and their
wives of taking children of alleged subversives who were imprisoned
at the Campo de Mayo army base outside Buenos Aires in the late
1970s.
   Many children disappeared in similar fashion during the so-called
``dirty war'' against leftist subversion conducted by the military
dictatorship of 1976-83.
   Bianco was a doctor at the army base and Miara was a police
intelligence officer. Both fled to Paraguay in April 1986, claiming
they would not receive a fair trial in Argentina.
   Neither couple was required to appear in court Monday. Bianco
told The Associated Press by telephone he learned about the decision
from a television newscast.
   ``We know the extradition ruling is for me and my wife, and that
the situation of the kids still must be resolved,'' said Bianco, who
like Miara claims he is his children's natural father. ``We don't
know anything for sure yet.''
   Bianco said he assumed his son Pablo, 11, and daughter Carolina,
12, would be allowed to accompany him and his wife, Susana, to
Argentina. Ambassador Quijano said he expected the order to be
carried out within within two weeks.
   ``The kids are resigned, very crestfallen, but they have a great
strength of spirit and they think that in Argentina they will be
able to put things right,'' Bianco said.
   Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, an Argentine human rights
group, claims Miara's 11-year-old twin sons Gonzalo Javier and
Matias Angel are Gustavo and Martin Rosetti Ross, whose parents were
arrested during the ``dirty war.''
   Their mother was never seen again but the father, Gustavo
Rosetti, survived, was released and now is a lawyer in Buenos Aires.
   No one answered the telephone Monday at the office of Miara's
lawyer.
   Asked for comment Monday, a spokeswoman for the Grandmothers said
they expected the decision but had no formal notification of it. She
would not identify the supposed biological parents of the Bianco
children.
   The group was set up in 1977 to trace the children who
disappeared and were presumed killed in the anti-leftist campaign.
Investigators for Alfonsin's civilian government say at least 8,960
people were killed but human rights groups put the toll nearer
30,000.
   According to the Grandmothers, about 300 babies were born in
captivity or taken with their mothers to clandestine detention
centers. The group has helped reunite about 50 children with their
biological families since Alfonsin took office in December 1983.

   The mood in Milan is relaxed as Italian
fashion enters the 1990s.
   Milanese designers presenting ready-to-wear collections for
fall-winter 1989-1990 this week are not forcing outlandish ideas on
a reluctant public for the sake of creativity. Rather, they are
content to tailor beautiful clothes in colors and styles which are
attuned to the needs of the modern woman.
   Italy's most flamboyant designer, Gianni Versace, said that as
fashion embarks on a new decade there is a need for ``looks more in
keeping with the times.''
   He thinks women should be free to choose between skirts and pants
and to decide for themselves the length of a hemline, ``provided the
fit is easy, truly comfortable, practically a home away from home.''
   For the most part, the collections seen thus far on the Milan
runway are helping women to do just that.
   Styles are mainly soft and sporty, with pants overshadowing
skirts, cozy sweaters replacing fussy blouses, and myriads of
generously cut jackets, big comfortable coats, and flattering capes
to face up to the rigors of the winter season.
   Hemlines play to the needs and tastes of all, from a few short
versions to the all-purpose knee length, to the calf length
championed by the young.
   When it comes to skirts, Versace, who presented his new
collection Sunday night, does not practice what he preaches. His new
skirt in clinging jersey is so short and tight that anyone wearing
it risks being arrested for indecent exposure. For nighttime the
skirt demurely descends to the ankle in black chiffon, only to be
ripped up the side straight to the hip bone.
   Milan has always felt most at home with sombre shades of black
gray and brown in keeping with the grim, smoggy skies of this
northern industrial city.
   But no Italian can live without color, and designers have always
perked up their collections with bright shades. This season is
particularly vivid with the favorite palette a fall scheme of
pumpkin and tangerine, plum and grape, crimson and fuchsia, apple
and moss green. A wide variety of yellows and blues also turn up, as
well as gaily colored prints.
   Never one to go along with the pack, Krizia, who usually favors
glitzy clothes in shimmery fabrics, showed the most somber
collection seen thus far on the runway.
   Not only were the colors almost exclusively in Milan fog shades,
but the style was uncharacteristically puritanical with long wool
jersey dresses or mohair skirts worn under straight three-quarter
length jackets by day, and demure gray evening gowns with lace
bodice and bunched tafetta skirt.
   In general there is much more wool than silk in next winter's
fashion, another concession to a sporty practical wardrobe.
   Best at this woolly look was queen of cashmere Laura Biagiotti,
who had her show late Sunday. For the past decade, Biagiotti has
been holding the working woman's banner high with soft and elegant
cashmere fashion, easy to wear and easy to pack.
   The novelty of her collection this season is in the intricate
ruffled workmanship in capes, sweaters and gowns to look like flower
arrangements. Her favorite shades are rose and fuchsia, as well as
her trademark white.
   The new casual look was no trouble for Britain's Keith Varty, the
designer behind the Byblos label, popular for its young sporty
style. Varty also showed Monday, the second day of the five-day
Milan ready-to-wear collections.
   Next winter the Byblos woman will wear cozy jackets in bright
shades of purple, blue and chartreuse, with shawl collar and
extra-wide sleeves in warm shearling or bulky wool, gaily printed
dirndl skirts, and heavy-knit sweaters with cheery floral motifs.

   Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama on Monday became
the first Democrat to swing behind John Tower's confirmation as
defense secretary, delivering a major boost to the troubled
nomination a few hours after President Bush urged lawmakers to ``put
aside partisanship'' in the struggle.
   ``I will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove
himself,'' Heflin said in a speech on the Senate floor, referring to
Tower's promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the
Pentagon.
   Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who has helped spearhead
the GOP effort to salvage the nomination, said Heflin's remarks
would ``stand out as a jewel' in the Senate debate.
   But moments after Heflin's surprise announcement, another
Southern Democrat, Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas, said he would vote
against confirmation because Tower would ``create more (problems)
than he will solve.''
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., emerging from an afternoon meeting
with Republican leaders and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu,
said: ``We have a better chance but it's still a fight.''
   The latest Associated Press survey found 47 Democrats and Sen.
Larry Pressler, R-S.D., either solidly opposed or leaning against
confirmation and 40 Republicans and one Democrat either leaning for
or supporting confirmation.
   The Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate.
   Heflin, who had been courted by the Bush administration, cited
Tower's qualifications; the ``uncertain state of the evidence''
against the nominee, specifically the allegations included in an FBI
report on the nominee; and the alcohol promise as the reasons for
his decision.
   Heflin spoke a few hours after Bush gave Tower a ringing
endorsement.
   ``I stand by this man,'' Bush told a Veterans of Foreign Wars
audience. ``I stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the
right man to take charge of the Pentagon.''
   In addition to Heflin, the Bush administration has courted Sen.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., who labeled the FBI report on Tower as
``unreliable'' but said he has not made a decision on the nomination.
   ``Frankly, I think this particular FBI report is basically
unreliable,'' Johnston said Sunday during a stop in Alexandria, La.
``I think there needs to be more fairness put into this process.''
   Heflin said the FBI report was ``not conclusive as to whether he
had a drinking problem in the 1980s that impaired his judgment on
issues in his official capacities.''
   Heflin noted Tower's no-drinking pledge and said the ``primary
safeguard against abuse or the breaking of his pledge is the
president himself. I don't believe that President George Bush would
allow a person to serve as secretary of defense whose conduct is a
threat to national security.''
   As for Tower's knowledge of defense issues, Heflin said, ``I
don't believe I've heard anyone question his qualifications.''
   Tower, in a statement, said he was ``grateful to Senator Heflin
for his objectivity and for the clear and lucid way in which he
stated the arguments for my confirmation. He has put the issue in
its proper perspective.''
   Pryor said he hadn't read the lengthy FBI report into Tower's
personal life and didn't intend to. He said his own decision was
based on a judgment about whether Tower would ``create problems or
solve problems,'' and said on balance he believed the nominee would
create more than he would solve.
   He also cited several remarks made by Tower, Dole and Republican
Leader Strom Thurmond of South Carolina about the Senate's
prerogative to consent on presidential appointments. Those comments
were made a decade ago during a partisan struggle that erupted when
Jimmy Carter named Paul Warnke as an arms negotiator.
   In his own speech to an enthusiastic Veterans of Foreign Wars
audience, Bush again spoke of Tower's qualifications.
   He asked senators to ``put partisanship aside,'' and to ``use
their own experience with John Tower as an expert on defense issues,
as a former colleague and as a tough, hard-nosed negotiator to guide
them.''
   There remains the possibility Tower will be allowed onto the
Senate floor to answer the allegations against him, which include
excessive drinkin, indiscreet behavior toward women and his
lucrative consulting contracts with defense contractors.
   But a majority of the chamber would have to approve the
appearance and a vote is unlikely before Tuesday at the earliest.
   Republican senators, including Dole, Warner, Rudman, William
Cohen of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, huddled with
Sununu to discuss the option of allowing Tower on the Senate floor
and other GOP strategy to save the nomination.
   ``We wanted to make sure we're not missing anything or anybody,''
Rudman said.
   As he began his speech to the VFW, Bush said he wanted to get
something ``off my chest.''
   ``I'm getting sick and tired of the rumors and the innuendo that
are used against this decent man,'' Bush said.
   ``You know John Tower is a fellow veteran,'' he told the VFW.
   Meanwhile, a conservative group said it had raised $100,000 to
finance an advertising campaign on Tower's behalf in states with
Democratic senators who conservatives think might be persuaded to
vote for Tower.
   Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Conservative Victory Committee,
said the group's lobbying campaign came after Bush last week urged
conservatives to generate political heat for Tower.
   The Tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations
between the White House and Congress at the outset of the Bush
administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 11-9 along
party lines to recommend that the full Senate reject the nomination.

<HEAD>Widespread Snow In East, With Flooding In Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong weather system spread heavy snow from the Plains over
sections of the Ohio Valley, and heavy rain caused flooding in the
Appalachians.
   Snowfall ended over Missouri after more than a foot fell in some
areas. Lebanon got 16 inches and 15 inches fell ar Marshfield. The
11 inches at St. Louis was the 11th heaviest snowfall on record, and
the fourth heaviest for March, the National Weather Service said.
   In Arkansas, snow and ice accumulations piled up 12 to 14 inches
deep in Benton County and 8 to 12 inches in Washington County.
   In central and southern Illinois, 6 to 8 inches fell at
Taylorville and Litchfield, with 6 inches in Moultrie county.
Northern Indiana got 2 to 4 inches.
   Freezing rain and sleet mixed with the snow from southern
Illinois to southern Indiana and Ohio. A layer of ice three-quarters
of an inch thick accumulated on trees at Clay City, Ill. In southern
Ohio, ice on electrical lines caused scattered power outages.
   Snow also fell on southern Pennsylvania, sections of New Jersey
and southeastern New York.
   A mixture of rain and sleet fell just south of the snow area.
   A line of strong showers and thunderstorms developed over western
sections of the Carolinas. Near Mooresville, N.C., intense
thunderstorms damaged several homes, overturned cars and blew down
fences.
   Heavy rain that fell over much of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
during the last couple days caused rivers to rise in Kentucky, West
Virginia, Tennessee and Ohio. West Virginia had flash flooding, and
many northern streams were expected to crest above flood stage
during the night. The Kentucky River was rising at a rate of a foot
and a half an hour in many areas and was expected to crest during
the evening over eastern Kentucky.
   In Tennessee, roads were flooded in Grundy and Marion counties.
   Light lake-effect snow fell along the western shores of Lake
Michigan in northern Wisconsin.
   Light rain and fog spread along the northern and central Pacific
Coast.
   Record lows were reported Monday at Austin, Texas, 27;
Bryan-College Station, Texas, 29; Corpus Christi, Texas, 29; Fort
Worth, Texas, 20; Galveston, Texas, 27; Grand Island, Neb., 10 below
zero; Houston, 25; Huron, S.D., 17 below; Lake Charles, La., 25;
Midland, Texas, 15; Port Arthur, Texas, 24; Shreveport, La., 24;
Victoria, Texas; and Wichita Falls, Texas, 8.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 85 at Fort Myers, Fla. Monday's low
for the Lower 48 states was 18 degrees below zero at Ord, Neb.
   Tuesday's forecast called for showers over Virginia and the
Carolinas, the Tennessee Valley and the lower half of the Florida
Peninsula; widespread rain along the northern and central Pacific
Coast and the northern and central Intermountain region between the
Sierra Nevada and the Rockies; and snow from southern Pennsylvania
to New Jersey and the southern New England coast.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted from the upper Great
Lakes to northern sections of the Ohio Valley, the lower Great Lakes
and New England; in the 30s and 40s from Washington state to the
northern Rockies, the northern and central Plains, Oklahoma, eastern
Texas, much of the Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the
middle Atlantic Coast; in the 70s over the southern Florida
Peninsula; in the 70s and 80s over Southern California; and
generally in the 50s and 60s over the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Poland To Allow Production Of U.S. Film On Walesa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will allow an American movie
producer to make a film in Poland about Solidarity founder Lech
Walesa, the Polish news agency PAP reported Monday.
   A brief announcement said a state-owned studio would provide
technical help for producer Stanley Kramer.
   PAP said the Wroclaw Film Studio would work with Kramer on the
movie ``Polonaise,'' especially on creating crowd scenes, including
ones requiring 25,000 extras portraying Solidarity's birth as an
independent trade union at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk in August
1980.
   It was not clear from the announcement if filming would take
place in the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa is still employed as an
electrician, or at some other shipyard.
   Kramer said Monday in Hollywood he had not received word that
filming in Gdansk was approved. He said he was approached last month
at a Los Angeles gathering by represenatives of Poland's official
film agency and they offered to let him shoot portions of the movie
at the Lenin yard.
   ``They came and had read the script and realized what it's about
and they were interested, whether because of the new government or
the whole glasnost thing or whatever,'' Kramer said.
   He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness in certain areas, which is being
copied by some of the Kremlin's allies, and recent changes in
Poland's government.
   Filming is expected to begin in several months on the movie
tracing the life of Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize as a
founder of the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc.
Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and later outlawed by
Parliament.
   Kramer said the film should be released in spring 1990.
   He said he visited Walesa in Poland last year but never sought
permission to shoot the movie in this communist country because he
assumed he would be turned down.
   ``After all, it was about Walesa,'' Kramer said. ``He was at
loggerheads with the government at the time.''
   Solidarity is still banned, but after years of trying to
eradicate the movment the government reversed its stand and is
conducting talks with the opposition that could lead to a
restoration of Solidarity's legal status and other reforms.
   Kramer said the film is expected to cost up to $15 million. He
said it would be historically accurate but will dramatize some
details, such as wedding-night conversations between Walesa and his
wife.
   ``It isn't political, it's a story, a drama of a hero, a hero who
had certain shortcomings and realized them,'' Kramer said. ``Winning
the Nobel prize is a symbol one man can make a difference and that's
the message of the film, not politics.''
   ``Polonaise,'' named for one of the works of the Polish composer
Chopin, follows other films on social issues by the 74-year-old
Kramer. They include ``Judgment at Nuremberg'' and ``Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner.''
   While Solidarity's story is mainly one of struggle against the
communist government, Kramer said the film does not portray the
authorities as villains.
   ``They don't look too bad for the simple reason that they didn't
look too bad during the real thing,'' he said. ``Even though he
(Walesa) was taken into custody a number of times, they couldn't do
anything to him because he was untouchable.''
   The screenplay was written by Daniel Taradash, who won an Academy
Award in 1953 for the screenplay of ``From Here to Eternity.''
   Film Polski, the official agency, will be paid to arrange for the
filming in Gdansk but will not have a role in writing or producing
the move and will not share in the profits, Kramer said.

<HEAD>Meeting Canceled In Controversy Over Hajek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Helsinki Federation
canceled a meeting Monday with the government in Prague after
authorities refused to accept former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister
Jiri Hajek as part of its six-man delegation.
   The Czechoslovak state news agency CTK later said the delegation
will meet Tuesday with officials of the Committee of the
Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights and Humanitarian Cooperation
and representatives of the Czechoslovak Peace Committee.
   It said a meeting at the Ministry of Justice and the passport and
visa authority of the Interior Ministry could not take place because
the delegation's condition for holding the talks was unacceptable to
the Czechoslovak side.
   CTK did not spell out the condition.
   The Vienna-based Helsinki Federation monitors human rights in
East Europe. Its delegation, led by Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg,
was scheduled to meet with officials in Prague to discuss human
rights in Czechoslovakia.
   Hajek is chairman of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee, a
member of the Federation. He helped lead Czechoslovakia's 1968
reform movement that was crushed that year by a Soviet-led invasion
and was a signer of the Charter 77 document on human rights in
Czechoslovakia.
   Von Schwarzenberg told Czechoslovak Premier Ladislav Adamec in a
letter made available to news media, ``We wish to express our
disappointment and grave concern about the refusal of Czechoslovak
ministers to meet with us.''
   He referred to the authorities' rejection of Hajek as a member of
the Federation delegation and the Federation's cancellation of
Monday's meeting.
   In behalf of the Federation, von Schwarzenberg protested ``police
brutality in Czechoslovakia against citizens engaged in peaceful
demonstrations during August, October and January.''
   He protested the trials and sentencing of rights activists in
Prague, including prominent playwright Vaclav Havel and Jana
Petrova, both members of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee.
   The Federation demanded immediate release of all political
prisoners, guarantees of due process, and an end to using visa and
passport regulations as a punishment for political activities.

<HEAD>Group To Import Drugs For AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug buyers club announced plans Monday to
provide American AIDS patients with prescription drugs from abroad
that have not been approved for use in the United States.
   The People with AIDS Health Group said it would rely on foreign
doctors to obtain the prescription drugs, then pass them along at
cost to AIDS patients.
   To get a three-month supply of a drug, an AIDS patient must
present a physician's prescription or note, group officials said at
a news conference.
   Although they described the plan as unprecedented, they said it
would not violate Food and Drug Administration rules.
   Last year, the FDA said it would allow people with
life-threatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved
drugs.
   But until now the New York group and other buyers clubs have only
imported drugs that do nt require a prescription in the foreign
country. Anyone wishing to legally obtain such drugs had to travel
abroad and get a prescription from a physician there.
   ``We're saving people the trip and the importation expenses,''
said Michael Callen, a founder of the group.
   Dr. Frank Young, commissioner of the FDA, has declined to say if
his agency would try to stop the drug importation effort, but said
any action probably would depend on what drugs the group imports and
how it does so.
   One will be fluconazole, which has been approved by several
European nations as an anti-fungal medication for use against
meningitis and AIDS.
   It is seen by some physicians and AIDS patients as an effective
yet mild alternative to amphotericin B, a drug which must be taken
intravenously once a week and whose harsh side effects include
shakes and fever.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta there have been 49,976 deaths from AIDS since June 1981.
   Callen said his group would decide which other drugs to import
based on criteria such as toxicity, cost, effectiveness and
availability. It is unclear how many patients might use the service,
he said.
   Although Callen said the group would try to keep drug costs as
low as possible, some AIDS remedies are relatively expensive. Mark
Mutchnik, an AIDS patient whom the group supplied with fluconazole,
said a daily dosage cost about $23, and was not covered by insurance
because it was not FDA-approved.
   The New York Times on Monday quoted group officials as saying
they would obtain the drugs through foreign doctors. But Callen said
at the news conference that they had decided ``not to be fully
forthcoming about our precise means'' of importation. One
possibility, he said, would be to put a patient directly in touch
with a foreign physician who would send the drug.
   AIDS patient advocates have criticized the FDA for being overly
cautious about approving AIDS drugs, arguing that they do not have
time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed controversial by the
agency.
   The FDA says it has a responsibility to protect Americans from
drugs that could be useless or harmful, but ``something is wrong
when doctors feel compelled to send patients overseas'' to obtain
drugs, said Dr. Peter Seitzman, a physician with a large AIDS
practice. He said several of his patients have gone to England to
obtain fluconazole.
   The People with AIDS Health Group has been supplying about 2,000
AIDS patients with non-prescription drugs from abroad which have not
been approved for use in this country.

<HEAD>Scientists Join Call For Amnesty, Democracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 prominent scientists have joined the
movement among Chinese intellectuals for greater democracy and the
release of political prisoners, a spokesman for the group said
Monday.
   Xu Liangying, a scientific historian at the Academy of Sciences,
said 42 people signed a letter urging China's top leaders to
guarantee freedom of speech, publication and information.
   ``This is the only reliable guarantee of unity and stability,''
the letter said, referring to government fears that democracy could
bring instability.
   ``World history and China's experience shows that political
democratization, including a legal system, is necessary to guarantee
economic reform and the whole modernization (program),'' the
scientists said.
   Xu said he mailed copies last week to Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang, Premier Li Peng and the heads of the National People's
Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee, an
advisory body of intellectuals.
   It was the third letter of its kind sent to the leadership this
year. China's best-known dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, first
proposed amnesty in a letter to senior leader Deng Xiaoping in
January.
   Thirty-three intellectuals, including some of China's most famous
writers and philosphers, signed a letter with the same message in
February. Hundreds of people in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as
Chinese living in the United States, have signed petitions and
letters of support for an amnesty.
   Specific requests were made in the first two letters for the
release of Wei Jingsheng, who was convicted of counterrevolutionary
activities in 1979 and is said to have become mentally ill.
   No names were mentioned in the scientists' letter, which appealed
for the release of ``all young people who were convicted and
sentenced to labor reform because of ideological problems.''
   It said that would ``open a new era in the political history of
our country.''
   Xu said he helped write the letter and the signers believed China
``shouldn't arrest people because they have different political
views.''
   Last month, the Justice Ministry said calls for amnesty amounted
to ``interfering in the administration of justice.''
   No other direct government response has been forthcoming, but
Monday's Beijing Daily defended the imprisonment of Wei.
   ``Freedom of speech in any country cannot be held to be above the
country's basic interests,'' it declared. ``People have the freedom
of speech but not the freedom of agitating for counterrevolution by
taking advantage of socialist democracy.''
   Among signers of the latest letter were Wang Ganchang, a former
vice minister of nuclear industry, and physicist Qian Lingjiao.
   Many intellectuals have learned caution from four decades of
alternating thaws and freezes on freedom of expression, but
increasing numbers now are speaking out on political and economic
issues.
   They say they are disillusioned by China's continued backwardness
and poverty and believe a free exchange of ideas is necessary to
modernizaton.
   Fang Lizhi, who last week was barred from a dinner given by
President Bush, has encouraged intellectuals to press for democratic
reform.
   China's leaders say their priority is stability. Party chief Zhao
told Bush during his two-day visit that multi-party democracy is not
suitable for China and efforts to promote it will endanger economic
reform.

   A senior British official on Monday sharply
criticized Israeli leaders and suggested that U.N. Security Council
members help prepare for Arab-Israeli peace talks _ a proposal made
recently by Soviet officials.
   ``We think that there may be preparatory work that can be done
among the five permanent members of the Security Council,'' said
William Waldegrave, Britain's minister of state for foreign affairs.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last month suggested
that the five permanent members should meet to discuss how to
arrange a U.N.-sponsored peace conference that has been endorsed by
the Arab states, the European Economic Community and other nations.
   Waldegrave arrived in Jordan Monday after six days in Israel and
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel after the 1967
Middle East war.
   In his speech to the Jordan-British Society, Waldegrave did not
refer explicitly to the Soviet proposal. He repeatedly criticized
the hard-line stands taken by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The Arabs favor a conference attended by the five permanent
members as well as all the parties to the conflict.
   U.S. officials have warily endorsed the idea of an international
conference, but only if it leads to direct talks between Israel and
its Arab foes. Shamir rejects such a conference.
   Waldegrave stressed that the EEC is now an economic superpower
greater than the United States and has deep interests in the region.
   He indicated Europeans should be represented in peace efforts,
saying the ``best way forward'' was through a conference involving
powers with legitimate interests in the region _ a reference both to
the Security Council members and European states.
   Waldegrave said Shamir's description of the occupied territories
as ``liberated'' was ``simply bizarre, to use a British
understatement.''
   ``My visit to Nablus (on the West Bank) under curfew brought home
to me forcibly that the territories are indeed under complete and
thorough military occupation.''
   He quoted British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as saying that
the occupation ``can only be temporary,'' and cited the Palestinian
uprising in which more than 380 Palestinians and at least 17
Israelis have died.
   ``If the way to peace is not found soon, a worse conflagration
will ignite,'' Waldegrave said.
   ``The Palestinians have made their painful concession,'' he said.
``That is why the world community is saying to Israel, must say to
Israel, the time has now come for you to respond.''
   In Vienna, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told three
high-ranking West European officials on Monday that now is not the
right time for Washington to launch a new initiative in the Middle
East or for a peace conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Baker met with foreign ministers Roland Dumas of France,
Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez of Spain and Karolos Papoulias of Greece.
   The three-man group, representing the 12-nation European Economic
Community, has spearheaded a drive for Middle East peace
negotiations on the theory the Palestinians have taken a more
moderate stance toward Israel.
   But Baker told them ``there is a need to proceed carefully'' and
that the time is not right to push for a conference, according to a
U.S. official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.

   A high school student from Little Rock, Ark.
who analyzed a 1,500-year-old mathematical equation was named the
winner Monday of the national Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
   Christopher McLean Skinner, 16, a student at Hall High School in
Little Rock, was the top award winner in the 48th annual
Westinghouse contest. He won over 1,461 other entrants and will
receive a $20,000, unrestricted science scholarship.
   Skinner's winning project was an analysis of a math equation
named for Diophantus, a fourth century mathematician.
   The second place winner in the Westinghouse competition was
Jordan S. Ellenberg, 17, of Potomac, Md., who also entered a math
project. Richard H. Christie, 15, of Penfield, N.Y. won third place
for a project on the nervous and immune systems.
   Both Ellenberg and Christie will receive $15,000 scholarships.
   The three were selected top winners from among 40 finalists in
the national contest. The finalists came to Washington last week for
a judging that involved displaying their projects and then
undergoing interviews by a panel of eight scientists who evaluated
the creativity and potential of each entrant.
   Other winners and their scholarship awards are:
   4. Stacy E. Benjamin, 16, Cambria Heights, N.Y., $10,000.
   5. S. Celeste Posey, 17, Cary, N.C., $10,000.
   6. Allene M. Whitney, 17, Helena, Mont., $10,000.
   7. Keven N. Heller, 17, Dix Hills, N.Y. $7,500.
   8. Andrew W. Jackson, 18, Medfield, Mass., $7,500.
   9. Andrew J. Gerber, 16, Brooklyn, N.Y., $7,500.
   10. Divya Chander, 17, River Vale, N.J., $7,500.
   Each of the other 30 national finalists will receive scholarship
awards of $1,000.
   The Westinghouse Science Talent Search was started in 1942 and is
the oldest national high school science competition in the U.S.

<HEAD>Ariane Launches Two Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe's 29th Ariane rocket lifted
off successfully Monday from this South American launch center and
put a Japanese and a European satellite into orbit.
   The launch had been scheduled for Feb. 28 but was postponed
because of a strike by technicians. It was rescheduled for Saturday
but delayed again when high winds caused two ``umbilical cables'' to
disconnect as the gantry was being pulled away.
   Seventeen minutes, 41 seconds after liftoff at 8:29 p.m., the
Ariane 4 attained orbit, and after seven more minutes it had
released the two satellites. Ariane 4 is the most powerful launcher
in the Ariane series.
   Put into orbit were JCSAT-1, a Japanese commercial communication
satellite, and MOP-1, a European meteorological satellite.
   The JDSAT-1, built by Hughes Aircraft Co. of Los Angeles for the
Japanese Communication Satellite Co., is Japan's first commercial
communication satellite.
   MOP-1 is the fourth weather satellite for the European Space
Agency. It will send weather pictures every half hour to stations on
Earth.
   It was the agency's second launch this year and the 11th straight
successful operation.
   The first Ariane rocket, an Ariane 1, was launched a decade ago.
The agency has had four failed flights since its rocket became
operational.
   The last failure was in 1986 and resulted in a delay in the
program of more than a year.Launches resumed in September 1987.

   Plans by pilots for nearly all U.S. airlines to
strictly fly by the rule book starting Tuesday could cause lengthy
flight delays, especially where there is heavy traffic and bad
weather, according to aviation experts and pilots.
   The Air Line Pilots Association announced the action by its
40,000 members as a show of support for 8,500 striking Eastern
Airlines Machinists union members and the Eastern pilots and flight
stewardesses who have refused to cross the picket lines.
   Pilots, in announcing the action, said it would not amount to a
``slowdown,'' because they would simply be following procedures,
taking the longer option when there are two or more safe options
available.
   The primary impact could come if pilots rely on instrument
landing procedures when they could use visual procedures, said FAA
spokesman John Leyden.
   But Leyden said it was impossible to tell how much the pilots'
action would affect overall air travel. He said in some instances,
the impact might be minimal and in areas where weather is bad and
traffic heavy, it could be greater.
   Pilot John Sheehy, who has been flying for Eastern for 19 years,
said he viewed the action as ``a morale booster'' from Eastern
pilots who are honoring the pickets but doubted it would cause
significant tie ups.
   Wayne Dolan, spokesman for picketing Eastern pilots at
Washington's National Airport, said the action could enhance safety
in a time when several airlines have beefed up routes normally flown
by Eastern, using pilots unfamiliar with the routes.
   ``What you want to do is be sure the public is protected. We want
to be sure the crews know where they're going ... so the approaches
are made safely,'' said Dolan.
   One thing pilots might do is require air traffic controllers to
read back flight plans for verification, rather than simply giving
an acknowledgement that they have heard the pilot's intentions.
   ``They'll make sure every `t' is crossed and every `i' dotted,''
said a government official who is a pilot. The official, who asked
not to be identified, said pilots likely would be taking the ``most
conservative and time-consuming way'' whenever possible.
   The official said this might not necessarily enhance safety,
because tie-ups at crowded airports could lead to increased
frustration.
   ``It's a matter of a few seconds here and a few seconds there,
and it could really cascade,'' the official said.

   The presidential election
scheduled this month cannot be postponed as suggested by leftist
rebels, the president of the legislature said Monday.
   ``Just like they (the guerrillas) do not accept the March 19 date
for whatever reasons, we do not accept any change in the date,
because constitutionally the date cannot be changed,'' Ricardo
Alvarenga told journalists at the National Assembly.
   His remarks appeared to quash any prospect that an election delay
could be a first step toward ending the 9-year-old civil war.
   On Jan. 24, the rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
offered to take part in the presidential election and respect its
outcome if it were postponed until September and if security and
anti-fraud conditions were met.
   The guerrillas had rejected all previous elections this decade as
sham.
   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian
Democrat, suggested the election be delayed by six weeks rather than
six months. The rebels said that was insufficient.
   The single-chamber legislature has virtual veto power over any
postponement and is controlled by the opposition rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance. The alliance, known as ARENA, is favored to
win the presidential election and has rejected any postponement of
the vote.
   The constitution says the election must be held at least two
months before a new government takes office. Duarte's term ends on
June 1.
   The Christian Democrats have said elections could be legally
postponed and an interim president named by the legislature if a
political consensus to do so exists.
   The Farabundo Marti on Saturday said direct talks with the
government on their proposal must be held Tuesday and Wednesday in
San Salvador, the capital.
   It repeated its accusation that the government was
procrastinating.
   The civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them
civilians.

   A program that allowed convicts time away
from prison was suspended Monday by Gov. Evan Bayh after an inmate
out on an eight-hour pass allegedly bludgeoned his former wife to
death while neighbors watched.
   Bayh said two corrections officers were suspended in connection
with the furlough of Alan Matheney, 38, from the Correctional
Industrial Complex near the Indiana State Reformatory at Pendleton.
   ``Clearly, mistakes were made, there's no doubt about that, and
I'm good and mad about it,'' Bayh said.
   Matheney was being held Monday on a preliminary charge of murder
in Saturday's death of his ex-wife, Lisa Marie Bianco, 29, in
Mishawaka near the Michigan state line. Officers said she was beaten
to death with the butt of a shotgun.
   He had been serving an eight-year sentence for beating Bianco two
years ago. The two were divorced in 1985, police said Monday.
   Prison officials said Matheney was released from the light-medium
security CIC to the custody of his mother, Martha Matheney, Saturday
morning and his freedom was supposed to be limited to the
Indianapolis area.
   ``I understand proper procedures were not followed, and we're
going to find out why that happened, discipline those who were
involved, re-evaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense,''
Bayh said.
   At a Statehouse news conference later Monday, he announced the
suspension of the two corrections officers pending an investigation
into their approval of a pass for Matheny. Correction Department
spokesman Vaughn Overstreet said he would not identify the workers
because they had not yet been notified.
   The governor said former U.S. Attorney Virginia Dill McCarty
would head a Correction Department internal investigation. A report
is due Friday.
   Bayh said earlier he thought that proper procedure was for a
victim to be notified that his or her attacker was being released.
   But Christopher Meloy, supervisor of work release services for
the Department of Correction, said policy calls for victims such as
Bianco to be notified of a release only if they had previously
requested such notification. Meloy did not know if Bianco had made
such a request.
   ``Some victims are not that concerned about it, some victims move
and are very difficult to get in touch with, and sometimes we don't
even have an easily identifiable victim,'' he said.
   Meloy also defended the programs.
   ``We for the most part have been enjoying a successful track
record,'' Meloy said.
   Succeeding in either program means the offender has not been
returned to the institution after his full release, Meloy said.
   Bayh spokesman Fred Nation said no inmates involved in the
special assignment program will receive a pass for the next four
weeks while the policy is reviewed.
   Bayh said the review would determine whether the program
``deserves to be continued or whether we should eliminate it
entirely.''
   Matheney got the pass under a program that sends inmates at state
expense to work for Interfaith Housing, a not-for-profit
organization that refurbishes hoouses and sells them to low- and
middle-income families, Meloy said.
   Bayh said he was aware of Indiana's Regulated Community
Assignment program and work-release program, but he was unaware of
the special release program that allowed Matheney an eight-hour pass.
   ``In fact, I have some serious doubts about this program because
it does not help significantly with the overcrowding situtation in
the prison. It is not related to work-release activities which
prepare inmates for meeting full employment in the private sector.
   ``This is used, as I understand it, as a tool to promote good
behavior in the prison walls. And it seems to me that there may be
some other less risky methods to make that possible,'' Bayh said.

   Police on Monday denied allegations that
they beat a diabetic man who went into insulin shock while driving
his car and was arrested for drunken driving.
   ``The police probably should have checked a little closer,''
Police Chief Charles Johnston said. ``But they had a lot of other
concerns at the time, mainly that this guy didn't fall down and hurt
himself.''
   Phillip Sanchez, 63, sustained bruises to his face, hip and arms.
He said he doesn't remember much of what happened in the incident
Friday because of his condition, but remembers being ``roughed up
pretty good'' and telling police he needed insulin.
   He said police should have diagnosed his problem sooner and that
they mistreated him by handcuffing him and putting him in a holding
cell.
   At a news conference, Johnston defended his officers' actions and
said a preliminary investigation showed no evidence of brutality or
excessive force.
   He said the bruises to Sanchez's arms and wrists were caused when
officers tried to handcuff him. He added that Sanchez bruises easily
because of medication he takes for a heart condition.
   Johnston said Sanchez may have contributed to discoloration
around his eyes by rubbing them a lot, but added that he also fell
and hit his eye on a file cabinet in the police station.
   The incident began when Sanchez allegedly made an improper turn
at an intersection and his pickup was hit by a car. He drove away,
and police were notified of a hit-and-run accident.
   Officers later found Sanchez and his car in a stranger's driveway.
   Police said they did not notice a necklace Sanchez wore under his
shirt identifying him as a diabetic or a similar identification card
in his wallet. They noticed a medical bracelet he wore which said he
suffered from a heart ailment but mentioned nothing about diabetes.
   Sanchez refused to take a sobriety test, but later tests showed
he had no alcohol in his blood. Officers said they asked Sanchez on
the way to the station if he needed medical attention and he said no.
   Police reports say Sanchez was uncooperative at the police
station, exhibited mood swings and was handcuffed to a bench in a
holding cell.
   An officer found him unconscious in that cell some 80 minutes
later and he was rushed to a hospital, where glucose injections
revived him.
   Johnston said Sanchez probably would not be charged in the
traffic accident because he was unaware of what he was doing at the
time.

<HEAD>Reports Hundreds of Haitians Seized Boats to Sail to U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hundreds of impoverished Haitians
seized boats over the weekend in efforts to go to the United States
after a rumored change in U.S. immigration politicies, a radio
station reported Monday.
   The independent station Radio Metropole said at least five cases
of ``piracy'' were reported after people tried to seize sailboats
and small cargo ships in the harbors of Port-au-Prince, Petit Goave,
Les Cayes and Jeremie.
   It said one body washed ashore after a commandeered boat
foundered on a reef. Craft carrying 183 Haitians were stopped at sea
by U.S. Coast Guard vessels, and the people were being returned to
Haiti, the report said.
   The rumor suggested that immigration authorities in Miami had
relaxed U.S. residency requirements, and that would improve the
chances of Haitians seeking refuge in the United States.
   A U.S. immigration official in Miami, speaking on condition he
not be identified, said he was not aware of any change in residency
requirements for Haitians.
   Radio Metropole gave this account of the various incidents:
   Early Saturday a group of armed men including at least six
soldiers boarded a cargo ship in Petit Goave, tied up the crew and
ordered the captain to take them to Miami. The ship struck a reef
and was abandoned.
   A soldier and three other men allegedly involved in the takeover
were arrested later Saturday by Petit Goave police, and the body of
an unidentified man was found on the shore.
   On Saturday night, a yacht docked in Petit Goave harbor was
stolen, presumably by members of the shipwrecked group, and the
vessel has not been recovered.
   Police, moving to block the possible seizure of boats, arrested
30 Haitians on a dock in Port-au-Prince's Cite Soleil slum district.
   The report about the U.S. Coast Guard stopping Haitians en route
to Florida said only that 183 people were picked up and were being
returned to Haiti.
   Coast Guard officials in Florida, in reports on three incidents,
said 154 Haitians were apprehended Sunday and Monday.
   Coast Guard spokesman Jerry Snyder said the Honduran coastal
freighter Madrid was intercepted Sunday 40 miles from Haiti, and 36
Haitians were transferred to a Coast Guard cutter. He said the
Haitian government suspected three of its soldiers hijacked the
250-foot freighter out of Mirgoane, Haiti, Saturday night.
   Snyder reported the Madrid's captain said eight others aboard the
freighter were either crew or visitors and were not involved in the
takeover.
   While dealing with the Haitians from the Madrid, the Coast Guard
cutter stopped a sailboat carrying 80 Haitians, and they also were
taken aboard.
   Coast Guard officer Luis Diaz said 38 more Haitians were picked
up Monday in a 30-foot sailboat 17 miles east of Fort Lauderdale.
   More than 7,000 Haitians trying to flee their Caribbean homeland
were apprehended in 1988 and returned to the island.

<HEAD>General Strike in Trinidad Protests IMF Conditions for Debt Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers
throughout Trinidad struck on Monday to protest an economic
austerity program and wage cuts imposed to meet International
Monetary Fund requirements for debt relief.
   Oil fields, factories and schools shut down.
   The trade union movement called it a ``Day of Resistance'' to
protest the government's 10 percent cut in the salaries of 65,000
public workers, part of the belt-tightening measures brought on by
the conditions of an IMF standby loan agreement.
   ``The strike has affected us, but it is much better than going
the way of the riots in Venezuela,'' said one businessman, who spoke
on condition of not being identified.
   He was referring to the bloody riots that rocked Venezuela last
week after the government there imposed similar measures.
   No violence was reported in the English-speaking nation of
Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony of 1.2 million people
and the southernmost of the Caribbean islands, lying seven miles off
Venezuela.
   National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson said 50 to 65
percent of the estimated 400,000 workers in the private and public
sectors showed up for work.
   President Errol McCleod of the Oilfields Workers Trade Union said
80 percent of the union members stayed off the job. He said the only
exception was at the refinery, ``where we did not want to interrupt
the complex operations there.''
   Workers also struck the country's major sugar factory.
   The turnout at government offices and several ministries was
reported at 50 percent, but at the post office and other key
operations, only a 2 to 3 percent turnout was reported.
   Throughout the country, schools closed as teachers and students
stayed home.
   In Port of Spain, plainclothes army personnel drove the buses.
There were no taxis as cab drivers honored the walkout. In San
Fernando, the second largest city, there was no transportation and
hardly any commercial activity.
   Workers earn a minimum wage of $500 a month. Midlevel
professionals make about $900 monthly. Inflation has averaged 10
percent a year, but Trinidadians complain most about taxes and about
high prices for many consumer items.
   Trinidad and Tobago's foreign debt runs to nearly $1.8 billion.
The government of Prime Minister H.N.R. Robinson received a $128
million standby loan from the IMF in January to be parceled out in
three payments, conditional on expenditures being cut in the public
sector and other measures.
   The country made nearly 75 percent of its payments on the
principal and interests in 1988, or about $350 million dollars to
creditors.
   Payments for 1989 have not come due yet.
   Robinson says commercial creditors would only reschedule the debt
repayments within the context of an IMF program.
   The country's economy has been hit by the world decline in oil
prices.

<HEAD>Leaders of Divided Island Hold First Round of Intensive Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Monday held their first session of
intensive talks on reunifying the island.
   The talks, held under United Nations auspices, lasted three hours
at the home of the U.N. special representative to Cyprus, Oscar
Camilion, a U.N. statement said.
   Vassiliou and Denktash are to hold 10 sessions of closed-door
talks over the next three weeks in preparation for a review April
5-6 in New York with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   U.N. officials have said the current intensive talks are intended
to examine a wide range of options on a non-binding basis.
   The two leaders started regular weekly meetings last September
but have failed to make progress on a formula for establishing a
two-state federation.
   The Greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong federal
government, while the Turkish side supports a looser federation.
   The two sides reportedly also disagree over the withdrawal of
Turkish troops, and the right of Greek Cypriots to return to
property they fled after the 1974 Turkish invasion.
   In 1974, a coup by Greece's military junta failed on the island.
Turkey invaded the northern part of Cyprus, saying it was protecting
the minority Turkish Cypriot community, and sent thousands of Turks
to settle in the north.
   
   Denktash in 1975 proclaimed the northern part of the island an
independent Turkish state. The state, where an estimated 30,000
troops remain, is recognized only by Turkey.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officials recently stopped more
than 3,000 Poles who were seeking to smuggle food into Western
Europe, where they could sell it for a profit, the official PAP news
agency reported Monday.
   It attributed its report to Zygmunt Janczyk, spokesman for the
main customs office.
   PAP did not say during what period of time the offenders were
turned back. It quoted Janczyk as reporting the crackdown and
saying, ``We will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes
completely.''
   Communist authorities on Jan. 1 eased procedures to obtain
passports and thousands of Poles have headed West to trade, mainly
to West Berlin or Austria where visas are not required.
   Janczyk said Poles were allowed to take enough food for their
journey, but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive
amount.
   He said some Polish passengers on a train en route to West Berlin
threw food away when they saw customs officers approach.
   Janczyk told PAP that in one case a Pole tried to smuggle a goat
and a baby pig into West Berlin.
   Meat has been rationed in Poland since December 1980. Although
consumers must wait in line to buy at state stores, meat also can be
bought privatedly from farmers at higher prices.
   Trading in the West is tempting to Poles because they can buy
goods in Poland for zlotys, sell them for hard currency in the West
and then convert that money back into zlotys at the black-market
rate for a profit.

<HEAD>Quakes Prompt Concern Among Scientists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NILAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 30 mild earthquakes rocked the
Imperial Valley on Monday, apparently causing no damage or injuries
but raising concern among scientists because the jolts were centered
near the San Andreas Fault.
   A temblor at 2:16 p.m. that measured 4.7 on the Richter scale was
followed by 32 aftershocks over magnitude 2 by 5 p.m., including a
magnitude-4.0 jolt, said California Institute of Technology
spokesman Robert Finn.
   The two largest quakes were centered six miles west-southwest of
Niland in the Imperial Valley, one of the state's major agricultural
areas and located north of the Mexican border, Finn said. Quakes in
the valley typically occur in swarms of dozens or hundreds.
   ``Hardly anyone has called, and we have no reports of damage,''
Imperial County Sheriff's Department dispatcher Pam Skipper said
after the main shock.
   ``It was one of those quakes that were fun _ just enough to
jiggle you around but not strong enough to scare you. It didn't
shake things off the wall,'' said Harry Jensen, city manager of
Brawley about 20 miles south of here.
   The quake was the largest of a swarm of jolts that started
several months ago in the Brawley seismic zone. It was centered 12
miles from the southern end of the San Andreas and roughly three to
six miles from an extension of that fault, said Tom Heaton,
scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena office.
   ``It's not far from the San Andreas Fault so of course it's a
concern to us any time there are earthquakes down there,'' Heaton
said. ``There's definitely communications back and forth among the
scientists and the state of California'' Office of Emergency
Services.
   Scientists are concerned about quakes in the Imperial Valley
because of the slight possibility they might trigger larger quakes
on the San Andreas.
   However, Heaton emphasized the quake was not on another fault
called the Extra Fault, but well south of it. That fault intersects
the San Andreas.
   A recent study by Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory raised the possibility that Southern California's next
great, or magnitude-8, earthquake on the San Andreas might be
triggered hours after an Extra Fault quake of magnitude 5.5 or more.
   The Imperial Valley is California's most active seismic region.
   ``It's not uncommon to have earthquakes in the Brawley seismic
zone,'' Heaton said. ``There have been many earthquakes in the
Brawley seismic zone and the big earthquake has not occurred.''
   Until Monday's quake, the largest quake in the swarm was a mild
one of magnitude 3.6, Heaton said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

   Former President Reagan confessed Monday
that he's finding some frustrations in life outside the White House,
including writer's block and a home filled with cardboard packing
cartons.
   But Reagan looked every bit the image of a happy California
retiree after his speech to Pepperdine University students, when he
exited stage right with an eight-foot-long yellow surfboard under
his arm. It was a gift from the school.
   Reagan, who has signed a deal that will earn him a reported $5
million to $7 million for a pair of books, spoke about the rigors of
writing to about 3,500 students and guests at the seaside Christian
campus.
   ``I tell you, I sit there looking at those blank pages, but I
want to give readers an idea what it's like in that house they drive
by,'' he said, referring to the White House.
   Reagan also told students that his move from Washington to
California on Jan. 20 was a cross-country move much like anyone else
might make.
   ``I'm getting rid of those cardboard cartons. They don't tell you
on the outside what's in 'em,'' Reagan said. ``We're still looking
for a heating pad.''
   Reagan's talk marked his second no-fee college appearance since
leaving office. He telephoned Pepperdine on Feb. 27 and offered to
address the students, waiving what has been reported to be a $50,000
per-speech fee.
   He told the students he had no bones to pick with President Bush
about his approach to the presidency so far.
   ``They are setting up their administration so I am kind of
waiting to hear his declaration on programs. There is still some
reorganization, some journeys he's making and he has not set a
course,'' Reagan said. ``I haven't heard him say anything I disagree
with.''
   Ten Pepperdine students were allowed to ask Reagan questions and
they ranged from policies in the Middle East to his transition into
private life.
   Reagan said it was still difficult getting used to passing a
television and hearing the voice of a newscaster saying, ```Today,
the president ...' and I say, `What did I do?'''
   Responding to one question, Reagan said he and Bush agreed on
economic policy. ``It would be economic disaster to raise taxes,''
the ex-president said to rousing applause.

<HEAD>Jesus Didn't Promise Second Coming, Scholars Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of biblical scholars agreed that
Jesus Christ never promised to return and usher in a new age and
would have been ``appalled'' about becoming a cult figure in a new
religion, the group's founder said Monday.
   About 100 scholars, theologians and historians discussed the
teachings of the historical Jesus in a three-day seminar that ended
Sunday. They agreed, with some dissensions, that Jesus did not
promise a Second Coming in which he would bring a new age.
   Gospel writers and later followers of Jesus were the ones who
predicted a second coming of Jesus, most scholars participating in
the Jesus Seminar said. The seminar was held in Sonoma in the wine
country about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   Robert Funk, 50, a New Testament expert and the seminar founder,
said most of its members believe that Jesus was a wandering sage and
did not think he was divine, ``although he felt very close to God.''
   Funk said the seminar's stand does not contradict the faith in
God expressed in the Apostles Creed but is at odds with many
traditional Christian beliefs.
   A fundamentalist pastor who attended the meeting called the
seminar's stance ``heretical.''
   ``They're robbing the church of its blessed hope,'' said the Rev.
Marion H. Reynolds of Los Osos. He said the impact of the group's
statements can't be dismissed because ``our society tends to place
scholars on a very high level.''
   In one vote of 30 scholars, 26 said they strongly disagreed that
Jesus expected to return and usher in a new age. The scholars almost
unanimously agreed, though, that Jesus spoke the words attributed to
him in which he said the kingdom of God already was present in his
day.
   The group also voted overwhelmingly that the language used to
describe the future kingdom of God in the New Testament is mythic
and symbolic, and recommended that people should not believe in or
look forward to the Second Coming and new age.
   Although there was no vote taken on the issue of whether Jesus
intended to start a new religion and be its central figure, the
subject is key to the seminar's debates and has come up in virtually
all of its nine meetings over the past four years.
   ``The overwhelming answer (among the seminar's scholars) is Jesus
had no intention of starting a new religion,'' said Funk. ``Most of
the fellows think Jesus led some kind of reform movement in Judaism.
I'm quite certain he had no idea that a new religion would transpire
or that he would become a cult figure in it. ... He would have been
appalled by it.''
   He said the scholars are almost unanimous that Jesus ``didn't
think of himself as divine.''
   The seminar's findings reflect what is being taught in most major
universities and seminaries, said the Rev. Edward F. Beutner, a
Jesuit and campus minister at Santa Clara University and a seminar
member.
   ``These are not maverick scholars,'' Beutner said. ``They take a
very careful approach to how sayings of Jesus were transmitted and
to the evolution of the Bible texts.''
   The Jesus Seminar is sponsored by the Westar Institute in Sonoma,
a private, secular, research group that explores topics in the
humanitites.

<HEAD>Assembly Approves Death Penalty Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Assembly approved legislation
Monday to restore the death penalty in New York as the bill's chief
sponsor predicted the chamber would for the first time override a
promised veto by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   A successful override later this year in the
Democratic-controlled Assembly would clear the way for the electric
chair to be put back into use in the nation's second largest state.
California already has the death penalty.
   The Assembly approved the death-penalty measure 97-48 after an
emotionally charged debate lasting more than five hours.
   The Senate, which passed the legislation last month, is expected
to override the veto, as it has several times in the past. A
successful override in the Assembly would restore the death penalty.
   New York's electric chair, last used in 1963, has been sitting
unused at Greenhaven state prison in Stormville since capital
punishment in the state was eliminated by a series of court rulings.
The chair, the first in the world, has already been used to execute
695 people since its introduction in 1890.
   Two death penalty supporters were absent from the Assembly on
Monday. Had they been present, there would have been 99 ``yes''
votes in the 150-member Assembly. A veto override requires 100 votes.
   Cuomo has promised to veto the bill, making it the seventh year
in a row the Democratic governor has quashed capital punishment
legislation.
   Assemblyman Vincent Graber, the bill's chief Assembly sponsor,
predicted he would have the extra vote required by the time the
override attempt comes later this year.
   State lawmakers have approved death penalty legislation in the
last 12 years, but Cuomo and former Gov. Hugh Carey repeatedly
vetoed it.
   Graber, a Buffalo area Democrat, closed in on the 100-vote
override margin when longtime death penalty opponent Edward Abramson
of New York City, also a Democrat, announced he would vote for
Graber's bill.
   Abramson, citing the highly publicized assassination last year in
his district of Police Officer Edward Bryne by associates of a drug
dealer, said a poll of his constituents found that 73 percent
supported the death penalty.
   The vote came less than a week after a federal narcotics agent
and a city policeman were shot to death in separate incidents in New
York City.
   Before the debate, about 150 anti-death penalty demonstrators,
many from a Hutterite religious community near Kingston, gathered
outside the Assembly chamber and sang such traditional protest songs
as ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``No person is allowed to take the life of another person, for
whatever reason,'' said Kathy Waldner, a member of the Hutterite
community in Rifton. ``Only God can do that. We feel God should be
the judge.''
   During the debate, Graber noted that the number of murders in the
state last year rose to 2,225, an increase of 213 from 1987.
Pointing out that most of the 1988 killings occurred in New York
City, he read off a list of the 20 most dangerous Assembly district
in the state, including Abramson's.
   All were in the city and all but one were represented by
legislators who had voted against the death penalty bill previously.
   Under the bill, the most cold-blooded murderers _ paid hit-men,
killers of police officers, those murdering witnesses and the like _
would be subject to the death penalty. Once a murder verdict was
delivered, a second jury would be asked to decide whether the death
penalty should be imposed.

   A vast weather system dumping up to 16 inches of snow virtually
shut down eastern Missouri on Monday in one of that area's worst
March storms on record, and it also blew snow all the way to the
Northeast and caused flooding in Appalachia.
   Hundreds of schools were closed by snow or high water in 10
states and travelers were snowbound in airports and in towns along
highways.
   The weather was blamed for at least 12 deaths, including one
person killed by what the National Weather Service said was high
wind in Georgia on Sunday when thunderstorms battered the Southeast.
   It also was blamed for millions of dollars in losses for poultry
farmers in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, where birds were killed
when the weight of snow collapsed their buildings.
   Snow in Pennsylvania forced President Bush to cancel a trip to
Lancaster County on Tuesday, where he had planned to visit schools
to talk about drugs and meet with Amish and Mennonite leaders in the
area.
   The widespread precipitation was caused by moist air welling up
from the Gulf of Mexico and sliding over cold air from the north,
the National Weather Service said.
   In that mass of icy air, record lows Monday included Fort Worth,
Texas, 20; Galveston, Texas, 27; Grand Island, Neb., 10 below zero;
Huron, S.D., 17 below zero; Lake Charles, La., 25; Shreveport, La.,
24; and Wichita Falls, Texas, 8.
   The heaviest snowfall was in Oklahoma, where 16 inches fell in
the Pauls Valley area south of Oklahoma City. Pauls Valley Police
Chief Robert Nichols said the snow had ``drifted halfway up the
door,'' and drifts up to 6 feet high were reported on some roads
around the state.
   Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow. Weather Service
meteorologist John Feldt said the 11 inches in the St. Louis area
was the third heaviest accumulation for 24 hours in March since
record-keeping began in 1874.
   The Missouri State Senate and House canceled Monday's and Tuesday
morning's sessions.
   Northern Arkansas got up to a foot of snow, collapsing some roofs
and causing millions of dollars in damage to poultry houses. In
Bentonville, part of the roof of an unoccupied kindergarten center
collapsed and a bowling alley was destroyed.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., asked federal officials to help
Arkansas poultry farmers and others who suffered damage from the
storm. Pryor said Hudson Foods of Rogers suffered more than $15
million in losses, including the loss of more than 150 breeder
facilities, broiler farms and turkey farms.
   Up to 11 inches fell over the weekend in northern Texas and part
of a fire station roof collapsed at Bowie, 70 miles northwest of
Fort Worth, where wind piled the snow into drifts up to 7 feet high.
   Central Illinois got up to 10 inches of snow and lesser amounts
extended eastward through Ohio into Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New
York state.
   Schools were closed Monday in parts of Arkansas, Indiana,
Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio. Some
junior colleges closed in Illinois, where most public schools were
closed by a state holiday.
   Icy pavement and blowing snow made travel nearly impossible in
many areas.
   In Ardmore, Okla., 328 travelers spent the night in the National
Guard Armory and the civic auditorium, said Civil Defense Director
James Mercer. About 75 people took refuge at a church in Davis in
southern Oklahoma.
   ``I've got a lobby full of people wanting rooms, and I'm full and
it's blowing like crazy,'' said Mary Martin of the Green Country
Motel in Sallisaw, Okla. ``They can't hold their trucks and vehicles
on the highway.''
   All the motel rooms in Mount Vernon, Mo., were filled while
motorists waited out the storm along Interstate 44, west of
Springfield, according to the Lawrence County Sheriff's Department.
   Officials at Lambert Airport in St. Louis said air traffic had
nearly come to a halt. Trans World Airlines, which accounts for more
than 85 percent of Lambert's traffic, said all departing flights
were canceled Monday. TWA said some arriving flights made it in but
ran late.
   Tulsa (Okla.) International Airport closed every 20 minutes so
plows could clear the main runway, said operations coordinator Roger
Blickensderfer.
   Rain caused flooding that forced the evacuation of more than 300
people in Tennessee, including 200 Girl Scouts moved from their camp
in Cheatham County, said County Executive Vernon Knight.
   The rain also pushed streams out of their banks across southern
West Virginia, closing roads in 14 counties, canceling school in
several counties and forcing some evacuations, state and local
officials said. Flash flood were reported around the state and
several rivers in the northern part of the state were expected to
crest above flood stage during the night.
   All four lanes of Interstate 79 were closed by high water at Jane
Lew, W.Va., between Weston and Clarksburg, said state Highways
Department spokeswoman Carol Melling. She said the department's
district headquarters in the area also was evacuated.
   In Calhoun County in western West Virginia, classes were closed
early but school buses were unable to complete their routes,
stranding about 100 students at Minora Elementary School and 22 at
Arnoldsburg Elementary School. ``It's been a mess,'' said Minora
principal John Queen.
   Weather-related deaths included one in Georgia, from high wind;
five in Oklahoma, two on icy roads, one in a sledding accident and
two apparently from the cold; two in Ohio, on icy roads; two in
Arkansas, one by exposure and one on an icy road; and two in
Alabama, from a fire started by lightning.
   Tornadoes in Alabama's Talladega County caused damage to homes
and businesses totaling more than $2 million, said Buddy Holcomb,
director of the Talladega County Emergency Management Agency.
   Of the 87 homes damaged, he said two residences and four mobile
homes were destroyed. Of the six businesses reporting damage, four
were destroyed.

   A U.S. soldier whose 11-day
disappearance prompted speculation he had defected to communist East
Germany was charged Monday with leaving his unit without permission
and violating security rules.
   Michael A. Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., returned
voluntarily to his unit Saturday. He disappeared Feb. 21 from the
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda, about 62 miles northeast of
Frankfurt.
   The disappearance baffled military officials, who said Peri had
been a model soldier.
   Peri was charged with being absent without leave and for entering
the half-mile-wide security zone near the communist East German
border without permission, said Lt. Col. Jake Dye, a spokesman for
the U.S. Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt.
   Active duty U.S. forces must have permission to enter the areas
next to the border with East Germany.
   Dye said Peri also was charged with theft of a vehicle and other
items, including a portable computer he took from the regimental
intelligence office where he worked.
   Peri has undergone questioning since he returned to his unit late
Saturday. His disappearance prompted speculation he had defected to
East Germany because his military vehicle was found parked and
undamaged near the border.
   Dye said Peri, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., has refused to tell
authorities where he was or what he was doing during his absence.
   ``Mr. Peri, on the advice of counsel, has elected not to comment
to investigating authorities,'' Dye said.
   Dye said Peri had been moved to a military detention facility in
Mannheim to await a court-martial.
   Peri had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and
was responsible for monitoring radar and other military signals.
   He has been stationed in West Germany since March 1988.

<HEAD>Founder of Doyle Dane Bernbach Advertising Agency Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ned Doyle, a co-founder of Doyle Dane Bernbach
Inc., one of the nation's largest advertising agencies, died Sunday
at his Manhattan home, the agency announced Monday. He was 86.
   The announcement did not give the cause of Doyle's death.
   When the agency was formed in 1949, Doyle was named executive
vice president in charge of account services. He became chairman of
its executive committee in 1967, when the company had grown to
become the nation's eighth largest advertising firm.
   Doyle remained on the agency's board of directors after his
retirement in 1969. In 1986, Doyle Dane Bernbach merged with two
other large agencies, BBDO Worldwide and Needham Harper Worldwide,
to form Omnicom Group Inc., one of the world's largest advertising
corporations.
   Doyle's blunt comments to co-workers and clients led many in the
advertising field to refer to him as the ``man with the sandpaper
charm.''
   One DDB employee once said of Doyle, ``He is the roughest,
toughest, softest man I know _ and I suspect the first two are
put-ons.''
   Doyle got his first taste of the advertising world as a magazine
space salesman, a job he held while attending Fordham Law School at
night.
   Although he passed his bar examination, he never practiced law.
   ``In those days, after you passed the bar, you went to work in a
law office for $10 a week. I was making $75 a week selling space. I
couldn't afford to quit,'' he explained.
   Doyle served as western and eastern manager for Cosmopolitan
magazine in the 1930s, and in 1936 he became the first advertising
manager for a new magazine _ Look.
   Just before World War II, he went to work for Good Housekeeping
magazine. After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he tried to
enlist in the U.S. Marines but was rejected because he was too old
for voluntary military service. He was 39 at the time.
   Doyle persisted and enlisted in 1942. Because of his Good
Housekeeping background, the Marines appointed him a mess officer.
He protested and, within three weeks was reassigned and became an
intelligence officer serving in the Pacific as a captain.
   After the war, he joined Grey Advertising and in 1949 he and
Grey's creative director, Bill Bernbach, decided to create their own
agency along with Maxwell Dane, who was running his own small ad
agency. The result was DDB.
   Doyle is survived by three children and four grandchildren.

   The first federal desegregation lawsuit ever
filed against an entire state university system heads back into
court Tuesday, 15 years after the Justice Department first sued
Louisiana.
   A special master appointed by a panel of federal judges is
convening hearings on desegregation plans proposed by the state, the
Justice Department, Southern University and the Grambling State
University Alumni Association.
   The panel of federal judges ruled in December that a 1981 consent
decree aimed at improving Southern and Grambling in order to bring
more whites to them had failed miserably.
   Settlement talks were held Monday, but the hearings will go
ahead, said the state's attorney.
   ``Some progress was made. There has not been total consensus in
the form of a settlement,'' said John Kennedy, attorney for Gov.
Buddy Roemer. ``And as a practical matter, even if everyone agreed
on everything, we couldn't get it all drawn up and written out in
time to stop the hearings.''
   Alumni from Southern, the nation's largest predominantly black
university system, and Grambling, also mostly black, are fighting to
keep their schools distinct from other state universities while
making them equal.
   ``Separate but equal has another connotation, so I wouldn't
describe it in those words,'' said Dolores Spikes, president of
Southern.
   ``I think what Southern is asking for is the same thing that the
Justice Department is asking for _ a desegregated system, but one
that still allows for access and a chance for reasonable success for
minority students, poor students, and disadvantaged students,'' she
said. ``That's part of the mission of Southern University; we're
asking that remain intact.''
   The problem that must be corrected, supporters say, is that
Southern and Grambling never got the money and programs needed to
catch up academically to other schools.
   Paul Verkuil, president of the College of William and Mary in
Virginia, was appointed special master in the case to draw up a
desegregation plan because attorneys for 13 universities, four
governing boards, the state and the Justice Department were unable
to agree on one.
   The first day of hearings comes one week before the suit's 15th
anniversary; Verkuil has said they must end by March 15, the day
after that anniversary.
   Louisiana State University and the Shreveport and New Orleans
campuses of the LSU system remain almost all white, while Southern's
campuses in those cities remain nearly all black. The same is true
of Grambling and Louisiana Tech, about eight miles down Interstate
20.
   Southern contends that Louisiana, not the agreement, failed
miserably.
   The state says it spent more than $200 million to upgrade the
black schools. Southern contends the total spent on black schools
was closer to $75 million.
   Grambling and Tech are among nine schools run by the Board of
Trustees for State Colleges and Universities, and the state's
proposal includes Grambling. However, the Grambling University
Alumni Association has proposed its own plan.
   Although the LSU, Southern and trustees systems all are
controlled by the Louisiana Board of Regents, they often fight over
the limited money in a state budget hit hard by the oil industry
bust.
   Roemer wants to scrap the current four-board system and set up
one board to run all of the schools and end the turf wars.
   Southern, which lost $5.6 million when $11 million in state money
was cut from all colleges, would probably lose even more if this
happens, supporters say.
   Just as important, they say, thousands of blacks left unprepared
by Louisiana's woeful public schools might lose their chance at a
college education.
   Plans submitted by Southern and by the Grambling alumni depend
heavily on moving programs from predominantly white schools to the
black schools to make them more attractive to whites.
   The Justice Department plan also leans heavily on transferring
programs to Southern and Grambling, and calls for Southern to open
new graduate schools in New Orleans and Shreveport.
   The state's proposal calls for varying admission standards for
seven of Louisiana's 13 four-year universities, for cooperation
among schools in the same part of the state and for a separate
system of community colleges to take over the most basic courses.
   Verkuil already has statements from all the witnesses, plus
depositions they gave to opposing lawyers.
   Rather than listen to arguments he's already read, he plans to
jump directly from an introductory statement by state attorney John
Kennedy into cross-examination of the state's 32 witnesses.
   Attorneys for the Justice, Southern and the Grambling alumni
association each may question each state witness. After that, each
must defend its own alternative to the state plan.

   Sixteen members of the Christian
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan chanted ``White power for America'' as
they marched Sunday afternoon through the town portrayed in the
movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   About 100 people lined the streets of the north-central
Mississipi town of 7,500 to watch the Klan demonstration. Only a
handful of hecklers, some of them white, shouted at the white
supremacists.
   About 20 Klansmen marched later in the day in Meridian about 40
miles to the east. About 10 counterdemonstrators and 100 spectators
turned out.
   Philadelphia was chosen for what was billed as a Klan recruitment
rally because of its portrayal in ``Mississippi Burning,'' said the
Grand Dragon for Mississippi, Jordan Gollub of Picayune.
   The fictional movie, which received seven Oscar nominations, is
loosely based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers
whose bodies were found in an earthen dam near Philadelphia.
   James Earl Chaney, 21, who was black, and Andrew Goodman, 20, and
Michael Schwerner, 24, who were white, were shot to death. The
federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating
the civil rights of the three men, but no one was ever charged with
murder.
   The Klan group that rallied Sunday included men and women, with
10 wearing robes.
   Gollub's group has marched in several Mississippi towns in the
past few months, with Philadelphia's crowd drawing by far the
largest number of spectators. The Klan planned another rally later
Sunday in Meridian.
   Several black leaders had asked opponents of the Klan to stay at
home during Sunday's march, saying the less attention the white
supremacists received, the better.
   The Klan members declared during their rally on the Neshoba
County Courthouse grounds that they plan to march in every
Mississippi county in efforts to attract new members.
   However, only a handful of people at Philadelphia took membership
applications offered by the Klan members.
   The Klan marchers were accompanied by two police cars and six
patrolmen on foot.

   Two Colombians allegedly sent here to assassinate
Mayor Edward I. Koch and the top federal drug official in the city
were secretly deported to their South American homeland, according
to a report published Sunday.
   Federal officials decided to deport the pair because trying to
convict them of conspiracy to commit murder would have endangered
drug informants in other cases, the New York Post said, quoting
unidentified sources.
   Officials also feared they did not have enough evidence to win
convictions.
   According to the Post, Carlos Vargas Martinez and Ivan Esteban
Ayala-Zitagualta were escorted aboard an Avianca Airlines flight
Friday from Kennedy International Airport to Cali, Colombia.
   ``They're out of the country. They're no longer here _ it's a
closed case,'' said Charles Troy, a spokesman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   The two men were arrested in October in a van loaded with
electronic equipment. Investigators said they were killers who had
targeted Koch and Robert Stutman, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's New York office.
   One source told the Post that the Colombians were part of a team
of contract killers with close ties to the Medellin drug cartel.

   Israel on Sunday vigorously denied Lebanese
reports that it plans to expand its self-proclaimed ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   Responding to statements of concern issued in Lebanon, an Israeli
Defense Ministry official said Israel has ``no intention
whatsoever'' of expanding the border strip the army controls.
   Israel carved out the 6- to 10-mile deep zone in 1985 when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon.
   A Lebanon radio station affiliated with the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army, Voice of the South, has reported that Israel wants to
include five Druse villages in the zone.
   The report said the move was requested by unidentified leaders of
the Mimes, Khalwat, Ein Senta, Kfir and Ein Ata villages, located a
few miles north of the zone.
   But Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber denied the reports
Sunday. He said there have been numerous requests from certain
villages whose residents would like to be included in the zone to
benefit from increased security and economic advantages. Many
residents of the security zone are employed in Israeli workplaces.
   ``Israel however has not intention whatsoever of widening the
zone,'' Haber said.

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian ready-to-wear collections for
fall and winter got off to a lively start Sunday with fashion
darling Giorgio Armani's sporty Emporio line and spoof specialist
Franco Moschino's gag-filled winter wardrobe.
   Pants, in all shapes and sizes prevailed in both collections,
with only a spattering of skirts.
   In the early 1980's, Armani, the leader in Italian ready-to-wear,
decided to court the younger set by creating a fresh sporty line at
more accessible prices. He started with designer jeans, but the
label dubbed Emporio soon was manufacturing Armani's trade mark
blazer, suits, coats and even evening wear.
   Today Emporio shops designed to appeal to the young with their
bright lights, trendy posters and hip music are scattered throughout
Italy and the rest of Europe. An Emporio Armani shop is due to open
in New York later this month.
   For this year's chillier season, Armani, who showed his
collection Sunday morning in the modern theater of his downtown
Milan headquarters, plays heavily on casual, with a series of wool
knit sweat pants worn under tweed blazers or matching jackets. Other
trousers are super wide and cropped at the ankle, with or without
cuff.
   Armani's new winter jacket is cut off above the waist. At times
it has a long loose back, at others it is trimmed in demure
pie-crust ruffles. His blazer is single breasted with huge breast
and side pockets, a look he introduced in his more exclusive Armani
label several seasons ago.
   There are plenty of beautiful coats to pick from for next winter,
from the classic polo, to cape coats and fun furs. Armani who has
joined the chorus of voices calling for a ban on the use of real
skins in fashion, introduced fake sables, minks and bear. To prove
his point he even dotted his leather wear from shoes to purses with
precious leopard spots.
   Evening at Emporio is very 1930-ish with long clinging black
jersey velvet dresses, enhanced by small velvet hats complete with
feather, and feather cuffed gloves. He also favors the tuxedo look
from silk lapel to studs and black tie.
   Armani has never been a bright light on the Milan runway where
color is concerned and his new Emporio collection is no exception.
Browns grays and blacks, plus the traditional fall shades are his
favorite palette, with a spatter of bright red and green for future
Christmas cheer.
   Franco Moschino, who also showed Sunday, was putting everything
but the kitchen sink on hats, as a joke, before Christian LaCroix
turned potpourri hats into a multi-million dollar business.
   For the winter season he gets his biggest laugh out of the label
racket, by flaunting labels and price tags throughout the
collection. Thus a simple striped silk stole has a super visible
huge white label with the designers name and the word `couture'
written on it.
   A jacket bears the inscription embroidered in gold, ``this is
very expensive,'' and a blouse states its price, also in gold.
   Other fashion gags at Moschino include tape measure belts, dinner
jackets decorated with real forks, knives and spoons, and an Irish
knit sweater with a ball of yarn and knitting needles still attached
around the collar.
   But don't be fooled by Moschino's sense of humor. Behind the
chuckles is a very serious designer with lots of superbly designed
clothes.
   For next season Moschino prefers pants, with wide bell bottoms to
skirts, and favors long jackets with large cloth buttons.
   Like Armani he prefers to let the animals keep their skins opting
for opulent fuzzy coats and stoles in harmless synthetic fabric.

<HEAD>Takeshita Takes Responsibility For Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita took responsibility
Sunday for a major political scandal that his eroded his public
support, but he pledged to restore confidence by pursuing political
reform, a published report said.
   ``The Recruit case ... surfaced during my term as prime minister
so there is no way for me to escape responsibility,'' Takeshita was
quoted as saying Monday in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
   The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demands
for the resignation of his entire Cabinet.
   ``I feel strongly that it is my responsibility (now) to tackle
reform of the Public Election Law and the Political Funds
Regulations Law in order to accurately abide with political
ethics,'' he was quoted as saying during a visit to Shizuoka, 95
miles west of Tokyo.
   The prime minister's remarks came one day after the Tokyo
District Public Prosecutors' Office indicted four people on bribery
charges in connection to the Recruit Co. stock-profiteering scandal.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former chairman of Recruit Co., an
information-employment conglomerate, was among the four arrested on
Feb. 13 on charges of bribery or violation of the nation's
securities exchange law. Four others have also been apprehended by
authorities but have yet to be charged.
   Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted shares
of the real estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos Co. at bargain prices
to politicians, their aides and other prominent figures up until
September 1986.
   Although he has repeatedly denied direct involvement, Takeshita
is among 17 politicians _ four of them from the opposition _
implicated in the stock trading scandal.
   An estimated 160 select individuals purchased the prelisted
shares and were then able to reap large, tax-free profits shortly
after they were offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986.
   Opposition party leaders and critics say the stock deals
represent influence-buying and have stepped up demands that
Takeshita resign or clarify his role in the scandal. They have also
called on Yasuhiro Nakasone, who served as prime minister during the
span of the Recruit stock transactions, to appear before the
Japanese Parliament to answer questions regarding his part in the
affair.
   Takeshita on Sunday said Nakasone had already made clear his
involvment in a recent press conference but added it was up to
Parliament to decide whether to summon the former leader for
questioning.
   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadily
over the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government
plans to levy a 3-percent tax on all services and goods in
commercial transactions, according to media polls.

<HEAD>Power Struggle Predicted Between Botha and Heir Apparent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A power struggle may break out
between President P.W. Botha and his heir apparent because of
Botha's plans to return to work after he recovers from a stroke,
newspapers reported Sunday.
   There had been speculation that the 73-year-old president, who
suffered a stroke Jan. 18, would return to office only long enough
to step down with dignity and ceremony, making way for Education
Minister F.W. de Klerk.
   However, Botha indicated in an interview last week that he will
come back to work in April and stay in office at least until his
term expires in September.
   De Klerk was elected by National Party members of Parliament on
Feb. 2 to become the party's new leader after Botha resigned from
that post. Traditionally, the party leader has been head of
government, and de Klerk has found himself in an awkward position
because he has no formal power over government decision-making.
   De Klerk was quoted in Sunday newspapers as saying he would raise
the issue this week in an effort to clarify who the party wants as
its top policy-maker.
   ``Showdown over P.W. looms,'' said a front-page headline in The
Sunday Star of Johannesburg.
   ``P.W. and F.W. Set To Clash,'' said a headline in the nationally
circulated Sunday Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper.
   Both newspapers said many National Party officials hoped Botha
would step aside after 10 years in power, but the reports said an
overt move to oust Botha was seen as an unlikely last resort.
   Botha has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at
his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting
president, Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis.
   Calls for Botha's resignation have come from liberal and
far-right opposition parties, as well as from some National Party
members.
   De Klerk has yet to declare any major policy differences with
Botha, but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic and
thus more capable of breaking South Africa's political stalemate. He
and Heunis have both made vague proposals to soften the impact of
existing segregation laws.
   A national opinion poll, reported Sunday in newspapers of the
Argus group, found that 47 percent of the 1,098 respondents wanted
Botha to step down, while 33 percent wanted him to stay in office
and 20 percent were undecided.
   The telephone poll, conducted by Marketing and Media Research,
involved randomly selected residents in six major cities nationwide.
The polling firm said the margin of error for the survey was 2
percent and noted that it was not representative of the country as a
whole because it was limited to people with telephones.

   A Chinese patrol boat has seized a
Taiwanese freighter with 31 crew members aboard, the freighter's
owner said Sunday.
   The 1,963-ton Kuang Ta No. 2, loaded with scrap metal and used
paper, was forced to sail to China on Friday, shortly after leaving
Hong Kong for the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung, said Tsai
Fu-chuan, general manager of Kuang Hwa Steam Ship Company.
   ``The freighter was sailing on the right route. We don't know why
it was seized,'' Tsai said.
   Tsai quoted his agency in Hong Kong as saying the freighter was
taken to Zuhai in southern China's Guangdong province. He said the
crew and the freighter were in good condition and hoped they would
be released soon.
   Zuhai freighter port officials were unavailable for comment
Sunday.
   The governments in Taiwan and mainland China both claim to be the
legitimate ruler of all China. The Nationalist government fled to
Taiwan in 1949 upon losing a civil war to the Communist forces on
mainland China.

<TEXT>
   Reporters, janitors and other
employees of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner authorized union
leaders Sunday to call a strike against the newspaper's management
if a contract settlement was not reached soon.
   Bargaining talks were expected to continue up to the midnight
contract expiration deadline, and perhaps into Monday if progress
was made.
   Members of the Graphic Communications Union, which represents 500
of the paper's 800 employees, voted 252 to 48 to allow their
bargaining committee to either call a strike or extend negotiations,
said John Chandler, a union spokesman and the Herald's City Hall
reporter.
   Little progress was reported, however.
   ``As of what I'd heard this morning, they had not even gotten
down to talking much about what the rank-and-file would consider to
be the major economic issues, such as salaries and health plan,'' he
said.
   Management representatives could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   The paper, owned by the Hearst Corporation, has struggled for
market share against the giant Los Angeles Times _ which has more
than three times the circulation _ and has never recovered from a
bitter, decade-long period of labor strife in the 1960s and '70s.
   Union workers are demanding a three-year contract with a 25
percent wage increase the first year, as well as more staff and a
new computer system, Chandler said.

   The Eastern Airlines strike this week is likely
to become the second major confrontation between President Bush and
a Democratic Congress already battling over John Tower's nomination
as defense secretary.
   The aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works Committee
will hold a hearing Tuesday on Bush's refusal to intervene hours
before 8,500 striking Machinists union members with support from
pilots and flight attendants virtually shut down the nation's
seventh largest airline.
   Bush on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators
and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board and order a 60-day
cooling-off period that would have forestalled the strike.
Administration officials said Bush would not allow unions to wage
``economic blackmail.''
   That decision _ which had been sought by the management of
Eastern and the head of its parent company, Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo _ was the first time in the 63-year history of the National
Mediation Board that a president has rejected its advice.

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower says his
``excessive drinking'' in the past does not indicate any long-term
problem and he would welcome the chance to defend his nomination on
the Senate floor.
   Tower, appearing Sunday on the CBS-TV program ``Face the
Nation,'' said he would not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn,
arguing that the dispute over his selection has escalated beyond
consideration of his qualifications.
   The former senator repeated his pledge to stop drinking if
confirmed as defense secretary, and he accused his detractors of
hypocrisy.
   Tower sought to deflect the most common criticism against him by
drawing a distinction between the past heavy drinking he has
acknowledged and an alcohol ``abuse'' problem that would disqualify
him from sensitive military positions.

scientists have corrected a muscle defect in mice by injecting
immature muscle cells.
   Mice that could not make a protein called dystrophin in their

<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government authorities thought they
had the drug problem under control in West Germany but new
statistics indicate they haven't.
   In the past year the number of new users of ``hard'' drugs, such
as heroin and cocaine, has increased dramatically and drug-related
deaths have risen 52 percent to 673, according to the Interior
Ministry.
   Government officials say about 80,000 people use hard drugs and
that more than 100,000 drug-related crimes were committed last year.
   West Germany's drug dealers are linked to an international
network stretching from the Far East to North America, law officials
say.
   From Frankfurt to West Berlin, from Munich to Hamburg, drug
dealers operate on city streets while keeping an eye out for
undercover police officers.
   ``Finding a fix of heroin these days is as easy as buying
candy,'' said a 37-year-old Hamburg addict who asked to remain
anonymous.
   ``I can't survive without drugs. My whole life is bad because of
drugs, but knowing that makes me need a fix even more so I can feel
better for at least a little while.''
   Sometimes youths who haven't even reached adolescence are caught
selling drugs as deadly as heroin, according to health and law
officials.
   International health experts say they fear the situation will
only worsen in West Germany.
   ``I'm very much afraid this could be the beginning of a new
wave,'' Dr. Cees Goos, a specialist for the World Health
Organization based in Copenhagen, Denmark, said in a telephone
interview.
   West German law officials say break-ins by drug addicts as well
as drug-related shootings are on the rise.
   Drug abuse is also tearing up relations within West German
families as parents find themselves unable to bear the stress of
dealing with an addicted offspring.
   Experts say a major reason for these problems is a worldwide
decrease in street prices of hard drugs, making it more affordable
for youths and others to go from marijuana or hashish to heroin or
cocaine.
   ``You can get a gram of heroin for 120 to 200 marks ($65 to
$110), or a one-fix street bag for 30 marks ($16),'' said
Kurt-Juergen Lange, a specialist at the Hamburg Health Department
and one of the country's best-known experts in his field.
   West Germany's relatively lax immigration policies have also
aggravated the country's drug woes, experts say.
   Hundreds of thousands of newcomers stream into West Germany every
year. Some of them take to drug-dealing to support themselves,
   ``The big dealers take advantage of the financial situation of
the asylum-seekers and get them to sell drugs,'' said Bernd
Metterhausen, a Hamburg police spokesman and expert on the drug
scene.
   Drug abuse in West Germany appeared to be leveling off after the
end of the 1970s, but experts say it has made a frightening rebound.
   According to the Interior Ministry, the number of known people
who took hard drugs for the first time last year increased by 38
percent, reaching 6,997.
   Last year's 673 deaths surpassed the previous high of 623 in 1979.
   No comparable figures for 1988 are available for the United
States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington doesn't
record all drug-related deaths in the United States but statistics
it has compiled from 75 medical examiners in 27 U.S. metropolitan
areas showed 4,678 drug-related deaths in 1987.
   The United States has a population of about 242 million people
and West Germany about 62 million.
   West German authorities use a combination of drug-education in
schools, law enforcement, and therapy in its battle against the use
of illegal substances.
   Newly launched methadone treatment programs in some West German
cities reflect the country's ever-increasing concern about heroin
addiction. West German authorities resisted such programs in
previous years, saying there is no evidence it works.
   Methadone, a synthetic drug, has been used in the United States
to wean addicts away from heroin.
   Law enforcement officials have also been stepping up their
efforts in the past year, hoping at least to put a dent in drug
trafficking.
   West German authorities seized a total of 1,181 pounds of heroin
last year, up 64 percent from the year before, the Interior Ministry
says. The amount of confiscated cocaine increased by 66 percent to
1,091 pounds, while 200 pounds of amphetamines were seized, up 42
percent from 1987, according to the ministry.
   In one of the more recent drug hauls, West Berlin police on Feb.
21 found $1.9 million worth of heroin hidden in the cellar of a pub.
It was the largest single confiscation of heroin ever made in the
city.
   Metterhausen says dangerous drugs enter West Germany by any means
available to a smuggler _ from a container vessel with illegal
substances hidden behind legal goods, to private cars with drugs
cleverly stashed in hard-to-inspect places.

   Rona Barrett is out to discover if she and
three guests can sit around the dining-room table and have a
conversation that other people will want to listen in on.
   Barrett is host of ``At Rona's,'' which NBC is giving a 10-show
tryout this week and next. It premiered Monday and runs through
March 17.
   Guests will include Jill Eikenberry, Christine Lahti, Sherry
Lansing, Ann Jillian, Valerie Harper, Malcolm Forbes, Debbie Allen,
Sandy Duncan, Michael Tucker, Fred Dryer, Geraldo Rivera and Kitty
Kelley, among others.
   ``We're putting all kinds of people together, not just
show-business celebrities, to see what kind of a mix works best,''
she said. ``Men and women, all women, me with all men. We'll tape it
at my home in Beverly Hills, two shows a day. We'll serve real
meals, so I guess I'll put on 10 pounds.
   ``I'll participate in the conversations, but I won't ask
questions. This is not going to be a one-on-one. We're hoping we can
spark some conversations and that people will react to each other.
We know it works as a special but we wanted to see if the concept
will work every day.''
   It's the first TV appearance Barrett has made, other than a stint
on CNN as a substitute host on ``Larry King Live,'' since she left
``Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986. She had also been an
entertainment reporter for NBC's ``Today'' and ``Tomorrow'' shows
and before that for ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   She said ``At Rona's'' was first tried as a special for
``Entertainment This Week.'' Her guests were Oprah Winfrey, Dyan
Cannon and Mariette Hartley.
   The guests for the show will come from entertainment, sports,
politics and business.
   ``We'll start when the people arrive and we serve coffee,'' she
said. ``We'll say hello and get acquainted. Like any interview, it
takes time for people to warm up. We'll tape the whole thing and
then edit it.
   ``We'll try different mixes, and we want to see if you can do two
shows a day and still be fresh. I want to mix people from different
backgrounds and see how that works. Say a person like Malcolm Forbes
and a very interesting person from show business or politics and a
very savvy woman.''
   Barrett said she had encountered some difficulties putting the
show together.
   ``You'd think it would be easy to get people to come to your
house for dinner,'' she said. ``It's not easy convincing people it's
new and not just another interview. My hope is that if it works we
can bring different people and points of view together.''
   Since leaving ``Entertainment Tonight'' Barrett said she has been
working on original novels for television under contract to NBC.
   ``I went to Brandon Tartikoff at NBC with an idea called `Rona
Barrett's Untold Stories,''' she said. ``Four days earlier NBC had
just bought Dave Bell's idea for `Unsolved Mysteries.' Then Brandon
suggested that I write original novels for television.''
   Barrett said she did not write them as novels but as treatments
for movies, which are detailed outlines. Besides being made into
movies, however, they could be published as novels.
   She said she has three novels in various stages of development.
Two are thrillers and one is a mystery. She has also sold NBC a
dramatic series with a commitment for a two-hour pilot.
   ``I'd more or less given up my other career,'' she said. ``Except
for substituting for Larry King. Then this came along.''
   Barrett said the protagonists in all of her projects are women.
``I find I have a running theme in journalism and in telling
stories,'' she said. ``It's a different way of telling the truth. My
interest is in seeing what's really there. My thrillers are about
ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations that
become world events. My examination is, how does this happen?''

   Elsewhere in television:
   SHOW RENEWED _ ``Hee Haw'' has been renewed for its 22nd season.
Roy Clark will continue as host of the syndicated music and comedy
series. It began in June 1969 as a temporary substitute for ``The
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' on CBS. But it became so popular CBS
kept it until 1971, the year it went into syndication. ...
   `THE MEETING' _ Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X have a
fictional meeting in the Bill Duke-directed film ``The Meeting'' for
PBS' ``American Playhouse.'' Dick Anthony Williams plays Malcolm X
and Jason Bernard plays King. The drama is tentatively scheduled for
airing June 14.

<HEAD>Iraqi Leader Seeks Dominant Role in Arab World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein, who has proclaimed
Iraq the victor in the war with Iran, now seeks a dominant role for
himself in the Arab world.
   But Saddam, the name he goes by in Iraq, faces growing resentment
at home because promised economic good times are slow in coming
after eight years of wartime hardship and sacrifice by his 16
million people.
   Salaries are low and prices are high.
   ``I want to get married, but I need 10,000 dinars ($30,000) for
an apartment, furniture, gold,'' said Ahmed, a 27-year-old soldier,
referring to the three items required of any perspective Middle
Eastern groom.
   He earns just 100 dinars ($300) a month in the army.
   ``I want to open an auto supply store, but I have to get out of
the army first,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Iraqis still regard Saddam as a hero and, according
to diplomats in Baghdad, visiting Arab leaders praise his strategies
that led Iran to sue for peace last summer.
   A Western military analyst said Saddam's well-equipped,
1-million-man army has made Iraq ``a major player'' in the region.
   Iraq's new economic alliance with North Yemen, Egypt and Jordan _
all of whom lent men and materiel to Baghdad's war effort _ may
prove the first indication of how Saddam will fare as a pan-Arab
leader.
   Other Arab countries will also be watching the extent of
political and social reforms inside Iraq.
   Iraqis accepted many economic and political limitations as a
necessary price for the war, but now that it's over, the
restrictions chafe.
   ``Wherever you go you feel that the secret police are on your
back,'' said Ali, 51, who works for a retail company. ``Even the
traffic police can beat you. There's no personal freedom here.''
   Said another Iraqi: ``There is some personal freedom, but not as
much as people want.''
   Restrictions like banning foreign travel, limiting imports of
videos and barring foreign publications are widely resented, he said.
   Iraqis are forbidden to allow foreigners into their homes and
even talking to them is viewed with suspicion. So Iraqis interviewed
by visiting reporters usually give their first names or none at all.
   Certain subjects, like the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran,
are taboo.
   Iraqi government officials say many of the restrictions were
necessary because of the war and will be lifted gradually.
   ``The trend has been approved that there be more openness in the
political system, including this matter of elections and other steps
to improve the political and social system,'' said Deputy Foreign
Minister Nizar Hamdoon. ``People should expect lots of changes over
the next few months.''
   Elections postponed since August are now set for April, with the
delay attributed to the governing Revolutionary Command Council
working out laws for new political parties Saddam is permitting to
operate.
   But Iraqi officials said the plans date back to the 1968
revolution that brought the Arab Baath Socialist Party to power.
They can now be implemented because Iraq came out of the war a more
cohesive nation.
   ``Difficult conditions existed even before the war,'' said Salah
Mukhtar, director general of the Information Ministry.
   ``But any citizen who lived through the war is qualified to
practice freedom in political life. No one who went through the war
is a threat to our government. Why should we exclude them?''
   The strongest opposition groups _ the Communists, the
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem Islamic Call and separatist Kurdish
factions _ are excluded. All were driven underground in bloody
purges.
   Information Minister Latif Nayyif Jasim said all were
``treacherous and treasonous'' for aiding Iran during the war.
   Iraq's image was tarnished by its alleged use of chemical weapons
against the Kurdish rebels last fall in a major offensive to crush
the guerrillas' campaign for an autonomous homeland.
   Saddam has declared an amnesty for many prisoners and dissidents,
but Kurdish officials described it as little more than cosmetic.
   The U.S. State Department recently singled out Iraq for its
``abysmal human rights record,'' mainly because of the assault on
the Kurds in the northern mountains.
   Diplomats said easing restrictions on personal freedom will help
Saddam deflect the heat from economic problems expected to last at
least five years.
   Iraq has an estimated $60 billion to $70 billion in war debts and
moves to expand the private business sector and secure Arab
investment have yet to make headway.
   Prices skyrocketed as private firms took over agriculture and
importing consumer goods, leaving Iraqis feeling empty handed
despite promises of postwar prosperity.
   Long lines form outside government meat stores when the monthly
ration is distributed. Volkswagen Passat cars imported from Brazil
are the only autos widely available.
   One boutique owner said she spent hours scouring the market for
decent buttons.
   ``Anything electric is very expensive. I can't afford them,''
said Abdel Hamid, 34, a veteran who was wounded seven times and lost
a kidney.
   Blistering attacks have appeared in the press. Economist Human
al-Shuma'a wrote in Al-Qadissiya that the private sector was
``soaking the sweat of the people and grabbing their daily bread.''

<HEAD>Senate Courtesy Shaken in Tower Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Layer by layer, the Senate's courtly veneer is
peeling away as John G. Tower's former colleagues sit in judgment of
``our distinguished friend.''
   That's the way senators talk about senators, and former senators,
even when the political cutlery is out.
   In this instance, Sen. Ernest G. Hollings, D-S.C., was speaking,
and right after he called Tower distinguished, he called him ``Mr.
Alcohol Abuse,'' saying he would not vote to confirm such a man to
be secretary of defense.
   Senatorial courtesy is taking a beating, the niceties of Senate
address notwithstanding. The words of esteem are demonstrably
hollow. Amid the flowery salutations come accusations of hypocrisy,
of judgment by standards that are at least double and maybe more.
   Republicans are making a target list of Democrats who have taken
campaign contributions, speechmaking fees and trip expenses from
defense interests, all to counter the criticism of Tower's lucrative
consulting contracts with the defense industry.
   That may not accomplish much because the numbers are public
information anyhow, and the practice involves senators of both
parties. Hollings said the tactic is part of a Republican ``scorched
earth policy.''
   But so far, neither side has escalated past anonymity on the
central issue of the Tower debate, the argument about excessive
drinking. There have been repeated suggestions of problem drinking
by others in the Senate, but never with names to make them more than
rumor.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, senior Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, says he never saw Tower impaired by alcohol.
Warner pointedly declined to answer when asked whether he ever saw
any other senator drunk.
   Tower's drinking habits are described in a secret FBI report,
open only to senators and off-limits in floor debate. Republicans
call it anonymous hearsay and innuendo; Tower's opponents say it
provides clear evidence of a persistent drinking problem.
   But no one claims personal knowledge; no senator has said he saw
John Tower drunk or even tipsy. ``I challenge any member of the
Senate to come in and tell me that he has seen John Tower
inebriated,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   None has.
   ``We all heard of it,'' Hollings said. ``... I thought he'd
outgrown it.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the
leading opponent of confirmation, said he never saw Tower drunk. He
was senior Democrat on the committee when Tower was its chairman.
Nunn said he had fully expected to vote for Tower until evidence of
problem drinking and the question of defense consultant contracts
came up in the confirmation investigation.
   In 1984, when Tower left the Senate after 24 years, more than 40
members took the occasion to praise his performance, especially on
national defense. Nunn said his talents were national assets.
   In debate on the nomination, the Georgia Democrat said he
respects Tower's knowledge, but that questions of personal conduct,
discretion and judgment are at issue now.
   Not that sincerity ever has been one of the tests of Senate
oratory, especially on occasions of ceremony. Much of the farewell
praise for Tower came from Democrats who are opposing him now.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts called him ``a
magnificent champion'' of the armed forces. Sen. James Exon of
Nebraska praised his ``strong leadership and sound head.'' Sen.
Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, uncommitted now, said Tower was one
of the leading defense authorities not just in the country but in
the world.
   ``It is sort of nice to be able to hear these nice things said
about one's self in the Senate,'' Tower said of the farewell
speeches. ``It is almost like having the privilege of reading your
own obituary ....''
   Another version is being written in Senate debate now.
   ``I think part of Tower's problem is a lot of people don't like
him personally,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``But that's no
reason to vote against him.''
   ``John Tower was never a member of the club,'' said Sen. William
Cohen, R-Maine, who supports the nomination.
   But these are not clubby times anyhow.

<TEXT>
   Caterina Cornaro was a pawn in superpower
intrigues five centuries ago, but she ruled as queen of Cyprus for
almost 16 years and won a lasting reputation as a fascinating
Renaissance personality.
   Caterina, a Venetian aristocrat, inspired dozens of portraits as
a dark-eyed beauty, a string of biographies and five operas,
including one by the Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti.
   Her life story reads like a pulp romance, starting with a
short-lived marriage at 18 to James the Bastard, king of Cyprus, and
ending with retirement near Venice presiding over a glittering salon
of poets, painters and musicians.
   But a new book published to mark the 500th anniversary of
Caterina's enforced abdication in 1489 avoids depicting her as a
tragic heroine.
   Instead, she comes across as a tough survivor, maneuvering to
stay alive in an maelstrom of violence and political treachery
between Greeks and Italians on this east Mediterranean island.
   According to one of the three contributors to ``Caterina Cornaro,
Queen of Cyprus,'' the chroniclers' references to her as ``la bella
donna'' (the beautiful lady) probably were inaccurate.
   ``She must have had what we would call charisma, but I don't
think she could be considered beautiful ... more a woman of
character,'' Terence Mullaly, a British art critic and Renaissance
specialist, said in an interview.
   ``She was certainly hard-headed and realistic, and not the sad
deposed queen of the sentimental legend.''
   Mullaly said that none of the portraits of Caterina as a young
woman were definitely contemporary. The only one that dates from her
lifetime, by the renowned Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, shows a
plump matron ``with shrewd eyes and a capable air,'' he said.
   Caterina rose to fame when she sailed to Cyprus in September 1472
to marry James, a ruthless but popular king who seized the throne
from his half-sister Charlotte, the legitimate heir.
   But James died suddenly nine months later, apparently of
dysentery, and so did Caterina's infant son, both in suspicious
circumstances, according to Joachim G. Joachim, a Cypriot historian
who also contributed to the book.
   ``I'm convinced that both James and his son were poisoned, and
the Venetians are the prime suspects,'' Joachim said in an interview.
   The historian, who researched Caterina's life in libraries around
Europe, added: ``It was their favored method of assassination. They
had professional poisoners on the state payroll ... and they
benefited most from James' death.''
   Cyprus had been ruled for centuries by French-speaking kings
descended from the Crusaders who fought in the Holy Land. The island
was coveted by Egypt, Turkey and Venice as an important trading post
for merchants dealing in silks and spices from the Orient.
   Caterina succeeded to the throne. But she was hemmed in by her
Venetian relatives and advisers who accused her of spending
extravagantly. They also blocked her plans to marry Prince Alonzo of
Naples, when she was 34 and he was 22.
   Caterina fought back, writing letters to Venice complaining that
her counsellors spoke to her rudely and failed to consult her on
financial and judicial issues.
   In one letter, she begged the Doge of Venice to strictly enforce
legislation protecting Cypriot peasants from being kidnapped and
forced to row Venetian galleys.
   She also complained she was not allowed to dine royally in public
attended by young noblemen, but was permitted only a small table and
two maids to serve her.
   But in the face of a growing threat from Ottoman Turkey, Caterina
was finally persuaded to abdicate in 1489 and make a gift of Cyprus
to the Venetian republic.
   In return, she got a pension of 8,000 ducats a year for life and
sovereignty over the small hill town of Asolo, 33 miles from Venice.
Histories say 8,000 ducats was a comfortable royal stipend for that
time. According to calculations based on the amount of gold in a
ducat, the stipend would be worth around $450,000 today.
   ``The Venetians were the all-time masters of diplomacy,'' Joachim
said. ``They knew when to act, and Caterina knew when she had to
give in.''
   In Asolo and her three other homes in the Veneto, Caterina
sponsored theatrical performances and concerts and entertained the
leading intellectuals of the day.
   But her practical streak emerged too. She rebuilt much of Asolo,
organized a lending bank and tax reforms, and even imported grain
from Cyprus during a famine.
   Caterina died in 1510 and was buried in Venice. The Venetians
held on to Cyprus until 1570, when it was captured by the Turks.
   ``Caterina was an extraordinary person. ... She deserves to be
known for the character she really was, not the legend,'' said Iro
Hunt, who co-edited the book with her husband, a former British High
Commissioner to Cyprus.

   In a muddy field near the Berlin Wall, a young Pole
looks furtively about and pulls a bottle of vodka out of a plastic
bag.
   ``Five marks, you can have,'' he says.
   He motions to a fox fur coat on a hanger clipped to button on his
shirt. A bargain for 30 marks ($17), he says.
   If he sells four bottles of vodka at five marks ($2.70) each, or
the fur coat, he will have earned himself the equivalent of about a
month's salary in Poland.
   Across town, in the fashionable Zehlendorf district, three Poles
are painting the interior of a handsome turn-of-the-century villa
for the unbeatable price of 400 marks ($220).
   ``You couldn't get a union painter to even look at the place for
that price,'' said the homeowner, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   City officials estimate that as many as 4,000 Poles sell goods or
their labor illegally in West Berlin now that entry into the city
has been eased for them. Many advertize in the city's newspapers
offering to do home repair work and odd jobs at prices many West
Berliners find hard to resist.
   Thousands of Poles are also turning up on weekends at a
flea-market to sell everything from baby clothes to superbly crafted
amber necklaces for hard currency, such as marks and dollars.
   With the Polish economy in shambles, the vendors say, hard
currency has become the only means to acquire quality goods and food
items in short supply. It also offers the opportunity for staggering
profits on the black market currency exchange at home.
   ``Without hard currency you can't get anything that's any good,''
said a 30-year-old man from Gdansk, who drove through the night to
be at the market when it opened at 5 a.m.
   He was among a record 8,000 Poles who jammed a field in the
Kreuzberg district of the city on a recent weekend.
   Thousands of West Berliners jostled through the mud to inspect
shoes, clothing, household goods and food. The grocery goods,
displayed in open suitcases and car trunks, ranged from heaps of
Polish sausage to tins of Russian caviar at dumping prices.
   Many Poles at the market earn enough West German marks in a
weekend to support them for several months.
   ``Ten marks on the black market in Poland will get you up to
20,000 zloty, or almost as much as a pension,'' said a middle-aged
man from Krakow who was selling crystal goblets from the trunk of
his car.
   A companion, who said he came from Warsaw, added: ``I buy goods
in Poland for 1,000 zloty that I can sell here for 200 marks. With
those 200 marks, I can get 400,000 zloty on the black market in
Poland. We can live for six months on that.''
   A Polish house painter, who asked not to be named, said he could
earn a year's wages from three months' work in West Berlin.
   Under new regulations that went into effect Jan. 1, Poles do not
need visas to enter West Berlin and are allowed to stay as long as
three months.
   However, they come as tourists and are prohibited from engaging
in commercial enterprises.
   So far, West Berlin police have cracked down only on vendors
illegally selling heavily taxed items such as cigarettes, furs,
jewelry and alcohol.
   West Berlin police said that on one day alone, authorities seized
11 liters of vodka, 28,000 cigarettes, 360 grams (about 12 ounces)
of caviar and two fur coats. Fourteen Polish vendors were charged
with violations of import tax laws.
   Six Poles were arrested in February and expelled after they were
caught working illegally in the city.
   Customs checks have also been stepped up and the West Berlin
Senate has ordered that Poles caught smuggling goods be immediately
expelled and the offense noted in their passports.
   But customs officials say tourists are allowed to bring in goods
worth up to 100 marks ($54) for personal use and it is often
impossible to prove that the goods are intended for sale.
   ``There are too many of them and too few of us,'' said an
exasperated customs officer as as he made his way down a row of
sputtering Polish Fiats and vans at Checkpoint Charley at the Berlin
Wall.
   Around the corner, where 45 cars packed to the roofs with goods
waited for custom inspectection, deals were already flourishing.
   A West Berliner walked away with a porcelain tea set for 50 marks
($27), three times less than the department store price.

<HEAD>Cape Town Wants to be South Africa's First Desegregated City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cape Town, South Africa's oldest
city, wants to be the country's first completely desegregated
municipality.
   ``We are striving toward prize No. 1, that the whole city is a
free settlement area. But the government is hardly likely to do
that,'' said Mayor Peter Muller. He meant the national government.
   National apartheid laws allow municipalities to decide whether to
open public amenities such as parks, beaches and buses. Cape Town is
the only major city with no segregated public facilities.
   But the national government holds the power to segregate
residential areas, schools and hospitals.
   The Cape Town City Council has petitioned repeatedly for the
right to declare its whole area, or sections of it, open to free
settlement. The law prohibited multiracial neighborhoods, although
parts of Cape Town and other cities are mixed, with non-whites
living illegally in designated white areas.
   On March 2, a new law took effect that will allow multiracial
neighborhoods on a limited basis. Muller believes that a section of
Cape Town will be the first area where all races can live together
legally since the governing National Party legislated residential
segregation in 1950.
   ``It's common cause that District Six will be the first free
settlement area,'' said Muller. He referred to a hillside near the
center of town where a squalid but lively multiracial neighborhood
was bulldozed in the 1960s and declared ``whites only.''
   District Six is now bordered by all-white apartment blocks and a
white technical school. But grass-covered lots, intersected by empty
streets and dotted with mosques and churches, lie vacant because
most Capetonians felt the demolition had stigmatized the area.
   ``Nobody with any kind of sensitivity would have taken it upon
themselves to in any way develop District Six,'' said Muller.
   Before cities were granted the right to open public amenities to
all races, the Cape Town City Council refused to enforce the
Separate Amenities Act. Instead of signs demarcating swimming pools
and toilets for ``whites'' or ``non-whites,'' Muller said, the
council put up notices warning ``disallowed people'' that they could
be prosecuted if they broke the law.
   ``But we didn't prosecute,'' he said.
   ``Right through the 1960s we fought the removal of the colored
(mixed-race) people from the voters' roll and as representatives on
the Council,'' recalled the City Council's executive committee
chairman, Dick Friedlander. He was mayor in 1972 when national law
forced the City Council to become all-white.
   ``We held protest meetings, we passed resolutions, we did all we
could,'' Friedlander said. ``Six of the 34 councilors were
legislated out of office.''
   ``Some of the colored councilors were elected from predominantly
white areas, and vice-versa,'' Muller said. ``We had gotten away
from racial stigma.''
   The people of mixed-race, Indonesian, Malaysian or Indian
ancestry whose religions, customs, language and architecture
contributed to Cape Town's historic and cultural attraction now have
no direct voice in how the city is run. They can elect neighborhood
management committees, which appoint delegates to a regional council.
   South Africa's Parliament sits in Cape Town, the legislative
capital. The first whites to settle in South Africa were merchants
from the Dutch East India Company who established a trading post in
Cape Town in 1652.
   The 1985 census put the population of greater Cape Town,
including suburbs, at 1.54 million _ 433,000 whites, 839,000
coloreds, 18,000 Asiatics and 254,000 blacks. City spokesman Ted
Doman said the blacks are grossly undercounted.
   Officially, no blacks live in Cape Town. The adjacent townships
of Langa, Nyanga and Crossroads were taken from the City Council's
control, although the city provides most of the water, sewerage and
fire protection services that exist in those areas.
   ``We feel a moral, if not a strategic, obligation to make sure
those places have the highest quality of life they can expect,
bearing in mind the shanty type of existence there,'' said Muller.

   On the 34th floor of a hilltop office building
in the Century City area of Los Angeles, a man stands at a window
with binoculars in his hand, scanning a hillside 2{ miles away.
   Yes, he decides, there it is. He has spotted his own house.
   That's something any man who has moved into a new skyscraper
office and a new home might do. But this is no ordinary citizen
settling into new surroundings.
   Until noon on Jan. 20, this man, Ronald Reagan, headed a
government with 3.1 million employees and a nation of 247 million
people. He commanded more than 2.1 million Americans in uniform, a
Navy of 565 ships, a force of 100 B-1B bombers able to strike
anywhere in the world.
   Ambassadors represented him in 142 countries.
   Now commands no troops or ships or airplanes. He has no
ambassadors anywhere. He has a staff of 12.
   ``In free governments,'' said Benjamin Franklin, ``the rulers are
the servants and the people their superiors and sovereigns. For the
former therefore to return among the latter is not to degrade them
but to promote them.''
   Now there are four former presidents back among the people _
Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon _ the most
alive at one time since Martin Van Buren died in 1862, while Abraham
Lincoln was in office. For them, the ``promotion'' was sometimes
hard to swallow.
   ``It was deeply discouraging for me to contemplate the
unpredictable years ahead,'' said Carter, back in Plains, Ga., after
his defeat by Reagan in 1980.
   Ford, recalling his own flight to California as a defeated
president four years earlier, said that ``halfway across the
country, it was as if an invisible force had entered the plane.
   ``The merriment ceased...''
   Reagan, stepping down after completing the two terms to which the
Constitution limits him, said his leave-taking was ``a bittersweet
experience.''
   ``It is going to take a little while for the dust to settle,''
says William French Smith, Reagan's longtime friend and lawyer, who
returned to California in 1985 after more than four years as
attorney general.
   ``He's getting along fine outwardly; inwardly there's got be a
real transition adjustment...there is no way to avoid that.''
   The transition has been going on since even before President Bush
took the oath of office.
   ``I was prepared for that,'' Reagan said. ``It had been on my
mind for quite some time.''
   Reagan has spoken little of his return to private life, but there
have been revealing glimpses in public, and more private moments are
etched in the memories of associates, some of whom spoke only on the
condition that they not be identified.
   On the helicopter flight from the Capitol to Andrews Air Force
Base, the departing former president remarked on how quickly the
inaugural crowd had dispersed.
   Then, flying over the White House, with two long moving vans
drawn up in the south driveway, he asked his wife of 36 years,
Nancy, to look down. ``There's our little bungalow, dear,'' he said.
Mrs. Reagan smiled through her tears. Actually, there were few
tears, but there was no joking either.
   ``There wasn't any sense of the door closing, and no one said,
`Well, it's all over,' or anything like that,'' says James Hooley,
director of the president's advance team. ``I think everybody just
had their own thoughts.''
   At Andrews, Ronald Reagan was treated one last time as though
there were no George Bush. The Marine Corps Band from Quantico
Marine Corps Base, Va., belted out a fanfare as the Reagans went to
the reviewing stand. The departing commander in chief trooped the
line as honor guard units representing each of the services stood at
attention. A salute gun platoon from the 3rd U.S. Infantry sounded a
21-gun salute.
   A little more than an hour after Bush was sworn in, the Reagans
took off for Los Angeles aboard the plane they had flown so often as
Air Force One. Now it was SAM 27000, the correct radio designation
since no sitting president was aboard.
   Stuart Spencer, a California political consultant associated with
Reagan since before he won the California governorship in 1966, was
on the flight.
   ``We talked about things clear back from `65 on, various high
points,'' Spencer recalls. ``A lot about his governor's races, of
course. Nostalgia is the word I would use, not sadness.''
   Hooley adds, ``It was the same old Ronald Reagan to the end. I
don't know whether, when he gets home and closes the door, he lets
out whatever emotion he wants to, but there wasn't anything really
measurable there, on that flight.''
   The welcome for the Reagans in the balmy air of Los Angeles was
fit for two troupers returning to the movie capital.
   Comedian Rich Little kidded Reagan about having to find a job.
The out-of-work president joked that he'd been asked to do a remake
of his 1951 movie ``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' this time playing the title
role of the mean-tempered chimpanzee. Members of the University of
Southern California marching band offered him their helmets to wear.
   It had been a trip far different from Richard Nixon's 15 years
earlier, as recalled by Frank Gannon, a Nixon speech writer now
working in television in New York.
   Nixon, forced from office by the Watergate scandals, flew West in
an atmosphere of emotional turmoil. After walking through the staff
cabin trying to cheer people up, he retired to his own cabin and
ordered a noontime martini, unusually early in the day for him, just
as Gerald Ford was taking the oath in Washington.
   Shortly after he arrived at Casa Pacifica, his home at San
Clemente, Calif., Nixon received a telephone call from Ronald
Reagan, then governor of California, welcoming him back to his home
state.
   ``We were all very moved because it was at the lowest ebb of all
our emotional tides,'' Gannon recalls.
   For Ford, too, the situation was different.
   ``Reagan knew he was leaving office and had been preparing for it
for a long time. Nobody ever thinks they are going to lose an
election, and then you have a much more hasty transition and
departure,'' said Robert E. Barrett, a military aide and executive
assistant who accompanied Ford to California and is now his
spokesman.

   Carter's departure from office was colored by the dramatic
announcement, moments after Reagan was sworn in, that the hostages
he had labored to free were out of Iran and on their way home.
   ``The atmosphere on the plane was one of celebration,'' recalls
Carter aide Anne Wexler, now in public relations in Washington.
   On his arrival in Plains, Carter was visibly weary and had a
growth of stubble after two nights in the Oval Office with little
sleep. Then he was whisked back to Washington for a flight to
Frankfurt, West Germany, to greet the freed hostages.
   ``So, in a way it was a more phased withdrawal,'' Ms. Wexler
says. Also, she adds, ``Because of all the tension with the
hostages, it wasn't so inner-directed as the Reagan departure was.''
   For families, too, the departure from the White House can be
wrenching.
   Amy Carter, 13 at the time, told her parents, ``I don't want to
go back to Plains to live. You may be from the country but I'm not.
I've been raised in the city.''
   After a few unhappy months at home, Amy did go off to boarding
school in Atlanta, Rosalynn Carter recalled in ``Everything to
Gain,'' the book she and her husband wrote about their post-White
House years.
   Susan Ford Vance, now married and raising a family in suburban
Washington, was a 17-year-old college student registering for
classes at the University of Kansas on the day Jimmy Carter was
sworn in to replace her father in the White House.
   ``I had left about two weeks before my parents moved out, so I
just sort of left like I was going away on a trip,'' she recalls.
   A television tape was made, however, of her parents walking down
the Capitol steps, getting in the helicopter and making the farewell
flight around the city where Ford had served 25 years in Congress
and the White House. A musician dubbed one of Mrs. Ford's favorite
songs, ``What I Did for Love,'' as background music.
   ``To this day, we still can't watch it,'' Ford's daughter says.
``It's still a very emotional thing.''
   Emotional or not, Reagan says he is looking to the future, not
the past.
   On his 78th birthday on Feb. 6, he told students at the
University of Southern California, ``For two weeks, I tried to
adjust to private life and growing old gracefully, but that's not my
style.''
   He repeated his pledge to campaign for repeal of the two-term
limit on presidential terms, saying, ``Two times isn't necessarily
enough time to get all you want done, done. I still had things to do
when I left.''
   Reagan is one of only 11 American presidents who have lived past
their 78th birthdays. John Adams and Herbert Hoover lived the
longest, both dying at 90.
   Reagan has signed a book deal worth up to $7 million and lined up
a $50,000-per-speech lecture contract. Although he had the help of a
ghostwriter on his earlier book of memoirs, ``Where's the Rest of
Me,'' Reagan told the Los Angeles Herald Examiner he will write this
one himself.
   Reagan spends six hours a day at his penthouse office, which is
decorated with many of the same items he had in the Oval Office _ a
miniature saddle, for instance, and pictures of his family. One
visitor noticed a painting, still to be hung, of the Reagans' ranch
north of Santa Barbara. Aides have denied rumors that the Reagans
plan to sell the 688-acre hideaway.
   His office has a view of the ocean on a clear day, but he can't
see their pink brick house in Bel-Air from the window. The
ex-president had to go into his wife's office down the hall to do
that.
   Mrs. Reagan is working on her memoirs, scheduled for publication
this fall, and making appearances for the anti-drug campaign she
began in the White House. A drug treatment center bearing her name
is planned for the San Fernando Valley.
   ``There is really no such thing as an average day for either of
us,'' Reagan told the Herald Examiner. ``Lunch is soup or a sandwich
at my desk, and then back to work.''
   Instead of getting daily briefings from his chief of staff and
national security adviser, he now gets his news by reading the
newspaper and watching television. Friends say he also talks to
former Washington associates to get filled in on what is going on in
the capital.
   On Jan. 26, he got a telephone call from President Bush. It
began, ``What's for lunch?'' It was Thursday, the day the two men
regularly had lunch in the Oval Office.
   The Reagans have had friends in for dinner and they go out
frequently, celebrating his birthday for instance at the Bistro
Gardens in Beverly Hills, where guests ranged from actress-socialite
Eva Gabor to Secretary of State George Shultz.
   ``They've received lots of flowers from neighbors,'' says
spokesman Mark Weinberg. ``They've received a first-aid kit from
neighbors. They have received cookies from neighborhood children.''
   The Reagans often attend Bel Air Presbyterian Church, where they
also worshiped when he was governor. They arrive in a limousine,
with a Secret Service car following. Other Secret Service agents
arrive an hour ahead of time.
   They sit near the back of the church, to the left of the center
aisle. The seats are selected by the Secret Service.
   ``In Washington, it had been decided our going to church
represented a threat to too many people in these times of
terrorism,'' Reagan has said.
   The first week at Bel Air Presbyterian, the Rev. Donn Moomaw
greeted the Reagans as a large crowd lined up outside to welcome
them. Each week, the crowd grows smaller.
   ``They are going to ease back into the family and be just
routine,'' says Shirley Brown, Moomaw's administrative assistant.
``That's what they want.'
   Meanwhile, back in Washington, another transition has been going
on _ one summed up in the Washington Post by writer Charles Paul
Freund as ``damning with tainted praise.''
   ``Reagan left office as a popular and much-praised man,'' Freund
wrote in a Jan. 30 article. ``But he lacks one thing today that he
still had 10 days ago: power. The result is that his reputation here
is being dismantled, through a revealing rhetorical process, faster
than are the inaugural reviewing stands for his successor.''
   The process works this way. Bush is praised for his
``governmental expertise,'' for his ``experience,'' for his
``spontaneity.'' And every word, said Freund, ``suggests an
equivalent term of opprobrium for his, by implication, detached and
lackadaisical predecessor.''
   ``It's kind of like you're the good guy until you leave town, and
then they can jump all over you,'' says Mrs. Vance. ``I don't think
my father had that problem.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Edward Pembroke oversees a most unusual
performance in a most unlikely setting. He's been doing it for 48
years, and spectators still wonder why they find it so amusing. He
knows why.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few days before his 9th birthday, Edward
Pembroke dared to try every boy's ultimate adventure. He ran away
and joined the circus.
   His purpose, he says, was to escape violin lessons, not to become
a performer.
   Yet today, a few days before his 80th birthday on March 22,
Edward Pembroke is still going strong as the raucous ringmaster of
the oldest established permanent floating animal act in Memphis,
perhaps in America, and certainly one of the most charming.
   He's the Peabody duck man.
   ``I swear,'' he was saying the other day, scratching his gray
head, ``I still don't understand why people like it so much.
   ``You saw 'em, saw how they behave. They laugh and clap and cheer
and take pictures. They've been doing that for the 48 years since
I've been here and were doing it before that, so I'm told. I don't
understand it, I just do it. Twice a day.''
   Edward Pembroke understands more than he lets on. The applause
recognizes the unlikely setting for the performance, and Edward
Pembroke's sense of showmanship makes the most of it.
   Picture this:
   At midmorning the grand and gilded lobby of the Peabody Hotel
begins to fill. The bar opens and the tinkle of ice in thin glasses
mingles with the chatter of expectant guests.
   At 10:45 a.m. the bell captain rolls a red carpet from the
elevator's brass door 50 feet to the base of the fountain in the
center of the lobby beneath hand-painted beams and wrought-iron
chandeliers. He places a three-step red-carpeted staircase up to the
lip of the fountain.
   The fountain is of carved travertine marble. Four marble cherubs
support a huge marble bowl of fresh water overflowing into an
octagonal marble pool. Above the bowl a marble pot overflows with
fresh flowers. When it comes to gilt and grandeur, the Peabody is
not known to stint.
   At the stroke of 11 a loudspeaker announces solemnly, ``Your
attention please. Ladies and gentlemen, the Peabody ducks.''
   Spectators crowd into position along both sides of the red
carpet. The loudspeaker strikes up ``Stars and Stripes Forever.''
All eyes turn to the polished brass elevator doors.
   They open with a flourish and Edward Pembroke, in a voice like a
trumpet, cries, ``Let's go, ducks!''
   Out they come, a mallard drake leading a four-hen harem. Pembroke
swaggers behind them in a burgundy and black uniform, carrying a
stick, like a field marshal.
   Down the red carpet they waddle, up the red stairs, over the
marble ledge, flapping and quacking into their elegant pond.
   Cheers. Laughter. Flashbulbs.
   Edward Pembroke has devoted more than half his long life to this
twice-daily task _ the duck parade will be repeated, in reverse,
precisely at 5 p.m. when they return to their penthouse palace _ and
he appears more than content in his role.
   ``I've done lots of other things in my life,'' he said. ``Some
I'll tell you about, some I won't. But the ducks are important to
the Peabody and I'm proud to be the one to see after them. I never
saw any reason to change jobs.''
   Indeed, Edward Pembroke has done other things. Chatting with him,
you get the impression that the ones he won't tell you about
outnumber the ones he will.
   When he fled his home in Reading, Pa. in 1918 and the circus
people adopted him, they gave him a job delivering the mail for
$4.28 a week.
   ``That way I got to know all of them. About half of them couldn't
read or write, both black and white people. I did that for them.
Sometimes we'd get a notice that a sheriff was waiting for one of
them in the next town, so of course I'd warn them about that. I
never turned in anybody.''

   He stayed with the circus 13 years, until he was 22, moving on to
more responsible jobs of every sort, including animal handling.
Ducks would prove to be a pushover.
   ``I left the circus because the train was in a wreck coming out
of Florida. I was hurt pretty bad, and had to stay behind.''
   When he recovered, Pembroke found jobs where he could, a period
in his life he recalls with a grin but few specifics.
   By inclination he drifted toward the company of entertainers. In
Chicago, he drove the bus for the Count Basie band. In Memphis, he
palled around with blues man W.C. Handy and other Beale Street
denizens and in 1940 landed a job at the Peabody, two blocks off
Beale, as bell captain.
   The Peabody, with various face lifts over the years, has been a
Southern institution since 1869 and is listed on the national
register of historic places. The saying is that the Mississippi
Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel and ends on Catfish
Row in Vicksburg, Miss.
   By the time Edward Pembroke arrived the ducks were an established
Peabody trademark.
   The story is that back in 1932 the hotel's general manager
returned from a duck hunting trip with three live decoys, which were
legal then. As a prank, he put them in the fountain. They've been
there ever since.
   Now duck imprints show up on everything imprintable _ the hotel's
soap, ash urns, swizzle sticks, chocolates that appear on
turned-down beds. One of its dining rooms is named ``Dux,'' another
``Mallards.'' The only place ducks do not appear is on the menu.
That's forbidden.
   ``The ducks were here when I came,'' Pembroke recalls, ``but they
didn't do the march then. That started with me. The duck palace is
new, too.''
   That's where the ducks live in regal splendor on the roof, where
people party and dance in the summertime.
   The palace is a large carpeted cage with a ``bed chamber''
painted purple and gold. Trays of cracked corn are handy. So is a
6-foot-wide pool sweetened daily with fresh lettuce from the
kitchen, a flower garden, a 24-foot mural of trees and waterfowl,
and a magnificent view of the Mississippi River.
   It is a duck Camelot and must look inviting to less privileged
ducks migrating along the Mississippi flyway.
   ``Oh it does,'' says Pembroke. ``Every spring and fall some of
them land on the roof. I shoo 'em off.''
   He also shoos off the Peabody ducks every four months.
   ``All that high living makes them so fat they wobble. Not waddle,
wobble. So we replace them. They don't get much exercise swimming
around in the fountain, and they can't fly.''
   They can't?
   ``I clip one wing. Otherwise they'd be flying all around the
lobby.''
   How long does it take to train a new batch to march down the red
carpet?
   ``One day. People are all lined up along the carpet. Their legs
are like fence posts. The ducks haven't got anyplace else to go
except to the fountain and back to the elevator.
   ``They might be a little confused on the first day. After that
they do just what I want them to do.
   ``They get to know my voice. They know I'm the one who feeds
them. They also know I'm the one with the stick.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Changes in federal tax laws have put a chill on
the rehabilitation of historic buildings. Investment in such
projects dropped from $2.4 billion in fiscal 1985 to $866 million in
fiscal 1988, according to the National Park Service, which must
certify properties as historic for tax purposes. Here's a look at
one giant renovating firm that has fallen on hard times as a result.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A developer with a reputation for saving
historic buildings threw a party last April to celebrate completion
of its most ambitious project, a $40 million refurbishing of a
19th-century railroad station in Pittsburgh.
   ``We believe it will be a grand slam home run,'' Carl E. Dranoff,
then-president and chief executive officer of Historic Landmarks for
Living, said as the station reopened with 242 luxury apartments, a
restaurant and office space.
   Less than a year later, he's in trouble, hitting just one more
long fly since the Pittsburgh opening, a 105-unit apartment building
in a former cosmetics factory in Milwaukee, Wis.
   The Philadelphia-based company is struggling to save itself,
largely because of an inability to recover from the tax-law changes
that have slashed the nation's investment in historic rehabilitation
by two-thirds in the past three years.
   Preservationists say the company's predicament symbolizes their
concern about the future of efforts to recycle old factories,
warehouses, hospitals and other threads of the nation's urban fabric.
   ``There already is a chill,'' says Ian Spatz of the
Washington-based National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``That's
not speculative. The numbers are very clear. The interest in
renovating historical buildings has crashed since the Tax Reform Act
of 1986.''
   Word of Historic Landmarks' troubles surfaced when First Fidelity
Bancorp of Newark, N.J., said in mid-December that it expected heavy
fourth-quarter losses in part because of troubled real-estate loans.
   Historic Landmarks, which had completed or planned 66 renovations
in 15 cities, soon announced the resignation of Dranoff and the
suspension of projects in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., Atlantic
City, N.J., Providence, R.I., Ellicott City, Md., and Philadelphia.
   Company officials, trying to renegotiate a $46-million line of
credit and $40 million in construction loans with the bank, agreed
to an interview but then backed out.
   On Jan. 31, the company filed for bankruptcy court protection on
three partnerships set up to renovate buildings in Philadelphia,
Lancaster and Marietta, Pa., and warned in a statement the
protection may be sought for other partnerships.
   Analysts say Historic Landmarks' problems were exacerbated by
softening demand for apartment rentals in Philadelphia, where the
company has its greatest concentration of buildings.
   In addition, the company was stymied in an effort to go public in
1987 and its projects have been under scrutiny by the Internal
Revenue Service. Dranoff has said a city condominium-conversion tax
added to the anticipated costs of selling apartment buildings after
tax credits expired.
   Historic Landmarks was one of a number of companies that sprouted
after Congress in 1976 authorized major tax incentives for
preserving historically certified, income-producing properties.
   Before that, ``our tax laws favored destruction of existing
building stock, because they reimbursed the developer the cost of
the demolition and then gave him preferential depreciation rates on
his new building,'' says William J. Murtaugh, the first keeper of
the National Register of Historic Places.
   In his 1988 book, ``Keeping Time: The History and Theory of
Preservation in America,'' Murtaugh said the public and private
sector were forced to act together on preservation after World War
II because of the impact of interstate highways and urban renewal
programs.
   ``These well-funded government programs were causing major social
displacement and widespread obliteration of visual landmarks in most
parts of the country, especially in cities,'' he wrote.
   Developers took even greater interest in preservation after the
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 allowed investors a 25 percent tax
credit on certified historic rehabilitations.
   But the 1986 tax law cut the historic-rehab credit to 20 percent,
limited it to $7,000 for most taxpayers and eliminated it for people
with more than $250,000 in income. Similar cuts were exacted on
low-income housing credits and non-historic restorations.
   Thus, instead of being able to raise millions of dollars from a
few wealthy investors, developers had to raise money in smaller
parcels from people with relatively moderate income.
   While some companies successfully set up partnerships that put
investors' money in a portfolio of renovations, many just switched
to other types of development.
   Investment in historic rehabilitation nationwide fell 64 percent
to $866 million in fiscal 1988 from $2.4 billion in fiscal 1985,
according to the National Park Service, which must certify
properties as historic for tax purposes.

   ``I didn't go out and restore 300 historic buildings because I'm
a frustrated curator,'' said D. Thomas Mistick, president of Tom
Mistick &amp; Sons, a Pittsburgh firm that has worked on three projects
for Historic Landmarks.
   ``I did it because there were incentives in the tax code to work
in historic districts. And it was fun, too.''
   Other companies say they are still making a good profit by
limiting their involvement to raising the money and hiring out the
work.
   ``We generally don't act as developer unless we have to,'' says
Ellen Warren of Dover Historic Properties Inc. in Philadelphia.
``The people here are bankers and lawyers first.''
   Historic Landmarks not only has raised the money, but acted as
developer, managed the buildings after restoration and set up a
realty subsidiary to sell the buildings as condominiums.
   ``They took the approach of doing large, single projects as
opposed to a portfolio of projects,'' says Kenneth E. Banwart of
Boston Bay Capital Inc., a Boston company whose portfolio includes
eight properties this year. ``I don't want to knock them. Both
approaches can be successful, but there's a big difference.''
   Stephen E. Solms, chairman and co-founder of Historic Landmarks,
told The Philadelphia Inquirer in a 1983 interview he got into
preservation because he abhorred modern high-rise apartments and
look-alike developments.
   ``They're nothing but concrete boxes,'' he said. ``Every
apartment looks just like the one next door to it.''
   He also said he found satisfaction in converting old buildings
into housing that could attract well-paid professionals as renters
without displacing low-income residents.
   ``I buy run-down, abandoned industrial properties,'' he said.
``We're not supplanting the poor. We go into neighborhoods or areas
of the city that are languishing.''
   For years, Historic Landmarks seemed to have the Midas touch,
turning buildings covered with pigeon droppings into gleaming,
desirable apartments, complete with concierges and limo service.
   Not that everything always went smoothly with the company.
   In November 1986, 45,000 demonstrators _ by police estimate _
marched in Pittsburgh against conversion of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Station, because Mistick, acting as contractor, was using
non-union labor.
   Some 1,500 union demonstrators kept Gov. Robert P. Casey and
other dignitaries away from the $40 million project's coming-out
party last May.
   ``This demonstration is an embarrassment to everyone,'' Dranoff
said, contending one-third to one-half the project was done by union
workers.
   ``It was an open shop with bids from union and non-union,'' he
said.
   The labor troubles were nothing compared to the firestorm that
greeted Historic Landmarks' plan in mid-1987 to sell up to $25
million of common stock and $50 million in debt certificates in a
subsidiary, Landmarks for Living Inc.
   Jonathan Butcher, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Butcher &amp; Co. investment firm, filed suit in U.S. District Court,
alleging Solms and his partners were trying to defraud him of his
share in several Historic Landmarks projects.
   Butcher's attorneys argued that Solms and his partners ``are
transplanting the heart and brain of the organization which has
taken years to build and are leaving Butcher with a lifeless corpse,
without any compensation whatsoever.''
   Solms' attorneys contended Butcher and a company he formed,
Deilwydd Historic Properties, had bargained away their interest in
the future of Historic Landmarks or its subsidiaries.
   Although Butcher never tried to stop the stock offering, just to
share in the proceeds, it was never completed. An unidentified
spokesman for Historic Landmarks told The Wall Street Journal in
December the plan was halted by the 1987 stock market crash, not
Butcher's lawsuit.
   For preservationists, the work Historic Landmarks and similar
companies have done is ample testimony for the need to restore some
aspects of the tax credits taken away in 1986.
   ``I think the whole purpose of the tax incentive program was to
connect the historic buildings to investors,'' said Spatz of the
National Trust. ``In 1986, that connection was broken.''
   A bill introduced on Feb. 2 by Reps. Barbara B. Kennelly,
D-Conn., and Richard T. Schulze, R-Pa., and by Sens. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo., and George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, would raise the
historic-rehab credit to the first $20,000 of a taxpayer's net
liability, plus 20 percent of anything over $20,000.
   It also removes the credits from rules restricting the type of
income against which they can be applied and contains safeguards to
prevent abuse of the credits by people trying to avoid any tax.
   ``The tax code has always been a tool of social policy,'' said
Mistick, the Pittsburgh developer. ``So we can say, look, we need
the urban investment and we can direct that investment through the
tax code, or we can address the problem head on and provide hard
money for such investment.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Ann Montgomery works in what used to be a man's
world, getting spacecraft ready for flight. Like the dozens of other
spacewomen, from project engineers to astronauts, she brings a
special attentiveness and care to the job.

   Ann Montgomery's ``baby'' stands
suspended 10 feet off the ground like a beached whale, its black
underbelly its most visible feature.
   A gang of men and women work on it night and day under Ann's
direction with all the attention a wealthy dowager would get at an
expensive spa.
   ``It's just a good old orbiter,'' she says, staring up at the
fuselage of Columbia, one of America's three space shuttles. ``I'm
kind of fond of it.''
   For the last 2{ years she has been in charge of getting it ready
for flight as the first woman ever named by NASA to be a ``flow
director'' for a manned space vehicle.
   As such, this sprightly 42-year-old engineer-manager with closely
cropped hair directs the flow of work that sweeps over the
spacecraft from the moment it arrives at the Kennedy Space Center
until it is launched. For Columbia, launch is scheduled in July. And
when it returns to Earth, Montgomery will start all over again.
   Clusters of technicians patch in the thousands of black thermal
tiles that protect its belly from blazing heat of reentry into the
atmosphere, as the spacecraft makes its long shallow dive back to
Earth.
   Others work on the landing gear, a fuel line valve. Up above in
higher scaffolds, on this day, they are removing a radiator from the
open cargo bay and making modifications to the crew cabin.
   Montgomery has about 180 technicians, men and women, working on
the vehicle, more than half assigned to the time-consuming job of
replacing tiles.
   Columbia has made seven trips into space, the last just two weeks
before Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of
seven.
   At the time of the accident, Montgomery was site manager at one
of the two orbiter processing facilities, responsible for everything
from the complex equipment and technical facilities to the
janitorial services and the vending machines.
   Six months later NASA asked her to take over as Columbia's flow
director.
   ``I had applied for the job, and I was really pleased, because it
was something I'd always wanted to do,'' she says. ``I thought, boy,
this is going to be fun.''
   It's the kind of fun that keeps her busy at least 50 hours a
week. She tries to hold it to that so she has some time for her
computer analyst husband and their children, Keith, 10, and Sally, 9.
   ``We knew the orbiters would be grounded for some time as a
result of the accident,'' she says. They expected a lot of changes.
And in fact the space agency ordered more than 200 modifications to
each of the shuttles, to enhance safety.
   In addition, Columbia, the oldest of the vehicles, was to undergo
extensive tile overhaul, and thus would be the last to return to
flight, after Discovery and Atlantis each had flown two missions.
   ``I was assigned to Columbia because I was new and it would give
me time to train,'' Montgomery says.
   She's at her office in the Launch Control Center building about
6:30 every morning to review what went on overnight, notify other
officials at the Cape and at Houston. Every day is replanned again.
   Two or three times a day she slips over to the processing
facility, a block away to check on Columbia.
   She's a veteran spacewoman, beginning as a crew systems engineer
with the Apollo moon landing program and then with the Skylab space
station project and the joint U.S.-Soviet manned flight.
   Women are no longer rare in a once male-dominated field.
   ``Things have changed too much,'' she says. ``For a long time, I
was one of the few women here, and for the first six months to two
years, (male resentment) bothered me a little bit, but after that I
tended not to notice it.''
   ``More and more women were added, and suddenly I found myself
going to meetings with other women,'' she says. ``On one of our
other orbiters, the lead project engineer is a woman. And, of
course, a lot of women are astronauts now. So you go to meetings,
and there are a lot of young women there, and you say, `Gee, we're
really good.' And it's nice.''
   One of the most rewarding moments came last September when they
powered up Columbia for the first time. ``We were working with a
very small crew at the time, and all of them really cared about what
they were doing,'' Montgomery says. ``Many people were saying, `Wow,
are you really going to do it?' It really was satisfying. It was a
milestone.''
   The most frustrating moments occur when NASA orders additional
changes, and the workload gets heavier and deadlines get tougher to
meet.
   Montgomery has worked here for NASA since 1968, just out of
college after earning a bachelor's degree in math and a master's in
industrial engineering at the University of Florida. Her husband,
Brian, whom she married soon after she began work, also is involved
in the shuttle program. They try to design the other part of their
lives around the children.
   But tough times are coming as Columbia gets closer to launch,
maybe in July. ``That will be quite a day, the end of a long road,''
she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the year of its centennial, the future of Our
Lady of the Rosary Roman Catholic Church is in doubt. It has one
year to show the Detroit diocese why it should not be closed, along
with many others that have already been shut down. Rosary is no
textbook parish, but it serves a clientele with special needs.

   On Coming Home Sunday, the Rev. Thomas J. McAnoy
turns to the visitors in the back of his church and apologizes.
   ``We're notoriously late,'' the priest confesses as children hop
from a bus outside and bound into the red sandstone Roman Catholic
church once occupied by Episcopalians.
   McAnoy's church, Our Lady of the Rosary, is less than a textbook
parish in many ways, the priest explains.
   As the organ strikes up, McAnoy, who is crippled, moves to the
lectern to begin his service. He opens with a discussion of Jesus
and Penthouse magazine.
   McAnoy is referring to a sketch hanging at the rear of the
sanctuary, a picture of Christ in an obvious expression of mirth.
The sketch seems appropriate for the themeless decor at Our Lady of
the Rosary, a parish celebrating its centennial this year with its
future in question.
   ``That picture first appeared in Penthouse magazine, and the
official church was,'' the priest pauses, ``chagrined to say the
least.''
   But the picture is a favorite of the 59-year-old priest whose
defiance dates to his days in the seminary when he let a woman _ his
younger sister _ ride with him in the front seat of the car.
   ``I look at it whenever I get down in the dumps,'' McAnoy says.
   There have been reasons for McAnoy to get down in the dumps of
late. On Jan. 8, Cardinal Edmund Szoka labeled Rosary ``questionably
viable,'' along with 24 other city churches. Szoka also announced
that 30 of the 112 Catholic churches in Detroit would be closed in
an unprecedented retrenchment.
   Szoka said ``questionably viable'' churches would have one year
to prove their viability or also face closing.
   McAnoy, a priest for 35 years, is known as Mac to Rosary's
eclectic parishioners, most of whom live in the blighted
neighborhood that lies in the shadow of the General Motors Corp.
world headquarters.
   The golden statue atop the building is visible from Interstate 94
just south of the church, which now shares a block with service
station and is the emergency shelter for a corrections center across
the street.
   Once attended almost exclusively by working-class European
immigrant families, Rosary's congregation is about 60 percent white,
25 percent black and 15 percent Asian. They include professionals,
laborers and recovering alcoholics, along with handicapped people.
   Rosary's handicapped members live in 44 group homes in the
neighborhood. Every year they are treated to a party at the church.
The celebration starts as the handicapped people are collected in a
caravan weaving behind businesses on Woodward Avenue, near the
campus of Wayne State University and the Detroit headquarters of
Unisys Corp.
   Parishioner Patrick Gossman, a suburbanite who works at Wayne
State, says about 40 of the church's 477 members live in the group
homes, which have proliferated in the neighborhood because of the
trend toward moving handicapped people out of institutions and
because real estate is cheap.
   ``I don't know if these people would be accepted anywhere else,''
Gossman says.
   This year's party was another activity on Coming Home Sunday. The
270 guests included an unshaven man who wandered around the church,
pant legs dragging the floor, and a man who lip-synced a spirited
conversation with someone who wasn't there. Another mistook a
baptismal font for an offertory bowl and dropped a nickel into the
empty stone.
   Many are physically handicapped and find the pewless church
comfortable. If they want to meander, rock in their chairs or pray
as if God were hard of hearing, no one bothers them.
   ``The best thing is the subtle way the developmentally disabled
are accepted, especially those who are regular,'' says Norbert Kidd,
president of the church council and an English teacher at Detroit's
Spain Middle School. ``It's authentic. It's not put on.''
   Mac knows the problems of the handicapped.
   A recovering alcoholic, the priest had one of his legs amputated
2{ years ago because of poor circulation caused in part by alcohol,
something he has lived without for 11 years. He gets around in a
wheelchair except during Mass when he stands to preach with the aid
of a prosthesis.
   ``One of the things you hear in Father Mac's sermons is, `If
you're not perfect, that's OK. Look at me,''' Gossman says.
   The church's work with handicapped people, however, won't be
enough to see it through its period of probation. Szoka says he
wants the parish to build a larger presence at Wayne State
University and to devote more effort to promoting the rosary.
   ``That the cardinal has challenged us to do the evangelization is
no problem,'' says Bob Van Cleef, a member of Rosary and a lawyer
helping some of the 30 closing churches appeal the decision to the
Vatican. ``But on the other hand, there's a bit of cynicism about
the evangelization because the archbishop has never guided us.''
   Church members also are optimistic because money isn't a pressing
problem. A large part of Rosary's $85,000 budget last year came from
interest on an investment of about $110,000.
   ``We have no bills, no mortgage and the property is basically in
good repair,'' Kidd says.
   Still, financing will be a question when the church is asked to
prove itself next December.
   Kidd says the church will have to collect more than the $26,000
that came from offerings last year, but he says people have begun
dropping more in the collection plate since the crisis.
   Kidd thinks the church's location, in an area he said is destined
to be a center of urban growth and development, helped it win a
reprieve.
   The diocese, he says, just didn't realize how much activity was
planned for the area when it proposed closing Rosary because of
stagnation.
   The city's Community and Economic Development Department says new
housing is slated for a wide expanse of land two blocks from the
church and the Veterans Administration has announced plans to build
a hospital inside the parish's boundary.
   Kidd says it's ironic the church must turn its attention to
survival at the same time it prepares for its centennial Aug. 24. On
that day 100 years ago, the parish held its first Mass in the dining
room of a home off a muddy path that was Woodward Avenue.
   The one-year reprieve, and the hope it brings for continued life
at Rosary, is cause for celebrating early.

   Gregory Peck rushes into his living room, late
and apologetic, wearing a white warm-up suit. He'd had to take his
60-year-old azalea bonsai to a Japanese tree surgeon.
   ``I'm not a great gardener,'' confesses the 72-year-old actor who
will be honored Tuesday on ``The American Film Institute Salute to
Gregory Peck'' on NBC. ``I just try to follow instructions and keep
things from dying.''
   Peck, who has reached the twilight of his acting career, finds
plenty of time for gardening.
   ``I'd like to keep working,'' he says, ``but if I don't work
again that's OK with me.''
   In the NBC special, such former co-stars as Lauren Bacall
(``Designing Woman''), Audrey Hepburn (``Roman Holiday''), Charlton
Heston (``Big Country''), Jennifer Jones (``Duel in the Sun'') and
Jimmy Smits and Jane Fonda (``Old Gringo'') will pay tribute to the
star whose film career goes back to 1943.
   His latest film is ``Old Gringo,'' in which he plays
author-journalist Ambrose Bierce in a fictional account of his
disappearance during the Mexican Revolution in 1913. The movie, in
which Jane Fonda plays a spinster American schoolteacher and Smits
is a fiery Mexican general, will be released later this year.
   ``Things are slowing down, but I expected that,'' Peck says.
``I'm getting on in age. There was a time I was champing at the bit
if I didn't make three pictures a year. For all I know I may never
make another picture.
   ``But somebody may be at a typewriter writing a new picture and
thinking of Greg Peck for one of the roles. Most of the good
pictures I've done have been dropped into my lap.''
   Peck says his own favorites from among the 51 pictures he's made
are ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the film that brought him an Academy
Award as best actor in 1962, ``Roman Holiday,'' ``The Gunfighter,''
``Captain Horatio Hornblower'' and ``The Guns of Navarone.''
   ``Hornblower'' was based on the books about the British naval
hero created by C.S. Forester. Peck says he'd always hoped to do a
sequel.
   Peck describes ``The Guns of Navarone'' as ``good, all-out
entertainment,'' but says it's really a comedy.
   ``It's a put-on,'' he says. ``Five or six guys take on the whole
Nazi army and beat them. Every time we turned one way, the Nazis
went the other way. It was the Keystone Kops. It was a put-on of a
great war picture.''
   He refers to ``Duel in the Sun'' as a parody of a Western that
they called ``Lust in the Dust'' when they were making it.
   ``Jennifer Jones had just played a saint in `Song of Bernadette'
and I had played a saintly priest in `Keys of the Kingdom,''' he
says. ``David O. Selznick took great delight in casting us as Lewt
and Pearl. I was the renegade son and she was the wild half-breed.''
   In recent years, Peck has also appeared on television. He played
Abraham Lincoln in the 1982 miniseries ``The Blue and the Gray'' and
was a priest in ``The Scarlet and the Black'' in 1983.
   ``I've been offered series,'' he says. ``I'm not snobbish about
television. You want to make it as good as possible, but on
television you never have enough time. I'd rather wait for something
good to come along. Or not work at all.
   ``When you reach 70 it limits people's perceptions. They begin to
think of you as too old for roles. But that's OK. I don't blame
them. And I do want to play parts my own age.''
   Unlike some actors, Peck admits that he occasionally watches his
old films on television.
   ``I saw `Shootout' recently for the first time since we made it
in 1971,'' he says. ``It was directed by Henry Hathaway, who also
directed me in `How the West Was Won.'
   ``He was a director from the old school who tried to tell a story
visually. `Shootout' was somewhat similar to `True Grit,' which
Hathaway had also directed. He always had something going, an
energy, a drive, and a way of linking the scenes together.
   ``Seeing my films years later I've come to appreciate the
director much more. At the time you're wrapped up in your role and
you're trying to do it as well as you can. You can't see the forest
for the trees. But after time has gone by I can appreciate the
director's style.''

<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The quiet, ivy-covered campus at Duke
University seems a long way from Times Square, but it has become a
hot spot for producers testing shows on their way to Broadway.
   ``What you have is a New Haven-Boston-Philadelphia-Washington
tryout in Durham,'' says Emanuel Azenberg, the New York producer who
first started the migration south in 1986.
   The 55-year-old Azenberg is a pragmatic, plain-spoken veteran of
the Broadway theater. He has presented every Neil Simon play on
Broadway since 1972. He's also a co-producer of ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' this season's newest hit and the biggest box-office
bonanza since ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   Azenberg discovered Duke through his family. His daughter went to
school there. During a visit, Azenberg saw a theater in the student
union building and fell in love with it.
   ``This is what all of New York should have _ beautiful 640-seat
theaters to do plays,'' he says. Through the efforts of then-drama
head John Clum and a handshake agreement with Joel Fleishman, a
senior vice president at the university, the producer brought Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring Jack Lemmon to
North Carolina.
   When Azenberg takes a show to Duke, everybody _ from actors to
stagehands _works for minimum salary, and authors forego royalties.
Students get to work behind the scenes with professionals on
everything from props to sets to publicity.
   Since ``Long Day's Journey,'' Azenberg has done Neil Simon's
``Broadway Bound'' and Jason Robards in ``A Month of Sundays'' at
Duke. Now other producers have noticed the campus, too.
   ``They have picked up on the idea that it makes sense _
artistically, financially, theatrically,'' Azenberg says. ``You're
bringing something to a new area and the audiences respond.''
   Lucille Lortel took ``A Walk in the Woods,'' Lee Blessing's
two-character play about American and Soviet arms control
negotiators, to Duke. In February, dance superstar Mikhail
Baryshnikov played three sold-out weeks in an adaptation of Franz
Kakfa's ``Metamorphosis'' before coming to New York.
   ``Producers can do their thing in a very relaxed, non-pressure
situation,'' says Ron Kumin, administrative director of the Duke
drama program.
   And they get intelligent, aware and responsive audiences,
according to Kumin. Durham is one point in the Research Triangle, an
area that also includes Raleigh and Chapel Hill and its large number
of schools and universities. The triangle has the highest per capita
population of Ph.D. engineers and scientists in the country.
   Duke is a wealthy, conservative school, built on the tobacco
fortune of James Buchanan Duke. The school, according to one college
guide, likes to think of itself as ``the Harvard of the South,'' and
its academic credentials are impressive with first-rate engineering,
business and medical schools.
   Now the drama program _ it isn't a department yet _ has decided
to try for a higher visibility. The program is headed by David Ball,
formerly of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
   Ball, who arrived in 1985, currently supervises 35 students and a
faculty of 12 instructors, including Azenberg who teaches a theater
appreciation course. His reading list includes Tom Stoppard's ``The
Real Thing,'' Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and Athol Fugard's
``Master Harold...and the boys,'' all of them, not coincidentally,
produced on Broadway by Azenberg.
   Because of the Broadway tryout situation, students and
professionals learn from each other, Ball says.
   ``We had a session with four actresses who were in the cast and
understudied roles in `A Month of Sundays,''' he recalls. ``They
talked to our senior students which that year included seven women
and one guy. What was supposed to be a 45-minute discussion about
the roles of women in theater, went on for five hours.''
   Ball also decided to take the tryout program one step further.
Besides serving as a testing ground for new Broadway shows, Duke
would be used as an incubator for new plays by unknown authors and
starring unknown actors.
   The first new play produced under this program was ``Moonlight
and Valentino'' by Ellen Simon, daughter of Neil Simon. It had its
world premiere in February in a tiny performance space in the
basement of the student union building.
   ``The fact that it's Neil Simon's daughter has something to do
with it and nothing to do with it,'' Azenberg says. ``It is a good
play. Now we've taken the money generated out of certain endowments
that we've helped arrange and are using it for new playwrights.''
   Money for those endowment funds is being raised through benefit
performances for Duke alumni of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' in New
York, ``Les Miserables'' in Chicago and ``The Phantom of the Opera''
in Los Angeles.
   More than 40 students worked on ``Metamorphosis'' and ``Moonlight
and Valentino'' during their performances at Duke. ``Moonlight,''
according to Azenberg, will have another life somewhere in regional
theater before he decides whether to bring it to New York.
   The play already has made its mark on the Duke students who were
involved in its production, and students were more involved in it
than ``Metamorphosis,'' which arrived with a complete New York
production team.
   ``The stage manager of `Moonlight and Valentino' is in the last
semester of her senior year,'' Ball says. ``She has now, to her
credit, two or three Broadway shows on which she has been assistant
stage manager and has her Equity card. That's the kind of experience
you can't buy.''
   Ball has even more plans for Duke Drama, including the start-up
late this spring of a professional theater company in Durham. With
Kumin and other investors, he has privately funded Duke Street Films
to make low-budget movies. The profits will be go back to Duke Drama
as well as help finance the new play program with Azenberg.
   ``Manny is one of these producers who's really in the business
because he loves the theater,'' Ball says. ``So am I, but it's
easier for me. I don't have to worry about selling tickets too
often.''

   Still looming over Scotland's capital
city today is Edinburgh Castle, a turreted, ancient fortress on a
hill that has succumbed to English invasions since the 7th century.
   It's symbolic of how Scotland, nearly 300 years after its union
with England, feels dominated by its southern neighbor, which sets
the direction for its economy _ not always, many Scots feel, the
most desirable one.
   Scotland's lack of control over its own economic affairs is a big
issue north of the border, particularly now that a sharp rise in
interest rates is threatening a slow, belated recovery in the
Scottish economy.
   The feeling that Scotland has fallen behind England, that its
economy has been battered by nearly a decade of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's policies, makes for some potent anti-government,
and anti-English sentiment, in Scotland.
   Mrs. Thatcher has pushed interest rates up 5.5 percentage points
to 13 percent in five months to curb inflation, which has
accelerated to a 7.5-percent annual rate. This, among other things,
could raise the value of the British pound and hurt exports, on
which the country depends heavily.
   ``The harmful effects of dampening could be worse on the Scottish
economy, just because you're cutting the recovery off just at the
point where it should continue to be growing,'' said Jim Walker, an
economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
   The backlash, also fueled by strong opposition to the
government's property tax reform, has revived Scottish nationalist
sentiment, and a heated debate over whether Scotland should keep the
status quo or seek self-government.
   The tax reform, known as the poll tax, takes effect in Scotland
in April and is based on the number of people in a home rather than
the value of the property. Property values tend to be lower in
Scotland.
   ``There is a great struggle of minds in the people of Scotland,''
said Jim Sillars, a Scottish National Party member, who won a
stunning election victory in Govan in November, ousting a Labor
Party member and reviving his party's fortunes.
   Opinion polls consistently find 80 percent of Scots would prefer
a moderate degree of self-government. But the Scottish National
Party's call for outright independence attracts only minority
support.
   Now the nationalists have come up with a new formula,
``Independence within Europe,'' whereby Scotland would become
independent but retain an association with England by joining the
European Economic Community.
   A recent opinion poll put support for the Scottish National Party
at 28 percent, double its strength in the June 1987 general
election. It stands in second place after the Labor Party, which has
a 41-percent approval rating. Conservatives are third at 20 percent.
   Of Scotland's 72 seats in the 650-member House of Commons in
London, 49 are Labor, 10 are Conservative, four are nationalist, and
the rest are held by centrist parties.
   A referendum in 1979 failed to win the necessary majority for
devolution, or self-government within the United Kingdom. Scotland
has always had its own church (Presbyterian as opposed to Anglican
in England), its own currency and its own legal and educational
systems, but critical decisions such as interest rate increases are
usually taken in Whitehall, the seat of government in London, 400
miles south.
   Most Scots are staunch socialists. Mrs. Thatcher, a fervent
capitalist, has been fighting to eradicate socialism from Britain.
   She is also a firm believer in maintaining the union between
England and Scotland.
   ``This government remains committed to the union, as committed as
ever,'' she said in a recent speech in Scotland. ``And it is in the
union that we have flourished and found strength.''
   Nationalists have long accused the English of fostering
Scotland's kilt-and-bagpipe identity as a diversion from the real
issues of nationhood.
   Now they talk of Scotland being ``Englished'' as more and more
positions of power in the Scottish cultural bureaucracy fall to
English appointees.
   The government's Scottish secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, says Scots
have benefited greatly from the government, which spent 2,676 pounds
($4,683) per capita in Scotland, compared with 2,162 pounds ($3,784)
overall in the last fiscal year.
   Scottish-born Rifkind, a Cabinet minister, says government policy
is not to ``put more pounds into people's pockets'' but to make them
take the initiative.
   In a speech, he urged Scots: ``Search out the opportunities. Do
not just respond to those put on the plate before you.''

   Scotland was united with England in 1707. Its 5.1 million people
are about one-tenth of Britain's population, and its 30,000 square
miles represent about one-third of the kingdom.
   Its economy now depends on services and high technology, rather
than basic industries, largely because it has managed to attract
outside investment _ principally American investors in the
electronics industry, who have created a ``Silicon Glen'' in central
Scotland.
   The North Sea oil industry has been recovering from a sharp
downturn in 1986. Scotland's huge financial services sector is
growing a bit.
   The historic industries of whisky, salmon fishing and woolens
have modernized and are thriving, partly by targeting the upscale
market.
   Unemployment, at 10.3 percent, is finally falling, and Scottish
businessmen are looking confident.
   ``Generally the scene is quite good,'' said John Davidson,
Scottish director of the Confederation of British Industry.
   The Scottish economy grew an estimated 3.5 percent last year,
compared with 4.5 percent in Britain overall. It should grow as much
as 3 percent this year, faster, for a change, than Britain, said
Gordon Hughes, a University of Edinburgh professor.
   But not everybody's assessment is sunny, and many problems
remain. Sillars, the nationalist, said: ``There's a lot of economic
anxiety around in Scotland.''
   Scotland has been painfully wrenched from its dependence on its
declining heavy industries and its job losses, which have been
exacerbated by Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to use taxpayers' money to
rescue ailing industries.
   Scotland's unemployment rate remains 3.3 percentage points higher
than the British average of 7 percent.
   The number of people employed in steel, shipbuilding, coal and
the heavy engineering industries has fallen in 30 years from 300,000
to about 50,000, Davidson said.
   ``There is an incredibly strong attachment to (what) represents
Scottish industrial heritage,'' Hughes said. ``There is an enormous
reluctance to come to terms with that and change that.''
   Critics complain that inward investment is creating a branch
economy based on low-skilled assembly jobs.
   ``The problem with Scotland is that we don't have (new)
indigenous industry,'' said Martin Gregson, a Scottish entrepreneur.
   Many of the jobs created by the inward investment go to women,
Davidson said.
   ``I think it has a very distinct effect on the way Scotland
lives. We're a very chauvinistic society,'' he said.
   Strongly Presbyterian, Scotland prides itself on its respect for
authority, its moral standards, work ethic and collective spirit.
   Scotland also is concerned about outside takeovers of its
relatively small number of public companies. Many Scots lay the
blame for this on Mrs. Thatcher's free-market policies. There also
is lingering resentment that Scotland doesn't benefit more from
North Sea oil revenue.
   The long list of complaints underscores that Scotland ``has got a
very big chip on its shoulder,'' said Hughes, the professor. ``There
is an enormous sense of oppression. Everything is the sense of the
English against Scotland.
   ``There's a need to step back from that kind of pattern.''

<TEXT>
   Democracy, Gorbachev style, went to
work aboard a Soviet fishing vessel off South America. Its 50
officers and sailors met during a storm to nominate a candidate for
a new national assembly back home.
   Slicing through 40-foot foam-flecked waves, the 18,000-ton Kola
Bay covered 400 nautical miles before its crew could agree on who
they thought should represent them in the halls of power in Moscow,
said first mate Konstantin S. Atroshnikov.
   Democracy, Gorbachev style, pre-empted the movie ``King Kong'' in
the palace of culture of this port city 1,000 miles north of Moscow,
famed as the destination of the World War II Allied convoys carrying
guns and Spam to the embattled Soviets.
   In snow-coated Kirov Palace, where on other days the great ape
had roared on the screen, more than 700 delegates from city
workplaces and neighborhoods gathered to whittle down the list of
candidates to be proposed to voters. It took them nine hours to pare
the list of six names to three.
   With passion and skepticism, a modest measure of ballyhoo and a
big dose of confusion, this city of 440,000 and the Soviet Union at
large are experiencing their first nationwide election campaign
where voters will be allowed a choice, instead of having a single
candidate put up by the Communist Party.
   ``I'm running because the law now gives me that right, and I want
to state my positions,'' said one Murmansk candidate, Andrei A.
Zolotkov, an engineer who has worked on nuclear-powered icebreakers.
``That's my only goal.''
   Said the chief of Murmansk's Communist Party apparatus, Vladimir
P. Khachenko: ``In the past, we used to gather in committee and say:
`How many women candidates do we need here, or how many workers
there?' This time not a single candidate has been endorsed by the
city (party) committee.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who championed the
multi-candidate elections, calls the exercise a ``school of
democracy.'' He says Soviet political life must be opened to greater
citizen participation if his program for ``perestroika'' (social and
economic change) is to succeed.
   That's the theory.
   In practice, there are clear signs of pressure from the party in
some sections of the country, like the conservative Ukraine, to have
a party-backed candidate become the voter's sole option in the
elections March 26 for the newly created Council of People's
Deputies.
   The electoral changes, approved in December by the Soviet
parliament, also create what some Soviets call ``filters'' at
several levels to block candidates who can't garner majority support
on nominating panels.
   One famous victim of the ``filters'' was Andrei D. Sakharov, the
dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, whose candidacy was not
backed by the Academy of Sciences. The choice of the Kola Bay's
crew, the captain of another fishing boat, never made it through a
subsequent nominating meeting held by representatives of Sevriba,
the enterprise that runs the Kola Bay and more than 70 other
Murmansk-based fishing vessels.
   As a result of the meeting in late February at the culture
palace, voters in Murmansk's Territorial Election District No. 224
will choose on March 26 from among a doctor, the chief of a fishing
trawler fleet, and the 37-year-old Zolotkov.
   What's emerging in their fledgling campaigns is a pronounced
accent on local issues, such as the lack of housing that's keeping
50,000 Murmansk residents waiting for better apartments; the
rationing of sugar, sausage and other staples; the lack of
polyclinics in new neighborhoods, and the fouling of the environment
by industry in this once pristine region north of the Arctic Circle.
   Zolotkov's nine-minute speech at the Kirov Palace never mentioned
Gorbachev but detailed the problems of his fellow city dwellers and
had a distinct ``let's send a message to Moscow'' tone.
   ``When you're talking about people's lives, you must make
demands,'' he declared.
   According to Khachenko, there's little if any difference in the
candidates' platforms: ``What people want is a deputy with courage
who will fight for what he believes in.''
   What's also becoming apparent in Murmansk is a clannishness, or
splitting along professional lines.
   ``The city's doctors are campaigning for the doctor and are in
the street passing out leaflets,'' Khachenko said. The captain,
meanwhile, has surrounded himself with other captains.
   A local editor, Viktor V. Prostikhin, is trying to shake off
attempts by Murmansk's electoral commission to force his Arctic Star
newspaper, run by the Murmansk Shipping Company, to give equal space
to other candidates besides Zolotkov, a shipping company employee.
   ``That's pressure on the press,'' Prostikhin maintained.
   If Gorbachev's new electoral system is a school, Zolotkov is a
budding star pupil.
   The lanky Murmansk native with gray-streaked black hair wears a
burgandy tie and light blue shirt, because allies advised him to.
   However, the engineer drew the line at loosening his collar and
tie while campaigning, as his advisers suggested.
   ``Somebody told me that's what American senators do, but it
wouldn't look proper here,'' Zolotkov said in an interview, between
puffs on an imported Pall Mall cigarette.
   Before the Kirov Palace meeting, Zolotkov bought time on an
electric sign that shines down on Murmansk's main square.
   ``VOTE FOR ANDREI ALEKSEYEICH ZOLOTKOV,'' it said.
   He wanted to rent a sound truck but relented when told that the
move might offend other candidates.
   His character became a campaign issue when one participant in the
Kirov Palace meeting asked him if he would have the courage to
publicly oppose a decision by Gorbachev.
   ``Yes,'' he responded.
   ``I already have disagreements with the election law,'' Zolotkov
said. ``Why should a member of the (party) Central Committee have
more votes than I do?''
   The Gorbachev-backed law gives the Communist Party the right to
directly fill 100 of the assembly's 2,250 seats.
   Whether a candidate like Zolotkov can win March 26 is a subject
of keen debate in Murmansk.
   ``Perestroika so far here is more slogans that deeds,'' said Yura
Verbitsk, 24, who works at a plant that burns garbage to generate
electricity. ``There are a lot of people still around from the era
of (Leonid I.) Brezhnev,'' the late Soviet president.
   But the fact Zolotkov even made it to the ballot is a sign of
changing times. To become the candidate proposed by the Murmansk
Shipping Co., he beat out a man who would have been an easy winner
in past elections, an icebreaker captain awarded the coveted title
of Hero of Socialist Labor.
   Zolotkov, a candidate for membership in the Communist Party, says
he is no expert on economics or legal matters but wants to go to
Moscow to make Gorbachev's vision of Soviet democracy work.
   ``If one party is directing things, that's exactly why we need a
stronger legislature,'' he said. ``By my activities, I want to
demonstrate that there can be controls on power.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``True Believer''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The American judicial system, that great theater of the absurd,
seems to inspire more movies than any subject except love.
   The newest addition to the pantheon is ``True Believer,'' the
saga of one burned-out lawyer and the murder case which offers him
redemption.
   In the capable hands of director Joseph Ruben and actor James
Woods, the imaginative story of lawyer Eddie Dodd becomes a genuine
edge-of-your-seat thriller with an ending that, for once, is not
telegraphed in advance.
   Believable? Well, one can't ask for everything. Suspension of
disblief is the name of the game in Wesley Strick's cleverly crafted
script.
   We meet Dodd at the nadir of his brilliant legal career. Once a
champion of the underdog, a fighter for unpopular causes, this aging
radical with the graying pony tail, has been reduced to defending
drug dealers. He says he's fighting for the constitution, but
neither he nor we believe that.
   With the arrival of his fresh-faced, hero worshipping new law
clerk (Robert Downey Jr.), Dodd is reminded of his past glories but
gives the apprentice defense lawyer his most cynical assessment of
the accused: ``They're all guilty.''
   That pronouncement quickly is followed by the arrival at Dodd's
office of a tearful mother seeking help for her imprisoned son. She
claims the son, a Korean-American, was wrongly convicted of a
Chinatown murder.
   Dodd takes the case, and with that begins piecing together a
puzzle so complicated we aren't quite sure where it leads. When the
revelations pile up toward the end, they are stunning.
   The pace of ``True Believer'' is so fast that we have little time
to question its real-world underpinnings. It will be hours before we
begin to wonder why Eddie Dodd, hated by law enforcement, would
tempt fate by openly smoking pot in his law office. Or why the most
simple fact involving the location of the coroner's office eludes
everyone on this case for years.
   But the plot is complex enough to distract us from such concerns.
And the peformances _ particularly Woods' _ make it all seem
plausible.
   Downey is appealing as the wide-eyed young law clerk who helps
crack the case. Charles Hallahan is memorable as the key prosecution
witness and Kurtwood Smith gives a cool malevolence to the district
attorney. Yuji Okumoto as the accused murderer and Miguel Fernandes
as one of several villains, give strong supporting performances.
   Production designer Lawrence Miller adds insight into Eddie
Dodd's character with his cluttered office and the lower Manhattan
world he inhabits.
   Woods puts his stamp so strongly on Eddie Dodd that it's hard to
imagine anyone else playing this off-beat character. With such
successful casting, could there be a sequel in the works?
   ``True Believer'' is rated R for violence.

   ``Spike of Bensonhurst'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
R)
   
   I fell asleep midway through this thoroughly confused and
confusing movie, woke up, dutifully rewound and watched again and I
still don't understand what happens in ``Spike of Bensonhurst.'' Or
why or how. And it didn't make me care.
   Spike (Sasha Mitchell) is your basic no-talent club fighter who
gets involved with Angel (the amusing Maria Pitillo), daughter of
the local don (Ernest Borgnine) and gets her pregnant as a kind of
career move.
   Of course the don wants no part of Spike, who is exiled from
Bensonhurst (in Brooklyn) and he impregnates a pal's sister _ the
achingly lovely Talisa Soto, whose luminous beauty is utterly wasted
here.
   I swear I don't know why any of this movie happens the way it
does. None of the characters are real. The actors are pretending
they are real, but it's really easy to see they are not _ all except
Talisa Soto, who wisely says little.
   ``Spike of Bensonhurst'' is a disquieting thing to see: It's not
like real life. It's not like a movie fantasy. It's not funny. It's
not scary. It's not anything.

   ``New York'' (Sire) _ Lou Reed
   
   ``You can't beat 2 guitars, bass, drum.'' Lou Reed states this in
the liner notes and proves it in each of the 14 songs on this album.
His four-piece band turns out essential rock 'n' roll, lean and
muscular. And this close-to-the-bone playing is the only proper
accompaniment for the down-to-the-marrow lyrics of Reed's bleak look
at his city.
   The wild side of city life that Reed once glorified has turned
brutal in the age of crack and AIDS. Drugged-out parents beat their
kids, love and sex are just a brief escape from the crack wars, the
ghosts of AIDS victims haunt the ``Halloween Parade'' and about all
you can depend on is ``the worst always happening.''
   The album title might as well include a date _ sometime in late
1988. References to specific crime cases and to Morton Downey Jr.,
Jimmy Swaggart and Rudy Giuliani threaten to turn the album into the
audio equivalent of one day's issue of a tabloid newspaper _ lacking
in the timelessness or universality that can touch people years
later or miles away.
   But just as a human interest feature story in a newspaper can be
more gripping than the latest shock headline, ``New York'' is most
successful when Reed focuses on individuals. In ``Romeo Had
Juliette,'' Romeo Rodriguez comes in from the crack-ridden streets
for a few moment's escape in bed with his Juliette. In ``Dirty
Blvd.'' young Pedro finds a book on magic in a garbage can and sits
in his welfare hotel room wishing he could make himself disappear.
   The album's lyrical strengths and shortcomings are highlighted by
a mix in which Reed's unvarnished vocal is featured prominently. But
if ``New York'' proves to have staying power, credit the two
guitars, bass, drum.

   ``Money for Nothing'' (Warner Bros.) _ Dire Straits
   
   This greatest-hits collection, coming as it does in the midst of
Mark Knopfler's public nonchalance about the future of Dire Straits,
if any, has an air of finality to it.
   But this is no ``Crossroads''-style retrospective; rather, it's
the obligatory, single-disc collection with the obligatory live
track ``not previously available'' _ in this case, the gentle
``Portobello Belle.''
   Much of the material is, then, Dire Straits' ``hits.'' But the
band has had few real hit singles; they are an album group, and most
fans will already have many of these songs. One notable omission is
``Skateaway'' from ``Making Movies,'' which became a semi-video-hit
in the early days of MTV.
   ``Money for Nothing'' _ this album, not the single, which is
indeed included _ also has one major fault: an unfortunate remixing
of the fine dance track, ``Twisting by the Pool.'' This time, the
sound is thinner, and some of Knopfler's vocals _ about the closest
his singing ever came to a rock 'n' roll rave-up _ have actually
been deleted.
   Still, many of these songs remain certifiably brilliant. Mark
Knopfler was fond of introducing his group in concert as the ``Dire
Straits rock 'n' roll band,'' and it has been that milieu, not his
session work or his film scores, that stands as his highest
testament.

   Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 in C minor; Etudes-Tableaux, Op. 39, by
Sergei Rachmaninoff; Evgeny Kissin and the London Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Valery Gergiev (RCA Victor)
   
   For an 18-year-old Russian pianist who played his first recital
seven years ago, why not debut on disc with Rachmaninoff's virtuosic
and most recorded of his four piano concerti. Evgeny Kissin, who
looks about 14 in his picture, gives a sure reading of this lush,
difficult work. He has plenty of technique and plays without
affectation.
   What's missing is a more vivid sense of mood and character
changes in contrasting sections _ the different flavors shown by
Gary Graffman, say, with Leonard Bernstein and the New York
Philharmonic on an older CBS recording. Then there's always
Sviatoslav Richter's performance on DG, and of course the composer's
own 1929 version with the Philadelphia Orchestra.
   The sound of the RCA recording is clear, though sometimes the
piano is a bit mushy, perhaps the result of a little too much pedal.
Valery Gergiev, music director of the Kirov Opera, and the LSO
provide solid support, particularly with some gorgeous wind solos in
the second movement.
   Rachmaninoff wrote the work after being treated for a paralyzing
depression brought on by the failure of his first symphony in 1897.
He dedicated the concerto to Dr. Nicolai Dahl, who helped his
depression with hypnosis, repeating _ as Racn to write your concerto. ...
you will work with great
facility. ... the concerto will be of an excellent quality.''' He
did. He did. It is. Kissin's performance is excellent but not
hypnotic.
   It's nice to see the infrequently recorded Etudes-Tableaux
coupled with the concerto. They have a Chopinesque flavor to them,
varying in moods. Kissin is more successful in the more intimate,
quieter moments. By the way, why include only six of the nine etudes
in Op. 39? At only 59:53, the disc has plenty of room to include the
other three.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Adventures of Terry Gilliam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Terry Gilliam doesn't make
box-office ticket machines sing. His movies aren't stuffed with car
chases, naked women or automatic weaponry. He prefers strange
characters, weird settings and unusual endings.
   Most of what Gilliam does rubs corporate Hollywood the wrong way.
And that's why the arrival of his new film, ``The Adventures of
Baron Munchausen,'' is such a minor miracle.
   While many other Hollywood filmmakers produce predictable, mass
appeal fare, Gilliam grinds out ruminations on fantasy, idealism,
history and death.
   ``I'm desperately trying to make popular films because they speak
to a large audience,'' Gilliam said on a recent visit from his home
in London. ``But I also want to turn people a little bit off the
path they are charging down.''
   Gilliam's past films have been praised by critics as much for
what the movies do as for what they don't do. Both 1981's ``Time
Bandits,'' about a schoolboy's exotic travels through the past, and
1985's ``Brazil,'' a bleak scrutiny of a nonsensical future, refused
to surrender their inventive premises.
   ``I had a very early talk with producer Arnon Milchan when we
started `Brazil,' '' Gilliam said. ``I said, `Arnon, we have to
approach this film in a very specific way. We have to think of it as
the most spectacular failure the world has ever seen. Because the
minute we start to think of it as a great film, or a good film or a
popular film _ any of those things _ we then start compromising.'''
   Four years in the making, ``Baron Munchausen'' fits no mold
either. In visually overwhelming style, the movie chronicles the
fantastic travels of a 10-year-old girl (Sarah Polley) and the
legendary German calvary officer Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von
Munchausen (John Neville), who was known for his exaggerated tales.
(His exploits were chronicled by the German writer Rudolf Erich
Raspe.)
   The two, trapped in an 18th-century European city surrounded by
threatening armies, set out in an improvised hot air balloon to save
their compatriots. The couple's odyssey takes them to the moon, the
center of the Earth and the stomach of a giant sea monster.
   While Gilliam says the film should appeal to a broad audience,
its lack of stars and British flavor will present a marketing
challenge to Columbia Pictures. And Gilliam, already having survived
the film's difficult production, knows he's not yet out of the woods.
   ``There are a lot of people here,'' he said with a sweep of his
hand toward Hollywood, ``who have worked very hard at training an
audience. I think America is the most brainwashed country in the
world.'' Brainwashed, Gilliam said, into thinking that everything is
safe, and nothing unusual is worth experiencing.
   ``McDonald's hamburgers are safe. They're not good or bad.
They're safe. You know exactly what you're going to get.
   ``Everything here is so infantile. There is no future, there is
no past, and the present is reduced to a nanosecond. People are just
seeing the same thing over and over again. They're being pandered to
all the time and their vision of the world gets smaller and
smaller.''
   Only a few moviegoers these days now want to be challenged, he
said.
   ``It terrifies me. What happens is that the handful of people who
are doing really interesting things end up only speaking to a very
small audience. And that's what I don't want to do.''
   Whether U.S. audiences love or hate ``Baron Munchausen'' isn't
exactly the point. What Gilliam is after is shaking the seats in
which they so casually slump.
   ``When my kids were younger, I would read fairy tales to them _
`Red Riding Hood.' And it's bowdlerized. Suddenly, the wolf doesn't
really eat Granny. Granny actually has been somehow hiding _ she'd
run and hide in the cupboard.
   ``And the woodsman has been turned into daddy, who chases the
wolf away. The whole point is just gone. And those fairy tales are
meant to be frightening. They're meant to scare the kids. Children
should know the world is not just a jolly place.
   ``And we just sit here and tell the kids it's all `Sesame Street'
time _ everything is wonderful. I don't mind that, but I think the
balance is gone. ... People don't want to see depressing endings.
But most of the great works of art tended to be tragedies.''
   Unlike ``Brazil,'' a movie so terrifying that Universal Pictures
originally refused to release it, ``Baron Munchausen'' celebrates
the triumph of whimsy.
   ``I wanted to make an upbeat movie,'' Gilliam said. ``I wanted
fantasy to win. I was making a film primarily for my daughters (ages
eight and 12) _ and to tell this fairy tale, not another fairy
tale.''
   Gilliam, 38, a graduate of Los Angeles' Occidental College and a
frequent collaborator with the British comedy troupe Monty Python,
said that as pleased as he is with ``Baron Munchausen,'' he'd never
want to repeat the experience.
   ``You begin to wonder whether it is worth four years of your
life. I wouldn't do it again. I hated the thing and I actually
wanted to quit.
   ``It was the worst nightmare I've ever been involved in. By week
two, I wanted out. It was like punishment for something I'd done. I
actually felt like Job.''
   Out of such anguish, though, do wonderful endings sometimes
follow.

<HEAD>The Artists: Underground Art Surfaces at Pompidou Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clanking pin ball machine, six bicycles and a
projector showing white light are among 100 pieces of ``anti-art''
objects on display at the Georges Pompidou Center in a retrospective
of Situationist art. It is said to be the first such exhibit of its
kind.
   ``On the Passage of a Few People Through a Rather Brief Moment in
Time, the Situationists 1957-1972,'' features comic strips,
cartoons, pamphlets, posters, paintings, sculpture and books
documenting the growth of the International Situationist.
   The International Situationist was an underground, avant-garde
movement of the 1960s and '70s which attempted to tear down the
barriers between art and everyday life.
   Situationists worked to combat what they saw as the oppression of
the individual by advertising and other elements of a capitalist
society.
   ``Their basic idea was that the mediated image controls us,''
said Elisabeth Sussman, chief curator at the Institute of
Contemporary Art in Boston which co-produced the show with the
Pompidou Center.
   ``Advertising is so dominant people only know what they're told
to desire, there's no room for their own desires to surface.''
   The show will run in Paris through April 9, go to London's
Institute of Contemporary Art from June 21 to Aug. 13 and move to
the Institute of Contemporary Art of Boston from Oct. 21 to Jan.7,
1990.
   Among works on display are a giant collage-mural by Britain's
Jamie Reid, who designed posters and record covers for the
now-defunct Sex Pistols punk rock group, and paintings by Italy's
Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio wrapped around an industrial spool.
   Most notable in his absence is Guy Debord, the French filmmaker
who was the movement's leading theoretician and author of the
Situationist bible, ``The Society of the Spectacle.'' The reclusive
Debord has not allowed screenings of his films since 1982, but they
were evoked in the show by a whirring projector showing only a beam
of light.
   The exhibition would probably horrify die-hard Situationists who
were opposed to both showing or selling art.
   Born in Europe as an offshoot of surrealism, the movement _
gathering no more than 100 members at any given time _ expelled
followers who became too commercial.
   ``Painting is finished. It might as well be killed off,''
proclaimed one poster.
   This early philosophy rose to a climax during the 1968 student
revolts in Paris, made its way to the Univerisity of California at
Berkeley, and contributed, ultimately, to the rise of punk culture
in Britain in the '70s.
   ``For the International Situationist, there is no separation
between art and nonart,'' said Peter Wollen, the show's curator.
``Art became a total environment, not a canvas on the wall.''
   Wollen said he spent three years tracking down the documents
which had been scattered throughout Europe. Everything had vanished.
Many items turned up in basements and garages, and a few were taken
out of museum storage rooms.
   The International Situationist argued that society was turning
into an all-embracing spectacle under the pressure of ever-expanding
Western capitalism.
   ``Most of the Situationists would have liked to dynamite a place
like the Pompidou Center, so it's really ironic that they're being
consecrated here,'' said Marc Higonnet, an antique dealer and
longtime aficionado of the International Situationist Movement.
   The show has not gone unnoticed by anti-art buffs nostalgic for
the Situationists' hey-day. They have showered the Pompidou Center
with more than a dozen tracts denouncing the exhibition as a
sell-out to the establishment.
   The show even managed to capture the revolutionary spirit as
France celebrates its bicentennial.
   An oversized coupon from the Marie-Antoinnette Bakeries reads:
``Good for One Cake.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Today's Blues Hero</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems that today's most prominent blues hero,
Robert Cray, has become a real close friend of the Grammys.
   This year, his ``Don't Be Afraid of the Dark'' single won a
Grammy as best contemporary blues recording. It's the title cut from
his fifth LP. Last year, his popular ``Strong Persuader'' album won
the best contemporary blues recording Grammy. It also has sold more
than any blues album in history.
   The year before that, ``Showdown,'' an album by Cray Albert
Collins, Cray and Johnny Copeland, won the best traditional blues
recording Grammy, proving that Cray can be a traditional blues man
when he wants to be. He and Robert Cray Band bassist Richard Cousins
recently played on a John Lee Hooker recording.
   But these are the 1980s, not the heyday of Collins and Hooker,
and Cray has found his own voice for his own time.
   ``A lot of people say it's not blues enough,'' he said. ``It does
incorporate a lot of rhythm 'n' blues.''
   His band doesn't always use the blues' traditional three-chord
progressions. ``I guess the best way to say what the difference
would be is that ours is more funky, more danceable, more current,
more in tune with what's going on,'' he said.
   He also isn't figuring just how much rhythm 'n' blues influence
to use or calculating music toward sales or black radio.
   ``We don't think about anything like that,'' he said. ``We go in
to make a good album. We're not trying to make anything else out of
it. The more uptempo dance things are rhythm 'n' blues. The sadder
songs are blues. Top 40 singles _ those aren't the intentions.
   ``We don't get too much play on black radio stations. We don't
fit their format, which is more dance and a lot of rap. The music
we're doing is too thick, too serious.
   ``We get a lot of play on album-oriented rock stations; the
singles are sometimes on contemporary hits stations. We've been
heard on jazz stations. A lot of older jazz stuff is basically blues
riffs.''
   For Cray, a blues is a sad or lonely song and somebody in it is
blue: ``When you go in to record, it's kind of embarrassing. It's
spilling your guts.''
   He wrote three of the 10 songs on ``Don't Be Afraid of the Dark''
and collaborated on two more. Producers Bruce Bromberg and Dennis
Walker do some of the songwriting. Walker wrote ``Don't Be Afraid of
the Dark.'' Band members Cousins, drummer David Olson and
keyboardist Peter Boe also write.
   Cray was recently in New York for a sold-out engagement at Radio
City Music Hall. But the veteran of 15 years on the road doesn't get
caught up in praise, though fame has allowed him to be freer on
stage.
   ``The excitement level is way up. They're familiar with a lot of
songs you're going to do. A lot of people are in your corner. You're
free to do pretty much what you want. It does make it just a step
more comfortable.''
   His current tour started last May, though his LP was released
until August. The band played in Brazil, Canada, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, Europe and the United States. The tour ends here in
June and runs in Europe until next August.
   Thinking back, Cray recalled, ``I was taken with Albert Collins
the first time I heard him, in 1969 at an outdoor festival in
southern Washington state. He got my attention playing guitar behind
his back and walking out into the audience with a long guitar cable.
I was 15 or 16. I was pretty impressed. I was playing guitar at the
time.''
   Cray, who is less of an extrovert, hasn't appropriated Collins'
tricks. ``That's not my personality. ... I guess I'm just not that
kind of guy.''
   In 1971, Collins played at Cray's high school graduation. ``The
class voted for him; he had done a lot of work in the area,'' he
said. ``I met him at the party during his break. I asked him about
his band and his music. The next time I saw him was 1976. He
remembered talking to me.''
   Cray and Cousins, both sons of career servicemen, met near
Tacoma. In January 1974, they moved to Eugene, Ore., to start a
blues band.
   ``We decided to get out of Tacoma and go down there and start
working with drummer Tom Murphy, who had gone to school in Salem,
Ore. Richard worked well with him. We were a trio for awhile. ... We
had a succession of different players,'' he said.
   ``We played rhythm 'n' blues and blues in the bars in Eugene and
Portland, did an occasional gig in Seattle, through 1974 and 1975.
In 1976 we started traveling to Vancouver and San Francisco backing
Albert Collins and doing some gigs on our own.
   ``Personnel changed in 1979. We started to work Montana, Idaho,
Utah, occasionally Arizona and more into California. It wasn't until
1983 we were able to go across the country.''
   They made their first recording in 1978 after meeting producer
Bruce Bromberg at a blues festival in San Francisco. But ``Who's
Been Talkin''' wasn't released until 1980 because the label they
were on, Tomato, had problems. Cray currently records for Mercury.
   Cray remembers that festival. ``It was a lot of fun. We were the
last act on Sunday afternoon. Albert joined us. We were the
highlight of the show. It was a big thing for us. We got our picture
in the paper.
   ``Tomato folded about six months later,'' he said. ``We continued
to work up and down the West Coast. In 1982 we ran into Bromberg
again. He and a friend of his started Hightone Records. We were the
first on it. `Bad Influence' was released in 1983. That's what
enabled us to go across country.''
   ``False Accusations'' was released in 1985 but it was ``Strong
Persuader,'' the first Cray album distributed by a major record
company, which shot him to prominence.
   Cray, who has too busy to look, has friends searching for a house
for him to buy in Southern California.
   ``I like Washington state a whole lot,'' he says. ``It's gorgeous
in the summertime. But we got spoiled. After we finished touring in
Japan in November 1987, we took a couple of months off in Los
Angeles to get material together and from January to April we made
the latest record. The sun was shining all the time.''

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Warren Moore knew the dirt roads and
outhouses of the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountains, but her
travels and talks with the people of the region fueled a passion to
have those voices heard.
   ``This is the nuts and bolts of social history. So much of what
they had to say is lost,'' said Moore, who put her photographs and
portraits of the hundreds of people she interviewed in the area in a
new book called ``Mountain Voices.''
   She took a leave of absence from her teaching job at a private
school in New York, leased an apartment in her hometown of
Greensboro and taught a few days a week so she could spend more time
in the mountains.
   ``I spent most of my time on the dirt roads where the blacktop
had ended,'' she said. ``I wanted to see what they had to say. I
found out how little I did know about these people. I became caught
up in it. I wanted their voices to be heard.
   ``The stereotype is they're lazy, barefooted hillbillies,'' said
Moore, now an educational consultant in New York. ``I had gone to
the mountains of North Carolina all my life as a summer person, and
this wasn't the view I had at all.''
   The 38-year-old author found herself going back to the southern
Appalachians every chance she got. Then she would bring back her
tape-recorded interviews and sit up all night and listen.
   ``I realized I needed to capture it before it was gone,'' she
said.
   She gained the confidence of people who do not typically give
interviews _ farmers, homemakers, raccoon hunters, mountain
musicians, craftsmen and Cherokee Indians.
   ``I found the people are very different from one area to
another,'' she said. ``There's lots of different kinds of people.
You don't get that from any stereotype.
   ``These people are very private individuals. They need to get to
know you before they open up.''
   Moore would begin her conversations by saying that her intention
was to portray the mountain residents on their own terms. ``I wanted
their views, their opinions,'' she said. ``I wanted them to talk
about themselves.''
   The book comes as oral history, as the words of the people
themselves.
   ``These people make quite good philosophers,'' Moore said. ``They
realize what is important. If something is difficult, they make a
joke about it and go on with their life.''
   People like Bea Hensley, a blacksmith from Spruce Pine: ``My
theory is that you were born to live and not make a living,'' he
says in the book. ``Making a living comes secondary. Anyone can make
a living. Not everybody can live. And your monetary value doesn't
have anything to do with it.''
   Moore believes the book should help clear up some of the
misconceptions about the people who inhabit the mountains of western
North Carolina.
   ``They are portrayed as people who didn't go to school and who
don't send their kids to school,'' she said.
   Instead, the offspring of some of those she interviewed had
graduated from college, and some had even gone on to graduate school.
   ``This isn't my book, it's theirs,'' she said. ``Every one of
them is special in their own way. These people are my best friends
and I care about them.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Movie `Big' Inspires New Mandrell Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As country music performer Louise
Mandrell left her dressing room to entertain recently, backup singer
Pedro Tomas greeted her with the show business phrase ``break a
leg.''
   ``I probably will,'' she quipped.
   The reason she fears for her lower extremities is that she has
just added some fancy footwork to her Las Vegas-style act. Inspired
by the recent movie ``Big,'' she has purchased a ``walking piano''
like the one actor Tom Hanks played in the hit film.
   The instrument is a flat, long series of adjoining keys that sit
on the ground. They are played by stepping on them.
   Mandrell, 34, whose sisters, Barbara and Irlene, also are country
music performers, is now using the unusual piano in her act.
   ``It's a novelty,'' she said in an interview before playing the
instrument on The Nashville Network on cable TV. ``It's a toy that
will be interesting to people. It's fun; we've been giggling half
the day away when we practice.''
   The electronic piano, which costs $15,000, weighs 600 pounds and
is 14 feet long. It has 40 keys (24 white and 16 black) which
require 30 pounds of pressure to make a sound. It came in two
sections, and her road crew put it together and made some technical
adjustments to amplify the sound to make it better for settings such
as showrooms.
   She will place a mirror behind her so the audience will be able
to watch the intricate foot work.
   ``It's a toy,'' she said. ``An expensive toy.''
   Three other members of her act will join her on the keys. They
hop on and off and quickly move to different spots along the keys.
The performance looks something like a Chinese fire drill where all
four have hot feet.
   She didn't have to hire a choreographer to take advantage of her
costly new prop.
   ``It's not really dancing,'' she said. ``It's playing an
instrument with your feet.''
   In the movie, Hanks is a boy who suddenly physically becomes a
man but responds at the level of a child. He and his boss, a toy
company executive, hop on the piano at the toy store and play a
``Chopsticks'' duet.
   ``I loved it,'' Mandrell said about the film. ``Movies usually
bomb when I love them, but not this one. I love kids. Tom Hanks was
believable as a child. I'm a big fan of his.''
   R.C. Bannon, her husband who is a country songwriter, suggested
they buy one and put it in her act. They called a New York City toy
store, ordered one and it arrived crated up in Nashville accompanied
by a piece of paper with a telephone number to call with questions.
   She began rehearsing on the piano in February. She knows of no
other performer who has incorporated the instrument into his or her
act.
   ``It's not like the piano where you just sit and do your piece,''
she said. ``Believe me, it's a lot of work.
   ``I play the (regular) piano, so it's not like a whole new
experience. And I dance, so the experience helped.''
   Mandrell, known to many TV viewers for her shampoo commercials,
said she won't be too worried about hitting a wrong key. ``The fans
like me because I'm not perfect,'' she said.
   The first two songs she learned on her new instrument are ``Down
Yonder'' and ``The William Tell Overture.''
   ```Down Yonder' is a standard country song,'' she said. ``The
country music fans know `The William Tell Overture' but it reaches
the non-country fans too. It's challenging.''
   She doesn't plan to carry the new piano to the dusty fairs where
nearly all country music stars perform in the summer.
   ``It's too big, too fragile. I don't think it could endure the
road. But people could set it up at home and it would last forever.''
   She and her sisters starred in the NBC-TV show ``Barbara Mandrell
and the Mandrell Sisters'' for two seasons beginning in 1980.
Louise, whose specialty is playing the fiddle, now performs in Las
Vegas about 12 weeks a year plus makes records and does other
appearances.
   Irlene, whose talent runs more toward comedy, is currently on the
syndicated TV show ``Hee Haw.'' Barbara appears periodically on TV
specials and has recently resumed her recording career.
   Louise recently has been the opening act for ageless George Burns.
   ``He watched every one of my shows and made all these cute
comments. He's really a lot of fun,'' she said.
   She said he's amusing even offstage and enjoys fostering his
image as a ladies' man. He sent her candy one day with this note
attached:
   ``We were great together last night.''

<HEAD>A Significant Archaeological Find, But What Does It Mean?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUXOR, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of five ancient statues has
transformed a tranquil courtyard of Luxor Temple into an
archaeologist's dream.
   ``We want to discover who buried the statues, why and when,''
Mohammed Saghir, the Luxor area's director of antiquities, said as
diggers' picks and shovels turn the silty earth in search of more
statues.
   Since the Jan. 22 discovery of the well-preserved statues,
experts have debated whether more lie near them beside towering
columns on the north side of the courtyard of Pharaoh Amenophis III,
who ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C.
   The courtyard, just over 57 yards long by 50{ yards wide, is
considered the glory of Luxor Temple, a fabled remain altered and
reworked by many of ancient Egypt's best-known rulers.
   On a recent Sunday, four of the statues, covered in padded vinyl
and tied so only their toes peeked out, sat in their burial pit.
Workers dug around them as small boys carted basketfuls of dirt to
mounds near an outer temple wall on which Ramses II, in a chariot,
smites the ill-fated enemies of Egypt.
   Each digger hopes to be the next el-Rayees Farouk, chief of
temple workers, who was credited with finding the edge of a buried
granite statue base that had shielded the figures from generations
of footsteps.
   Farouk, in a brown galabeya, or robe, his head swathed in the
traditional scarf of southern Egypt, shouted orders to his men as
they excavated.
   They've found no additional large statues, but Saghir said the
dig had turned up a small bronze of the god Osiris, lord of the
underworld; part of a stela or commemorative plaque; copper tools,
and other small artifacts.
   Some light has been shed on mysteries of the discovery, one of a
number of group burials by ancient Egyptians.
   ``We know this burial was not accidental,'' Saghir said. ``These
statues were placed lovingly in the earth, their sides turned toward
the west. Not only did the ancients protect the statues by putting a
base over them, but they took the care to seal the pit with a layer
of gypsum and limestone chips. They wanted to save them for
eternity.''
   The base, a granite slab with two niches carved in it, apparently
once held two of the statues found in January. The general, and
later pharaoh, Haremhab, knelt in a rounded-off rectangle with
offerings before a seated creator god, Atum, that fit in a
rectangular niche, according to measurements.
   A third statue found in January is of the goddess Hathor, patron
of beauty and womanhood, and the fourth is a minor goddess, Yunet.
   Originally, the base lay on the ground inside the temple. At some
time, for reasons unknown, the ancients decided to bury the statues.
They put them in a hole, covered it with dirt, gypsum and stone,
then put the base on top and covered it with dirt _ much like the
layers in a sandwich.
   Saghir and others think the base may have provided protection, or
may have had some magical significance. It only actually covers a
quartzite statue of Amenophis III, which Saghir said was the most
important find.
   The statue depicts Amenophis III standing on a sledge to
demonstrate his divinity. Tomb paintings and small wooden statues
exist showing him in such a pose, but the stone statue standing more
than eight feet tall is unique.
   Over 34 centuries Amenophis III has remained among ancient
Egypt's most fascinating personalities. Early in his reign he
claimed to have killed 102 fierce lions. He brags in heiroglyphs on
the new statue that he controls land from Nubia, ranging from
southern Egypt through what is now northern Sudan, to the Euphrates
River to the east to the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. In
later life, Amenophis III preferred luxury to prowess. A patron of
the arts, he demanded magnificent monuments and the finest works
craftsmen could produce.
   The five statues show the masters' touch, and conservation
experts from Cairo will have the job of ensuring their safety in the
modern world. They have been moved from the courtyard to a special
storage area at Luxor.
   Saghir said he's just beginning to have the time to think about
what's been found. ``Finding something by surprise and discovering
it in a regular excavation give different feelings,'' he said.
   ``The first night after these statues were found I couldn't
sleep. I went to Luxor Temple at 11 p.m. and walked in the
moonlight. I went home. At 2 a.m. I went again to the Temple. I was
trying to decide what to do next. I was so afraid something would
happen to them. I knew at first sight we had a cache.''
   The statues may have been put in hiding for safekeeping during
the Assyrian invasion, he said. That west Asian empire conquered
Egypt in 671 B.C., and for years its soldiers ransacked and
plundered monuments throughout the country.
   However, Egypt suffered ups and downs as early as 100 years after
Amenophis built Luxor Temple, when the pharaohs began to decline
after the 66-year reign of Ramses II, and that may account for the
statues' burial.
   In Cairo, Rainer Stadelmann, director of the German
Archaeological Institute and one of the profession's most respected
scholars, said he believes the order in which the statues were
buried gives history a hint.
   ``The best choice'' for the time of burial would have been during
the reign of Ramses II, who expanded and redesigned Luxor Temple, he
said. ``Perhaps they bothered Ramses in some way or interfered with
his processions.''
   He reasons that the statues were grouped as they are for a reason.
   ``To me they represent the west, the setting sun,'' Stadelmann
said. ``If this is true, then we can expect in the opposite
courtyard to find another grouping, this time representing the east,
the rising sun.''
   He characterized his ideas as fantasies because the discovery is
so new, but said he expects that the statues lined the sides of the
festival courtyard in ancient times to produce a processional
journey for the sun god.
   ``We have these processions painted on walls, but in this case it
could have been done with statues. To the ancients it wouldn't have
mattered if the pharaoh were dead or if the statues later were
buried...
   ``The journey would continue.''

   Bridges, buildings, trains and planes that
monitor their own structural well-being sound like science fiction,
but they're results of new technology that lets scientists test
things without destroying them.
   ``Our work is like re-inventing the wheel and making it work
better,'' said physicist Joseph S. Heyman, who runs the
Non-Destructive Evaluation Laboratory he started in 1971 at NASA's
Langley Research Center.
   The lab uses an array of measurement techniques _ thermal
diffusion, ultrasonics, acoustics, magnetism, X-rays, lasers and
holography _ to probe for internal defects in objects like space
shuttle solid rocket motors, satellites, airplane wings, train
wheels and railroad tracks _ and even ordinary bolts.
   Then there are ``smart'' materials that take care of themselves.
   ``We're investigating how to incoporate sensors directly into
materials,'' Heyman said. ``It's easy with fiber-like materials like
composites _ a fiber optic line is buried in the structure. An
aircraft wing can be made the same way, and the same applies to
larger structure like the space station.''
   The technology is especially critical for the space station
expected to be built in thes, lasers and
holography _ to probe for internal defects in objects like space
shuttle solid rocket motors, satellites, airplane wings, train
wheels and railroad tracks _ and even ordinary bolts.
   Then there are ``smart'' materials that take care of themselves.
   ``We're investigating how to incoporate sensors directly into

aircraft wing can be made the same way, and the same applies to
larger structure like the space station.''
   The technology is especially critical for the space station
expected to be built in the 1990s because it will be a permanently
orbiting platform bombarded by cosmic dust and stressed by
temperature differences. Less glamorous would be its use in bridges,
buildings, oil platforms and pipelines, ``anything where you need to
measure strain, stress and temperature,'' said Heyman.
   Smart materials will sense that something may be malfunctioning
before a major problem develops, he said. ``This nervous system
we're building will be able to sense when we need help. I'm talking
about the whole structure as a sensor. It can measure with
phenomenal sensitivity.''

<HEAD>Texas A&amp;M Scientists In Search Of The Perfect Grass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a plant, grass is taken more or
less for granted. It grows. It gets mowed, watered and fertilized.
It grows more.
   ``There's not just that much attention to it,'' said Milton
Engelke, a turf researcher for Texas A&amp;M University. ``But
everybody's got grass to cut.''
   Engelke, who estimates he's one of just a dozen turf breeders in
the United States, would like to see the care given to grass become
even easier. He and a staff of 11 have 20 acres of grass in College
Station, Dallas and El Paso.
   One objective of their research is to give the homeowner ``a much
higher quality plant with less input, less care, less maintenance,''
he said. ``And in the program we're introducing grasses that won't
have to be mowed as frequently or grasses that produce little or no
clippings.''
   Homeowners, though, aren't the only people who stand to benefit
from Engelke's research. Most people believe turf is just there to
look pretty, but its main purpose is to stabilize and conserve the
landscape.
   Engelke hopes to introduce two new grasses this year to the
grass-growing industry _ a $25 billion business nationwide. One is a
buffalo grass capable of growing from South Texas to the northern
United States; the other is a zoysia grass adaptable along the
southern tier of states from California to Georgia.
   The buffalo grass will be introduced to growers this year and
available to the public in about three years. It would grow to only
about four inches, need little or no fertilizer and pesticides, and
crowd out less desirable grasses.
   Engelke wants it to be called ``Prairie Buffalo Grass'' because
it reminds him of the rippling, wind-blown grass crossed by prairie
schooners.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Chiefs Expect Harmony And Few Changes In $18 Billion
Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took two years of negotiations before Time
Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. could agree to create the
world's biggest media and entertainment concern through an $18
billion merger. But the executives who will head the new company say
their protracted talks have paved the way to a harmonious future.
   ``I don't know of an item we didn't explore,'' Warner Chairman
Steven J. Ross said Sunday. ``That is one of the things that makes
me feel very secure in the future.''
   Time and Warner announced Saturday they would join forces in a
merger of equals that would value the combined company, Time Warner
Inc., at $18 billion and would rank it as the biggest media
conglomerate in the world, followed by Bertlesmann AG of West
Germany. Time Warner would have projected annual revenues of $10
billion, while Bertlesmann recorded 1987 revenue of $6 billion.
   The agreement between Time and Warner followed two years of
on-again, off-again talks between the two New York-based companies.
The most-recent hiatus occurred as Warner pursued a $1.2 billion
buyout of Lorimar Telepictures Corp., but the negotiations picked up
steam after Warner completed that acquisition in January.
   Saturday's announcement also followed years of takeover
speculation about Time that sparked periodic surges in the company's
stock price. The company shored up its defenses from time to time,
most recently by extending its stock buyback plan and amending its
shareholder rights plan in January.
   Time Inc. Chairman J. Richard Munro _ who will serve as
co-chairman and co-chief executive officer of the new company along
with Ross _ said Sunday of the merger, ``This is an offensive move,
not a defensive move.''
   However, it is impossible to ignore the fact that the combination
of Time and Warner literally gives the two companies solidarity in
the face of a trend toward consolidation in the media industry.
Publishers including Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell have gone on
shopping sprees in recent years, building media conglomerates that
would have found either Time or Warner to be an attractive takeover
candidate.
   The deal calls for Warner shareholders to receive 0.465 share of
Time for each share of Warner they own. Since there are potentially
177.2 million Warner common shares, and Time closed Friday at
$109.12{ a share, that puts a value on Warner of about $9 billion if
the deal had closed Friday.
   In addition, there are 56.6 million shares of Time outstanding,
giving it a market value of a little more than $6 billion based on
Friday's close. Warner stock closed at $45.87{ on Friday.
   Debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the $18
billion market value of the proposed new company.
   The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies
and by the federal government.
   Because the deal is a merger of equals rather than an
acquisition, it cannot be directly compared to such megadeals as the
record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. last month.
   Munro said in an interview there was no one factor that enabled
the two sides to finally reach agreement.
   ``I'm not sure anything happened,'' he said. ``I think there is a
certain time when things really begin to come together.''
   The price of the merger was not a problem, according to Ross.
``Ninety percent of the discussions had to do with people, logistics
and future plans,'' he said.
   Both executives said the congeniality of their contacts over the
past two years cemented a relationship that will make it easy for
them to work together as co-CEOs.
   It won't be the first Ross has served as a co-CEO. He and William
Frankel shared the top job at Warner from 1967 until Frankel's death
in 1971.
   Munro and Ross will serve together until Munro, 58, retires and
becomes chairman of the executive committee of the combined company.
   Munro will be succeeded as co-CEO by N.J. Nicholas Jr., currently
the president of Time Inc. and who will hold that same post at Time
Warner.
   Upon the eventual retirement of Ross, who is 61, Nicholas is
expected to be sole head of Time Warner.
   Few immediate changes are expected in the structure of the new
company. Ross and Munro said there were no plans to sell any parts
of either Warner or Time, and they did not expect any layoffs as a
result of the combination.
   Ross was reluctant to discuss what Time Warner's plans were, but
did say he expected the biggest impact of the merger to be on the
company's overseas operations.
   Time is the nation's leading magazine company, with such titles
as Time, People and Sports Illustrated, along with Time-Life Books
and the Book-of-the-Month Club.
   Warner has major movie and television production interests,
including Warner Brothers and Warner Brothers Television and Warner
Cable Communications.
   Munro predicted the Warner cable television operations would be
merged with Time's, creating the second-largest cable operation in
the country, behind Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver. Time's cable
holdings include Home Box Office and Cinemax.
   Munro also expected Warner's book division to become part of
Time's larger publishing empire.
   The merger announcement came nearly two months after Warner
completed its long-delayed acquisition of Lorimar. Warner and
Lorimar agreed on a merger last May, but the deal wasn't finalized
until January because of stumbling blocks raised by Chris-Craft
Industries Inc., Warner's largest stockholder.
   Ross and Chris-Craft Chairman Herbert Siegel have been at
loggerheads for years, quarreling not only about Lorimar, but about
Ross' salary and the makeup of the Warner board.
   How much of a thorn Siegel will be in the side of Time Warner
remains to be seen. Ross said it was not yet known if Siegel, who
sits on the Warner board, will also be a director of Time Warner.
   Siegel's stake in the new company will decline to between 6
percent and 7 percent from his current 11 percent Warner share,
Warner officials said.
   Chris-Craft bought its stake of Warner in 1984 to help Warner
fight a takeover attempt by Murdoch's News Corp.

   The dollar edged lower against the Japanese yen and
share prices also fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.
   The dollar started the week at 127.55 yen, down 0.57 yen from
Friday's 128.12-yen close. It closed at 127.63 yen after ranging
between 127.50 yen and 127.68 yen. It had edged up 2.12 yen over
four trading days last week.
   ``The market wanted to test the dollar's lower depths, but
commercial buying orders were too strong,'' said Kaneo Ogino, a
dealer with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.
   ``The dollar is still mildly bearish and will move in a tight
range for the time being,'' he added.
   Dealers said market activity wavered without strong direction and
people were taking a ``wait-and-see'' attitude because of concern
over possible Japanese interest rates hikes.
   ``This week, people are waiting for a conference Wednesday by
Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and the release of U.S.
unemployment figures due out Friday,'' said one dealer with a major
Japanese securities firm.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 73.63-point loser last week, shed another 123.24
points, or 0.38 percent, today to close at 31,876.86.
   Investors moved to the sidelines ahead of the settlement of March
futures contracts scheduled for Tuesday, dealers said.
   ``They are also watching the monetary stance of the Bank of Japan
and whether West Germany will raise its discount rate or not,''
Ogino added.

<HEAD>Some Questions And Answers About The Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some key questions in the 17-month labor dispute between
Eastern Airlines and its Machinists union.
   Q: Who is on strike?
   A: The 8,500 Eastern workers who belong to the International
Association of Machinists. They are about equally divided between
aircraft mechanics and ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle
baggage and drive motorized equipment on airport runways.
   Q: How much do Machinists make?
   A: Mechanics at Eastern earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour. That
compares with $16 at non-union Continental Airlines, $18.78 at
American Airlines, $20.05 at United and Northwest Airlines, and
$20.10 at Delta Air Lines and USAir.
   Ramp service workers earn a top hourly wage of $15.60. Comparable
workers earn $15.51 an hour at American, $15.93 at USAir, $16.53 at
Northwest, $16.57 at United and $17.47 at Delta. Continental
contracts for the work.
   Q: What does each side want?
   A: Eastern is seeking $150 million in wage and benefit
concessions to help stem mounting losses at the airline. The
Machinists want $50 million in raises but last week offered to delay
increases for 15 months.
   Q: How has the dispute evolved?
   A: The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal
talks began in October 1987. Pilots and flight attendants a year
earlier reached concessionary agreements with the airline that
slashed pay 20 percent.
   The National Mediation Board intervened in the dispute in January
1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massive
layoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last month
after Eastern rejected binding arbitrtion and the mediation board
declared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike.
   More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized a
strike. President Bush refused to intervene to delay the strike.
Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13
percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. It
was rejected Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Q: Could the Eastern strike affect other modes of transportation?
   A: Yes. The National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycotts
in air and rail travel. If rail union workers honor pickets, traffic
on the nation's 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak could be severely
disrupted. Also, other airlines could be picketed and the 14
million-member AFL-CIO has asked its members to honor the Machinists
strike.
   However, the union decided Sunday to appeal a judge's order
barring such secondary boycotts in the New York metropolitan area
and said it would not picket any railroads Monday.
   Q: What is Eastern's financial condition?
   A: Eastern says it has lost more than $1 billion this decade and
is losing more than $1 million a day. It also has $2.5 billion in
debt. The airline was bought by Texas Air in February 1986 and since
then has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restore
profitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunk
to about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cut
profitable routes, closed its Kansas City, Mo., hub and taken
smaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on some
flights.
   Eastern has about $400 million in cash to help it meet its
financial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pending
sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump will
bring in about $365 million.
   Q: Why is Eastern ailing?
   A: Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands and
says it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to make
sacrifices. Labor maintains Eastern is suffering because it didn't
react aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in
1978. In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for future
profits that never materialized and stock. Tey don't want further
concessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-term
commitment to its financial fitness. The unions also claim Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo wants to strip the airline of assets or
dissolve it.
   Q: What are the strike's possible effects?
   A: The strike threatens to force the 60-year-old airline into
bankruptcy. To forestall its demise, Eastern could lay off striking
workers and sell other assets, such as planes, airport gates or
international routes, to raise cash. Texas Air could sell the
airline, and Trans World Airways owner Carl Icahn has been among
potential buyers who recently have expressed interest. A separate
settlement with pilots, who are honoring the strike, could allow the
airline to keep more planes airborne. And Bush could change his mind
and appoint an emergency panel that would force the Machinists to
return to work for 60 days.

   Number of flights: 1,040 daily.
   Passengers: 100,000 average daily.
   Main strike issues: Eastern, which claims it lost $1 billion in
the last decade and is losing more than $1 million a day, sought
$150 million in wage concessions. The Machinists wanted $50 million
in raises. Each side said last-minute offers brought the sides
somewhat closer.
   Where negotiations stand: Talks under National Mediation Board
supervision in Washington were suspended at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
President Bush refused to appoint an emergency panel that would have
delayed the strike 60 days. No new talks were scheduled.

<HEAD>Former Utility Chairman Arrested in Recruit Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today arrested the former chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. on suspicion of bribery in a
stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken Japan's political and
business elite.
   The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office said Hisashi Shinto, 78,
was arrested with his 63-year-old secretary, Kozo Murata, on
suspicion of receiving bribes in the form of bargain-price shares in
a subsidiary of the Recruit Co., a conglomerate with business links
to the giant telecommunications utility.
   Authorities also said they searched Shinto's home.
   Shinto was known as an advocate of clean government and business
until December, when he was forced to resign from the chairmanship
of NTT as a result of the scandal.
   Today's arrests follow the announcement Saturday that prosecutors
in the case had indicted four people on bribery charges, including
the founder of the Recruit Co., another Recruit executive and two
former NTT officials.
   The Recruit figures were indicted on charges of offering bribes,
and the former NTT officials were accused of accepting bribes.
   Prosecutors suspect that in exchange for bribes, NTT gave Recruit
special favors in the resale of U.S.-made Cray supercomputers and
reduced rates on leased communications circuits, news reports say.
   The Recruit scandal has shaken confidence in the government of
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Three members of his Cabinet have
resigned under fire for links to the Recruit company.
   A total of 10 people have now been arrested in the case on
charges of bribery or violating securities and exchange laws. Five
have been indicted, including one who allegedly tried to bribe an
opposition legislator into easing off in an investigation into the
affair.
   Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted shares
of the real estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos Co. at bargain prices
to politicians, their aides and other prominent figures through
September 1986.
   An estimated 160 people purchased the prelisted shares and were
then able to reap large, tax-free profits shortly after they were
offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986.
   Shinto's secretary reportedly made about $157,000 and Shinto
earned about $71,000. When the transaction was revealed in detail in
December, Shinto said he had not known of it and that his secretary
had controlled the account.
   Shinto had headed NTT since 1981 and oversaw its conversion to a
private company during the administration of former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was among politicians whose aides or
relatives profited from transactions in the stocks.
   Takeshita, who is also among those figures, has repeatedly denied
direct involvement in the scandal.
   On Sunday, he took responsibility for the scandal but pledged to
restore confidence by pursuing political reform, a published report
said.
   ``The Recruit case ... surfaced during my term as prime minister
so there is no way for me to escape responsibility,'' Takeshita was
quoted as saying in today's editions of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
   The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demands
for the resignation of his entire Cabinet.
   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadily
over the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government
plans to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in
commercial transactions, according to media polls.

<HEAD>Eastern Strike's Effects In Airline's Major Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a city-by-city wrapup of the effects Sunday of the
3-day-old Eastern Airlines strike at key airports and transit
systems. Almost all Eastern flights were canceled Sunday; effects on
other airlines and mass transit were negligible.
   MIAMI: Pickets were held at Miami International Airport and
nearby Eastern corporate headquarters. No violence was reported.
Twenty flights left the airport on Sunday; normal daily schedule
calls for 100 departures. No reported problems at other airlines.
   FORT LAUDERDALE: All 24 flights canceled Sunday.
   ORLANDO, Fla.: Some 140 pickets were working in shifts, with 20
at a time at about a half-dozen locations. One flight departed
Sunday; on a normal day 31 flights are scheduled. No reports of
violence or problems at other airlines.
   TAMPA, Fla.: Machinists picketed minimally at six locations. No
Eastern flights out of 28 normal Sunday flights left.
   ATLANTA: Eastern's schedule at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport, the airline's largest hub, was extremely limited Sunday.
   At a rally of about 1,500 people across from Eastern's
maintenance headquarters, Jesse Jackson urged President Bush to use
his power to persuade labor and management to ``sit around a common
table.''
   BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON: Just four pickets at a time walked at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. No other carrier
employees joined in sympathy. Eastern said it had no flights out
Sunday. Ten are scheduled daily.
   Amtrak added 12 Metroliner trains today, and Greyhound Lines Inc.
planned special bus service in the Northeast and had 200 buses
deployed for extra duty.
   NEWARK, N.J.: A total of 60 pickets marched at Newark
International Airport. All 18 Eastern flights out of Newark were
canceled A ticket agent said passengers were being put on other
airlines with ``no problem'' and that no one had been stranded.
   NEW YORK: A federal judge signed a temporary restraining order
blocking sympathy strikes by railroad workers ready to join the
striking Machinists. The order covered the Long Island Rail Road,
Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit, which carry
about 320,000 commuters daily. Unions said they planned to honor the
order and Machinists nationwide agreed not to set up pickets.
   Forty Eastern workers, including several pilots, picketed outside
the Eastern terminal at LaGuardia Airport. Eighteen flights took off
Sunday. The Eastern terminal at Kennedy International Airport had
shut down operations, and about a dozen pickets walked in the rain.
   BOSTON: At least three Eastern flights departed Logan
International Airport, which normally handles about 100 Eastern
flights a day servicing 7,200 passengers. Some travelers were
successfully placed on other airlines. About 50 striking machinists
spread out at six picket locations.
   CHICAGO: All 15 Eastern flights from O'Hare International Airport
Sunday were canceled; airport police said strikers were peaceful and
hadn't set up picket lines at other airlines. An airport official
said other airlines were honoring Eastern tickets.
   HOUSTON: Eight people picketed at Hobby Airport, where Eastern's
four daily flights were canceled Sunday. No pickets appeared against
Eastern's sister carrier _ Houston-based Continental Airlines _
which operates a large hub at Houston's Intercontinental Airport.
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico: About 125 pickets at Munoz Marin
International Airport; Eastern said four flights took off Sunday,
equal to Saturday. The airline chartered four planes from
Continental on Sunday for cruise ship passengers.

<HEAD>Hazardous Waste Entrepreneurs Say Business is Booming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget plastics. The glow is off computers.
Hazardous waste disposal is the high-tech growth industry of the
1990s.
   So say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs, executives
and consultants who attended a two-day conference on how to profit
from America's toxic waste problem.
   ``Two or three years ago if you'd said you're having a hazardous
waste business conference, you'd get very few people showing up,''
said Stephen L. Irish, whose company extracts heavy metals from
contaminated wastewater.
   But it was standing room only at a session last week in the
Copley Plaza Hotel's ornate ballroom.
   The subject: ``Identifying Market Opportunities in the Hazardous
Waste Industry,'' or, as one person attending put it, ``Given that
companies don't publicize their hazardous waste problems, how do we
identify potential customers?''
   Other sessions covered how to comply with environmental
regulations, how to minimize legal liability, ``Surviving
Hypergrowth'' and ``Preventing Your Employees from Becoming Your
Archrivals,'' or how to protect toxic trade secrets.
   The beverage served everywhere was mineral water.
   Hazardous waste processing will be a $5 billion industry this
year and could hit $12 billion by 1994, said conference organizer
Richard S. Golob, publisher of the weekly newsletter ``Harzardous
Materials Intelligence Report.''
   There's no shortage of stuff to clean up. The Environmental
Protection Agency has identified 30,000 potentially hazardous sites,
of which 1,000 qualify for Superfund clean-up money. According to
Golob, other surveys have estimated that up to 430,000 U.S.
manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination.
   And the Department of Energy has estimated that of managing,
disposing and cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at
its facilities could cost from $53 billion to $92 billion, DOE
spokesman Will Callicott said.
   The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, consumer products and even
decaffeinated coffee produces hazardous waste.
   As environmental regulations get stiffer, companies that can deal
with infectious waste, radioactive contamination and dirty drinking
water are in special demand.
   Irish's enterprise was born in 1988 from tougher state and
federal groundwater regulations. Electroplating plants produce
rinsewater that includes heavy metals, including nickel, lead and a
carcinogenic chromium compound, said Irish, director of marketing
for UNC Reclamation, a Mulberry, Fla., subsidiary of UNC Inc.
   UNC Reclamation installs equipment that extracts metals from
rinsewater, Irish said. The residue is turned into metal salts that
can be sold back to the electroplaters, he said.
   The service costs electroplaters less than disposing their
metallic sludge in landfills. And it eliminates their long-term
legal liability, Irish said. The process also ensures that no
contaminants will leak from a landfill into groundwater.
   ``Clearly it's the intent of Congress to keep anything from going
into the ground,'' Irish said. ``Reclamation is what they want.''
   UNC Reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are
expected to hit $12 million this year, he said. The company plans to
expand into cleaning up toxic sludge from batteries that have been
dumped into some Gainesville, Fla., lagoons.
   The environmental boom already has produced some hazardous waste
millionaires, Golob said. One high-tech entrepreneur is Alan S.
McKim, who founded Clean Harbors, Inc. of Boston in 1980 at age 25.
The company said it now has nearly 1,000 employees and had sales of
$73 million last year.
   But the industry has to cope with more than its share of
regulation and red tape, said Thomas Moran, vice president of
DartAmerica of Freehold, N.J.
   DartAmerica transports toxic, low-level nuclear and solid waste
to approved disposal sites. It is regulated by the EPA, the federal
Department of Transportation, and has an array of permits that allow
it to truck waste in 48 states. It takes three full-time employees
just to handle shipping permits, Moran said.
   ``In New York, PCBs are regulated and (waste) oil isn't. In New
Jersey, oil is regulated but PCBs aren't,'' Moran said. ``You're
like a slave to 48 masters.''

<TEXT>
   Newsweek magazine scooped its chief rival, Time,
on one of the biggest business deals of the year: the $18 billion
proposed merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
   Newsweek included a two-page story on the proposed deal in its
March 13 issue, but this week's Time is silent on the merger that
was announced hours before the magazines went to press Saturday
night.
   ``We never intended to cover the merger in the news pages,'' Time
spokesman Louis J. Slovinsky said.
   He said Time Inc. wanted to include the merger announcement in
the same issues of its other weekly magazines, People and Sports
Illustrated.
   Because People goes to press Thursday, Time opted to wait a week,
he said.
   ``I think that's wonderful,'' said Richard M. Smith, Newsweek's
editor-in-chief. ``Needless to say, I was curious to see how Time
was going to cover this.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of leaded gasoline jumped more than
a penny per gallon during the past two weeks, an analyst said.
   The increase may signal a long-expected decision by dealers to
pass on losses sustained by higher wholesale costs, Trilby Lundberg
said Sunday.
   ``It's taken years, but the differential is finally shrinking,''
she said.
   A March 3 nationwide survey of gasoline stations found the
average cost of gasoline for all grades with taxes was 99.22 cents
per gallon, up about a half-cent from Feb. 17, Ms. Lundberg said.
   For the same period, leaded gasoline at self-service stations
rose 1.11 cents per gallon, Ms. Lundberg said.
   The cost of making leaded gas has risen as environmental laws cut
the amount of lead allowed, forcing producers to use costlier
substitutes, and as older leaded gas-using cars were taken off the
road, she said.
   Self-service prices on March 3 were 88.87 cents per gallon for
regular unleaded, $1.0806 for premium unleaded and 86.25 for regular
leaded.
   Full-service prices were $1.1857 for regular unleaded, $1.3008
for premium unleaded and $1.1479 for regular leaded.

<TEXT>
   The Pan Am shuttle doubled its normal rush hour
schedule from Washington, New York and Boston today in the wake of a
strike at its competitor, Eastern Airlines.
   The shuttle, which normally flies once an hour from each city,
was scheduled to fly every half hour today, except for the slow
hours between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon.
   Pan Am also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planes for
150-seat Boeing 727s on some flights between New York and Boston,
Hanlon said. Noise restrictions prohibited use of Airbuses on
flights to Washington.
   The airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000
passengers on the shuttle Saturday and Sunday, also with a doubled
schedule. It expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekday
norm, Hanlon said.
   One shuttle passenger, Manhattan lawyer Gloria Hoyal, said she
went to LaGuardia Airport an hour and a half early today in
anticipation of delays that did not occur.
   ``And to add insult to injury, I was in Connecticut for the
weekend and I came back early to avoid the train strike,'' she said.
That problem also did not materialize: A federal judge blocked a
sympathy strike at the railroads.
   Today's first Pan Am shuttle flights arriving in New York, the
6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m. airplanes from Boston and Washington, were
delayed in New York for reasons unrelated to the strike: It was
snowing.

<HEAD>Soviets: Need More Scientific Evidence Before Banning CFC's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said today it requires more
scientific evidence that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons are
destroying the ozone layer before agreeing to a ban.
   ``Any decision ... should be well-grounded and should have a firm
scientific basis,'' said Vladimir Zhakarov, Soviet delegate to a
120-nation conference on the ozone layer.
   ``If any fears which some scientists have now ... are proved, the
Soviet Union will back any initiative, or will initiate itself the
reduction of CFCs,'' he told reporters.
   Western scientists agree that the compounds, used in
refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosols and fast-food packaging,
are destroying the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the
sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   They say the compounds are responsible for creating an ozone hole
roughly the size of the continental United States over the Antarctic
every winter.
   An international team of scientists this winter also found
evidence of ozone depletion over the Arctic, but said it couldn't
yet prove a link in the region with the compounds.
   Zhakarov, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozone protection,
said Soviet scientists have found evidence of a 25 percent ozone
depletion over parts of Europe and the western Soviet Union, but he
said it was due primarily to naturally occurring cyclones.
   ``This process is cyclical and this cycle is 10-15 days, and it
was observed in February and in January of this year,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union is one of 31 signatories to the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which calls for halving production of the compounds by the
end of the century. Six more agreed Sunday to abide by its terms _
Austria, Hungary, Malaysia, athe Philippines, Trinidad and Zambia.
   The United States and the European Economic Community have said
they want to ban the chemicals by that time.
   Zhakarov said ``if there is proved scientific date that we should
phase out those substances, we will support this idea ... not all
the countries support the appeal of the EEC. We must be very
cautious here. If we take a decision which is not well grounded, we
can interfere and destroy the economies of the developing
countries.''
   Liz Cook, ozone campaign chairman of the environmental group
Friends of the Earth-USA, said the Soviets ``have presented a fairly
confusing position ... I think what they'd like to do is just buy
themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy ...
The science is clearly there.''
   China's delegate called for the establishment of an international
fund to protect the ozone layer, to be supported mainly by the
industrialized countries.
   Liu Ming Pu, China's environmental commissioner, said the
industrialized countries had done most of the damage. He said the
developed world produced 80 percent of all the compounds, while
China produced less than 2 percent.
   He also proposed that substitutes for the compounds be provided
at no cost to developing countries.
   No substitutes the compounds are available for sale, but industry
officials say they hope to have some on the market by the mid-1990s.
   The compounds can last 100 years, but when they reach the
stratosphere, about 15-25 miles above the earth's surface, they
break apart and their chlorine atoms destroy ozone.
   The compounds also trap heat and warm the Earth's surface, a
process known as the greenhouse effect, which could cause major
climate changes.

<HEAD>Atari Games Granted Injunction Against Nintendo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Games was granted a preliminary
injunction barring Nintendo of America Inc. and its Japanese parent
company from suing retailers who carry Atari Games products for
alleged infringement of Nintendo's patent.
   The injunction granted in U.S. District Court Sunday prohibits
the video game giant from filing suit against retailers who sell
products by Atari Games' wholly owned subsidiary, Tengen, until the
dispute between the companies is formally resolved.
   The injunction also places similar restrictions on Atari Games
concerning its claims of patent infringement against Nintendo. The
Milpitas, Calif.-based Atari Games is a privately-held company and
not related to Atari Corp.
   Atari Games said it and Tengen asked for the injunction after
learning that several Tengen retailers, including some large
national toy chains, received letters from Nintendo's lawyers
insisting that they take all Tengen products off their shelves.
   The letters told the retailers that failure to do so would result
in Nintendo's taking legal action against the retailers for
third-party patent infringement, Atari Games said.
   The motion for the injunction was filed in connection with an
antitrust lawsuit Atari Games and Tengen filed against Nintendo. The
suit alleges monopoly, wrongful business interference and patent
infringement.
   In January, Nintendo sued Atari Games, accusing the company of
making and selling unauthorized video-game cartridges.
   Nintendo of America, based in Redmond, Wash., is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan, a major
manufacturer and marketer of video games.

Inc., at $18 billion and would rank it as the biggest media
conglomerate in the world, after Bertlesmann AG of West Germany.
Time Warner would have projected annual revenues of $10 billion,

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.35 to 2,279.64 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 640 up, 299
down and 465 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.65 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement
between Time Inc. and Warner Communications.
   Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that
other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might
be candidates for mergers or takeovers.
   Warner stock was delayed in opening, while Time's shares dropped
1]. Analysts said Time's decline in part reflected disappointment
among traders who had been reckoning that the company might have
itself become a takeover candidate at a higher price.
   Elsewhere in the group, Columbia Pictures Entertainment gained }
to 18[ and American TV-Communications, traded in the
over-the-counter market, jumped 3\ to 42\.
   Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly
report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of
economic growth.
   That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation
outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest
rates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.46 to 164.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .70 at 326.92.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.58 to 2,274.29,
stretching its gain for the week to 28.75 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 850 up, 578 down and 501 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 151.79 million shares, against 161.98
million in the previous session.

   Buyers snapped up the 1988 burley crop
across the eight-state belt, with gross sales up almost 50 million
pounds over the previous year.
   Kentucky burley farmers led the way in both production and price
again this year, selling a total of 380.3 million pounds for an
average price of $1.6145 per pound.
   The lowest statewide average was registered in West Virginia,
where the Huntington market sold 2.8 million pounds for an average
of $1.5368 a pound.
   Gross sales for the 1988 crop throughout the area known as the
Burley Belt totaled 530.7 million pounds, compared with 484 million
pounds the year before.
   In addition, the average price per pound increased 4.7 cents a
pound, from $1.5634 in 1987-88 to $1.6104.
   ``It looks to me like the tobacco program, the tobacco situation,
is as good as it has been for a long time,'' said Danny McKinney,
executive secretary of the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative
Association.
   The 1988 crop was rescued from last summer's drought by rains
beginning in mid-July, and was far superior to the previous year's
crop. In 1987, a dry autumn curing season left much of the burley
brittle and undesirable.
   The burley selling season concluded last week. Burley is a
thin-leaved, light-colored tobacco, usually containing less nicotine
than the dark-colored varieties.

<HEAD>Fistfight Mars U-Haul Stockholders' Meeting in Nevada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fistfight erupted at a U-Haul stockholders'
meeting, punctuating a bitter family struggle over control of the
rental empire.
   Witnesses said the fight Saturday involved four sons of U-Haul
founder Leonard Shoen, 73.
   Shoen, who has sought to regain control of the company since he
was forced into retirement in 1986, appeared visibly shaken by the
brawl. ``I created a monster,'' he said.
   Two of the sons involved in the fight, Mike and Sam, support
their father's position in the ownership struggle, while the other
two, current board Chairman Joe and Mark, oppose it.
   Two other sons, Paul and James, also sit on the six-member board
of directors, which was re-elected Saturday. They were not involved
in the fisticuffs.
   Hotel security guards quickly responded to the fight and broke it
up.
   Sam Shoen, who was forced to hold an ice pack to his cheek
afterward, said the fight occurred after the stockholders' meeting
adjourned.
   ``They ran it (meeting) in the most hough they knew they had the votes
they needed to win,'' Sam
said. ``They were not willing to allow discussion on anything.''
   Joe and his supporters declined comment Saturday, but issued a
news release pledging a back-to-basics approach in the company's
five-year management plan.
   The plan calls for an all-new truck fleet, discontinuation of
unprofitable operations, liquidation of unused assets and an
employee profit-sharing plan.
   The elder Shoen contended the company has been devalued under
Joe's leadership and no longer adheres to its founding principle of
customer satisfaction.
   He also accused Joe of lending money from a trust fund to several
company employees to purchase shares of stock in an effort to retain
control of the company.
   The elder Shoen set the stage for the brawl years ago when he
divided 95 percent of the company's stock among 12 children from
three marriages.
   After Saturday's meeting, he said the only way to defuse the
situation is to sell the company. ``This will have to be solved and
that's the only way to solve it,'' he said.
   U-Haul is now part of a Nevada-based corporation, Amerco,
headquartered in Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Require Retirement of Airline Flight Engineers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from
Delta Air Lines' takeover of Western Air Lines, today refused to let
Delta force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over age
60.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Delta is
bound by an age-bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against
Western.
   A federal judge in California ordered Western in 1981 to abandon
its mandatory retirement age of 60 for flight engineers. The judge
also permitted pilots to bid for flight engineer jobs when they
approached 60, the retirement age for pilots.
   That ruling stemmed from a suit by 15 flight engineers who
accused Western of violating the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act aimed at protecting older workers.
   Their victory was upheld in 1985 by the Supreme Court in a ruling
that set guidelines for enforcing the federal law.
   When Delta merged with Western in 1987, it sought to force the
retirement of the 15 unless they agreed to take on-ground jobs.
   Delta said its offer was in line with its policy barring captains
and co-pilots over 60 from becoming flight engineers.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last October that
Delta is bound by the 1981 court order enforcing the flight
engineers' victory against Western.
   ``Delta may be free to execute its own policies to other
employees, but it is not free to abrogate (Western's) obligations
to'' the former Western employees, the appeals court said. ``There
is a continuity of operations between the merged airlines, Delta had
notice of Western's obligations and Delta has the ability to provide
relief.''
   Some of the 15 have retired voluntarily.
   The case is Delta vs. Criswell, 88-1138.

<HEAD>NY Stock Market Magazine Loses Free-Speech Argument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down the
free-speech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating
an anti-touting provision of federal securities law.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force
The Stock Market Magazine to tell readers whether companies featured
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for
other services.
   The magazine, aimed primarily at small investors, is published 10
times a year in Yonkers, N.Y., by Angelo Martinelli, that city's
former mayor. Each issue contains general financial news and seven
or eight articles on specific companies as investment prospects.
   According to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here, the articles
``describe the featured companies in unabashedly glowing terms'' and
never contain a negative report or even mild skepticism.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the magazine in 1982,
alleging that it violated securities law by failing to disclose
``consideration'' received from those companies described in its
feature articles.
   The suit said such considerations included the purchase of
advertising space in the magazine and the purchase from the
publisher of article reprints. The commission sought a court order
forcing the magazine to tell readers about considerations received
in connection with all future articles.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. of Washington threw out
the civil suit in 1986. He said any order forcing such disclosure
would be a ``prior restraint'' on publication, violating the
magazine's free-press rights.
   The judge said, however, the SEC was free to criminally prosecute
the magazine for alleged willful violations of the anti-touting
provisions.
   The commission appealed, and the appeals court last June 21
reinstated the civil suit.
   ``The prior restraint doctrine is not precisely applicable to the
requested relief in this case,'' the appeals court ruled. ``Orders
that are carefully focused, address a continuing course of speech
and are imposed after an opportunity for full merits consideration
are not properly analyzed as prior restraints.''
   The appeals court sent the case back to the trial court for a
determination whether the anti-touting provision was violated.
   The magazine then sought Supreme Court review. It said the
appeals court ruling wrongly would allow the SEC to dictate ``a
significant element of the content of the articles it publishes,
under threat of contempt.''
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to reject the
magazine's appeal as premature.
   ``The decision of the court of appeals does not ... determine
that (the magazine) has or has not violated (the anti-touting
provision) or establish what the terms of any injunction prohibiting
future violations of that provision may be,'' the government said.
   The case is Wall Street Publishing Institute vs. SEC, 88-982.

<HEAD>Eastern Strike Increase Traffic At Other Carriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines and bus companies braced for a heavier-than-usual
passenger load today as the Eastern Airlines strike continued into
its third day with no signs of a settlement.
   Meanwhile, worried commuters nationwide breathed sighs of relief
after a federal judge blocked sympathy walkouts by railroad workers
and striking Eastern Machinists called off plans to picket about a
dozen commuter rail stations.
   The Eastern strike began Saturday with a walkout by 8,500
mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew over demands for wage
concessions. Most of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants have
honored picket lines, virtually shutting down the carrier.
   Only about 9 percent of Eastern's 1,000 daily flights took off
Sunday, according to Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of Eastern's
usual 100,000 daily passengers at airports nationwide and have left
other airlines scrambling to accommodate those travelers.
   Pan American World Airways said its already-busy shuttle doubled
its normal rush hour schedule from Washington, New York and Boston
today.
   The shuttle, which usually flies once an hour from each city,
planned to fly every half hour today, except for the slow hours
between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   She said Pan Am also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planes
for 150-seat Boeing 727s on some flights between New York and Boston.
   The airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000
passengers on the shuttle over the weekend, also with a doubled
schedule. It expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekday
norm, Hanlon said.
   Eastern's sister company, Houston-based Continental Airlines,
which is also owned by Texas Air Corp., has ``added some extra
sections to already existing flights where there has been market
demand, primarily Newark. N.J., to Florida,'' according to spokesman
Art Kent.
   Kent said that pickets have not gone up against Continental and
that the strike was not having any effect on its operations.
   In Dallas, Greyhound Lines Inc. said extra buses were standing by
at several East Coast cities today prepared for heavier-than-usual
traffic.
   Greyhound said it added 200 buses and 32 express routes
connecting New York, Boston, Providence, R.I., Washington, and
Philadelphia in anticipation of a heavier demand for bus travel.
   ``We're not like airlines. We don't sell out of seats,'' said
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale. ``We just keep adding buses and sending
them out.''
   Hale said Greyhound ``should be able to maintain on-time
expectations, ... now that the commuter rails are open.''
   On Sunday, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson signed a
temporary restraining order in New York blocking rail workers from
sympathy strikes to support striking Eastern employees.
   The machinists had planned to mount secondary picket lines at
commuter railroads today and rail union leaders had said they would
honor them.
   The machinists promised to file an emergency appeal today.
   Patterson's order will last until 3 p.m. Wednesday, when he will
conduct a hearing to determine if he should issue a temporary
injunction.

<HEAD>Court Bans Tennessee Age Rule</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let
Tennessee officials impose a retirement age of 55 for officers who
enforce state wildlife laws.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the state
failed to show that physical fitness and a healthy heart are
necessary to do the job.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October struck down
the mandatory retirement age for officers of the Tennessee Wildlife
Resources Agency. The officers' duties include investigating
violations of hunting and fishing laws and arresting suspects.
   The appeals court said the age limit violates the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act aimed at protecting the rights of
older workers.
   Tennessee officials said wildlife officers also are responsible
for rescuing boaters and water skiers, work long hours in bad
weather and face life-threatening situations.
   The strenuous nature of the job is too demanding for those 55 and
older, the state officials said, because older officers are more
likely to be unfit and suffer from heart disease.
   But the 6th Circuit court said the state undermined its case by
not requiring physical fitness tests or heart examinations for any
officers, and by permitting some officers to stay on past age 55 due
to economic hardship or political pressure.
   Such waivers of the mandatory retirement age ``were granted
without any determinations as to job performance, physical ability
or physical fitness,'' the appeals court said. Therefore, it said,
Tennessee ``has not treated physical and coronary fitness as
reasonably necessary to the position of wildlife officer.''
   The Supreme Court in 1985 said the federal age-bias law requires
employers to show that employee qualifications _ such as physical
fitness _ are reasonably necessary to carry out the employer's work.
   The court also said in that ruling that an employer must show
that workers over a certain age lack such qualifications, or that it
is impractical to test the workers individually to determine whether
they are so qualified.
   Justice Department lawyers, representing the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in the case, said the Tennessee
dispute has limited application.
   There are only about a dozen similar cases in which states or
cities allegedly have violated the federal age discrimination law,
the government lawyers said.
   They also noted that Congress amended the law in 1986 to make it
easier for states and cities to impose mandatory retirement ages for
firefighters and law enforcement officers.
   The case is Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency vs. EEOC, 88-1100.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs increased
by four this week to total 761, continuing a seesaw trend that saw a
slight boost with the addition of 20 Texas rigs, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported.
   The count dropped by nine last week to total 757, following an
increase of 20 rigs in the previous week, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   A year ago, the rig count was 978.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, only three saw increases this
week, including Texas, with 20 additional rigs; California, seven;
and Michigan, two.
   Oklahoma saw the biggest decline, with five fewer rigs, followed
by Kansas and Ohio, two each; and Louisiana, New Mexico and
Pennsylvania, one each. Wyoming, North Dakota and Colorado rig
counts were unchanged for the week.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive
lawsuits by Johns-Manville Corp. that sought government
reimbursement for more than $35 million paid or owed to shipyard
workers suffering from asbestos-related diseases and injuries.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw the
suits by Johns-Manville out of a federal claims court.
   Thousands of workers exposed to products containing asbestos made
by Johns-Manville have sued the company.
   Many of the workers were employed at government-owned shipyards,
others at privately owned shipyards that built or repaired ships for
the government. Many of the claims date back to World War II.
   Johns-Manville sought reimbursement from the government,
contending that federal officials negligently approved use of
asbestos in shipbuilding. The company also accused the government of
failing to protect and warn workers about the hazards of exposure to
asbestos.
   The corporation filed suits in the U.S. Court of Claims, a court
here that handles various claims against the federal government.
   The claims court threw out the suits and a federal appeals court
upheld the dismissal.
   The appeals court said Johns-Manville is barred from seeking
reimbursement in the U.S. Court of Claims because the corporation
also sued the government in a federal district court in another
asbestos-related matter.
   The related case sought reimbursement for $45,000 Johns-Manville
paid a worker injured by asbestos exposure after 1963.
   The appeals court said the fact that the cases stem from asbestos
exposure some 20 years apart does not permit Johns-Manville to seek
recovery in the claims court while also seeking reimbursement in
federal district court for a similar claim.
   The case is Johns-Manville vs. U.S., 88-1052.

<HEAD>Michigan Law on Minority-Owned Businesses Found Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Michigan law that required 7 percent of all
state contracts be awarded to minority-owned businesses and 5
percent to businesses owned by women was unconstitutional, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, without issuing any written opinion, upheld a
federal appeals court's invalidation of the law.
   In a Jan. 23 decision, the high court itself struck down a
similar affirmative action plan that set aside 30 percent of all
city construction contracts in Richmond, Va., for minority-owned
businesses.
   In that ruling, the justices made it far more difficult for local
governments, and by extension state governments, to impose strict
racial quotas as part of affirmative action plans.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Michigan program,
enacted in 1980, was unlawful because there was inadequate evidence
of past discrimination by the state against minorities and women.
   State officials ``have relied upon certain conclusory historical
resumes of unrelated legislative enactments and proposed enactments,
executive reports and a state-funded private study conducted in
1974,'' the appeals court said. ``This documentation is not
reflective of discriminatory action by the state of Michigan.''
   The appeals court said there was ``little if any probative
evidence'' of discrimination against minority groups, and it said
evidence of discrimination against women ``is non-existent.''
   The minority groups covered by the program are blacks, Hispanics,
Orientals, Eskimos and American Indians.
   State officials said the quota figures were based on the
percentage of businesses in the state owned by minorities and women.
   The set-asides were challenged by various contractors doing
business with the state, led by the Michigan Road Builders
Association.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 upheld a federal law that set aside 10
percent of federal contracts for minority owned businesses.
   The case acted on today is Milliken vs. Michigan Road Builders,
87-1860.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Rate Restructuring Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by a
group of rural electric cooperatives challenging the authority of
Colorado officials to restructure rates charged to customers.
   The court, citing the lack of ``a properly presented federal
question,'' let stand a ruling supported by major oil companies that
buy power from the cooperative group.
   The Colorado Supreme Court ruled last July that the state's
public utility commission acted properly when it ordered the
Colorado-Ute Electric Association to redesign its rates.
   The association, comprised of 14 rural electric cooperatives, had
been charging what is known as a flat rate _ one not taking into
account the differences between fixed capital costs and variable
energy costs that fluctuate depending on fuel needs and costs.
   The utility commission ordered the cooperative association to
adopt a pricing setup that reflects separate charges for capital and
energy costs and varies according to seasonal demands of customers.
   The association's power needs generally are greater in winter.
   Supporting the change ordered by the state officials were Shell
Oil Co., Exxon, Atlantic Richfield and Union Carbide Corp.
   The state Supreme Court said the public utility commission had
adequate grounds to order the cooperative association to restructure
its rates because the old system resulted in ``an uneconomic
under-utilitization of capacity.''
   ``Rates charged should accurately reflect the utility's actual
cost of providing service, including both capital costs and
operating expenses,'' the state court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the cooperative
association also argued that its constitutional rights were violated
because the public utility commission based its findings in part on
a key computer analysis that the association was barred from
challenging adequately.
   The cooperatives said the they did not have an opportunity to
examine the computer program and supporting documents.
   The coops also said the state regulators interfered with the
power of the Rural Electrification Administration, a federal agency,
to regulate the cooperative utilities.
   Colorado-Ute Electric Association has 14 members. One member,
Empire Electric Association, opposed the appeal by the other 13.
   The case is Colorado-Ute vs. Colorado PUC, 88-977.

   Wheat futures prices opened mostly higher but corn
and soybeans were mostly lower this morning on the Chicago Board of
Trade, reflecting a mixed bag of weather in key growing areas over
the weekend.
   Some expected precipitation did not materialize in the winter
wheat regions of the Great Plains, boosting wheat futures prices,
particularly those for wheat to be harvested this spring.
   But rain and snow fell in much of the Midwest over the weekend,
dampening buying interest in corn and soybean futures.
   ``Spring planting is just three or four weeks away and we're
replenishing the soil moisture supply,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
grain trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The corn and soybean fields of Argentina received a substantial
amount of rain over the weekend, adding more pressure on the U.S.
corn and soybean markets.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.33 a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.78 a bushel; oats were } cent
lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.06} a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March at $7.66 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mixed.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .25 cent lower with April at 77.55
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .42 cent lower with
March at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent lower to .28 cent
higher with April at 43.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.50 cents lower to .53 cent higher with March at 38.10 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Friday.

<HEAD>Federal Workers Don't Have Right to Sue in Federal Court in California
Union Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today federal workers do
not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union
representing them of unfair treatment.
   The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the
employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge
with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the federal
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 does not ``provide a private cause
of action to enforce federal employees unions' duty of fair
representation.''
   The court ruled against Efthinios Karahalios, a Greek language
instructor at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif.
   Karahalios had worked for the institute for nearly 20 years when
in 1976 he was promoted to the higher-paying position of course
developer.
   Greek language instructor Simon Kuntelos objected to the
promotion and filed a grievance with the National Federation of
Federal Employees, which represents the institute's workers.
   Karahalios is not a member of the union, but it represents him in
collective bargaining. Kuntelos is a union member.
   The union decided to arbitrate Kuntelos' grievance without
telling Karahalios about it. After a hearing not attended by
Karahalios, an arbitrator cleared the way for Kuntelos, in effect,
to get Karahalios' job.
   Karahalios objected to his demotion, but the union refused to
arbitrate in his behalf.
   He filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the Federal
Labor Relations Authority. But the union and FLRA settled the case
when the union agreed to state it would not undertake similar acts
in the future.
   Karahalios then filed a federal court suit against the union.
   A federal judge said the union breached its duty to give
Karahalios fair representation and ordered the union to pay his
lawyer fees. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
ruling and threw out the suit.
   In upholding the appeals court decision, White said today that
federal workers do not have the same relationship to unions as
privately employed workers.
   The court enforcement procedures for private
collective-bargaining contracts do not apply to federal employees
covered by the civil service act, White said.
   The case is Karahalios vs. National Federation of Federal
Employees, 87-636.

<HEAD>Court Says Contract Dispute Between Stanford, Computer Firm Should
be Settled in State Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today said a contract dispute
between Stanford University and a computer firm should be settled in
state court, not in arbitration.
   The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for Stanford and a setback
for Volt Information Sciences Inc., which had asked the justices to
compel arbitration.
   Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said
California _ not federal _ law governs the case.
   The dispute developed when Volt submitted a claim for additional
compensation for extra work it said it performed installing a system
of electrical conduits connecting computer facilities on the
university campus in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The contract signed by Stanford and Volt contained a provision
that any dispute would be submitted to binding arbitration. The
contract also specified, in typical contractual language, that the
pact would be ``governed by the law of the place where the project
is located.''
   When Volt demanded that its claim for additional compensation be
arbitrated, Stanford sued in state court. Its suit alleged breach of
contract against Volt and two other companies with whom Stanford did
not have arbitration agreements.
   California courts ruled that the contract dispute should be
resolved in state court, and not in arbitration, because of a state
law allowing arbitration to be postponed pending lawsuits involving
third parties not bound by the arbitration.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for Volt said the
company was being deprived of its arbitration rights under the
Federal Arbitration Act.
   But Rehnquist wrote today that such rights are not absolute, and
may be overridden by agreements to let state law govern.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented, and
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the case.
   The case is Volt Informational Sciences vs. Stanford, 87-1318.

   The stock market pushed ahead today in activity
dominated by heavy buying of communications and entertainment issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.10 points to
2,278.39 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 744 up, 501 down and
542 unchanged.
   The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement
between Time Inc. and Warner Communications.
   Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that
other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might
be candidates for mergers or takeovers.
   Warner stock led the active list and jumped 3 to 48~, while
Time's shares dropped 2[ to 107. Analysts said Time's decline in
part reflected disappointment among traders who had been reckoning
that the company might have itself become a takeover candidate at a
higher price.
   Elsewhere in the group, Gulf &amp; Western rose 1~ to 45\; MCA 1] to
52\; Columbia Pictures Entertainment | to 18, and American
TV-Communications, traded in the over-the-counter market, 1 to 40.
   Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly
report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of
economic growth.
   That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation
outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Ohio Mattress climbed 2~ to 24|. The company agreed to a
$25.50-a-share buyout by the investment firm of Gibbons, Green, Van
Amerongen.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.43 to 164.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .35 at 326.57.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.35 million shares at noontime,

   The Pan Am shuttle doubled its normal rush hour
schedule from Washington, New York and Boston today in the wake of a
strike at its competitor, Eastern Airlines.
   Eastern, however, had crews available and was operating its
shuttle today, said spokesman Tim Cook. Four out of eight scheduled
Eastern shuttle flights left by 10 a.m. _ two to Boston and two to
Washington _ and the others were canceled because of snow, not the
strike, he said.
   Eastern also got off one non-shuttle flight _ to Miami _ from
LaGuardia Airport this morning, Cook said. Eastern was not operating
from the other New York-area airports, John F. Kennedy International
and Newark International.
   The shuttle crews were made up of a combination of union
employees who crossed picket lines and airline managers pressed into
duty, Cook said. He said he did not know how many passengers were on
the Eastern shuttle flights; the man who usually tracked such
figures was ``out throwing bags.''
   The Pan Am shuttle, which normally flies once an hour from each
city, was scheduled to fly every half hour today, except for the
slow hours between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon.
   Pan Am also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planes for
150-seat Boeing 727s on some flights between New York and Boston,
Hanlon said. Noise restrictions prohibited use of Airbuses on
flights to Washington.
   Pan Am carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000 passengers
on the shuttle Saturday and Sunday, also with a doubled schedule. It
expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekday norm, Hanlon
said.
   One shuttle passenger, Manhattan lawyer Gloria Hoyal, said she
went to LaGuardia Airport an hour and a half early today in
anticipation of delays that did not occur.
   ``And to add insult to injury, I was in Connecticut for the
weekend and I came back early to avoid the train strike,'' she said.
That problem also did not materialize: A federal judge blocked a
sympathy strike at the railroads.
   Today's first Pan Am shuttle flights arriving in New York, the
6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m. airplanes from Boston and Washington, were
delayed in New York for reasons unrelated to the strike: It was
snowing.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Challenge to Miami Affirmative Action Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a challenge
to a Miami affirmative action plan requiring 5 percent participation
of businesses owned by women or minorities in building a rail
transit system.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ordered a lower court to reconsider
its dismissal of the challenge in light of their Jan. 23 decision
striking down a similar affirmative action ``set aside'' program in
Richmond, Va.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens voted to leave intact the Miami affirmative
action plan.
   The Richmond plan required that 30 percent of all public works
contracts go to minority-owned businesses.
   The Miami plan was challenged by a construction company that
submitted the lowest bid on the project but was rejected for lack of
minority participation.
   The project involved construction of an electrified third rail
for the city's transit system, which is run by Metropolitan Dade
County officials. The construction is financed with 80 percent
federal funds.
   Dade County awarded the contract in 1979 to Transit Products
Inc., which submitted the second lowest bid of $8.37 million. The
low bid, $8.08 million, was submitted by H.K. Porter Company Inc.
   County officials required that 5 percent of the work be farmed
out to minority subcontractors unless the main contractor could show
it made every reasonable effort but failed to get minority
participation.
   Porter said it was unable to arrange minority participation.
   The corporation said it has a plant in Chicago that would
assemble the electrified third rail, and that only four items from
outside sources would be needed to complete the project. The firm
said no minority firms produced any of those items.
   After its bid was rejected, the company sued for $1.5 million in
damages. The firm said the Dade County set-aside plan is a form of
reverse discrimination that violates its constitutional rights.
   A federal judge threw out the Porter lawsuit, and the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.
   The appeals court, citing key Supreme Court rulings on
affirmative action, said the Miami plan is justified by a federal
law mandating minority participation in federally financed public
works projects.
   Congress in 1978 passed the Surface Transportation Assistance Act
appropriating money for highways and mass transit. The law, without
setting specific percentages, called for participation of minority
business enterprises to alleviate past discrimination against women,
blacks, Hispanics and other minorities.
   The 11th Circuit court said Dade County ``was not
constitutionally required to make additional findings of past
discrimination regarding the awarding of this contract. Congress was
concerned about a national problem. Its findings provide adequate
support for such local projects.''
   The appeals court conceded it was troubled by a lack of evidence
to support the 5 percent figure for the Miami project. But the
appeals court said the Supreme Court had upheld higher percentages
for minority participation.
   The appeals court also noted that Porter failed to show it made
every reasonable effort to get minority participation from
subcontractors to support its bid.
   In urging the justices to reject Porter's appeal, Dade County
officials noted that the federal regulations at issue in the case
acted on today were amended by a 1982 law.
   The new law changes the concept of minority-owned businesses to
require 10 percent participation in federally supported projected of
small businesses owned by ``socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals.''
   The case is Porter vs. Metropolitan Dade County, 87-1001.

<HEAD>Court Enhances States' Power Over Gas Production in Kansas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today enhanced the power of
states to regulate natural gas production, including
``use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production.
   The justices unanimously upheld the authority of Kansas officials
to control production from what is believed to be the largest
natural gas reservoir in the world.
   The decision upheld regulations adopted by the Kansas Corporation
Commission.
   At issue was gas from the Hugoton Field, which extends across
portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. About two-thirds of the
field is in Kansas, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines.
   The Kansas Corporation Commission since 1944 imposed regulations
aimed at assuring that each well will ultimately produce about the
amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder.
   The idea was to treat well owners equally, since gas can migrate
underground from an unproducing area to a well that is overproducing.
   To assure equal treatment, the state fixed the maximum amount of
gas that can be produced each month from each well.
   In practice, wells cannot always be operated to meet monthly
ceilings for varying reasons. For example, there may be a low demand
in a given month.
   To allow for these variables, state officials permitted owners of
underproducing wells to ``save up'' their production ceilings _
creating what are called ``underages'' _ and overproduce in future
months to make up for the shortfalls.
   To create a production incentive, the Kansas commission changed
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within
specified periods of years or they would be cancelled.
   The use-it-or-lose-it policy was challenged by Northwest Central
Pipeline Corp., one of the major buyers of the Hugoton gas for
transport outside Kansas.
   Northwest Central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually.
   The pipeline company asked the Supreme Court to strike down the
1983 regulations on grounds that the Federal Energency Regulatory
Commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production.
   Northwest Central also argued that the regulations impermissibly
interfered with interstate commerce.
   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said the
Kansas regulations are neither pre-empted by federal law nor
unconstitutional.
   ``We must decide whether a regulation ... to govern the timing of
production of natural gas from the Kansas-Hugoton field violates
either (the constitutional clause giving federal law supremacy over
conflicting state laws) or the commerce clause,'' Brennan said. ``We
hold that it does not.''
   The justices ruled in 1986 that states may not require interstate
pipelines to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool when the
pipeline had pre-existing contracts with only some of the owners.
   But Reagan administration lawyers had told the high court that
the Kansas controversy should not be controlled by the 1986 ruling.
   The case is Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. vs. State
Corporation Commission of Kansas, 86-1856.

<HEAD>Pillsbury To Lay Off 550 in Minneapolis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ``overlap of functions'' since Pillsbury
Co. was acquired by Grand Metropolitan PLC has contributed to a
decision to lay off 550 of the company's 2,350 employees in its
Minneapolis headquarters, officials announced today.
   The layoffs, amounting to about 23.4 percent of Pillsbury's
Minneapolis staff, are to take place over the next several weeks,
Pillsbury said. The company will be left with about 1,800 employees
in Minneapolis and 100,000 worldwide.
   ``The decision to eliminate these positions was necessary to make
Pillsbury a stronger, more profitable company, prepared to compete
successfully in the world marketplace,'' Ian A. Martin, chairman and
chief executive officer of Pillsbury and head of Grand
Metropolitan's worldwide foods group, said in a statement.
   ``We have concluded that the Pillsbury Foods business has been
operating at a competitive disadvantage which must be corrected.
Additionally, the merger of Grand Met and Pillsbury created some
overlap of functions which will be eliminated,'' he said.
   After a three-month fight, Pillsbury in December agreed to accept
a sweetened $5.68 billion takeover offer from the Britain-based
Grand Metropolitan.
   Grand Met reported sales of more than $11 billion in fiscal 1988.
Pillsbury had sales of $6.2 billion.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose
Monday but trading activity was thin as players began casting a
cautious eye toward next week's presentation of Britain's fiscal
1990 budget.
   ``Everybody's really not doing too much because of the budget
next week,'' one dealer said.
   Several factors combined to boost prices, including a
strengthening of the pound and a shortage of stock among market
makers. In addition, revised figures on British retail sales,
showing a greater slowing than had previously been reported,
encouraged hopes that inflation in Britain might be subsiding.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines President Phil Bakes' birthday
horoscope on Monday promised: ``You'll be on more solid
emotional-financial ground in April.''
   But Bakes, 43, didn't get the present he hoped for _ a return of
Eastern's pilots to work. Without the pilots, who are supporting a
strike by the airline's Machinists union, the airline's chances of
survival by April are considered low.
   Bakes, in pleading Sunday for the pilots to cross the Machinists
picket lines, declined to speculate how long Eastern could survive
but said ``the economics are clear.'' He also referred to
speculation about consequences such as bankruptcy that could stem
from a prolonged strike at Eastern, which is $2.5 billion in debt
and says it is losing $1 million a day.
   Since becoming Eastern president 2{ years ago, Bakes has talked
of plans to pull the carrier out of its 10-year financial tailspin,
make it grow and make it profitable.
   But union leaders call Bakes one of ``the Continental crew,'' the
executive team that helped Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo
turn Continental Airlines into a cheap-labor, predominantly
non-union company. Texas Air bought Eastern three years ago.
   Lorenzo and his ``union-buster'' image have galvanized Eastern
workers who believe his priorities are attacking organized labor and
milking cash out of Eastern.
   ``What we're seeing here is a remake of the Continental movie,''
pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said Sunday, after Bakes made a
televised plea for pilots to cross Machinists union picket lines.
``You've got the same players and Frank Lorenzo as the script writer
and director. But this time, the first act has been different.''
   In 1983, pilots crossed Machinists picket lines at Continental,
but both unions later had their contracts voided when the parent
Texas Air took Continental into bankruptcy reorganization.
   Bakes said he was ``somewhat surprised'' and had miscalculated
the extent to which Eastern pilots would support the Machinists.
Eastern's strike contingency plans had counted upon the pilots to
follow tradition and not support the Machinists, or for many of the
pilots to defy their union leadership and cross the picket line.
   The tall, lean long-distance runner with bright, piercing blue
eyes was born in Little Rock, Ark., and graduated with honors from
Loyola University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.
   Bakes served as an assistant prosecutor in the Watergate
investigation, was a counsel for Senate subcommittes and then the
Civil Aeronautics Board and then, after the airline industry was
deregulated, joined Texas Air as a vice president.
   In 1982, Bakes became executive vice president at Continental and
the carrier's president and chief operating officer in 1984. There,
he helped Continental return from bankruptcy reorganization as a
low-cost, aggressive airline.
   Bakes joined Eastern as its chief executive in October 1986 and
in January 1987 unveiled a plan to turn the airline around with a
six-point program that included marketing expansions and $490
million in labor cost cuts. He has promised Eastern, which has
shrunk steadily under Texas Air, will grow again if its labor costs
can be cut.
   Bakes said he inherited a tense labor situation that predated
Lorenzo, himself and chief Eastern negotiator Tom Matthews.
   ``Eastern Airlines is a company that's lost $1.5 billion since
deregulation. Frank Lorenzo as chairman of Texas Air...owner of
Eastern Airlines has only been involved for three years.
   ``What we've tried to do is say: `Give it a chance.' We will put
contractual guarantees that perhaps will get over the initial
distrust.
   ``With a successful company, when we're growing, buying
airplanes, refurbishing, trust will come,'' Bakes said.

   Paraguay has reapplied to join the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the main pact setting rules
for world trade, a GATT source said Monday.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Paraguyan
delegate brought his nation's bid to a regular meeting Monday of
GATT's governing Council, which is open to all members.
   After the overthrow of longtime military strongman Alfredo
Stroessner last month, Paraguay's new government had notified the
GATT administration that it wants to pursue its bid to join, which
it abandoned in 1974.
   GATT has agreed to consider the request, the source said.
Reaching a decision seems likely to take months, if not years.
   Asked whether the timing of the bid was related to the new
government's coming to power, the GATT source said only that
Paraguay already had indicated renewed interest in joining for about
a year.
   GATT is an agreement promoting free trade and also a forum for
negotiations and resolution of trade disputes. GATT sets mutual
privileges and obligations. An attempt at expanding their scope,
aimed at further freeing global commerce, is currently underway in a
four-year round of world trade talks due to wind up in 1990.

   On reviewing the monthly housing statistics, you
might think that one of today's most popular participant activities
is moving, preparing to move or thinking about moving.
   It isn't quite true. It is true nevertheless that real estate and
housing markets have been particularly busy in recent months and
years, in spite of foreboding by economists and despite rising
prices and interest rates.
   January housing starts soared to 1.69 million units, 170,000
units higher than in December 1988 and 310,000 thousand higher than
in December 1987. Single-family resales last year reached 3.63
million units, the highest since 1978.
   But, while such statistics are impressive and to some extent
unexpected, there is an aspect of the housing market that is even
more active. Remodeling, that is, seems to have become the national
pastime.
   While final figures aren't in, the National Association of Home
Builders already has declared that remodeling and fix-up
expenditures last year exceeded $100 billion for the first time,
double the amount spent five years earlier.
   While the exact amount for the year hasn't been determined, it is
known that in the first three quarters the annual rate was better
than $102 billion and that preliminary indications were for a strong
fourth quarter.
   The spending rise has been what economists tend to call
``dramatic.'' After varying between about $45 billion and $49
billion in the four years from 1980 through 1983, the total soared
to $69.8 billion in 1984.
   It has risen without interruption since then, to $80.3 billion in
1985, $91.2 billion in 1986 and $94.1 billion in 1987.
   Even when adjusted for inflation, says Kenneth Klein, a Tulsa
remodeler and chairman of the NAHB Remodelers Council, this huge
increase ``makes the remodeling industry the fastest growing sector
of the construction industry.''
   Whether growth will continue is questionable, because almost all
segments of housing markets are cyclical. The NAHB expects growth of
four to six percent for the next three to five years, or little more
than the inflation rate.
   Some non-housing people wouldn't be surprised, however, to see
the trend continue, especially if the cost of new housing continues
to rise. They point to these factors as contributing to the
remodeling and repair statistics:
   _The rising cost of housing, which often makes it more
advantageous to remodel than move. New houses often absorb all of
the old equity; remodeling may leave some for other purposes.
   _The desire to remain in mature communities with good schools and
desirable amenities, rather than moving to new communities with
prospects of higher taxes for new schools and municipal improvements.
   _Equity growth and growing access to that equity through
tax-advantaged loans.
   _Convenience as well as savings. Anyone who has moved recently
knows it can be costly _ for moving expenses, set-up costs, lawyers,
new mortgages and the points that accompany them.
   There may be inconvenience in either instance _ moving or
remodeling. But in remodeling you can at least stay put amid the
noise, confusion and dirt.
   According to an NAHB survey, the top remodeling activities in
1987 were room additions, which accounted for 25.5 percent of all
remodeling, and kitchen remodeling, 20.2 percent. Complete
rehabilitation accounted for 7.9 percent.
   As many homeowners might guess, the major expenditures by type of
work were painting, plumbing and roofing, with heating and central
air conditioning not far behind. Luxuries, such as swimming pools,
were far down the list.

<HEAD>New Report Estimates Lower OPEC Production in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The OPEC nations produced about 19.4
million barrels of oil a day in February, less than in the previous
month but still above their new production goal, according to fresh
estimates released Monday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that estimated production by the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries dipped last month from 20.2 million
barrels a day in January.
   The oil-producing nations agreed in November to slash output
starting Jan. 1, to try to boost prices to $18 a barrel.
   Since then, analysts say the oil nations have reduced the crude
flow to meet their ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day
in the first six months of the year.
   The slowdown in output has boosted prices about $5 since last
November. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC
was $16.31 a barrel last week.
   Independent oil-producing nations have also agreed to lower their
exports in the April-June quarter in an effort to kick up prices
further. As part of that drive, the Soviet Union on Friday announced
it would cut its exports by about 5 percent in the first half of the
year.
   The Soviet Union, the world's largest crude oil producer, said
Monday the export reduction would amount to 100,000 barrels a day
and was an effort to cooperate closely with OPEC to stabilize world
oil prices.
   The Soviet Union sells foreign clients an estimated 1.8 million
barrels of oil a day.
   The International Energy Agency's report estimated the world oil
supply at 49.6 million barrels a day in February, off 900,000
barrels from January.
   ``The reduction,'' it said, ``is due primarily to lower
production in several Middle Eastern countries as well as a slight
production decline in the (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development).'' The OECD is an organization of about two-dozen
industrialized nations.
   Oil output in those nations, it said, was estimated at 16.2
million barrels a day in February, down 100,000 barrels from January.
   The report also said strong economic growth, especially in Japan,
helped lift oil consumption in the industrialized nations to 38.8
million barrels a day in the October-December quarter of 1988, up
about 5 percent from year-earlier levels.
   ``Heavy fuel oil consumption increased in all regions, mainly
because of higher demand by electric utilities,'' the report said.
``In North America, there was considerable switching from natural
gas, partly because of competitively priced fuel oil.''
   Oil consumption in North America, it said, was 19.7 million
barrels a day in the fourth quarter of last year, a gain of about
4.5 percent from the same period of 1987. European consumption, it
said, advanced about 3.5 percent in the last three months of 1988.
   The report estimated that oil consumption in the industrialized
nations would rise about 1.6 percent in the first quarter of this
year.
   ``January consumption growth was quite strong but appeared to
slow in February,'' it said.
   According to the agency's supply estimates, only Iran, Ecuador
and the United Arab Emirates appeared to be producing in February
above the levels set for individual OPEC countries last November.
   Iran's output was estimated at 2.7 million barrels a day in
February, compared with its quota of 2.6 million barrels.
   The United Arab Emirates produced about 1.6 million barrels a
day, well above its target of 988,000 barrels. Ecuador was measured
at roughly 300,000 barrels a day, compared with its quota of 230,000
barrels.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, produced an
estimated 4.5 million barrels a day in February, the same as its
quota. Its daily output was roughly 4.8 million barrels in January.
   OPEC released figures late last month that showed member
countries complying in January with the new output accord. It said a
dozen of its members supplied a total of 17.42 million barrels a day
in January, just under the combined quota for those countries of
17.51 million barrels.
   OPEC said it measures a nation's quota by figuring crude
production and the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Since coming to Eastern Airlines as president 2{
years ago, Phil Bakes has insisted he has firm plans to pull the
carrier out of its 10-year financial tailspin.
   The crippling strike that continued in its third day today
indicates his employees don't really believe him.
   Instead, union leaders call Bakes one of ``the Continental
crew,'' the executive team that helped Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo turn Continental Airlines into a cheap-labor,
predominantly nonunion company.
   It's Lorenzo and his ``union-buster'' image that has galvanized
Eastern's workers, who believe his priorites are attacking organized
labor and milking cash out of Eastern.
   ``By all the actions they've already taken, it's clear where he's
taking the airline,'' pilots' union spokesman Ron Cole said Sunday,
after Bakes made a nationally televised plea for pilots to cross
Machinists union picket lines and return to work. ``He (Bakes) is
trying to deflect the issue away from Frank Lorenzo.
   ``What we're seeing here is a remake of the Continental movie.
You've got the same players and Frank Lorenzo as the script writer
and director,'' Cole said. ``But this time, the first act has been
different.''
   Cole referred to 1983 when pilots crossed Machinists picket lines
at Continental, only to join the Machinists in having their
contracts voided when the parent Texas Air took the carrier into
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Bakes admitted Sunday he was ``somewhat surprised'' and had
miscalculated the extent to which pilots would support the
Machinists. Eastern's contingency plans had counted on pilots
crossing the picket lines.
   ``If the pilots had come to work Friday night, I'd be at the
Miami Grand Prix this afternoon and you'd all be home with your
families,'' Bakes told reporters.
   This morning, Bakes accused the pilots of misleading the airline,
and later in the day, the airline dropped the other shoe by filing
suit against the pilots, saying the work stoppage was illegal.
   ``The pilots have been saying over the last year that if the
Machinists did strike, they would come to work. That's why we were
so surprised,'' Bakes said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``This is the pilots strike that really shouldn't have been,''
added Bakes.
   Eastern filed the request for a restraining order to halt the
strike with a federal judge in Miami, who did not immediately
schedule a hearing.
   The tall, lean long-distance runner with bright, piercing blue
eyes turned 43 today. A newspaper horoscope for those with birthdays
today promises: ``You'll be on more solid emotional-financial ground
in April.''
   However, Bakes is unlikely to reach that ground with Eastern if
the strike doesn't end soon.
   He declined to speculate on how long Eastern could stay alive,
but said ``the economics are clear.'' He referred to speculation
about the consequences of a prolonged strike, which include
bankruptcy. Bakes said Sunday the company is keeping up its payments
on nearly $2.5 billion in debts.
   Philip J. Bakes, a Little Rock, Ark., native, graduated with
honors from Loyola University of Chicago and Harvard Law School,
served as an assistant prosecutor in the Watergate investigation,
was a counsel for Senate subcommittees and then the Civil
Aeronautics Board.
   After the airline industry was deregulated, he joined Texas Air
as a vice president. In 1982, he became executive vice president at
Continental and the carrier's president and chief operating officer
in 1984. There, he helped Continental return from bankruptcy
reorganization with a low-cost, aggressive airline.
   Bakes joined Eastern as its chief executive in October 1986.
Three months later, he unveiled a plan to turn the airline around
with a program that included marketing expansions and cutting labor
costs overall by $490 million, or about 30 percent. He has promised
Eastern, which has shrunk steadily under Texas Air, will be rebuilt
to grow if its labor costs can be cut.
   Bakes agreed that trust is an issue.
   ``We would hope that over time there will be much more trust
among all the Eastern people,'' he said, adding that he inherited a
tense labor situation that predated ``Frank Lorenzo, Phil Bakes and
(chief negotiator) Tom Matthews.
   ``Eastern Airlines is a company that's lost $1.5 billion since
deregulation. Frank Lorenzo as chairman of Texas Air ... owner of
Eastern Airlines has only been involved for three years.
   ``What we've tried to do is say: `Give it a chance.' We will put
contractual guarantees that perhaps will get over the initial
distrust.
   ``With a successful company, when we're growing, buying
airplanes, refurbishing, trust will come,'' Bakes said.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Economy Grew in February But At Slower Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy grew in February at the
slowest rate in two years, according to a survey of purchasing
executives.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy through its monthly survey of its members, said in a
report for release Monday that its Purchasing Managers Index fell
slightly last month, to 53.0 from 53.2. The February level was the
lowest for the index since February 1987, when it was 52.6 percent.
   Despite the drop, the index still pointed to economic growth. A
reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding, while
below 50 it is contracting. The index has exceeded 50 for 31
consecutive months.
   ``The economy appears to have entered a period of slower and more
moderate growth than the robust pace of last year,'' said Robert J.
Bretz, association chairman and director of materials management at
Pitney Bowes Inc.
   ``This, coupled with a decreased employment and a declining
inflation trend, could be signalling a more subdued and healthier
economy for this stage of the economic recovery.''
   The survey found that new orders continued to increase in
February from the previous month, which was at its lowest level
since October 1986.
   Thirty-two percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said new
orders were better last month, while 53 percent said they were the
same and 15 percent said they were worse. In January, 27 percent
said they were better, while 61 percent said they were the same and
12 percent said they were worse.
   The rate of production growth slowed to an index level of 53.7
percent from 56.2 percent in January. The February level was its
lowest since 53.0 percent in December 1986.
   Vendor deliveries continued to grow, but their change came at a
slower pace. Slow vendor deliveries are a bullish economic signal;
they indicate a business is getting new orders faster than it can
fill them.
   Sixteen percent of the respondents said deliveries were slower,
while 74 percent said they were the same and 10 percent said they
were faster. In January, 15 percent reported slower deliveries,
while 79 percent said they were the same and 6 percent said they
were faster.
   Inventories declined for the second consecutive month.
   Eighteen percent of the purchasing managers said inventories were
higher, 67 percent said they were the same and 15 percent said they
were lower. That compared with 17 percent who said they were higher,
59 percent who said they lower in January.
   Thirty-eight percent of the respondents said prices were higher,
while 57 percent said they were the same and 5 percent said they
were lower. In January, 51 percent reported higher prices, while 46
percent said they were the same and 3 percent said they lower.
   Employment declined in February after eight consecutive months of
increasing, according to the survey.
   Thirteen percent of the purchasing managers said employment was
up at their companies, 72 percent said it was the same and 15
percent said it was down. The previous month, 10 percent reported
higher employment, 80 percent said it was the same and 10 percent
said it fell.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is an education
and research organization of purchasing executives. It polls
purchasing managers in more than 250 industrial firms for its
economic survey.

<HEAD>U.S. Electronics World Trade Deficit Decreased 25 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. electronics trade deficit
with the world shrank about 25 percent in 1988 to $9.6 billion but
the deficit with Japan grew 2 percent, the American Electronics
Association reported Monday.
   U.S. exports increased more than 28 percent to $58 billion from
$45.2 billion in 1987, while imports increased 17 percent to $67.6
billion from $58 billion.
   U.S. electronics companies' exports to Japan shot up, but a small
percentage increase in imports was still enough to cause the deficit
to swell.
   The electronics trade deficit with Japan grew to $20.5 billion
from $20.1 billion. U.S. exports to Japan grew more than 43 percent,
to $6.3 billion in 1988 from $4.4 billion in 1987. Imports from
Japan increased 9.4 percent to $26.8 billion.
   ``This significant reduction in our trade deficit with the world
is the result of a surge in U.S. electronics exports,'' said J.
Richard Iverson, AEA president and chief executive officer.
   ``Unfortunately, the same progress wasn't achieved with our trade
problems with Japan,'' he added. ``The Japanese electronics industry
must realize that trade is a two-way street and that the open
markets in the United States must be matched by the same in Japan.''
   The fourth-quarter U.S. electronics trade deficit with the world
decreased by almost 20 percent to $3.0 billion from $3.7 billion in
1987. Exports rose to $15.7 billion from $12.7 billion and imports
to $18.6 billion from $16.4 billion.
   The U.S. electronics trade deficit with Japan for electronics
products and services slowed its rate of growth in the 1988 fourth
quarter to 1.5 percent to $5.6 billion from $5.5 billion. U.S.
exports to Japan improved to $1.8 billion in the 1988 quarter from
$1.3 billion in 1987 and imports from Japan rose to $7.4 billion
from $6.9 billion.
   The AEA represents more than 3,500 companies in the United States.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade with the wheat market
posting solid gains amid weather concerns and new export activity.
   The key winter-wheat states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and
Nebraska received far less precipitation over the weekend than many
traders had expected, spurring brisk buying Monday of new-crop wheat
futures _ contracts for delivery in July or later.
   Wheat for near-term delivery was supported by reports that China
was seeking to buy 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices for April or May delivery.
   The soybean complex was boosted by heavy speculative buying of
soybean meal futures, although analysts could cite no new
supply-and-demand developments to account for the late surge.
   Corn futures finished narrowly mixed.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 7{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents
lower to 1} cents higher with March at $2.80 a bushel; oats were 2{
cents to 4{ cents higher with March at $2.10 a bushel; soybeans were
3\ cents to 8{ cents higher with March at $7.71 a bushel.

<HEAD>Three U.S. Companies to Supply Steel Bar Products to Honda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc.
announced Monday it will purchase specialty bar steel products from
three U.S. steelmakers for use in engine, drive-train and suspension
components.
   The purchase of the domestic steel bar products, as well as
purchases from other U.S. sources, will bring domestic content for
automobiles produced by Honda of America to 75 percent by 1991, the
Japanese automaker said. Domestic content of such vehicles is
currently 62 percent.
   Honda said a total of five steel bar materials will be supplied
by LTV Steel, Copperweld Steel and Timken Co., with up to 1,400
metric tons per month to be purchased by the end of 1990. The steel
will be supplied by Ohio mills: LTV, from Massillon; Copperweld,
from Warren; and Timken, from Canton.
   Yoichi Harada, a spokesman for Honda of America, said the company
currently purchases assembled engine, drive-train and suspension
components from Japan. Under the new arrangement, the assembly will
be done with domestic steel bar products at Honda's engine plant in
Anna, Ohio.
   All of the body stampings currently produced at Honda's
Marysville auto plant are manufactured from domestic steel supplied
by Inland Steel, Bethlehem Steel and Armco.
   The auto plant at Marysville began production in November 1982,
and the engine plant at Anna began production in July 1985.

<HEAD>Reynolds Introducing Colored Plastic Wrap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Colored plastic wrap introduced Monday by
Reynolds Metals Co. will ``make the mundane task of wrapping
leftovers fun,'' the company says.
   Skeptical?
   Reynolds says consumers responded with even more enthusiasm than
expected when the company tried out the red, green, blue and yellow
plastic wrap in focus groups and simulated test markets.
   ``The addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic
wrap, which in its clear form is considered purely a functional
product,'' said Jane D. Nims of Reynolds' consumer products
division. ``Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product
exciting.''
   The new product, called ``Crystal Color Plastic Wrap,'' is
intended to liven up the kitchen . . . make things more
interesting,'' said spokeswoman Anne F. Waring.
   Marabel Morgan, author of ``The Total Woman'' and proponent of
the idea that women spice up their marriages by greeting their
husbands at the door wearing only plastic wrap, says the colored
wrap ``is a great idea. It would really add a lot of zip,'' she said
Sunday in a telephone interview from her home in Miami.
   The Richmond-based company will promote use of the colored wrap
in crafts as well as food storage, Ms. Waring said. Reynolds will
have several special promotions around the holidays for the product,
which is manufactured at its plant in Grottoes, Va.
   The colored wrap is unlikely to have a significant impact on the
company's sales, Reynolds analysts said.
   ``It's a tempest in a teapot,'' said William G. Siedenburg of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``Reynolds is
principally and always will be an aluminum producer.
   ``Does it matter what color you use to wrap the meat you didn't
finish at dinner?'' he added.
   But Michael Via of Anderson &amp; Strudwick Inc. in Richmond said the
innovation is part of the company's movement away from aluminum,
which has a cyclical market, toward plastic products and consumer
packaging, which have higher profit margins.
   In 1988, Reynolds reported a record net income of $482 million,
or $8.35 per share, on revenues of $5.6 billion.
   Ms. Waring said the consumer products division accounts for 10
percent of Reynolds' sales.

<HEAD>Two Companies Agree To Offer Anti-Theft Discounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two insurance companies announced Monday they
plan to offer 5 percent discounts to motorists who agree to let
police stop their cars if they are seen on the road between 1 a.m.
and 5 a.m.
   The program is designed to deter the theft of cars during the
four-hour period, which is prime time for thefts.
   A police decal on a side window of the cars identifies them as
participants in the program, which is already in effect in New York
City, Yonkers, East Brunswick, N.J., and Philadelphia.
   The Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. and Travelers Insurance Co.
said the discounts will be offered on comprehensive car policies if
the customer participates in the Combat Auto Theft program and if
the reductions are approved by the state Insurance Department.

<HEAD>Ruling Bolsters States' Power To Regulate Natural Gas Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court Monday enhanced the power of states to regulate
natural gas production, including ``use-it-or-lose-it'' rules
designed to stimulate production.
   The justices unanimously upheld the authority of Kansas officials
to control production from what is believed to be the largest
natural gas reservoir in the world.
   The decision upheld regulations adopted by the Kansas Corporation
Commission.
   At issue was gas from the Hugoton Field, which extends across
portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. About two-thirds of the
field is in Kansas, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines.
   The use-it-or-lose-it policy was challenged by Northwest Central
Pipeline Corp., one of the major buyers of the Hugoton gas for
transport outside Kansas.
   Northwest Central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually.
   The pipeline company asked the Supreme Court to strike down the
1983 regulations on grounds that the Federal Emergency Regulatory
Commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production.
   Northwest Central also argued that the regulations impermissibly
interfered with interstate commerce.
   Writing for the court, Justice William J. Brennan said the Kansas
regulations are neither pre-empted by federal law nor
unconstitutional.
   In other action, the court:
   _Rejected an appeal by Northeastern states seeking to force the
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution
they say is caused by smokestacks in other states.
   _Decided federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal
court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair
treatment. The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse
for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice
charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   _In a case stemming from Delta Air Lines' takeover of Western Air
Lines, refused to let Delta force the retirement of a group of
flight engineers over age 60. The justices, without comment, let
stand a ruling that Delta is bound by an age-bias lawsuit the flight
engineers won against Western.
   _Turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine
accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities
law. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force
The Stock Market Magazine to tell readers whether companies featured
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for
other services.
   _Took steps against two affirmative action programs, citing its
ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in
the award of public works contracts in Richmond, Va.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling
a Miami plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned
by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system.
   And the court declared unconstitutional a Michigan law requiring
that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minority-owned
businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women.

   Stock prices posted a broad gain today in
activity dominated by buying of communications and entertainment
issues.
   The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement
between Time Inc. and Warner Communications.
   Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that
other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might
be candidates for mergers or takeovers.
   Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly
report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of
economic growth.
   That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation
outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest
rates.

<HEAD>Orders For New Construction Off 5 Percent in January</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release 6:30 p.m. EST.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts for new construction fell 5 percent in
January from the high level of December, when public works projects
had surged, F.W. Dodge Group said Monday.
   F.W. Dodge, a division of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.,
said fluctuations in contracting for public works projects have been
a big influence on the building sector for several months.
   Commercial and industrial construction showed renewed strength in
January while residential building slowed.
   Contracting for public works and utilities in January was 20
percent lower than December's unusually strong level. The January
decline brought the annual pace of contracting in this sector to a
more normal level, F.W. Dodge said.
   The value of all newly started construction in January declined
to an annual rate of $243.6 billion from December's annual rate of
$256.2 billion.
   George A. Christie, F. W. Dodge's vice president and chief
economist, said the construction sector entered 1989 on a weak note
and could deteriorate as the year goes on if the Federal Reserve
Board becomes increasingly aggressive in its battle against
inflation.
   The building business is very sensitive to interest rate
movements and interest charges have been rising lately as the
central bank pursues a tight-money policy.
   ``One month hardly sets a trend, but if the Federal Reserve
stands firm in its determination to tighten credit further as
inflationary pressures continue to mount, the coming months could
make January look good,'' Christie said.

   To Jennifer Dickson, commercial television is as
welcome in the classroom as it is in the living room.
   ``The people against the commercials should wake up and smell the
coffee,'' the 12th-grader at Detroit's Mumford High School said
Monday after viewing the first edition of Whittle Communications'
Channel One news program. ``This is the 1980s and commercials are a
way of life.
   ``They're just trying to create the image of `Leave It To Beaver'
and it's just not that way anymore,'' Dickson said of the show's
critics.
   Students and administrators at Mumford gave high marks to Channel
One, a 12-minute daily program being tested in six schools around
the country by Whittle, a Knoxville, Tenn.,-based media company.
   The launch of Channel One came amid growing criticism by some
children's advocates and educators, including the National
Parent-Teachers Association, of the inclusion of 30-second
television ads.
   Commercials for Snickers candy bars, Head and Shoulders shampoo,
Levi's 501 jeans and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America were in
the initial show.
   ``I enjoyed the program,'' said LaMesa Williams, a 12th-grader.
``Not a lot of kids go home and watch the news on television, so
it's good that they have the opportunity to see it at school.''
   About 20 students viewed the premier show with members of the
media in the high school's library on Monday. The program contained
features on students' reactions to the continuing death threats
against Salman Rushdie, author of the book ``The Satanic Verses;''
life for a teen-ager in the Soviet Union; and the controversy
involving the launch of Channel One.
   ``The story about the Soviet Union was especially interesting
because I got to see how teen-agers over there live, what they wear,
what music they listen to,'' 12th-grader Tammy Warren said.
   Students appeared to watch the program closely, with some taking
notes, while others at times were distracted by the lights of
television cameras from local stations covering the program's first
showing.
   Detroit Schools Superintendent Arthur Jefferson, on hand for the
debut of Channel One, said the program would be monitored carefully.
   ``We take very seriously the responsibility of educating young
people,'' Jefferson said. ``We have to be very careful about the
intrusion of commercialism upon a captive audience.''

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices began the week slightly
higher Monday, aided by the Soviet Union's reaffirmation of oil
production cuts and a report showing a drop in OPEC output last
month.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 11 cents
higher at $18.67 a barrel, after falling 16 cents in volatile
trading Friday.
   The April contract had risen as high as $18.86 a barrel Monday,
but declined on profit-taking, analysts said.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 0.63 cent
higher at 51.43 cents a gallon, after falling 1.07 cents Friday.
   April unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.68 cent the previous
session, settled at 51.59 cents, up 0.60 cent.
   ``The confirmation of the Soviet cutback on production was the
principal issue in the market,'' said William Byers, an energy
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Top Soviet energy officials said Monday that the Soviet Union is
prepared to cooperate closely with OPEC to stabilize world oil
markets. The statements follow a Tass announcement Friday that the
Soviets will cut oil exports by about 5 percent in the first six
months of 1989, as part of an effort by non-OPEC producers to shore
up world oil prices.
   Byers said the oil market also got a boost Monday by a report
shoing daily oil production among the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries declined to 19.4 million from 20.2 million
barrels.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed in November to slash output starting
Jan. 1, to try to boost prices to $18 a barrel. Since then, analysts
say, the oil nations have cut crude flow to meet their daily quota
of 18.5 million in the first six months of the year.

<HEAD>American Plans Up to $3.5 Billion Purchase of Smaller Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is about to follow up
last month's order for up to $7.5 billion worth of McDonnell Douglas
jets with the purchase of up to $3.5 billion more in smaller
commuter airplanes from undisclosed manufacturers, a newspaper
reported Monday.
   An American spokesman, though, said the company has yet to make
any decisions about commuter plane purchases.
   The small commuter jets, which would seat about 100 and together
cost up to $2 billion, would fly under the American Airlines name,
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.
   Turboprop planes that seat between 35 and 50 passengers and
together cost up to $1.5 billion would be flown by American's
commuter airline subsidiaries that operate collectively as American
Eagle, the newspaper said.
   Bob Baker, American's senior vice president for operations, told
the newspaper the airline expects to order both types of aircraft
within the next 30 to 45 days.
   ``We'd like them yesterday,'' Baker said. ``We are units short.
We'd love to have 50 more airplanes Monday morning, simply because
we have the chance to use them productively now. And there are some
closing windows of opportunity.''
   The story did not say what company might supply the new planes.
   Baker was attending a daylong meeting Monday and was unavailable
for comment, his secretary told The Associated Press.
   Calls to Baker were referred to Al Becker, a corporate
communications spokesman for American. Becker said reports about
plans for airplane purchases are ``speculative'' and said although
American is reviewing its needs for new commuter airplanes,
decisions about purchases have yet to be made.
   With 475 airplanes, American already operates the biggest
commercial fleet in the Western world. Last month, American ordered
eight MD-11s with the option to buy another 42. MD-11s are
three-engine, wide-body jets that can carry 405 passengers
long-range and are designed to replace the older DC-10. American
also took options on 100 MD-80s, smaller twin-jet planes designed to
replace the Boeing 727.
   American's commuter airline subsidiaries operate 128 commuter
planes, and six are on order. That does not include the 58 planes
operated by Metro Airlines Inc. of Grapevine, an independent company
that flies as the American Eagle franchisee at American's
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport hub, and Executive Air, the American Eagle
operator at American's hub at San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Baker said American wants to use some 100-seat jets to replace
its 39 Boeing 727-100s, which seat 118 and are the oldest planes in
the fleet. The oldest 727-100 is nearly 25 years old.
   American also sees the 100-seat jet as a vehicle for expansion
into small-city markets. Baker said American has identified 80 to
100 such markets around the country.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Chairman Criticizes Boeing Testimony On Composite Materials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee chairman lashed out at
Boeing Co. on Monday just moments after a top official of the
Seattle-based aerospace firm testified there was no evidence to link
the use of a high-tech composite material with workers' health
problems.
   ``I am somewhat resentful of your testimony,'' said Nevada
Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, chairman of the toxic substances,
environmental oversight, research and development subcommittee of
the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee.
   Reid said he felt Boeing was ``minimizing'' the effects the
materials can have on workers by pleading ignorance and emphasizing
the disagreements in the medical community.
   Joseph Peritore, Boeing's vice president for human resources,
told the subcommittee his company had decided to discontinue use of
the material even though it was ``determined that the material
presented no significant health hazard.''
   Peritore also said doctors were divided on the effects composite
materials can have on workers and that Boeing had ``not only met,
but significantly exceeded'' regulatory standards governing use of
the material.
   Peritore said that Boeing, in ending its use of a resin that
contains phenol and formaldehyde, was responding to workers'
complaints.
   ``The fact that we believed the material was safe became
irrelevant,'' said Peritore. ``In the highly-charged atmosphere that
existed, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concerns
was to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.''
   Reid told reporters after the hearing, that he felt testimony
from an official of the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. showed
that firm ``recognized the problem'' and was trying to do something
about it.
   ``The difference between Lockheed and Boeing was like night and
day,'' said Reid.
   The subcommittee hearing stemmed from complaints by Boeing
workers in the Seattle area and employees at a production site for
the new stealth fighter operated by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems
Co. in Burbank, Calif.
   The materials are mixtures of plastic, carbon and synthetic
fibers which increasingly are being used to replace metal in aircaft.
   Nearly 100 workers are suing Lockheed, claiming workplace
chemicals resulted in ailments ranging from dizziness, nausea and
bloody urine to skin and organ injuries and cancer. Lawyers
representing the workers say at least five have died of cancer since
the lawsuit was filed in 1986.
   Boeing workers at plants in the Puget Sound region, including
Kent, Everett, Renton and Auburn, have had similar health complaints.
   Dr. Gordon Baker, a Burien, Wash., allergist whose patients
include more than 130 Boeing employees, said composite materials are
causing ``widespread, serious'' health problems for aerospace
workers.
   ``Chemicals are being used without adequate health and safety
data, without proper testing, and without giving some workers the
necessary protective equipment, ventiliation and training that are
essential to safely using these toxic industrial materials,'' said
Baker.
   Baker said his patients showed a ``definite pattern of symptoms''
that were ``unprecedented and unexpected'' in a general allergy
practice.
   ``There are widespread, serious health problems throughout the
industry now that they are using the new composite materials,'' said
Baker.
   Baker said that of the Boeing employees he has seen, 75 percent
suffer from extreme fatigue, 68 percent had memory lapses, 67 had
chest pains or trouble breathing and 68 percent had vision problems.
   In addition, Baker said there was evidence that some of the
employees may be suffering from ``organic brain poisoning,'' which
can result in varying degrees of ``incapacity to perform and think
up to previous abilities.
   ``It is of the greatest urgency that adequate safety is insured
in the workplace wherever these materials are used,'' Baker said.
``The unfortunate victims of these chemical poisons should be
properly cared for and not be subjected to harrassment, demotion,
termination, or forced to continue working in unhealthy work
environments until they can work no more.''
   Two women who worked at Boeing's Auburn plant testified they were
never warned that the chemicals could be dangerous.
   ``I had no idea what chemicals we had in the shop,'' said Beverly
McCormick of North Bend, Wash.
   Ms. McCormick said the exposure to chemicals left her with a
number of medical problems and an overall lack of energy. ``I can't
play with my own granddaughter for more than a few minutes,'' she
said.
   Bonnie Faye Schrum, who lives in Renton, Wash., said workers were
discouraged from reporting their health problems and were warned
they would be fired if they did.
   ``I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' said Ms.
Schrum. ``I can't go to the grocery store without getting sick, I
can't sleep at night, you don't eat, you have no energy.
   ``My memory is a mess, I don't know my kids, some days I don't
even know I am in my home,'' she said.

<HEAD>Du Pont Announces Long-Term Alternatives To CFC Cleaning Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. says it has developed two products
that could become long-term replacements for a chemical commonly
used as a cleaning agent that is suspected of damaging the Earth's
ozone layer.
   The products are intended as substitutes for CFC-113, a
chlorofluorocarbon used by the electronics and other industries
requiring high standards of cleanliness in such equipment as wiring
assemblies.
   Cleaning agents account for about 20 percent of the world market
for CFCs, which also are used in refrigeration, aerosols, and
blowing agents, including for insulation and cushioning.
   Du Pont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production of
CFCs and is the world's largest producer, plans to stop making the
chemicals, and has been researching possible alternative products.
   With the latest two products, Du Pont has developed candidates to
replace CFCs in each of the four major areas in which the chemicals
are used, said Archie W. Dunham, a Du Pont group vice president. He
made the announcement Sunday at an international conference on ozone
protection in London and a summary of his remarks was released in
the United States.
   The 120-nation conference has focused attention on the chemical
compounds that scientists say are destroying the ozone shield that
protects the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   The compounds are blamed for creating an ozone hole roughly the
size of the continental United States over the Antarctic every
winter. A smaller hole has also been spotted over the Arctic.
   One of Du Pont's long-term cleaning agent substitutes is a
fluorocarbon-based blend that has about 90 percent less ozone
depletion potential. Laboratory tests show it might be a superior
cleaning agent in removing residue from wiring assemblies in the
electronics industry.
   The other candidate contains a mixture of solvents and
surface-active agents and it is designed to remove residue in a
process using a final water rinse. It has no potential to deplete
the ozone layer.
   Du Pont has applied for patents on both blends and limited
quantities of each are available for evaluation.
   The company said that depending on market reaction and further
testing, the fluorocarbon-based product could be ready for
commercial use in several years and the other product could be ready
by the end of this year.
   Du Pont plans to introduce a series of product alternatives to
CFCs over a three-year to five-year period beginning in 1990. The
company expects to phase CFCs out of several major market segments
in the early to mid-1990s, but complete phaseout may take until the
turn of the century.
   The company said it has spent or authorized nearly $100 million
on developing substitutes for CFCs and plans to spend $45 million
more this year. An investment of more than $1 billion would be
needed to completely restructure its U.S. CFC business to produce
alternative products, Du Pont said.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
except the British pound and Canadian dollar in choppy trading
Monday.
   Gold prices rose in domestic trading following a mixed
performance overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $387.30 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, $1 higher
than Friday's late bid.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the New York office of
Banco di Sicilia, said the dollar benefited from improvements in the
stock and bond markets and rising oil prices.
   Snowy weather in New York Monday kept some dealers away and
persuaded others to end their business days early, which made for a
thin market, Glamuzina said. In a thin market, individual trades can
have an exaggerated impact on prices.
   European dealers said the market lacked much incentive to do
anything other than explore the dollar's recent ranges. They said
the market may get direction from a Labor Department due Friday on
February's unemployment situation, which will provide the first
indication of last month's economic activity.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7210 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7240 late Friday. Later in
New York, however, sterling strengthened a bit and a pound cost
$1.72335, up from $1.72025 Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar dropped 0.49 Japanese yen to a closing 127.63 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 128.80 yen and at 129.15 late in New
York's day, up from 127.815 late on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
levels, included: 1.85275 West German marks, up from 1.8437; 1.58575
Swiss francs, up from 1.57515; 1.19235 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19505; 6.29725 French francs, up from 6.2645; and, 1,362.125
Italian lire, up from 1,358.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates,
included: 1.8531 West German marks, up from 1.8415; 1.5830 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5765; 6.2955 French francs, up from 6.2600; 2.0855
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0770; 1,359.25 Italian lire, up from
1,358.75; and 1.1928 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1935.
   Gold and silver prices were mixed.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $388 a troy ounce, up from Friday's $386.60.
   Gold finished in London at a late bid price of $386.25 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid. In Zurich, gold closed at a
late bid $386.25, down slightly from $386.30 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.36 an ounce to close at a bid
$387.80.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market, where silver
traded at a late bid price of $5.81 a troy ounce, compared with
$5.82 late Friday.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.809 a troy ounce, compared with Friday's settlement of $5.801.

<HEAD>Continental Employees Unsympathetic to Strikers at Sister Airline</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines employees showed little
sympathy Monday for the walkout at Eastern, saying many of them earn
less money than the strikers at the troubled sister carrier.
   Pilots for Continental, itself the target of wage cuts and job
actions during a tumultuous 1983 reorganization under Texas Air
Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, predict their Eastern counterparts
will suffer for honoring picket lines. Texas Air owns both airlines.
   ``My personal opinion is that the pilots _ or for that matter
anyone else _ should not have gone out on strike. I think they're
going to lose their jobs and they're probably going to lose the
airline,'' said one pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``I think Frank Lorenzo's going to shut that thing (Eastern) down
and either sell parts of it or bankrupt it,'' he said, adding that
Eastern pilots he talked to in advance of the strike had hoped to
keep flying. ``I don't see how they can continue.''
   Of more than a dozen Continental employees interviewed, none
expressed misgivings about aiding Eastern management by accepting
additional passengers bumped from the sister carrier's flights.
   However, some Continental laborers suggested their comments were
restricted by management.
   ``It's going to be tough to try to find anyone to talk to,'' said
one worker. ``They're really cracking down on us.''
   With only four daily Eastern flights through Houston airports,
Continental workers say they have seen only a slight rise in
passengers and shipping since the strike began. Continental is based
in Houston and Eastern is in Miami.
   Despite increased security and fears that striking Eastern
workers may target Continental because of its relationship to Texas
Air, there have been no reported attempts to block Continental's
Houston operations, union and airline officials said.
   Many of the pilots, flight attendants and other workers at
Houston's Intercontinental Airport, the airline's main hub, said
they considered the labor strife unrelated to their operations, and
uncalled for when compared with salaries at Continental or in other
industries.
   Nearly all of them, however, said they hoped to see an end to the
strike and the ultimate survival of Eastern.
   ``What Lorenzo did is look at their salaries and then compare
them to salaries in the marketplace _ what those people would make
working somewhere else,'' said another Continental pilot, who asked
not to be named.
   ``Let's face it _ throwing a bag is throwing a bag no matter
where you do it,'' he said. ``This is a supply and demand business
and they're in business to make a profit. They have to answer to
their shareholders.''
   The sentiments apparently spread through the ranks at Continental
on Monday, although many employees refused to be interviewed.
   ``The problem isn't really the mechanics, it's the baggage
handlers,'' said one worker. ``They outnumber the mechanics and
they're the ones who pushed this thing, and they're making a lot of
money for what they're doing.''
   He said that his wife, a nurse, makes about $6 per hour less than
an Eastern baggage attendant who may have no advanced education.
   Teresa White, who was laid off after Continental filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1983 but later was rehired and rose to a
supervisory position, said union members at Eastern apparently
missed a valuable history lesson.
   ``I think they should have foreseen what was taking place and
know what he (Lorenzo) would do _ get rid of their jobs,'' she said
of the possible response to the strike.

<HEAD>Japan Not Obliged to Buy More U.S. Chips, Trade Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is not obliged to increase American
semiconductor manufacturers' share of this country's computer chip
market, a Japanese trade ministry official said Monday, disputing
American officials.
   ``There is no legally binding agreement except the semiconductor
agreement,'' an official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said.
   U.S. government officials have said Japan has failed to live up
to a commitment to increase the percentage of the Japanese chip
market held by American companies, while Japanese officials say they
made no such commitment. Former Commerce Department official Clyde
Prestowitz alleged last year in his book, ``Trading Places: How
America Allowed Japan to Take the Lead,'' that the Japanese
government pledged in a secret document to raise the U.S. market
share of semiconductors in Japan to 20 percent by 1991.
   In the third quarter of last year, the latest period for which
there are statistics, foreign manufacturers had 10.9 percent of
Japan's chip market, the MITI official said in an interview. The
U.S. Commerce Department says the American share rose from 9.2
percent in 1987 to 9.5 percent in 1988.
   In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japan pledged not to dump
computer chips _ selling them at less than fair market value _ in
the United States, and to increase American access to Japan's chip
market.
   Prestowitz wrote that there was a confidenial side letter in
which ``the Japanese said that they understood, welcomed and would
make efforts to assist the U.S. companies in reaching their goal of
a 20 percent market share within five years.
   ``The U.S. negotiators said that this commitment meant there
would be a guaranteed increase in the U.S. share of the Japanese
market,'' Prestowitz added.
   Japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separate
document accompanying the semiconductor agreement, but say there was
no document that holds them to increasing U.S. market share.
   ``In a sense he (Prestowitz) is wrong because there are no
legally binding documents. In fact, U.S. government statements never
admitted to the existence of such a document,'' the MITI official
said.
   ``In general there are a lot of letters of exchange between the
U.S. and Japan in any kind of trade negotiations,'' he said.
``Sometimes they're secret and sometimes they're not.''
   Asked if there was an informal agreement by the Japanese
government on a 20 percent share for U.S. chip manufacturers, the
official said, ``No comment.''
   But he added, ``Imagine if there was such a letter. It wouldn't
represent a commitment to a market share.''
   A U.S. government official who spoke on condition of anonymity
repeated Monday the American position that Japan is failing to live
up to an agreement to ensure a steady increase in U.S. market share
in Japan.
   In April 1987, Washington imposed penalty tariffs of $300 million
against Japanese electronics imports, saying Japan still was dumping
chips worldwide and had failed to live up to its market access
pledge.
   Washington reduced the penalties to $165 million two months
later, saying Japan had stopped dumping but that the access question
remained.
   Japanese manufacturers accounted for 50 percent of semiconductors
sold in the world last year, up from 48 percent in 1987, while the
American global share fell from 39 percent to 37 percent, according
to a U.S. survey.

<HEAD>Platinum Rallies On Japanese Buying, Technical Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices gained strongly Monday after a modest
rally led by Japanese jewelry makers pushed prices through key
resistance levels, triggering widespread buying.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures also advanced; copper
futures declined; energy futures gained; grains and soybeans were
mostly higher; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Platinum settled $7.40 to $8.30 higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at $546.70 a troy
ounce.
   Japanese commercial traders, who recently had been absent from
the platinum market, began buying futures early in the session,
which encouraged others to enter the market.
   The rally slowly gathered steam, then accelerated rapidly in
afternoon trading after the April contract's price surpassed $544 a
troy ounce, analysts said.
   ``We hit buy stops right over that, ran up to $548, then pulled
back,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals-market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Observers noted an easing of concern about the possibility that a
strike in the base-metals section of South Africa's Rustenburg
metals complex would spread to the platinum refinery, which
processes about half of the world's platinum.
   ``That's definitely a contributing factor but it's not as
prominent as it was last week,'' said James Steel, an analyst with
Refco Inc. in New York.
   Trading volume in precious metals futures was thin, both on the
New York Merc and on New York's Commodity Exchange, where gold and
silver futures are traded.
   Gold settled $1.10 to $1.20 higher with April at $390.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 0.8 cent higher with March at $5.809 a
troy ounce.
   Copper futures retreated on the Commodity Exchange after five
straight days of gains.
   The decline was linked to the London Metal Exchange's report of a
relatively large, 4,500-ton increase last week in its warehouse
stocks of copper, and to a 337-ton increase over the weekend in
warehouse stocks registered with the Commodity Exchange.
   Copper settled 1.4 cents to 3.1 cents lower with May at $1.42 a
pound.
   Oil futures climbed moderately higher on the New York Merc
following an International Energy Agency report showing a reduction
in OPEC crude-oil output last month.
   Meanwhile, Soviet energy officials said Monday they were willing
to extend a previously announced 5 percent cutback in crude-oil
production beyond the original 6-month deadline in a bid to help
boost prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 21 cents
higher with April at $18.67 a barrel; heating oil was .32 cent to
.63 cent higher with April at 51.43 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .06 cent to .87 cent higher with April at 51.59 cents a
gallon.
   Wheat futures made solid gains on the Chicago Board of Trade
following a weekend of drier-than-expected weather in the Great
Plains, the heart of the winter-wheat country.
   Wheat also was supported by reports that China was seeking to buy
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 7{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1{
cents higher with March at $2.79} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4\
cents higher with March at $2.09} a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents
to 8{ cents higher with March at $7.70{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures settled mixed in lackluster trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Frozen pork bellies finished sharply
higher, erasing about half the losses sustained in last Friday's
steep sell-off.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with April at
77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .43 cent lower
with March at 82.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to
.52 cent higher with April at 43.87 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.85 cent lower to 1.38 cent higher with March at 38.95
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   The cost of living outrageously well leapt 8.7
percent in 1988, and Petrossian beluga caviar led the way with an
increase of more than 41 percent, according to survey released
Monday.
   A survey commissioned by Moet &amp; Chandon champagne tracked the
cost of a dozen luxury items and services in New York City, and
found they went up in price at twice the 4.4 percent rate of the
government's Consumer Price Index.
   A round-trip ticket on the Air France Concorde from New York to
Paris cost $4,876, up 10.2 percent from $4,424 in 1987. A
Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible cost $205,500, up 12 percent from
$183,500; the caviar cost $47, up from $33.25; a bottle of Hennessy
X.O. cognac cost $78.95, up 7 percent from $73.79, while a bottle of
Dom Perignon cost $69.97, up 8.5 percent from $64.50; and a men's
Rolex Oyster perpetual day-date watch with President bracelet could
be had for $11,700, 12 percent more than last year's $10,450.
   Some items registered price increases that were near or lower
than the overall CPI increase: a ticket to ``Cats,'' $50, up 5.3
percent from last year's $47.50; a wash, cut and blow dry in one of
New York's more exclusive salons cost $70, up 4.5 percent from $67;
and a full-length mink, $17,000, up $500 or 3 percent from last
year's $16,500.
   The prics of three items remained unchanged: a one-hour limousine
rental at $40, a pound of imported chocolate truffles at $36, and
maid service for a day, at $88.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co., acquired by Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC for $5.68 billion two months ago, announced plans
Monday to lay off 550 of the company's 2,350 employees in its
Minneapolis headquarters.
   An ``overlap of functions'' since the food and restaurant company
was acquired by Grand Met was cited as a reason for the
across-the-board layoffs, and one analyst expressed surprise about
the amount of fat on the Doughboy.
   ``These guys (Grand Met) are obviously looking to become low-cost
producers,'' said Craig Carver, an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.
   The layoffs over the next several weeks will leave Pillsbury with
about 1,800 employees in Minneapolis and 100,000 worldwide.
   ``The decision to eliminate these positions was necessary to make
Pillsbury a stronger, more profitable company, prepared to compete
successfully in the world marketplace,'' Ian A. Martin, chairman and
chief executive officer of Pillsbury and head of Grand
Metropolitan's worldwide foods group, said in a statement.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said the layoffs affect all job
classifications, from clerical support employees to managerial and
staff-level functions.
   Last month, Pillsbury announced the closing of two plants, in
Grand Forks, N.D., and Joplin, Mo., which will result in 334
layoffs. The shutdowns, effective the end of March, are because of
surplus production capacity resulting from acquisitions and were in
the works before the takeover.
   After a three-month fight, Pillsbury in December agreed to accept
a sweetened $5.68 billion takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan.
The acquisition was completed in January.
   Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling
conglomerate. Its U.S. holdings include Alpo dog food and Pearle
Vision Centers.
   Pillsbury makes Pillsbury flour, Green Giant vegetables, Haagen
Dazs ice cream and a variety of other products. Pillsbury also owns
the Burger King, Bennigan's and Steak &amp; Ale restaurant chains.
   Grand Met reported sales of more than $11 billion in fiscal 1988.
Pillsbury had sales of $6.2 billion.

<HEAD>Exxon Chairman Might Accept Gas Tax Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said Monday
he might be willing to accept a gasoline tax increase of 5 cents a
gallon if the money was used to repair aging roads and bridges.
   ``There's a lot of money needed for infrastructure,'' Rawl said.
``The U.S. highway system needs a great deal of work done on it.''
   Rawl spoke at a news conference preceding an Economic Club of
Detroit luncheon.
   Rawl said he disagreed with proposals that would use the
increased tax receipts for uses other than roads and bridges. ``A
large increase in the fuel tax is not an easy option for fiscal
relief,'' he said later in his formal address.
   On another matter, Rawl said Exxon expects stable crude oil
prices in the coming year with no marked increases for more than two
years.
   Rawl predicted that the price of North Sea Brent crude oil will
average $15 to $17 a barrel this year, with West Texas Intermediate
crude about $1 a barrel more.
   The predictions represent no change from the current price of
$16.50 for Brent crude and slightly over $18 for West Texas
Intermediate.
   ``After two or three years, we see some growth in prices,'' Rawl
told reporters.
   The Exxon chief executive officer said he wouldn't dispute
predictions of $25- to $30-a-barrel prices by 2000. But he said, ``I
wouldn't bet a nickel on it either.''
   Rawl said he didn't know how long the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' December agreement to limit the countries'
total production to 18.5 million barrels a day would last.
   Such agreements ``all hold up for a while,'' he said.
   He refused to forecast Exxon's earnings for the year, but said
they would depend heavily on crude oil prices.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Seeks Journalism Charter Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. on Monday asked its shareholders
to adopt a charter amendment requiring 80 percent shareholder
approval for any merger or sale that might threaten its newspapers'
journalistic goals.
   The ``super-majority'' would also apply to any merger putting
more than 20 percent of the company under foreign ownership.
   ``Our board believes the company's newspapers serve a unique and
vital public interest in our society,'' said James K. Batten,
president and chief executive officer of Knight-Ridder. ``The
proposed charter amendment is directed at preserving their
journalistic excellence, integrity and independence ....''
   He said the company's newspapers have won 50 Pulitzer prizes,
including 22 in the past four years.
   The proposal is to be voted on at Knight-Ridder's April 28 annual
meeting.
   Batten said he was not aware of any threatened or rumored
takeover effort against Knight-Ridder, which owns 30 newspapers. He
noted that more than half of the company's shares are in the hands
of the current directors, officers, employees and members of the
founding families.
   The ``super-majority,'' as management called it, would be avoided
only if the board studied the merger or buyout plan, and determined
it did not threaten the company's journalistic mission,
Knight-Ridder said.
   The company wants to extend the rule to cases involving foreign
ownership, noting that ``restriction on foreign ownership of our
country's media are not uncommon.''
   The proxy statement says that federal law already prohibits
foreign ownership of more than 20 percent of the stock of any
licensee of any broadcast station.

   Lotus Development Corp. announced Monday
that a federal judge has dismissed all claims made by SAPC Inc.
against Lotus and its founder, Mitchell D. Kapor.
   In November, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton dismissed
SAPC's claim of copyright infringement, ruling that SAPC gave up its
right to sue when it sold most of its assets to Lotus in 1985.
   Keeton dismissed all remaining charges against Lotus and Kapor
last Wednesday. Those claims included charges of breach of contract,
misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential secrets and
unjust enrichment.
   SAPC's motion for an immediate appeal was denied. A hearing has
been scheduled for March 29 to consider whether to proceed with
Lotus counterclaims seeking full compensation for expenses related
to the suit.
   SAPC's telephone number at its Cambridge headquarters was
disconnected. A spokesman for Lotus said SAPC was still incorporated
but was not doing business.

Machinists union strike:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OPERATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern shut down nearly all operations and laid off 5,000
workers, saying it could not maintain its business while pilots
honored the Machinists' walkout. The airline said it would retain
its most profitable routes _ the Northeast shuttle and three flights
weekly between Miami and Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago,
Chile.
   Using managers and workers who crossed picket lines, Eastern
managed to fly about one-third of its 62 shuttle flights between New
York and Boston and Washington. Snow in New York hampered service
further. Supervisors de-iced planes, loaded baggage and worked as
flight attendants. Planes that did leave were delayed by up to five
hours. Few non-shuttle flights made it into the air.

pilots. The airline said the pilots' walkout was illegal and asked
U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis to force them back to work.
   The pilots, who argue they are not striking but merely honoring
Machinists' picket lines, said they were studying the management
motion and were not surprised by it.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell blamed the pilots for the
shutdown. ``The pilots are conducting their own economic strike
against the company,'' he said. The 41,000-member Air Line Pilots
Association reiterated a pledge to begin a job action at dawn
Tuesday that could delay every flight in the country.

<NOTE>PICKETS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Machinists and supporters picketed Eastern terminals. No problems
were reported Monday. The Machinists' strike was joined by most
Eastern flight attendants and pilots.
   In New York, former Screen Actors Guild president Ed Asner joined
picketers, calling Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo one of the
``corporate raiders who take what they can get and leave behind the
desiccated hulls of the companies.''
   In Atlanta, the Rev. Jesse Jackson urged Eastern to give
employees a chance to buy the failing airline and try to save it
from bankruptcy. ``If Lorenzo can't fly it, let the workers buy
it,'' he said.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporary
restraining order Monday against secondary picketing at Amtrak.
   The judge on Sunday issued a similar order against three major
rail lines that carry 320,000 commuters daily between New York City
and New Jersey, Long Island and northern suburbs.
   Nine other commuter railroads nationwide and Amtrak had been
potential targets of sympathy actions. But the Machinists union said
it decided to appeal Patterson's orders and did not set up picket
lines at railroads Monday. A hearing was scheduled on both rulings
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Twelve Disagree On Strategy To Promote High-Definition TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 12 European Economic Community
countries could not agree Monday on a strategy to defend their
high-definition television system and have it adopted worldwide.
   The EEC's ministers of industry differed on the role to be given
to the executive European Commission in promoting the European HDTV
system. A single world system will be adopted next year by the
International Consultative Council of Radiocommunications.
   The ministers were scheduled to agree on a declaration asking for
the adoption of their system worldwide and setting up a special body
to coordinate the action of their governments, the commission and TV
equipment industries.
   Some countries wanted to give the commission a leading role in
the strategy, while West Germany and the Netherlands balked at
handing too much power to the executive.
   HDTV should make TV films as sharp as movies, allowing projection
of the same films on either screen.
   The issue was pased to the EEC's ministers of telecommunications,
who will meet in Luxembourg next month.

   A buyout specialist Monday offered to buy Ohio
Mattress Co., the world's largest bedding maker and producer of
Sealy Posturepedic and Stearns &amp; Foster mattresses, in a deal
valuing the company at nearly $1 billion.
   ``This is a great day for all our stockholders,'' said Ernest M.
Wuliger, chairman and chief executive of Ohio Mattress, which
announced Nov. 18 that it had hired an investment banking firm to
review a possible sale.
   Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, with offices in New York and Los
Angeles, said it was offering $25.50 in cash for 96 percent, or 36.9
million, of Ohio Mattress' shares. The remaining shares would be
exchanged later for shares in the new company.
   The tender offer alone would cost $940 million. The value of the
whole company implied by the price of $25.50 a share is $980
million. The tender offer is dependent on obtaining at least 51
percent of Ohio Mattress' shares.
   The stock jumped $2.87{ a share to $24.62{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Harvey Katz, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in
New York, said the news of the bid was ``no big surprise'' given the
Ohio Mattress announcement last fall that it was reviewing its
possible sale options.
   ``The price being offered would seem to be a done deal and
reasonably close to full value,'' Katz said.
   He said it was unlikely Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen would
attempt to sell off much of Ohio Mattress to pay off the takeover
debt, noting that most of the company's operations reflected its
core bedding business. Any non-bedding operations would be
relatively small, he said.
   E. Stephen Benson, a partner in the investment firm, said the
firm was attracted to Ohio Mattress by its market share, its
opportunity for international growth and plans for direct home
delivery by Ohio Mattress of products sold by retailers.
   ``We think we can run the company more efficiently,'' Benson said
by phone from New York.
   Europe's largest bedding manufacturer, Madrid-based F.L. Betere
S.A. (The Flex Group), plans to take a minority participation role
in the new company, according to Benson. The percentage ownership it
will have was not disclosed.
   ``We believe such an international strategic alliance, coupled
with domestic opportunities we see for the company to develop its
`home delivery business,' as one example, will enable management to
generate an accelerated and even more profitable rate of growth in
the years ahead,'' Benson said.
   Ohio Mattress said it received six acquisition offers last
Wednesday, three of which were subsequently improved. The other
bidders were not disclosed.
   ``The (Gibbons, Green) offer was selected by Ohio Mattress' board
following its determination that the offer represented the best
available transaction for the Ohio Mattress stockholders,'' the
company said in a statement.
   The tender offer is expected to begin Friday, Ohio Mattress said.
   Gibbons, Green said it has financing commitments from the First
National Bank of Chicago. The entire offer will be financed with
funds from First National Bank of Chicago and its own equity funds,
Gibbons, Green said.
   Wuliger said he had been asked by Gibbons, Green to remain as
chairman and become an investor in the subsidiary company.
   For the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, Ohio Mattress had sales of
$661.5 million and profits of $33.2 million. Ohio Mattress has 5,555
employees at locations around the nation, Wuliger said.
   The acquisition would be the 29th by Gibbons, Green, which was
founded in 1969 and acts as general partner in three equity buyout
funds on behalf of banks, insurance companies, pension funds and
university endowments. Its previous acquisitions include Coca-Cola
Bottling of New York, Purex, Ekco Housewares, Rival Manufacturing
and Budget Rent-a-Car.

<TEXT>
   SPX Corp., an automotive supply company,
on Monday announced a restructuring designed to help it concentrate
in the automobile parts and specialized tool markets.
   SPX said it was forming a limited partnership among four of its
original-equipment divisions, an investment banking firm and a
management team, and setting up an employee stock ownership plan.
   The new partnership, called Sealed Power Technologies Ltd., will
combine the Sealed Power, Hy-Lift, Contech and Filtran
original-equipment divisions of SPX.
   SPX and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. each will hold 49 percent of the
partnership's stock with the remaining 2 percent held by the
management team, SPX spokesman John Tyson said.
   Also as part of the restructuring, SPX said it would issue a
one-time, $13-per-share dividend to SPX shareholders and sell five
small businesses outright. Tyson declined to identify those
businesses other than to say some were in the automotive field.
   SPX Chairman Robert Tuttle said the partnership will be the
world's largest maker of piston rings and transmission fluid
filters, used in assembling automobiles. The four divisions which
will make up Sealed Power Technologies had $357 million in sales
last year.
   In addition to piston rings and filters, SPX makes special tools
and electronic diagnostics products used after an automobile is
sold. Last year, the corporation earned $44.9 million on sales of
$877.7 million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' roughly $400 million in cash
will drain fast because the strikebound carrier must pay competitors
to fly waylaid passengers and it's facing a $70 million debt
repayment within weeks, a leading debt-rating agency said Monday.
   ``The strike poses a serious threat to Eastern's survival, and
management may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcy
protection if more pilots don't return to work soon,'' Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said in a bulletin about the finances of the
Miami-based airline.
   Eastern was struck by its Machinists union Saturday and pilots
and flight attendants have been honoring picket lines.
   S&amp;P said the airline began the year with $402 million in cash but
the reserve fell slightly in January and February because of
operating losses. Eastern has said it is losing about $1 million a
day.
   ``Refunds and payments to other airlines flying passengers
ticketed to Eastern will dissipate most of its cash reserves within
several weeks,'' S&amp;P's bulletin said.
   Under so-called interline agreements among airlines, passengers
ticketed on Eastern may use their tickets on competitors, which get
a reimbursement from the airline later. Eastern has been forced to
transfer thousands of passengers from canceled or delayed flights to
seats on other airlines.
   S&amp;P also said Eastern may have to repay $70 million worth of
unspecified secured debt at the end of March. Secured debt is a loan
backed by assets of the borrower, which in Eastern's case could
include aircraft.

   Companies based in Great Britain were by far the
largest purchasers of U.S. companies in 1988, according to a survey
released Monday by an international accounting and management
consulting firm.
   British companies bought 420 U.S. companies last year in deals
valued at $32.7 billion, according to the survey by KPMG Peat
Marwick.
   At the same time, U.S. companies spent $4.02 billion buying 71
British companies _ the greatest amount of money spent by U.S. firms
in buyouts in any one country.
   A total of 729 U.S. companies were sold last year to foreign
interests in deals valued at $71.98 billion, KPMG said.
   After British firms, the second-largest purchaser of U.S.
companies last year were Canadian interests, which spent $9.6
billion for 60 companies, including the Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion
purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc.; Japanese companies,
which spent $8.4 billion for 45 U.S. firms; French firms, which
spent $7.3 billion for 41 companies; and Australian companies, which
completed 16 deals valued at $4.2 billion.
   The most-popular types of U.S. companies targeted by foreign
acquirers last year were producers of food, drink and tobacco, with
acquisitions valued at $9.7 billion; paper, printing and publishing,
$9.1 billion; retailing, $8.4 billion; and engineering products,
$8.3 billion.
   Meanwhile, U.S. companies spent $9.4 billion last year acquiring
471 foreign firms, the survey found.
   The most popular industry target for U.S. companies, rated by
value of the deals, was the oil and gas industry (20 companies
bought for $1.5 billion), leisure and entertainment (seven companies
for $1.3 billion), and electrical and electronic products (40
companies for $1.3 billion).
   The study examined 2,326 cross-border transactions involving
buyers based in 37 countries making acquisitions valued at $118.4
billion in 42 nations.
   While 17 of the transactions had a value of $1 billion or more
each, about 91 percent of the deals were found in the middle market,
where the price was below $100 million or not even disclosed, KPMG
said.

   Entertainment and communications issues set the
pace as the stock market staged a broad advance Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.53 points to
2,294.82.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by better than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
995 up, 475 down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.88 million
shares, up from 151.79 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 200.72 million shares.
   The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement
between Time Inc. and Warner Communications.
   Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that
other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might
be candidates for mergers or takeovers.
   Warner stock led the active list and jumped 2] to 48\, while
Time's shares dropped 1| to 107{. Analysts said Time's decline in
part reflected disappointment among traders who had been reckoning
that the company might itself have become a takeover candidate at a
higher price.
   Chris-Craft Industries, which owns a 17 percent interest in
Warner, gained 3} to 33{.
   Elsewhere in the communications and entertainment group, Gulf &amp;
Western rose 2{ to 45~; MCA 2[ to 53; Walt Disney 1\ to 77|; Orion
Pictures 1[ to 16~, and Columbia Pictures Entertainment 1 to 18].
   Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly
report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of
economic growth.
   That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation
outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest
rates.
   The news got a warm welcome in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose as much as $5 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   Ohio Mattress gained 2~ to 24|. The company agreed to a
$25.50-a-share buyout by the investment firm of Gibbons, Green, Van
Amerongen.
   Shaklee, subject of a $40-a-share bid from a group led by invest
Irwin Jacobs, rose 4} to 38}.
   Takeover rumors and speculation prompted gains in such other
issues as Longview Fibre, up 4} at 68|, and Reebok International, up
| at 14\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $28.32 billion, or 0.98
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.73 to 165.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.04 to 340.39, and S&amp;P's

<HEAD>Eastern Shutdown, Air Slowdown Show Power of Pilots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-month labor dispute at Eastern Airlines, capped
by the virtual shutdown of the strike-torn carrier Monday, displays
the power of pilots over their employers.
   The decision by most of the 3,600 Eastern pilots to join the
working-class Machinists' strike dealt a crushing blow to Eastern
after a long history of financial losses and labor-management
tensions.
   And ``pilot power'' is poised to expand its reach Tuesday, when
pilots across the country planned a job action that could delay
every flight on every major airline.
   Eastern on day three of the strike said it was shutting down
nearly all operations and idling 5,000 to 6,000 workers. The company
was quick to blame the pilots, saying it could not afford to
continue operating because they had honored the Machinists' picket
lines.
   ``The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the
company,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.
   Why did Eastern pilots, who earn an average $80,000 a year, cast
their lot with mechanics and baggage handlers who make about $19 and
$15 an hour respectively?
   ``The older pilots don't have a chance to go to another
airline,'' said Gordon Lane, an Eastern pilot. ``We're going to lose
our profession.''
   ``The fact that we're out here (picketing) is Frank Lorenzo,
period,'' said Lane, 47, who has flown for Eastern for 22 years.
   Lorenzo, who controls Eastern through parent Texas Air Corp., has
been a lightning rod for the pilots' anger. He is widely mistrusted
by pilots and other Eastern workers because of what they call his
triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier Continental
Airlines.
   They also accuse Lorenzo of diverting precious Eastern assets to
Continental.
   The Eastern pilots have been torn between their dislike for
Lorenzo and reluctance to quit the airline and sacrifice years of
seniority.
   A shortage of pilots nationwide means they could easily find jobs
at other airlines, but they would have to relinquish seniority and
accept lower pay and benefits, said Kit Darby, executive vice
president of Future Aviation Professionals of America in Atlanta.
   ``The job market (for pilots) is extremely good,'' Darby said,
noting that the airline pilots earn an average $82,500 a year plus
substantial benefits.
   Eastern had said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying during
the strike, but the pilots union put the number at 88. Eastern has
operated only a fraction of its customary 1,040 daily flights during
the strike.
   Air Line Pilots Association President Henry Duffy has asked all
pilots nationwide to strictly follow aviation rules Tuesday ``to
ensure the safety of the (air traffic) system,'' which he said had
been weakened by the Eastern disruptions.
   Duffy said the action would slow air traffic, but insisted that
was not the intent.
   ``We expect a very good response from pilots at all carriers,''
ALPA spokesman John Mazor said. ``Pilots are going to recognize that
there are problems generated out of the Eastern strike that have a
ripple effect throughout the system.''
   Delta Air Lines pilots prepared to join the slowdown, and pilots
at United Airlines also expressed support.

   A federal judge has ruled in favor of a

may protect software manufacturers against what is called the ``look

   The judge, in Bridgeport, Conn., ruled recently that three
competitors infringed on the copyright of the Costimator program
made by Manufacturers Technologies Inc. of West Springfield.
   The Costimator helps users to estimate the time and cost of
manufacturing parts.
   The competitors did not copy the mechanics of the Costimator

   The ruling was made in late January, but Manufacturers

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Fined $5.5 Million For Defense Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. was fined $5.5
million Monday for double-billing the Pentagon on a navigation
satellite.
   The company, which pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of
court in the case but maintained it was innocent, vowed to appeal
the U.S. District Court fine.
   The El Segundo-based aerospace and manufacturing company was
fined $500,000 for an alleged conspircy among some of its managers
to double bill the Air Force by approximately $450,000 on the
NAVSTAR navigation satellite system between 1982 and 1984.
   U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall ordered a $5 million fine
for a contempt of court charge brought against Rockwell because the
terms of settlement of an earlier, unrelated case barred the company
from fraudulent billing. The fine for contempt of court is unlimited.
   Rockwell also was sentenced to five years' probation.
   The company's attorney, James Neal, vowed to appeal the fine.
   On Jan. 19, Rockwell entered a conditional plea of guilty to the
charges in an agreement with prosecutors under which a number of
related charges were dismissed.
   The conditional plea was based on the company's appeal of an
early ruling in the case to a higher court. If that appeal were to
succeed, the company hoped to have its guilty plea erased from the
record.
   Neal maintained the fraud was perpetrated by division managers
without the knowledge or consent of upper management.
   In the earlier ruling, the judge rejected a company motion to
throw the case out of court on grounds that Rockwell had reported
the fraud under provisions of a Pentagon program intended to
encourage defense contractors to report dishonesty.
   Since it entered its plea, Rockwell has engaged in a public
relations campaign portraying itself as a victim of overzealous
prosecution, and maintaining that the example of Rockwell's case
would deter other defense contractors from reporting fraud under the
Pentagon's voluntary disclosure program.
   Federal prosecutors maintain that Rockwell didn't report the
fraud until after auditors were on the trail.
   The case involves billing for repairs to the satellite's radio
gear performed by a subcontractor, ITT Corp.'s defense
communications division. ITT wasn't a defendant.
   A Rockwell manager, Robert Zavodnik, 47, has pleaded guilty to
lying to the government and conspiracy in the case. His supervisor,
Donald Carter, 60, was acquitted of the same charges by a federal
jury.
