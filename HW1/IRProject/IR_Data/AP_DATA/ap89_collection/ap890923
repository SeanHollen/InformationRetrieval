<HEAD>Senator Wants Supreme Court to Take Over Impeachment Trials</HEAD>

   Lawmakers who have been tied up by the
impeachment trials of three federal judges in as many years are
calling for a change in the Constitution to hand such trials to the
Supreme Court.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., chairman of the 12-member trial
committee that heard the case of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon
earlier this month, said Friday that he would propose a
constitutional amendment to relieve Congress of its impeachment
duties.
   ``They ought to be the ultimate triers of fact,'' Fowler said of
the Supreme Court justices.
   ``They are the most qualified. They have the constitutional
perspective on both the protections and sensitivity of federal
judgeships,'' he said.
   He said the justices also have more time for the lengthy process
required to remove judges from the federal bench.
   The amendment would pertain only to the federal judiciary,
leaving the trial of other public officials impeached by the House
to the Senate, said Fowler, who said he would sponsor the proposal
with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   An impeachment voted by the House serves as an indictment for
trial before the Senate. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required
to then remove an official from office and disqualify the person
from holding other federal office.
   There only have been 15 impeachments by the House sent to the
Senate for trial in the 200-year history of the Congress, but three
of them have been in the last three years and all of the last three
were federal judges.
   Fowler said he spent all of August studying the Nixon case prior
to the four-day trial before his special 12-member committee earlier
this month. The full Senate is expected to take no less than two
days to hear the case, debate and vote.
   Senate hearings in the impeachment case against U.S. District
Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida took four weeks last summer and are
awaiting action by the full Senate.
   The impeachment and trial of U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne
in 1986 took the committee 10 days to hear and the full Senate 18
hours to consider before voting to remove Claiborne from office.
According to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who was majority leader at the
time, the Senate floor proceedings took more time than all but a
handful of major issues before the 98th Congress.
   Under the Constitution, the federal judges are appointed for life
and can be removed from office only by voluntary resignation, death
or trial by Congress.
   Fowler's plan for a constitutional amendment is not the first
call for a change in the discipline of federal judges.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the administration
of justice, has proposed strengthening federal laws governing the
judges and setting up a commission to study the impeachment process.

<HEAD>President Defends Arranged Crack Sale for Drug Speech</HEAD>

   President Bush says it doesn't really matter
that a drug dealer was coaxed into selling crack cocaine near the
White House _ just so the president could tell the American people
that's where the sale took place.
   ``The man went there and sold drugs in front of the White House,
didn't he?'' the president told reporters in Maine on Friday.
``That's the bottom line. That's what the man did.''
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, and the Drug
Enforcement Administration concede the drug dealer was maneuvered
into making a previously arranged sale in Lafayette Park, across the
street from the White House.
   The president displayed the cocaine in a see-through plastic bag
in his nationally televised drug strategy speech on Sept. 5. He told
the audience the crack had been ``seized a few days ago in a park
across the street from the White House.''
   A Democratic senator from Louisiana, John Breaux, criticized the
president's use of the prop as ``staged.''
   ``Is this really a drug war, or is this theatrics and
screenplay?'' he asked. ``We don't need the president to lure drug
pushers to Lafayette Park for photo opportunities.''
   And a reporter suggested to the president that the transaction
wouldn't have taken place in the park had the cocaine not been
needed for the speech.
   ``The message I get out of it (is) a man was busted in front of
the White House and I cannot feel sorry for him,'' Bush said. ``He
ought not to be out peddling these insidious drugs. It's ruining the
children of this country.''
   The president said he'd asked for a drug sample ``from that
vicinity to show it can happen anywhere ... and that's what they
gave me. And they told me where they caught this guy.''
   Bush spoke as if the suspected dealer, a teenager, had been
arrested. Although the transaction with an undercover DEA agent was
photographed, the dealer was not taken into custody, agents said,
because they hoped he would sell a larger amount later and identify
his organization.
   A planned arrest earlier this week fell through when the suspect
did not show up, and agents hope to obtain indictments against him.
   Asked if the American people were manipulated into thinking drugs
were being sold near the White House, Bush replied: ``What do you
mean it didn't really (happen)? The guy was arrested or grabbed for
selling drugs in front of the White House. It didn't exist? It
didn't happen?''
   On every drug bust, Bush said, ``You bring somebody someplace.''
   Bush became irritated with reporters' questions, gesturing toward
the press at one point and saying, ``I don't understand. Are these
advocates here for this drug guy?''
   But while Bush and Fitzwater defended the arrangement, another
senior White House official suggested the Drug Enforcement
Administration had been ``a little overzealous.''
   ``We told them that if a buy could be made near the White House,
so much the better. They took us literally,'' said the official,
asking not to be identified.

<HEAD>Congressman Apologizes for Dealing With Prostitute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank is offering an apology to
political supporters and assuring them that ``my judgment has
improved'' since his involvement with a male prostitute.
   ``I made some serious mistakes in judgment several years ago.
What I did was wrong,'' the Massachusetts Democrat, said in a letter
mailed Friday to home-state supporters and volunteers in his
previous campaigns for Congress.
   ``It did not affect my public decisions or any public business,''
Frank wrote. ``But I regret that some of my past personal actions
are troubling to people who placed their confidence in me.''
   Frank also drew some Republican support Friday for his decision
not to resign while awaiting an inquiry by the House ethics
committee into his 18-month relationship with Stephen L. Gobie.
   ``He deserves a fair hearing,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, the House Republican whip.
   Gingrich, who is under investigation by the ethics committee over
his personal finances in a book deal, told reporters it was
appropriate for Frank to await the panel's findings.
   Frank is a five-term congressman and outspoken liberal who was
re-elected overwhelmingly in 1988 after disclosing the year before
that he is homosexual.
   Gobie has charged he operated a prostitution ring out of Frank's
Capitol Hill apartment. Frank has acknowledged paying Gobie for sex
and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver, but says he
threw Gobie out when he learned of the prostitution operation. That
was shortly before Frank publicly disclosed he is homosexual.
   Frank, in his letter, said the pressure of hiding his
homosexuality while maintaining a political life led him to deal
with the prostitute.
   ``Dealing with being gay, while continuing to meet my public
obligations, created tremendous internal pressures,'' Frank wrote.
``Those pressures ended when I spoke publicly about my own personal
identity. Not coincidentally, my judgment has improved since then.''
   Frank said that as a result of being in public life, ``I cannot
be surprised that my mistakes in personal judgment of several years
ago have now become public knowledge.'' But he said that ``some
highly sensationalized stories'' about the matter have included
``substantial untruths.''
   ``It was to end any question about what is the truth that I asked
the ethics committee of the United States Congress to consider this
entire matter,'' he wrote. ``I need hardly tell you that this
committee will have my full cooperation. Meanwhile, I hope you will
accept my apology.''
   Aides to Frank said the letter was widely distributed to veteran
supporters, and was not mailed at government expense.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's choice to lead the National
Endowment for the Arts says a measure by Sen. Jesse Helms to stop
federal funding of sexually explicit or blasphemous art would
cripple the government's role in promoting artistic excellence.
   ``Making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult
under the Helms amendment,'' John E. Frohnmayer told a Senate
committee considering his nomination.
   ``I think we need freedom ... and tolerance ... for art to
flourish,'' the Portland, Ore., lawyer told the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee on Friday.
   The arts agency is at the center of a political storm resulting
from the use of federal money in exhibits that included works by
artists Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. Mapplethorpe's
photographs depict explicit homosexual acts and Serrano displayed a
work showing a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine.
   The Senate in July adopted an amendment by Helms, R-N.C., that
would prohibit the agency from using any of its $170 million in
annual appropriations to promote, distribute or produce ``obscene
and indecent materials'' or art that denigrates the beliefs of any
religion.
   The House voted against Helms' measure 264-153 last week after
endowment defenders complained it would establish a broad pattern of
censorship that would destroy the agency's credibility in the arts
community.
   The endowment uses panels of experts to award subsidies each year
to artists.
   ``I do not believe in funding obscene art,'' Frohnmayer said.
But, he added, ``I would certainly hate to see the whole structure
change because of some grants which are controversial.''
   A one-time divinity student with a graduate degree in Christian
ethics from the University of Chicago, Frohnmayer encountered no
opposition to his confirmation from members of the Senate committee.
   If approved by the full Senate, he would replace Hugh Southern,
who has been named general manager of the New York Metropolitan
Opera.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Suggests Stronger Warnings on Sleep-Drug Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal advisory committee says the world's
leading sleep medication, Halcion, may put users at greater risk of
temporary amnesia than other drugs of its kind.
   The Food and Drug Administration panel recommended Friday that
the warning be added to Halcion's label and that stronger warnings
be given to consumers and doctors about all possible side effects
for this drug and other sedative-hypnotics, which are sold only by
prescription.
   The Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee asked the FDA
to work out the language of the warnings. Paul Leber, director of
the FDA's division of neuropharmacological drug products, said it
would be at least six months before the agency would complete work
on the warnings.
   ``There's no sense of urgency on this,'' he said.
   Godfrey Grant, a spokesman for the Upjohn Co., which makes
Halcion, said the committee's review should put to rest many
concerns that have been raised about the drug.
   The recommendations resulted from the committee's review of a
``relatively high'' number of reports about side effects associated
with the use of Halcion compared with other sedative-hypnotics.
These included amnesia, anxiety, aggression and hallucinations, all
of which are included in the warning label for Halcion.
   Panel members said the high number of reactions reported may be
overstated, since incomplete data on incidents was collected and it
can be used only as a broad indicator.
   ``Given the limitations of the information, we did not sense
there was a special problem'' of side effects with Halcion, said Dr.
Daniel E. Casey, panel chairman and chief of psychiatric research
and psychopharmacology at the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Portland, Ore.
   Halcion was approved for sale in the United States in 1983 and
about 43 million prescriptions of the drug have been written since
then. The FDA has received 1,693 reports of adverse side effects
possibly associated with its use, ranging from amnesia to death,
said Charles Anello, deputy director of the FDA's office of
epidemiology and biostatistics.
   By comparison, 35 million prescriptions have been written for
Restoril, a sedative-hypnotic made by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.,
since 1981 and the FDA has received 266 reports of unwanted side
effects, he said.
   Officials of The Upjohn Co., which makes Halcion, said the
greater number of Halcion reports could be the result of a number of
things, including media reports about the drug. These include
reports about a Utah woman shot her mother last year after taking
Halcion. Charges against the woman were dismissed.
   Upjohn spokesman Grant said the company was ``pleased the
advisory committee has essentially come to the conclusion that there
are few if any concerns that need to be addressed.''
   Besides agreeing to recommend relabeling for Halcion for
temporary amnesia, the panel decided to address concerns for the
entire class of sleeping pills. Three drugs are included in this
class _ Halcion, Restoril and Dalmane.
   Panel members asked the FDA to ``provide material to consumers to
alert them to the possibility of side effects'' of the drugs so the
consumers could discuss them with their doctors.
   Committee members said they were concerned about ``traveler's
amnesia'' _ a temporary syndrome that can affect travelers who take
one of the drugs. They can function normally after awakening but
later won't recall their activities during this period, such as
going through Customs at the airport.
   The labels for these drugs already warn of amnesia as a possible
side effect, but the committee recommended the FDA consider adding
``traveler's amnesia'' to the labels.

<HEAD>Navy Cleaning Up ``Catastrophic'' Hurricane Damage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hugo Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force crews are beginning to clean up
``catastrophic levels of damage'' at the Charleston, S.C., Air Force
Base and sweep wreckage at other bases and military ships that were
caught in the path of Hurricane Hugo.
   No serious injuries were reported at several bases along the
eastern seaboard, the Pentagon said Friday, but two firefighters at
the Charleston base sustained minor injuries.
   A nuclear attack submarine was knocked from its moorings in the
Charleston harbor and a Navy destroyer was sideswiped by a barge
tossed in the waves whipped by the hurricane's winds.
   Hugo treated the military installations no differently from the
rest of the ravaged Carolinas, ripping apart poles with power lines
and wiping out power and communications at facilities. The
information from the Charleston base, one of the Navy's main
installations on the East Coast, was sketchy.
   ``Many roofs off, many windows out, ... most trees down,'' the
Pentagon statement said. ``Preliminary reports of catastrophic
levels of damage'' had been received.
   A few airplane hangar doors were knocked off during the storm but
the aircraft inside were not damaged, the statement said.
   The base is the home of the 437th Military Airlift Wing, and the
315th Military Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve.
   The USS Narwhal, a nuclear attack submarine that was tied up at
the Charleston Navy shipyard, broke loose from its moorings, said a
Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist.
   The crew submerged the sub as a safety precaution, he said, and
later returned to the surface without incident.
   The Pentagon statement said the USS Dewey, a guided missile
destroyer, was damaged by a barge that broke free and scraped the
side of the ship, and several small boats assigned to a submarine
squadron were sunk at the pier.
   ``Widespread flooding'' occurred and electricity has been
disrupted at the Navy base, but emergency power has been made
available at ``vital installations.'' Limited telephone service was
restored Friday, the statement said.
   The Naval Hospital was reported operating and providing
assistance to local residents, the Pentagon said.
   Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., reported ``major damage'' to its
housing area with ``many trees and power lines'' down. No injuries
occurred at the base, where the wall of the commissary caved in, the
Pentagon statement said.
   At Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C., moderate structural damage
occurred to some buildings, and only emergency generators were
providing power.
   The Army reported a ``widespread power outage and minor
flooding'' at Fort Jackson, S.C., which was directly in the path of
the hurricane. Minor damage occurred to one of the barracks, the
statement said.

   The co-pilot of the USAir jet that crashed into
the East River, killing two people, inadvertently pushed a button
that caused the 737-400 to decelerate, federal officials said Friday
after interviewing the cockpit crew.
   The pilot tried to increase the throttle manually, the plane
began to veer to the left and the pilot, feeling a vibration,
aborted the takeoff, said James Kohlstad, acting administrator of
the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Kohlstad did not specify a precise cause for Wednesday's 11:29
p.m. crash, when Flight 5050, bound for Charlotte, N.C., skidded off
the runway into the waters off LaGuardia Airport.
   ``He initiated the abort because of the drift,'' Kohlstad said.
   Kohlstad said the plane has automatic throttles that are
programmed prior to takeoff by the flight crew.
   The button that the co-pilot, Constantine Kleissaf, 29, should
have pushed would have automatically accelerated the plane to a
preset speed for takeoff, he said.
   But Kleissaf inadvertently hit the disengage button, he said. As
the plane continued down the runway, pilot Michael Martin, 36,
jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually.
   The plane started drifting to the left and ``the pilot felt and
heard a vibration which concerned him,'' Kohlstad said. A senior
flight attendant and a passenger also reported feeling the
vibration, he said.
   As the plane accelerated down the runway, Kohlstad said, the
flight crew did not call out the jet's speed to each other as is
mandatory.
   ``It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the
cockpit,'' Kohlstad said.
   The co-pilot, meanwhile, told investigators he was looking out
the front window when he realized the captain was going to abort the
flight, Kohlstad said.
   The pilot, referring to an earlier flight that day, told
officials ``the co-pilot's performance suggested that he was
obviously new,'' Kohlstad said.
   Kohlstad said it was the co-pilot's first operational takeoff on
a 737-400 following completion of flight training.
   After the crash, the pilot and co-pilot helped passengers get out
of the plane, Kohlstad said.
   The pilot took a rescue boat to the airport and then a taxi to
the Marriott Hotel, where he called his union representative, he
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration earlier Friday suspended the
flight licenses of the pilot and co-pilot because both men left the
scene after the accident and could not be questioned by
investigators, said FAA Administrator James B. Busey.
   ``For these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36
hours after an accident that took two lives and to do so with no
explanation is highly questionable,'' Busey said in a statement
issued in Washington. ``There are many questions that only they can
answer relating to public safety.''
   Both men may appeal the suspension but would need to go through a
recertification procedure to get their licenses back.
   Interviews with the flight crew indicated that the pilot ``was
not exhibiting any abnormal behavior'' before the takeoff, Kohlstad
said at a news conference Friday evening.
   Kohlstad said the co-pilot, Kleissaf, apologized for having said
the pilot, Martin, was incoherent before the takeoff.
   Kleissaf had reportedly said Martin had been acting irrationally
just before he ordered the plane's takeoff aborted. ``I regret that
I put that in those words,'' Kohlstad said Kleissaf told the
investigators.
   Both men have submitted to urine tests but the results were not
yet available, Kohlstad said.
   Kohlstad said Martin and Kleissaf were not required to remain at
the accident scene. ``They had gone through a very traumatic
experience,'' he said. ``They had helped the passengers, they wanted
to leave the scene.''
   Martin's whereabouts were unknown the day after the crash, but
NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said that was not unusual in plane
crash investigations.
   Kohlstad said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment
Thursday, which he said partially explains their absence. ``I don't
feel they've hampered the investigation,'' he said. ``It is
difficult for me to say they were stonewalling us.''
   Investigators arranged Thursday through the pilots' union and the
airline to interview the pilots, who had been subpoenaed by the FAA
but appeared before investigators voluntarily, authorities said.
   The senior flight attendant on the plane, at an emotional news
conference with three of his co-workers from Flight 5050, said both
pilots assisted in rescue efforts after the crash.
   But the attendant, Wayne Reed, 34, of Chesapeake, Va., refused to
comment on the captain's behavior except to say, ``He was assisting
me in any way he could.''
   Also Friday, the Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement
in response to what it called ``a number of erroneous news reports
and inappropriate speculations'' about the crash and Martin's
alleged irrational behavior.
   ``There was nothing unusual in the crew's performance, no federal
rules were broken and the crew has cooperated completely with the
investigation,'' the pilots' union said.
   ALPA also denied that Martin disappeared after the crash. A USAir
representative contacted Martin after the crash and told him to
check into a Marriott hotel and stay there, the union said.
   ``When he was unable to obtain a room at the Marriott, he went to
the home of another pilot to rest and recuperate,'' the union's
statement said. ``There he remained in contact with the company,
which knew his whereabouts at all times.''
   USAir spokesman Dave Shipley denied that Martin had been in
contact with any airline official. ``He did not contact us and we
did not tell him to go to the hotel,'' Shipley said.
   In another effort to determine what caused the crash,
investigators began removing pieces of the plane from the East River
on Friday morning, said Port Authority spokesman John Hughes. The
11:29 p.m. crash Wednesday cracked the plane into three pieces,
which were partly submerged.
   The New York Times reported that according to airline industry
officials, the captain had flown 737s for only two months and the
first officer was in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time.
   FAA records show Kleissaf received his commercial pilot's license
in October 1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His
FAA record is completely clean, said FAA spokesman Bob Hoppers in
Oklahoma City, Okla.
   Killed in the crash were passengers Betsy Brogan, 37, of Gray,
Tenn., a nurse and mother of a 5-year-old boy, and her
mother-in-law, Alyce Brogan, 69, of Vixton, Va. The deaths were
USAir's first in 17 years.
   The plane was delivered in January and had no history of
mechanical problems, said airline spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan.
   In June, the FAA ordered most Boeing 737-400s grounded because of
two incidents in which engines failed. Airlines were ordered to
replace certain engine parts.

   Frances Reiter can't figure out what's
offensive about the heart-shaped ``God bless this house'' sign on
the front door of her apartment, but her condominium board says it
has to go.
   Ms. Reiter, who has lived at the Fairways Riviera complex for 17
years, says she's been told to remove the sign by Monday.
   ``She is not supposed to put anything strange on her door,''
condo board member Theo Zeelander said Thursday.
   Ms. Reiter can't see what's wrong with her sign because other
residents decorate their doors with mezuzas _ Biblical inscriptions
in Hebrew meant to be hung on doorposts.
   ``Are we in America? I have every right to have that sign on my
door,'' Ms. Reiter said. ``I am a Christian. This is my religious
symbol asking God to bless my home.''
   Condo President Sidney Jacobs wouldn't explain why the
association found the sign offensive, but said it has to go.
   ``If the sign was somewhere else on another front door hidden
from view, it wouldn't matter, but her door is very close to the
condo's meeting room. A lot of people have to pass by her door, and
it's offensive to everyone,'' he said.
   Jacobs has sent a letter telling Ms. Reiter the condo association
would remove the sign if she does not. He said she was in violation
of a condo regulation that prohibits residents from decorating their
front doors.
   Ms. Reiter said she has called a lawyer and is ready to go to
court.
   ``If they pull down that sign, there will be trouble,'' she said.

   A grain elevator explosion in this
southwestern Minnesota town Friday killed two people and injured
three others, authorities said.
   The bodies of two employees of Cargill Inc., which owns the
elevator, were recovered about two hours after the 2:30 p.m.
explosion, said to a dispatcher for the Cottonwood County Sheriff's
Department.
   The dead were identified as John William Gahler, 39, and Leonard
Dunkelberger, 51, both of Bingham Lake.
   Rescue workers had to empty the 75,000-bushel bin to recover the
bodies, the sheriff's department said.
   Three people were hospitalized at Windom Hospital with minor
injuries suffered in the explosion, said nursing supervisor Carla
Mitchell. All three were in stable condition and remained under
observation Friday night, she said.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, Cargill
spokesman Garland West said. He said there was no fire, although
some materials were smoldering after the explosion.
   The sheriff's department said the entire elevator complex
sustained extensive structural damage.

<HEAD>Cable Company Offers to Blackout ``Last Temptation of Christ''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cable television company is asking its
Cinemax subscribers whether they want the cable company to blackout
the scheduled showing next month of the movie ``The Last Temptation
of Christ.''
   When the movie was released last year, many fundamentalist
religious groups objected, with mass demonstrations and picketing of
theaters where it was shown. In North Dakota, the movie was only
shown in Fargo.
   Because of that controversy, Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV sent its
1,800 Cinemax subscribers a letter saying it is considering blacking
out the five showings of the film in October.
   The company also sent subscribers a card with two boxes to check
_ a box in favor of the blackout and a box against it.
   ``As we examined it, we said it looks like a no-win situation,''
said Jay O. ``Jot'' Turner, manager of the cable company. ``If we
aired the movie there will probably be a lot of protests like last
year in the theaters. And if we censor the movie or blackout there
would be a lot of protests from people saying you shouldn't do
that.''
   Turner said he will have an announce the results of the balloting
on Wednesday.
   A spokesman for Home Box Office, parent company of Cinemax, who
asked not to be identified said he didn't want to comment on the
movie but said the company's general policy is that HBO and Cinemax
have the final say over programming. Local cable operators do not
have the right to blackout the movies, he said.
   Turner said Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV's contract allows it. ``We
do have a clause in there which says that we can make a decision if
there's some programming we feel is not proper to community
standards, we would have the right to black it out,'' he said.
   Turner said that clause is used only as a last resort and added
the cable company has never exercised that option.

   The Rolling Stones may not seem like
publicity-shy types, but they banned reporters and photographers
from a newspaper whose shutterbug snapped a few unauthorized shots
during a concert.
   The photographer from the Herald-Journal sneaked back into the
group's performance in Syracuse Thursday night and took photos after
a two-song time limit. So the photographers were banned from
Friday's concert, and Stones aide Neil Friedman said they wouldn't
be allowed back unless the newspaper's managing editor met with him.
   Managing Editor Tim Atseff took the ban in stride.
   ``Wild horses couldn't keep us from doing our job, and neither
will the promoters,'' Asteff said. ``Don't they know you can't
always get what you want? Come on, Mick, what's the big deal? It's
only rock 'n' roll. And our readers like it, too.''

   Gov. Michael Dukakis, a frequent
target of radio talk show hosts, took to the airwaves with a live
call-in show of his own.
   Broadcasting Friday from the Big E, a state fair in western
Massachusetts, the one-time presidential candidate fielded questions
about his unpopular budget cuts and a variety of social issues.
   ``You're on the air, this is Gov. Mike Dukakis,'' the Democrat
said in the first installment of a regular show on station WSPR-AM.
   In the off-the-wall category, one caller asked him to intercede
in the case of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. When a caller
accused him of lying about plans for a state prison, the unflappable
governor responded, ``You're wrong sir. I'm sorry.''
   It wasn't his first broadcast experience. In the 1970s Dukakis
hosted a public television show called ``The Advocates'' that
featured roundtable discussions of controversial issues.

   ``Roots'' author Alex Haley is working
on another book, and it may include a story about losing a childhood
friendship with a white boy who said Haley would one day have to
call him ``Mister.''
   The Pulitzer-Prize winning author told students and faculty at
Lincoln University Friday about his boyhood friend Kermit.
   Haley said he remembers spending time with Kermit climbing a
persimmon tree in Henning, Tenn., and talking about the future.
   Haley said he pulled away from the friendship when the two boys
were about 10 because Kermit told Haley, ``Pretty soon you'll have
to start calling me `Mister.'''
   Both boys knew the statement was true in the 1930s, Haley said,
but it made him so uncomfortable that in a month the friendship was
over.
   Haley said he hopes to find Kermit someday and renew the
friendship.

   Jimmy Hoffa's daughter says she doubts a
magazine article describing the alleged murder and dismemberment of
her long-missing father is true because the FBI has never given the
family such information.
   ``It's terribly gory. It's terribly upsetting to the entire
family,'' Barbara Ann Crancer said this week after reading an
advance of the article in Playboy. ``It's a shame we had to read it
in a Playboy-type magazine.''
   A federally protected witness, Donald ``Tony the Greek'' Frankos,
told Playboy that Hoffa, the former Teamster leader who disappeared
July 30, 1975, in suburban Detroit, was shot, dismembered and buried
in concrete at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
   Crancer said she assumed the FBI would have notified her family
if the agency had information such as that given to Playboy by
Frankos.
   Crancer, who is an administrative law judge for the Missouri
Division of Workers Compensation, has sued the Justice Department
for release of the FBI's file on her father. No trial date has been
set.

<TEXT>
   The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew
apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons
and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
   A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled
the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between
practice sessions on the school's parade ground.
   Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them
in serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead were
bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.
   Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English
seaside town of Deal were damaged.
   Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col.
John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all
were trained, adult musicians. They held military ranks but none had
been trained as a fighting soldier.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old
campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland,
claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International,
a Dublin news agency.
   Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Friday
that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness
against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably.
   ``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the
base,'' said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran.
   Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance
to the barracks.
   ``There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, Kent police
Chief Constable Paul Condon said.
   The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military
establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense
Ministry figures show.
   Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today
said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who
patrolled regularly inside the perimeter.
   Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and said
new measures had already been taken at the base. He did not
elaborate.
   Martin O'Neill, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
defense, said on Friday: ``Serious questions must be asked about the
penny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well put
our armed services at dreadful risk.''
   O'Neill later told British Broadcasting Corp. television the IRA
was ``prepared to take out anybody. The cowardly nature of their
attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat.''
   He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered
low risks for attacks.
   ``If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is
likely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forced
to operate,'' O'Neill added.
   ``The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they're
picking off the ones which they regard ... vulnerable.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing
while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow. She
called it a ``deeply serious outrage.''
   King visited the scene soon after the explosion.
   ``I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who
sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to
make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of
killing,'' he said.
   The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said
that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack
``redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot
win.''
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attack
and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this outrage ...
which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.''
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the
operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war''
delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine
days ago.
   It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very brave group of
men'' who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970.
   The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as a
sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations
that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRA
suspects to Protestant assassins.
   British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA
campaign. Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11
servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central London.
   The music school trains young recruits for the seven Royal
Marines bands. Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergo
military and musical training there, working with older,
professional bandsmen.

   Many residents of this hurricane-ravaged
city mounted bicycles to check on their homes and friends, dodging
toppled trees, wind-sheared roofs, broken gas lights and other
debris.
   Hurricane Hugo's torrential rains and 135 mph winds caused an
estimated $1 billion in damages in historic Charleston. Mayor Joseph
P. Riley Jr. imposed a 7 p.m. curfew Friday to deter looting, and
1,400 National Guardsmen joined police in patrolling the streets
early today.
   Among those pushing pedals were Dr. Bob Sadler, his wife and two
daughters. Their golden retriever, ``Snickers,'' maneuvered around
the debris on foot.
   ``We didn't know which streets would be under water,'' said
Sadler.
   The Sadlers spent Thursday night in Summerville, about 25 miles
inland, when it became clear Charleston would get the brunt of Hugo.
   The family returned to the battered city Friday morning to check
on damage, finding streets littered with planks, window frames,
shards of glass and other debris. Many of the city's historic homes
were damaged and its big oak trees topped by the force of the storm.
   ``I couldn't imagine it being as bad as they were saying,'' said
Sadler's wife, Francie. ``I didn't want to believe it. I cried when
I came back into town.''
   Attorney Tom S. Tisdale said he decided to use his 10-speed
bicycle because his car was low on gasoline and because some streets
were impassable in cars.
   ``Given the problems with the streets, it's easier and faster in
many cases to get around on bicycles,'' he said.
   In the luggage rack of his bicycle, Tisdale carried a folded blue
tarp that had covered his desk during the storm. Tisdale said his
office was not damaged, but a friend's roof was gone. Tisdale
planned to give the tarp to his friend to cover the gaping hole.
   Another bicyclist, Beth Hutton, stopped for a break at a street
corner across the street from City Hall, whose metal roof was blown
off.
   ``It's the only way to get around,'' she said. ``I came out to
look at family homes. One's water damaged. One's roof is damaged.
One's OK, except we'd like to take a bath.''
   Ms. Hutton said she didn't think Hugo would cause such extensive
damage.
   ``Lots of trees are down,'' she said.
   Katie Crouch peddled along Meeting Street, past damaged motels
and shops, to check the homes of friends who had evacuated.
   ``Everything is in shock right now,'' said Ms. Crouch, a high
school junior.

   Here are some of the major IRA attacks of recent
years on targets in Britain and continental Europe:
   July 20, 1982: A bomb exploded under the British army's bandstand
in Regent's Park, London, killing seven band members and injuring
28. On the same day, another bomb in the capital's Hyde Park killed
four soldiers.
   Dec. 17, 1983: A car bomb exploded outside Harrod's department
store on a London street packed with Christmas shoppers. Six people
were killed and 90 injured.
   Oct. 12, 1984: Five people were killed and 24 injured when an IRA
bomb exploded at the hotel in the southern English seaside town of
Brighton, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was staying during
her Conservative Party's convention. Mrs. Thatcher, the IRA's
declared target, was unhurt.
   May 1, 1988: Three British airmen stationed in West Germany were
killed in Nieuwbergen, Holland. One was fatally shot and two died an
hour later when a bomb went off in a discotheque frequented by
British troops. It was one of a series of IRA attacks on British
military personnel in continental Europe during the year.
   Aug. 1, 1988: A bomb in the dormitory at Inglis Barracks in
London killed one soldier and injured nine.
   Sept. 7, 1989: The wife of a British soldier, Heidi Hazell, 25,
was shot and killed near her home outside Dortmund, West Germany.
   Sept. 22, 1989: An explosion at the Royal Marines School of Music
in Deal killed 10 people and injured 22.

   ``Hillside Strangler'' inmate Kenneth
Bianchi has married a woman he met through the mail.
   Bianchi, 38, and his pen pal, Shirlee J. Book, 36, of Monterey,
La., were married in a 30-minute ceremony in the Washington State
Penitentiary chapel, prison spokesman Richard Bauer said Friday.
   The couple have corresponded by mail and telephone since 1986 but
didn't meet face to face until Wednesday, the day before the
wedding, Bauer said. A marriage license was issued Monday by the
Walla Walla County Auditor's Office.
   Bianchi is serving two life sentences for the slayings of two
Washington women in January 1979.
   He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in five of the 10
``Hillside Strangler'' slayings in California, in which young women
were raped and strangled and their bodies dumped on hillsides around
Los Angeles in 1977 and 1978. His cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., is
imprisoned in California for nine of the killings.
   The newlyweds won't get a conjugal visit for two to three months,
Bauer said. Then they'll get to spend time together in a trailer on
the prison grounds.
   Bianchi and his bride each were allowed one attendant, but
neither the attendants' names nor the minister's will be released,
Bauer said.
   The spokesman didn't know if Book would move to Walla Walla.

   President Bush's war on drugs is caught in a
partisan battle in the Senate, with Democrats trying to add
prevention and treatment money and Republicans arguing the revision
would weaken the defense budget.
   ``If we're not willing to spend $150 million more, this is no
war,'' Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Friday after a week of
closed-door efforts to reach a compromise failed.
   The talks broke off Friday and no new negotiations were scheduled.
   Republicans were proposing to add $850 million to the $7.9
billion program Bush announced two weeks ago and Democrats were
holding out for an additional $1 billion, with no further talks
scheduled.
   The parties also were at odds over how to distribute cuts in
programs for money to go to the anti-drug effort.
   The breakdown threatened to create a logjam of money bills in the
Senate just before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year when the
funds ordinarily would be needed. Lawmakers said they might pass a
stopgap measure to keep federal workers on the job and benefit
checks flowing.
   The chief Republican negotiator, Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
said the two sides were actually fairly close and said he hoped the
parties would take ``a clear-eyed, Monday morning view'' and resume
bargaining.
   ``We have to wage this war and the sooner we get at it the better
it's going to be,'' Hatfield said.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the chief Democratic negotiator,
said the White House had been ``a shadow participant'' in the
negotiations and that its reluctance to compromise was the key
problem.
   ``There comes a time when you have to fish or cut bait,'' said
Byrd, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Republican lawmakers said they were frequently on the phone to
White House chief of staff John Sununu on Thursday when a marathon
bargaining session ended at midnight.
   Sununu was in the office of Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas Friday morning for a strategy session with GOP senators,
national drug policy director William Bennett and budget director
Richard Darman.
   Of the $1 billion Democrats would add, $800 million would be
aimed at stemming demand for drugs through education and prevention
programs and through treatment. The rest would go to local law
enforcement.
   Democrats would finance their program with an across-the-board
cut of 0.3 percent in federal spending plus selected cuts to be
determined by congressional subcommittees.
   Republicans were offering to add $850 million to the program,
including $750 million for the so-called demand side programs of
treatment and prevention and the rest for local law enforcement.
   They would get additional money through a 0.4 percent
across-the-board cut in spending, Hatfield said. But Republicans
were holding out for additional flexibility to protect defense
procurement from the full brunt of across-the-board cuts.
   Since the bargaining began, Democrats cut their proposed increase
by more than half to compromise with Republicans. GOP senators said
Byrd's initial plan, with its across-the-board reduction of more
than 0.5 percent, would have been too hard on defense.
   And inclusion of selected cuts also represented a partial
concession to Republican demands.
   Byrd told a news conference that Republicans asked for
concessions ``and we said, OK, we'll do that, but lets beef up that
treatment side, that prevention side.'' He and other Democratic
lawmakers dismissed the notion that their proposal would weaken
defense.
   ``The administration was unwilling to let a $300 billion defense
budget bear a less than one-half of one percent cut to beef up the
war on drugs,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., told reporters.

<HEAD>Governor Orders Clinic Closed, Seeks New Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez is seeking emergency
rules to protect women at private abortion clinics in Florida after
ordering a Miami clinic closed because of reports of botched
abortions.
   ``This is a pure pro-health issue,'' Martinez said at a Friday
news conference. ``This is for the health of individuals
irregardless of philosophy on the substance of the abortion issue.''
   Martinez told Health and Rehabilitative Services Secretary Greg
Coler to ``take all steps necessary to remove the license of this
clinic.''
   The action comes after reports of improper abortions by
unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptured uteri and hysterectomies
at the Dadeland Medical Center, now doing business as the Women's
Service Center.
   ``There is no legal reason, no health reason, for this order,''
responded Susan Hoffman, director of the center. ``We've done
nothing against the law. We've helped thousands of women. I see this
as totally ludicrous.''
   Peter Dunbar, the governor's general counsel, said any emergency
regulations drawn up by HRS for abortion clinics would be in effect
for 90 days. After that, the new rules would be subject to public
hearings and HRS board approval to become permanent.
   By that time, the Legislature will have decided whether to go
along with Martinez's proposals to further restrict access to
abortions. The session is scheduled for Oct. 10-13.
   Martinez has denied he was trying to bypass the Legislature by
using the Miami situation to enact emergency regulations.
   Yet in his letter to Coler, the governor said conditions at the
Miami clinic ``are precisely why I have called for increased
regulation of abortion clinics to protect the health of women.''
   The new rules, Martinez said, will not be as strict as his
proposal for the special session to make private abortion clinics
adhere to the same standards as ambulatory care clinics.
   Martinez said HRS should not be blamed for the problems at the
Miami clinic, saying the agency doesn't have the power at present to
uncover them. He said he doesn't know whether abortion clinics
throughout the state have similar practices.
   Brian Ballard, the governor's chief of operations, said
veterinary clinics have more stringent regulations than abortion
centers.
   Neither Martinez nor Dunbar would be specific about the kinds of
regulations being sought, but both said they would be designed to
protect the health of women seeking abortions _ not to restrict
their access to an abortion.

   The Vatican has confirmed that a Roman
Catholic Church official met with the Soviet ambassador to Italy to
discuss a possible meeting between Pope John Paul II and President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Such a meeting would be the first between the leader of the
world's 850 million Roman Catholics and the head of the officially
atheist Soviet Union.
   Joaquin Navarro, the Vatican spokesman, Friday confirmed a
newspaper report that Archbishop Angelo Sodano of the Vatican's
Secretariat of State had gone to the Soviet Embassy in Rome about 10
days earlier to meet Ambassador Nikolai Lunkov.
   The spokesman told reporters the meeting involved ``preparation
for a possible visit by President Gorbachev to the Vatican.''
   Navarro gave no dates for such a meeting. Gorbachev is expected
to visit Italy sometime in November, however.
   The spokesman did not comment on another part of the report in
the Rome daily La Repubblica that said Sodano told Lunkov the
Vatican was ready to consider establishing diplomatic relations with
the Soviet Union.

convicted of plotting to bomb a refugee center and sentenced to one
year in prison, news reports said.
   Arne Myrdal, 53, called his conviction on Friday ``absurd'' and
``a political judgment,'' according to the Norwegian news agency
NTB. He was expected to appeal.
   The Agder Country Court said evidence, including dynamite and a
hand-drawn map of a new refugee reception center near this southern
Norway town, proved that Myrdal intended to bomb the center, NTB
reported.
   Myrdal helped found the People's Movement Against Immigration in
October 1987, after the annual number of asylum seekers in Norway
increased tenfold in two years to about 8,600 people.
   A second defendant in the case, Fred Skauen, 34, was convicted of
conspiracy and threatening to kill a police informer who acted as a
prosecution witness, the news report said. He was sentenced to eight
months in prison, according to the report.

   Irving Berlin created the American popular song.
   Until Berlin began writing after the turn of the century,
American music was dominated by Europe _ English music hall, Gilbert
and Sullivan, Viennese operetta and Italian opera. Berlin took
native American sounds, such as ragtime, and turned them into huge
popular hits like ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ``Everybody's
Doin' It Now.'' When Irving Berlin wrote, America listened _ for
more than 50 years.
   ``He caught the voices of the people early in this century and
held them for longer than anyone else,'' Robert Kimball, musical
theater historian, said Friday.
   From his first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy,'' in 1907 to his
last Broadway show, ``Mr. President,'' in 1962, Berlin's presence
was felt on the music scene in this country. No one today can look
to such a long period of domination.
   And Berlin was a winner in every medium he tried. He found
success not only in Tin Pan Alley but on Broadway with musicals like
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and his Music Box revues,
and in Hollywood where he wrote the scores for Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers movies like ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the Fleet'' and other
films like ``Holiday Inn'' and ``Easter Parade.''
   His colleagues thought he was the best, particularly
contemporaries like Jerome Kern. He had an enormous influence on the
Broadway composers who followed him, especially George Gershwin and
Harold Arlen who relished his inventive way with rhythm.
   Berlin also had an incredible versatility, a great intelligence
and perspective about the world. He could write any kind of song _ a
stirring, patriotic anthem like ``God Bless America,'' a seasonal
standard like ``White Christmas,'' a comic theater ditty like
``Doin' What Comes Natur'lly,'' an unbashedly sentimental favorite
like ``Always'' or a complex love song like ``Let's Face the Music
and Dance.''
   ``He was a folk singer and he was able to absorb whatever was
happening in the street and bring it out, even more than Stephen
Foster,'' said Edward Jablonski, a good friend of Berlin's and the
author of several books on American theater composers. ``He was an
ordinary man who was able to write songs. That's why he appealed so
much to people.
   ``But he also made a point of not being a well-educated musician.
He was a born musician, which is a hard thing to be. So he could be
more sophisticated that he ever thought he was.''
   Berlin also was a shrewd businessman. He was a charter member and
served on the first board of directors for ASCAP, the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which collects
songwriting royalties. Before 1920, he had formed his own music
publishing company which published all of his music. And at the time
of his death, he was still co-owner of the Music Box Theater, a
Broadway theater he built in 1921. As late as two years ago, he
would call up the box office at the Music Box to see how the grosses
were going.
   But it will be for his music that he will be remembered.
   ``I would think Irving Berlin is the most admired songwriter
America has produced in this century _ and maybe ever,'' Kimball
said.

   Waste watchers in the Chinese government have
seized a new luxury office building from a ministry accused of
ignoring state orders to avoid extravagance, according to an
official report today.
   The China Daily newspaper quoted He Yong, vice minister of
supervision, as saying, ``This violates the state's regulations on
construction standards for executive office buildings as well as the
present austerity drive.''
   The central government has demanded for the past year that all
public offices sharply reduce spending as part of a policy to
counter inflation, rising budget deficits and excessive economic
growth.
   The six-story building on Beijing's main Changan Avenue contains
marble walls and floors, central air conditioning and other luxuries
for top officials. It cost $31 million, 3{ times the amount planned.
   He Yong said the building, completed last year, will be turned
over to the Bureau of Government Offices Administration.

<TEXT>
   Platoons of would-be Rambos are shopping for
exotic weaponry and fighting fashions, taking tutorials on world
terrorism and swapping war stories at the 10th annual Soldiers of
Fortune convention.
   At the start of the three-day gathering Friday, conventioneers
decked out in berets, flak jackets and camouflage pants sat around
the pool of the Sahara Hotel amid bikini-clad sunbathers. Others
rubbed shoulders with civilian gamblers at the bars and slot
machines.
   An estimated 10,000 delegates could choose from seminars on such
hot spots as Central America and Afghanistan, manufacturers'
displays and a shooting competition at a desert range.
   As usual, the big hit was the annual display of weapons and
apparel designed especially for those spoiling for a fight.
   ``It features a lot of things your mother probably didn't want
you to play with when you were growing up,'' said Bill Brooks,
exhibition director at the convention, which is put on by Soldier of
Fortune magazine of Boulder, Colo.
   The show, he said, is keyed to the interests of the
``professional adventurer.''
   Elsewhere in the country, people are campaigning to rid the
civilian populace of semiautomatic weapons. But in the hotel's main
exhibition hall, convention-goers trooped to booths featuring the
latest in rapid-fire armament.
   Street Sweeper Sales of Atlanta touted a line of automatic
weapons with a banner picturing an ominous looking weapon.
   ``The Street Sweeper _ Delivers 12 rounds in less than 3
Seconds,'' the sign said. ``Buy American _ It matters.''
   Salesman Sherman Yarborough said the featured firearm is used
mainly for police work and by Florida law agencies against drug
smugglers and dealers.
   Some Street Sweepers are used for ``self protection,'' Yarborough
said, adding it's ``like any gun. Each person has a different use
for them.''
   Yarborough said his company sells only to licensed gun dealers.
   Several booths, including one set up by the National Rifle
Association, urged attendees to fight efforts at gun control.
   Posters, T-shirts and bumper stickers carried a similar theme.
   One poster pictured a man with a cache of guns and a message:
``Make all the laws you want _ you ain't taking mine!''
   Nearby was a stack of bumper stickers reading ``WAR _ Mankind's
oldest contact sport.''
   Camouflage was the uniform of the day. Several booths offered
``camo'' clothing including pants, jackets, hats _ even bikini
swimsuits and women's lingerie.
   Outside, a motor home sported a camouflage paint job.
   T-shirt slogans ran along the lines of ``Kill a Commie for
Mommy,'' and ``I don't dial 911'' next to a picture of a gun.
   One booth bristled with dozens of official-looking laminated ID
cards, including Police, Press, Swat Team, Security and Ordained
Minister. A sign read ``America is at Peace because the CIA is at
War.''
   Among the hundreds of books offered were a manual on the care and
operation of the AK-47 assault rifle and a volume entitled, ``Armed
and Female: 12 million American women own guns. Should you?''
   Some exhibitors were reluctant to talk to reporters. A salesman
for Miami-based Intratec referred questions to his home office when
asked about the company's .22-caliber Scorpion automatic pistol.
   CEP, Inc. of Boulder, Colo., was hawking videos on such subjects
as terrorist weapons and making various explosives.
   Wayne's Gun Shop of Dublin, Calif., showcased a new bullet with
enhanced destructive power. The promotional literature described it:
``On impact, a pre-cut, precision forged metal projectile opens into
whirlpool-creating, chopping blades.''
   Airpower Sabot Cannons of Boulder City, Nev., demonstrated an
air-powered gun that's fired while resting on a person's shoulder.
Potential ammunition included steel or lead balls, steel
projectiles, bean bags, paint balls and water balloons.
   ``Kill it, capture it, mark it, rescue it, scare it, intimidate
it, supress it, sink it,'' read the brochure.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators, meeting
under the splendor of the snow-capped Rocky mountains, reached a
major breakthrough Friday on a treaty to slash long-range nuclear
weapons arsenals.
   They also neared completion of a separate accord that would open
Soviet underground nuclear tests to on-site American inspection and
vice versa, senior U.S. and Soviet officials reported. A Soviet
official said a ``general framework'' for a pact had been nailed
down, which if made final could end a deadlock on the ratification
of 15-year-old test ban treaties.
   The breakthrough on strategic weapons came during an arms control
session between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in a mountain lodge overlooking
Jackson Lake.
   There, Shevardnadze informed Baker the Soviets had dropped their
demand for completion of a treaty to limit space-based defenses _
Star Wars _ before a separate pact to slash long-range bombers,
missiles and nuclear submarines could be implemented.
   ``I am not aware of any statement like that in the past,'' said a
U.S. official who demanded anonymity.
   ``The Soviets have shifted,'' he said.
   Since the United States refused to yield to Soviet demands to
trim its space-defense program, known popularly as ``Star Wars,''
completing a treaty to reduce strategic weapons 30 to 50 percent was
improbable.
   Former President Ronald Reagan's summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Iceland in 1987 fell apart over the
dispute, which is known within the arms control community as
``linkage.''
   The shift in Soviet position was announced this way by the senior
U.S. official at a briefing for reporters:
   ``In response to a question from Secretary Baker, Mr.
Shevardnadze said they had dropped their linkage between completing
an agreement in START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) and achieving
a defense-in-space accord.''
   The U.S. official repeated the statement thrice for emphasis. He
stressed a treaty to slash strategic weapons could be implemented
even without an agreement on U.S. and Soviet defenses.
   ``This looks like a positive development,'' the official said.
   He stressed President Bush intended to go ahead with the U.S.
Strategic Defense Initiative launched by Reagan.
   ``The President's commitment to that program is very
well-known,'' the official said.
   Reagan announced the program in March 1983. From the outset the
Soviets sought to stifle it.
   But since 1987 the Soviets had said they were willing to permit
some Star Wars tests. The offer is under discussion at the talks in
Jackson Hole.
   A Soviet spokesman, Boris Malakhov, said there would be no Soviet
response to the American comments before Shevardnadze spoke at a
joint news conference today.
   In another development, The Washington Post said in Saturday
editions that the letter carried to President Bush by Shevardnadze
from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev called for an acceleration
of meetings of foreign ministers aimed at a treaty on conventional
arms in Europe by the end of next year.
   The inspection agreement would send scores of American inspectors
to the Soviet test site at Semipalatinsk to ensure that detonations
that are part of the Soviet nuclear weapons program are within legal
limits. It would also bring Soviet inspectors to the U.S. test site
in Nevada.
   Scientists from both countries have monitored some of each
other's recent explosions as a test.
   The current ceiling under unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties is a
force of 150 kilotons, or 150,000 tons of TNT. The bomb that
destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 exploded with a force now estimated at
about 13,000 tons of TNT.
   The Soviet official, who briefed reporters on the daylong
Baker-Shevardnadze talks on condition that he not be identified,
said that the two sides still had to decide the range of the small
blasts that could be excluded from inspection. The U.S. position is
to have all tests between 50 and 150 kilotons subject to inspection
while the Soviets wanted to set the range between 75 and 150
kilotons.
   There would be no bar to underground explosions smaller than
whatever floor is decided upon.
   Tests in the atmosphere and in the ocean are banned by a 1963
treaty.
   The new agreement could pave the way for Senate ratification of
the 1974 and 1976 treaties, which critics had contended did not
contain adequate safeguards against violations. In fact, former
President Ronald Reagan accused the Soviets in two reports to
Congress of cheating _ charges the Soviets flatly denied.
   The agreement clears the way for American use of a new
sophisticated technique that measures the speed of destruction of a
coaxial cable in a vertical hole near the blast, the so-called
CORRTEX technique.
   Until now, measurements have been undertaken with seismic
methods, measuring the ground motion resulting from the blast _ just
like measurements of earthquakes.
   The Soviet official said the agreement gives the two sides the
option on which method to use and his government still prefers the
seismic approach.
   ``The general framework has been agreed on,'' the Soviet official
said.
   The other two tentative accords, announced during the lunch
break, provides for advance notice of military exercises and an
agreement in principle for ``trial verification'' of each other's
stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons, according to the Soviet
briefer.
   Some of those arms, such as cruise missiles carried aboard
submarines and surface warships, are hard to track. This has slowed
completion of a treaty to slash stockpiles of bombers, missiles and
submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   The Soviet official said there were still differences over which
weapons to expose to inspection. He said the United States was
concentrating on Soviet mobile missiles, while the Soviets wanted to
check on a broader range of arms and factories.
   Still, the headway on arms control reflected a generally good
atmosphere.
   Not all went smoothly, though. One U.S. official, who also
requested anonymity, said Baker had complained to Shevardnadze about
``tremendous increases'' in Soviet bloc weapons shipments to
Nicaragua and Cambodia.
   Posing for pictures at the start of two days of talks, Baker and
Shevardnadze looked over a meadow with the snow-dusted Grand Teton
mountains just beyond.
   Two moose grazed in the sun-lit flats at the base of the peaks.
   Baker joked that the animals had been chained to provide a
bucolic backdrop.
   ``Yes, I notice that the moose are tied,'' the Soviet minister
replied. After the two men left the terrace, the moose bolted into
the woods at the approach of television cameramen.
   Baker, meeting with Shevardnadze in a lakeside lodge, said he
hoped a new openness between the superpowers would lead to ``some
steps that are unprecedented.'' The nuclear test agreement would
fall into that category.
   Shevardnadze shared in Baker's upbeat mood as the two spoke
briefly to reporters.
   ``I would like especially to emphasize,'' he said, ``that it is
high time for us to move from mutual understanding to mutual
action.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze are scheduled to meet through Sunday
morning, when, after a fishing expedition, they will fly on an Air
Force jet to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, which
opens on Monday with a speech by President Bush.
   Shevardnadze addresses the assembly on Tuesday.
   The talks here were also designed to narrow a time frame for
Bush's first summit meeting with Gorbachev sometime next year.
   Shevardnadze, asked to comment on Bush administration statements
that a summit would be held sometime next year, said, ``We'll be
discussing this today.''

   A defense witness admitted she
received a teddy bear from Zsa Zsa Gabor before testifying that she
saw a motorcycle policeman drag the actress from a car and kick her.
   Miss Gabor explained she handed Rosa Perick a ``Zsa Zsa G'Bear,''
replete with satin nightgown, as a gift for Ms. Perick's son.
   Ms. Perick was the first witness in the cop-slapping trial to
corroborate Miss Gabor's story about her arrest. She said Miss Gabor
made other offers during her two visits to the actress' house this
week.
   Miss Gabor ``offered me whatever I wanted,'' Ms. Perick said.
   Miss Gabor faces a possible 18-month jail sentence if convicted
of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container
of alcohol in her car.
   Miss Gabor does not deny slapping Officer Paul Kramer. But she
insists she lashed out in self-defense after he cursed her and
dragged her from her Rolls-Royce on June 14 when he spotted expired
registration tags on the car.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox cited Ms. Perick's remarks to
imply that she stood to benefit by buttressing Miss Gabor's case.
   Elden asked Ms. Perick how she supported herself.
   ``When I work, I have income. When I don't work, I don't have
income,'' she responded. Under further questioning, she began to
explain that she had taken a mortgage on her home when Miss Gabor
broke in: ``I will help you.''
   ``I'm sure you will,'' Fox quipped to snickers from the packed
Beverly Hills courthouse.
   Fox asked Perick why defense attorney William Graysen invited her
to Miss Gabor's house on Tuesday, the day Miss Gabor took the
witness stand.
   ``I guess to review the case,'' Ms. Perick replied. ``We had
nothing else to speak (of),'' she said.
   Graysen said he planned to call up to four more witnesses for the
defense before wrapping up his case. But he conceded Miss Gabor
likely would be convicted of driving without a valid license, a
misdemeanor.

<DATELINE>FOLLY BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo's six-hour blast left
Folly Beach unrecognizable even to its mayor. Up the coast, the
storm's wake left two other barrier islands cut off, and sliced
another in two.
   Folly Beach, the town and island just south of Charleston,
virtually lost its entire beachfront row of homes.
   ``I don't know where we are,'' Mayor Bob Linville said during a
tour of the area. ``All of my usual landmarks are gone.''
   One missing dwelling was the Atlantic House Restaurant, which had
survived years of serious erosion that left it literally sitting
atop pilings in the ocean, approachable only by foot bridge. After
Hugo, all that remained was its red shingle roof.
   ``About 30 percent of the houses on the island are no longer
habitable, if they're even here,'' said Claude Wade of the Folly
Beach Police Department.
   Linville estimated the damage at tens of millions of dollars and
said hundreds of buildings had been damaged or destroyed.
   Most of the seaward houses in the town of 2,000 residents either
were cracked open or without roofs or windows.
   Along the ocean, support poles for beach houses had nothing to
support, their houses having been washed away by Hugo's 12- to
17-foot tidal surge. Arctic Avenue, about 50 feet from the ocean,
looked like a dirt road, covered with sand and the debris of smashed
beach houses.
   The storm showed that the destruction was often a game of chance.
One house was knocked off its foundation and with a wall missing.
But a china cabinet remained standing as did two plates inside.
   Demolished houses spewed mattresses, clothes, and furniture along
the beach.
   The Holiday Inn, which sits on a slab of concrete 50 feet from
the ocean, seemed to weather the storm remarkably well despite its
proximity to the ocean. Its upper floors remained intact even though
the first floor was demolished. Farther up the coast, two barrier
islands _ Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms _ were cut off
from land because the storm knocked out its only link _ the
swing-span Ben Sawyer Bridge.
   On the Isle of Palms, which hosts the U.S. Clay Court Tennis
Championships, the hurricane ripped the fishing pier out of the
water and destroyed million-dollar waterfront homes.
   About 100 boats that had been docked at the Wild Dunes Marina
were ``stacked up like cordwood'' across the marina on Goat Island,
said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department
official.
   Hugo created a 100- to 200-foot-wide channel of water through
Pawleys Island, midway between Charleston and Myrtle Beach,
according to Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flew people to
the coast to check their property.
   ``There are now two Pawleys Islands, if you will,'' Sellers said.
   Back on Folly Beach, Dean DuBani walked along the streets Friday
afternoon carrying a small satchel and looking for a ride.
   While many other heeded evacaution orders before the storm,
DuBani said he remained and partied with some other people in an
ocean front house as Hugo smashed ashore.
   ``It was incredible,'' he said. ``Everything was just floating
by.''
   DuBani said he left the house when it began breaking up, and
walked across the street to a neighbor's house whose door had been
blown open.
   ``I got scared and just grabbed my clothes. This is all I have
left,'' he said, pointing to his pouch that contained a fishing
pole, a can of beer, some swimming fins, a snorkel, several shirts
and a few pairs of pants.
   ``Thinking about heading to Key West,'' he said before hitching a
ride out of town with a blonde woman in a sports car.
   But Bud Tetric was determined to stay.
   ``Going to rebuild,'' he said of his demolished house. ``I pay
taxes, and, if I pay taxes, I should have full use of my property.''

<HEAD>Former HUD Head to Have Cameras Banned from Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce will
exercise his right to ban cameras from his forced congressional
testimony on scandals at the agency during his eight-year tenure.
   Pierce's attorney on Friday also gave his strongest indication
yet that the former secretary might refuse to answer some questions
when he appears before a House subcommittee Tuesday. But attorney
Paul L. Perito said no thought was being given to ignoring the
subpoena.
   ``That's not even in the realm of possibilities,'' said Perito.
``We'll be there.''
   Pierce was subpoenaed to testify after he refused to appear
voluntarily last week. House rules allow subpoenaed witnesses to ban
television cameras, still photographers and microphones from the
hearing room.
   Pierce's decision, expressed in a letter from Perito to the
subcommittee, is the latest maneuver in what has become an
increasingly hostile interaction between the panel and Pierce.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing is reviewing allegations of fraud, mismanagement and
cronyism at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It
wants to ask Pierce about a number of controversial decisions and
testimony that contradicts a sworn account the former secretary gave
in May.
   Chairman, Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., characterized Pierce as
``deceitful'' after he declined to testify last week. Perito said
Pierce needed more time to prepare his testimony.
   Perito said he believed that televising the hearings has
contributed ``to an atmosphere that totally departed from fairness
and objectivity.''
   ``I am deeply committed to restoring decency and a sense of
somberness in the process. And frankly, I want very much to decrease
the atmosphere for what I consider unfounded but damaging references
made about my client under the rubric of the free speech and debate
clause,'' Perito said.
   That clause provides that members of Congress may not be sued for
anything they say during official proceedings.
   Stuart Weisberg, the subcommittee's chief counsel, said Lantos
had expected the decision.
   ``Chairman Lantos believes that it is not in the best interests
of Mr. Pierce and is a disservice to the American people who have a
right to know what happened during Mr. Pierce's eight-year tenure at
HUD,'' Weisberg said.
   Lantos most likely will allow the use cameras and microphones at
the conclusion of Pierce's testimony and offer a summation of the
hearing, Weisberg said.

<HEAD>Key Senators Reach Compromise on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key Senate clean air sponsors say they've
reached a political compromise on acid rain that would benefit seven
states that cleaned up emissions from coal-fired power plants.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., on Friday predicted their agreement would win
support for clean air legislation. The compromise is not included in
President Bush's clean air plan, which is being considered by a
House subcommittee.
   Both the administration and Baucus-Mitchell plans are designed to
reduce the major component of acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10
million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after the
reductions are achieved.
   The Bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year
2000 and the Mitchell-Baucus requires the improvement by Jan. 1,
2000.
   The agreement would exempt states from making further sulfur
dioxide reductions through the start of 2000, if more than one half
of their coal-fired power plants utilize pollution-reducing
equipment called scrubbers.
   The provision would benefit Montana, Kansas, Minnesota, North
Dakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to a list handed out
by the senators.
   Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide, and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down
to earth. Acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams,
damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs.

<NOTE>Illegal Decisions to Deny Treatment to Handicapped Said to Persist</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors and hospitals illegally deny
lifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mental
disabilities, says a government report.
   Decisions to withhold medical treatment, food and fluids to these
disabled children in many instances occur with the cooperation of
federal, state and local government agencies, despite a federal law
prohibiting the practice, concluded the study released Friday.
   The 500-page report, ``Medical Discrimination Against Children
with Disabilities,'' was released by the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights.
   The study's conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence, an
examination of how hospital infant-care review committees and child
protection agencies have enforced the law, and a national random
survey of physician attitudes published late last year.
   In that survey, 75 percent of the responding physicians said they
would be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spina
bifida and another severe disability, hydrocephalus.
   The study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment often
are not made on the basis of medical judgments and are
discriminatory.

<NOTE>Pork Bellies Destined for Poland</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Between 7,000 and 10,000 metric tons of pork
bellies will be sent to Poland as part of a U.S. aid package
promised by President Bush, says Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter.
   The pork bellies will be included in a $108.4 million in food aid
pledged by Bush on Sept. 14.
   Yeutter said Friday the pork will be donated under the Food for
Progress program authorized by 1985 farm law.
   The Agriculture Department expects to announce in the near future
offers to buy the pork bellies from commercial providers, he said.
Pork bellies are the source of sliced bacon for American consumers.
   A delivery schedule will be worked out with Polish officials, but
Yeutter said shipments probably will be made in the winter months
when food shortages can be aggravated by severe weather.

<TEXT>
   The magic tricks, dazzling and amazing, flow one
into the next. A mime troupe sparks children's laughter, while a
basketball game on unicycles draws chortles from adults.
   Walking through a green light that appears to have no ramp
beneath it, Siegfried and Roy opened the first of 32 performances at
Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, a show as lavish in
constuming and lighting as those the late Liberace used to do.
   Siegfried and Roy are swallowed by two robots helped by
putty-colored people with big insect heads. A woman arrives, lifts
her arms and disappears. Another woman is seen swimming in a tank. A
cloth is thrown over the tank and when it's removed, a white tiger
is in there and the audience hears a tape-recorded roar.
   That all takes place in the first few minutes of the show, and
Siegfried and Roy aren't taking time to milk the applause. Their
show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the
next dazzlement.
   Women assistants suffer everything but being sawed in half. One
lies in a long box which is pushed together like an accordion.
Another swings on a swing from her waist up. Her skirt, legs and
feet dance out on stage separately. Another gets into a Japanese
box, which then is folded into a tiny square box. Unfolded into a
large rectangle again, she emerges from it. Another is balanced on a
spike, which seems then to skewer her.
   The charming Mummenschanz mime troupe from Switzerland was a
special favorite with children. A big green ``clam'' licks its lips
around a stuffed rabbit before gobbling it up. Two men wearing putty
masks made countless shapes with them, one pulling a pieces of the
``face'' out like chewing gum and whacking it back onto himself.
   The unicycle basketball teams are the King Charles Troupe, formed
in the 1960s as a Bronx unicycle club. There are a couple of Las
Vegas-style numbers by dancers wearing not much.
   The animals are beautiful. A white car drives on stage _ as
Liberace used to do _ bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs.
   Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the
end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his
back, they're pulled into the air.
   It's a Las Vegas show and it's nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers
aren't too sophisticated for this.

<DATELINE>PURSAT, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ravaged by two decades of war and bloody
revolution, Cambodia now faces a drought that is expected to cut
rice and fish cultivation by 25 percent and threaten many with
starvation.
   A lack of local government to provide social services or
otherwise help people makes the prospects for this nation of 8
million appear even bleaker.
   ``If the war won't kill you then you might die because of no
water,'' said Treang Suon, a 37-year-old mother of four from Veal
village in the Pursat province, 90 miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
``And there is no government to help us along.''
   Interviews with peasants, government officials, teachers and
Western aid officials in the provinces of Pursat and Kampong Chhnang
gave a dark picture of the future for Cambodia.
   The country appears poised to slide into a new phase of civil
conflict now that the Vietnamese, this nation's occupiers for the
last decade, say they will withdraw the last of their troops by
Tuesday.
   Fighting between Cambodian government troops and guerrillas from
the Khmer Rouge resistance group already is intensifying in
Battambang, 140 miles northwest of Pursat. A Western doctor in
Pursat said his hospital has seen a twofold increase in gunshot
wounds over the past two months.
   ``Now we average about five a day,'' he said. ``The Khmer Rouge
are moving about very freely and the peasants are scared.''
   The economy, too, is in deep trouble.
   Fish cultivation and timber production have fallen in Pursat for
two straight years. Due to the late and light rains this year,
production of rice, the staple crop for the whole country, also is
sure to fall.
   Three decades of peace ended in Cambodia in 1970 when a military
coup ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk, dragging Cambodia into the
Vietnam War. The Khmer Rouge took power in 1975 and killed hundreds
of thousands of people under their radical brand of agrarian
communism.
   Vietnam invaded the country in December 1978 and installed a
pro-Hanoi regime in Phnom Penh. A resistance coalition led by
Sihanouk has been battling the Vietnamese and Cambodian government
troops.
   If the economy worsens, the government will lose legitimacy,
making its battle against the resistance front that much harder.
   The biggest loser will be Cambodia's people.
   Time was when the Moslem people of Ro Leap village took the
half-day walk over palm-lined paths and verdant paddies to Lake
Tonle Sap to fish the once-bountiful waters. But now there is a
drought, and bands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas would make a trip too
risky.
   ``We buy our fish now and only eat it on special occasions,''
said Ty Chouk, a 37-year-old farmer. ``We used to fish everyday.''
   The catch in Pursat province fell 41 percent between 1987 and
1988 to 4,120 metric tons, according to Khang Heang, vice chief of
the provincial committee. Another drop in 1989 is expected,
government officials said.
   They still fish in nearby Veal village, but the residents no
longer wander into the forest near Ro Leap to cut hardwood timber
and bamboo for their homes.
   Landmines laid by the government and the Khmer Rouge have blown
up too many people.
   ``The folks near the lake don't come up here anymore,'' Ty Chouk
said. ``Only we know where the government mines are because we laid
them in the ground. Other villages are too scared to risk their
lives. Even we don't go into the high areas anymore. That belongs to
the Pol Pot people and their mines.''
   Timber cultivation also fell in Pursat between 1987 and 1988,
dropping 16 percent to 5,000 cubic meters, Khang Heang said.
   Bad weather has been another problem. Scarce rain pushed rice
planting back from May until August, raising doubts as to whether
the peasants around Pursat would be able to plant a second crop of
rice.
   ``My family will go hungry this year,'' said Mrs. Suon, spitting
a red wad of beetlenut juice in the dirt. ``We can't live only on
coconuts and onions, we must have rice.''
   Another blow to agriculture has been the government's policy to
forcibly conscript many young men.
   San Poen, a 43-year-old father of four, had his two sons taken
away by the military.
   ``They were rounded up after a movie show,'' he said. ``It is
good that they are serving the country but I need them, too, to farm
the fields. I had to drop some land this year and am farming less.
So we will have too little to eat.''
   Khang Heang estimated that rice cultivation in Pursat would fall
between 12 percent and 25 percent.
   ``If the weather doesn't get better the people could starve,'' he
said.
   A Ministry of Finance official said he believed nationwide
production would probably fall 25 percent.
   Yet another problem is the lack of local administration to help
people deal with the crisis.
   At Veal village, which is responsible for eight communes holding
about 1,500 people, the local government office consists of a
ramshackle two-story house. Three rooms open onto a courtyard shaded
by coconut trees. Freshly painted signs, ``Justice,''
``Administration'' and ``Economy'' hang from the rooms.
   ``These are our departments,'' says Hem Pheach, a Communist Party
official. The rooms contain no chairs or tables. There is no paper,
no phone. In one room, a chicken clucks in a corner, searching for
food.
   ``We lack some materials,'' Hem says quietly, ``then maybe we can
get on with our job.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Caribbean
residents remained at the mercy of the elements nearly a week after
Hurricane Hugo destroyed their homes and communities.
   Officials in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico complained
Friday that while Washington readily flew in troops to stop the
looting and restore order, disaster relief was slow in coming.
   Tens of thousands of people remained in shelters or were roughing
it wherever they could.
   ``I think the governor was wrong in telling the people the
military was coming without telling them (when) food was coming,
water was coming,'' said territorial Sen. Lilliana Belardo de O'Neal.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and a group of congressmen were
to begin a two-day fact-finding trip to Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands today. A congressional aide said the lawmakers planned to
bring 20 cases of baby formula, 30 chain saws and 2,100 transistor
radios.
   The congressmen, led by Rep. George Miller, D.-Calif., also will
consider special aid requests by local officials.
   The U.S. Justice Department obtained authority Friday from Virgin
Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly to order FBI agents and deputy U.S.
marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any
looters, officials said.
   Officials say at least 27 people died when Hugo steamrolled
through Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday before hitting the Carolinas on
Thursday, where it left 11 dead. Losses were estimated in the
billions of dollars.
   President Bush on Wednesday declared the Virgin Islands a
disaster area and ordered 1,200 troops, mostly military police, to
St. Croix in part to stop widespread looting.
   There were no reports of looting Friday, but virtually every
store in Christiansted, the capital of St. Croix, appeared to have
been cleaned out.
   The National Guard has acknowledged that some of its members took
part in the looting, and several witnesses said some police also
were involved.
   Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge of the Virgin Islands said Friday that Hugo
left homeless more than 45,000 people _ about 90 percent of St.
Croix's population. St. Croix, about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico,
is the main island in the group that includes St. Thomas and St.
John.
   Hodge said damage was tentatively estimated at $4 billion.
   ``The island is almost a total disaster,'' he said in a radio
broadcast.
   He appealed to the National Guard, the police and other public
employees to return to work in full force despite the continued
chaos on the island. He said the National Guard was operating at 40
percent strength and the police at 80 percent.
   Ms. Belardo de O'Neal said she and four other senators met with
Gov. Alexander Farrelly on Friday to find out when people can expect
relief supplies.
   The St. Croix Red Cross vice chairman, Evelyn Crittenden,
complained that the army failed to promptly fly in food, clothes,
bedding and medicine.
   ``Here we are, and this is what I have,'' she said, pointing to
some old clothes piled on a table and the floor of an office.
   Hodge said federal disaster specialists arrived on St. Croix
Tuesday but were unable to request immediate help because of
communications problems. He said the Virgin Islands needs
``everything from wrenches to chain saws to medical supplies.''
   In Puerto Rico, 70 percent of the island's 3.3. million residents
remained without running water and 20,000 were still housed in
shelters. Large parts of San Juan, the capital, and several towns in
the northeast also remained without power, officials said.
   Hundreds of residents in San Juan stood in long lines waiting for
water, ice and gasoline.
   When Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon arrived in the northern coastal
town of Canovanas on Friday to inspect local shelters, angry
residents complained they had received no govenment aid since the
storm.
   ``We're all in the street. We don't have any food, water or
light. Our houses blew away,'' resident Gladys Cruz told the
governor.
   In the British colony of Montserrat, Gov. Christopher Turner said
30 percent of the homes will have to be rebuilt and another 30
percent will need extensive repairs. He said about 3,000 of the
island's 12,500 residents were left homeless.
   While the 39-square-mile island still lacked power, some water
and phone service was being restored, he said.

   The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and
deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger
than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some
meteorologists say.
   Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph
winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.
   Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured
at 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes
this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane
Center's Miles Lawrence said today.
   Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last
year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It was the most
powerful hurricane ever recorded.
   Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with
current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology
department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the
wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive
force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.
   Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the
warming trend is already here.
   Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new
book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the
last 100 occurred in the 1980s.
   He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.
   Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its
winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf
Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.
   ``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' he
said. ``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will
have stronger hurricanes.''
   Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes
of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts
will be even stronger.
   Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national
hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity
scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five
the highest.
   The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case
scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump
by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both
contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the
atmosphere unchecked.
   It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up,
the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that is
unlikley.
   ``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said. ``And
that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''

<HEAD>World Conservative Parties Back Reform in East Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of conservative political parties from
around the world said today the failure of socialism is evident and
that they will support East Bloc reformers.
   ``The disintegration and decay of socialism as an idea and as an
economic and political system is one of the most important
developments in our world today,'' said a statement issued at the
end of a three-day meeting of the International Democrat Union.
   The union, formed in 1983, includes right-of-center parties from
26 countries and holds a meeting of party leaders every two years.
   Figures who attended the conference in Tokyo, hosted by Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, included Vice President Dan Quayle,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister Harri
Holkeri of Finland and party leaders from countries in Europe, Latin
America, the Caribbean and the Pacific region _ most of them in the
opposition.
   Quayle, whose speeches at the conference stressed the need to
keep defenses strong and avoid complacency, spent today touring U.S.
military bases in Japan, which is home to about 64,000 U.S. troops.
   The vice president will hold meetings with Kaifu and other
Japanese leaders Monday and Tuesday before flying to the Philippines.
   Although delegates from Austria, on the frontier with the rapidly
changing countries in Eastern Europe, called for a program of
comprehensive aid to East Bloc reformers, the final conference
document did not go so far.
   ``Only the societies that free themselves totally of the
structures, rigidities and follies of socialism will in the longer
run be able to share in the new prosperity of the future,'' it said.
   ``We therefore resolve to give support to all those who accept
these challenges and who will embark upon a program of peaceful
change towards freedom and democracy,'' the statement said.
   It said the West should not subsidize failed socialist economies,
and that increased debt would only hinder progress toward
free-market economies.
   ``However, the West must be prepared to give financial incentives
which support real changes in these economies, introducing market
economy and other structural reforms,'' it said.
   The statement also called for more joint East-West business
ventures.
   Mrs. Thatcher, at a news conference Friday before she left for
Moscow and talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
she did not think the stage was set for something like the Marshall
Plan, the massive U.S. aid program that helped Western Europe
recover from World War II.
   But she said West European countries, individually and in the
European Economic Community, had taken steps to aid Poland and
Hungary, and that she expected the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank eventually to help.
   Andrew Peacock, head of the opposition Liberal Party of Australia
and new chairman of the organization of conservatives, said the
group was proposing programs to assist advocates of change in the
East Bloc.
   While the conference statement praised Gorbachev's reforms, it
said there was no guarantee he would succeed. ``We therefore
reaffirm our absolute determination to maintain adequate defenses
and our continuing support for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence,
which has kept the peace in Europe for over 40 years.''
   The statement noted, however, that some communist leaders have
recognized a link between economic freedom and political freedom and
said this showed a commitment to reform. ``We are convinced that
this new approach will diminish mistrust, thus leading to marked
improvement in East-West relations,'' it said.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Argue For Asylum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Chinese students seeking asylum
testified that a return to their homeland would mean a life as bleak
as their families endured during China's Cultural Revolution.
   The students, who fled to San Francisco after leading an
anti-government protest in Tokyo following the June crackdown in
Beijing, were emotional Friday during the first day of their hearing.
   Asked through a Cantonese translator if she would be willing to
return to China, Hoy Yu Li replied, ``I would rather die.''
   The 27-year-old linguistics student testified about her father's
imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution and her own fears that
her political activity while studying in Japan would lead her to the
same fate.
   ``If we return, it's like a death row. My life will be like my
father's and many others','' she said.
   Her fiance, Luo Jian Guang, said when his father died last July,
he was afraid to return for the funeral.
   ``I would never return to China because if I return to China,
they know my name, they will imprison me,'' he said.
   The students were led handcuffed into the court, but federal
Immigration Judge Bernard Hornbach ordered the handcuffs removed.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service attorney Beverly Phillips
said the INS had no particular position on the matter but filed a
brief containing a State Department recommendation that asylum not
be granted because the students hadn't proved they face persecution
if they return to China.
   Hoy and Luo helped organize and publicize a rally in Toyko on
June 4, just after Red Army troops began their assault on student
protesters in Beijing. They also signed a petition protesting the
action.
   Immediately afterward they began receiving threatening phone
calls warning them that their demonstration, photographed by Chinese
embassy officials, could lead them into trouble. Both testified
Friday that they believed the calls came from Chinese authorities.
   They fled through Hong Kong and have been seeking political
asylum since arriving in San Francisco in August. Their attorney,
Eugene Wong, said there has been only one other case in which a
Chinese person came into the United States after the crackdown to
seek asylum.
   Wong said the case could set a precedent for other Chinese
residents in the United States who have spoken out against the
current regime in Beijing.
   The U.S. government estimates there are 73,000 Chinese students
in the country. President Bush decided in June to allow students who
were in the country at the time of the Beijing crackdown to remain
here.
   Hornbach continued the hearing until Sept. 29 and advised Wong to
seek Hoy's release from custody so she could seek medical treatment
for ulcer-like symptoms.
   David Ilchert, regional INS director, said Hoy would be examined
by a doctor today. She was being held at a Santa Clara County
women's detention facility.

   Fighting between the government and
guerrillas intensified as Vietnam's pullout deadline neared, but
Thai officials said today the resistance and Cambodian government
had agreed to more peace talks.
   Vietnamese soldiers, meanwhile, received gifts and were serenaded
at a farewell ceremony.
   In Bangkok, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan said that
after meetings in the past two weeks, Cambodia's three main
guerrilla factions and Premier Hun Sen agreed to future talks after
negotiations failed in Paris last month.
   The time and place for the talks had yet to be fixed, Chatichai
said at a news conference.
   There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas or the
Cambodian government.
   However, Chatichai said Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the leader of a
coalition of guerrillas, had suggested that the meeting be held in
Bangkok, Jakarta or Paris.
   ``We cannot let the Cambodian fighting go on any longer. If a
civil war happens Thailand will have to bear a greater burden of
Cambodian refugees,'' he said.
   Already about 300,000 refugees live along the Cambodian-Thai
border.
   A Soviet military adviser was quoted today as saying the
Cambodian government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas have thrown their
best troops into heavy fighting for a gem-rich town near the border.
   The Soviet adviser said Khmer Rouge troops succeeded in
controlling the ridge and mountains around the city of Pailin but
that they had not taken the town, located about 140 miles northwest
of Phnom Penh and known for ruby mines in the area.
   The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of
the town's residents had fled or been evacuated and that fighting
was fierce. His remarks, made in Russian in an interview with an
East European reporter, were made available to The Associated Press.
   The adviser said Cambodia's 196th Division, apparently its best,
was fighting with the 302nd Division of the Khmer Rouge, a force
formed in 1978 to serve as bodyguards for high-ranking Khmer Rouge
leaders when tensions with Vietnam were mounting.
   Soviet-backed Vietnam has been supporting the communist
government in Pnom Penh while China has backed the Khmer Rouge, who
governed from 1975 until 1978 and tried to carry out an agrarian
revolution that killed hundreds of thousands of people before the
Vietnamese invaded.
   There was no way to immediately confirm the adviser's report.
   Friday, Cambodian Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Ke Kim Yan said up
to 450 Khmer Rouge guerrillas were trying to carve out a ``liberated
zone'' around Pailin, and had intensified 120mm mortar shelling,
firing up to 2,000 rounds a day.
   The Cambodian resistance group, led militarily by the Khmer
Rouge, has its bases near the Thai border, in Thailand and in
Cambodia. It receives the bulk of its arms via Thailand from China.
   For the past three days, festive gatherings have been held across
Cambodia marking what Vietnam says is the withdrawal of the last
26,000 troops it sent since invading in December 1979 to oust the
Khmer Rouge.
   Guerrillas say the pullout, which Vietnam promises to complete by
Tuesday, is a sham. Observers say they believe the movement is
largely genuine.
   Crowds of villagers, holding placards reading ``Welcome, the
withdrawal Vietnamese troops from Cambodia,'' applauded and cheered
in unison after patriotic speeches by Cambodian and Vietnamese
officials.
   Some Vietnamese officers were presented with gifts and leis of
flowers. One officer was given a large portrait of the late
Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh sitting with Tou Samuth, one of the
founders of the Cambodian Communist Party.
   A band, dressed in dirty white uniforms, played throughout,
cranking out off-key renditions of the national anthems of Vietnam
and Cambodia.
   Vietnamese soldiers interviewed during the festivities said they
were looking forward to going home but that they were concerned for
their future.
   ``I hope to go home and stay in the military,'' said Nguyen Son,
from Can Tho province in Vietnam. ``But I am an enlisted man and my
country wants to cut our armed forces.''
   Vietnam has said it wants to cut the size of its military, which
because of its expense, has contributed to the country's economic
difficulties. Son, 22, said that if he can't stay in the army he
will return to his village and farm.
   The withdrawal is to end Vietnam's involvement in the decade-long
war that left more than 25,000 Vietnamese soldiers dead and its
economy in tatters.
   The guerrillas charge that Vietnam actually is leaving its troops
behind in various disguises.
   That is not possible, said John McAuliff, the American observer
from the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a Philadelphia-based
private group.
   ``It is just physically impossible for Vietnamese troops to stay
in this country in the quantities that would be needed'' without
being seen by the many foreign aid officials in Cambodia and on the
Thai-Cambodian border, he said.
   ``I won't report that I have proof of a complete withdrawal, but
we believe that Vietnam is withdrawing all its troops,'' said Bali
Ram Bhagat, a former Indian foreign minister representing India's
governing party.

   They gathered by the thousands in a high
school stadium to pray and to cry, to comfort each other and to
remember 20 young people who died when their school bus plunged into
a water-filled pit.
   ``The emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again,'' said
Sanjuanita Zamora, mayor of Alton, the town of 3,700 where the
accident occurred. ``A part of our lives has been taken away from
us.''
   ``We wish we could at this moment turn the clock back to avoid
what happened, but we cannot,'' Ms. Zamora told more than 10,000
people at Mission High School's stadium Friday.
   It's believed most of the victims, ranging in age from 12 to 18,
drowned when a soft drink truck ran a stop sign and rammed the bus
over a 40-foot cliff into the pit Thursday morning. At least 63
people were injured; three remained in critical condition late
Friday. The bus was headed to the high school.
   Federal investigators said Friday night an initial investigation
did not produce any evidence to support the claim of truck driver
Ruben Perez that his brakes failed.
   ``Nothing to date shows any indication of a failure in the
braking system,'' said Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation
Safety Board member. But he added that the probe had just begun.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Bill Clements assigned a team to study whether
the state should revise bus safety laws and require guard rails
around gravel pits and similar roadside hazards.
   There was no rail or fence around the pit in Alton. The bus had
only one emergency exit _ the back door _ and rescuers said many of
the students who died were trapped at the front of the vehicle.
   Drivers in Hidalgo County, which lies along the Mexican border,
drove with their headlights on Friday and flags were flown at
half-staff.
   At the memorial service, which replaced a canceled football game,
the mourners sat silently as the names of the dead were read. Some
wept and consoled each other through the 90-minute service attended
by more than 20 ministers and priests.
   Rolando Rocha, 16, who said he escaped through a window in the
bus but lost six friends, prayed on the field with his 14-year-old
brother, Ramiro, another survivor.
   Rolando, teary-eyed, said the stadium service made him feel
better, although he still hurts ``because my friends died.''
   Magdalee Salazar, 16, a Mission High junior, said she knew four
of the students who died. ``I felt that I owed them something. I
felt that it was best for me to come.''
   Orfilinda Jimenez, sophomore counselor at the school, said the
service was helpful. ``It's a way of dealing with it and everybody
feeling the same things together,'' she said.
   ``It will take more of this,'' said the Rev. Sostenes Campos, of
the Independence Church in nearby Sullivan City.
   Funerals and other memorial services will help the families and
friends of victims and survivors to heal, said Gustavo Zapata,
principal at Mission High.
   ``It's a way to release some of the grief and sadness that build
up,'' he said.
   At least 14 funerals were scheduled for today.
   About 500 people attended the funeral Friday of 12-year-old Elda
Patricia Cruz. Rev. Frank Gomez told them not to blame themselves or
question why the victims died.
   ``It doesn't help to ask why him or why her. Only God knows,''
Gomez said in Spanish and English.

<HEAD>Three Nobel Academy Members Quit, Two Cite Rushdie Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of the academy that awards
the Nobel Prize for literature have resigned, and two said they were
unhappy that the body did not denounce Iran's death threat against
Salman Rushdie.
   The secretary of the Swedish Academy, Sture Allen, confirmed
Thursday he received three letters of resignation but said they
could not be accepted because the academy's 200-year-old rules
stipulate that members are elected for life.
   Author Kerstin Ekman, one of the three to resign from the
18-member body, told Swedish radio afterward, ``No human can, at
least in our country, belong to an organization which she does not
want to be part of. ... I guess they just cannot admit that we
quit.''
   In any case, Allen said the resignations will not affect the work
of the academy. He declined further comment.
   The third resigning member, poet Werner Aspenstrom, did not
disclose his reasons but told Swedish television his motives
differed from those of his two colleagues.
   The resignations came weeks before the announcement of the winner
of the Nobel Prize for literature. The date is not set in advance
but traditionally falls in October.
   In explaining her reasons for resigning, Ms. Ekman said, ``I am
upset about the Rushdie affair.''
   She and another resigning colleague, former Academy Secretary
Lars Gyllensten, stopped taking part in the academy's work in
February.
   They said they were protesting because the academy refused to
condemn explicitly the death threat issued Feb. 14 by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Khomeini said Rushdie
blasphemed Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a bestseller
that stirred worldwide protests among Moslems.
   Several other Academy members have complained about the group's
stand on the Rushdie case but generally accepted its tradition of
avoiding official statements on political issues.
   Ms. Ekman said the three resigning members had not planned their
action together. She said she had submitted a resignation now to let
a substitute be elected.
   She also said the Academy was in need of renewal. ``Everybody
realizes that it has come to a standstill,'' she said.
   The Academy statutes were written by King Gustaf III, who founded
the institution in 1786. It has awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize
for literature since 1901.

<HEAD>Rockwell Will End Management Of Rocky Flats Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. bowed out suddenly
after 14 years as operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant,
marking the final breach between the company and the government over
hazardous waste disposal.
   The move was announced late Friday by the Department of Energy,
one day after Rockwell sued the government over the dispute at the
plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. The
contractor maintained it was impossible to follow both its contract
with DOE and the waste disposal rules of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   The DOE has identified Rocky Flats as the most environmentally
hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry because toxic
chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and threaten nearby
city water supplies.
   Adm. James Watkins, the energy secretary, said EG&amp;G Inc., a
Wellesley, Mass.-based scientific engineering firm, had been asked
to replace Rockwell. EG&amp;G officials will arrive at the plant Monday,
the DOE said.
   Watkins said he and Rockwell chairman Donald Beall had agreed to
change Rocky Flats' management ``in the best interest of both
parties.''
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, a critic of safety practices at the
plant, warned that a management change wouldn't end state efforts to
track possible waste violations at the plant.
   ``I am going to continue to hold the feet of DOE and the operator
to the fire to be sure that there is no endangerment to the citizens
of Colorado from the operation of the Rocky Flats plant,'' Romer
said. ``I have been informed by DOE that EG&amp;G is an experienced
operator and that there will be an orderly transition in which the
current Rocky Flats employees will retain their jobs.''
   The decision came so suddenly that plant employees were not
notified of the change until after the 4 p.m. shift change Friday
afternoon, Rockwell spokesman Pat Etchart said. It was announced
over a public-address system late in the afternoon, Etchart said.
   EG&amp;G is the prime contractor for DOE's Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory and is a contractor at the Nevada test site and
government facilities in New Mexico.
   EG&amp;G officials didn't respond to calls placed late Friday to the
firm's headquarters and branch offices in several western states.
   Rockwell sued the government Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, claiming conflicting federal rules require it to violate
hazardous waste disposal laws at the plant. The same day, the EPA
cited Rockwell for violating hazardous waste storage laws at Rocky
Flats.
   The lawsuit named the government, the Justice Department, the DOE
and EPA and asked the court to clarify the obligations of Rockwell
and the government in running the plant.
   A week ago, Rockwell threatened to close the plant unless the
hazardous waste regulations were clarified. Later in the day, DOE,
Environmental Protection Agency and Colorado officials announced a
plan to resolve the problems over the next year.
   But Beall said the assurances given by the government were
inadequate to protect Rockwell employees against possible criminal
prosecution for violating the environmental rules.
   The DOE's statement said Rocky Flats' current work force of 5,000
would not be affected by the change in management.
   Federal law prohibits storage of hazardous wastes at a production
site for more than 90 days, but there is no federally approved
disposal site or treatment process for Rocky Flats' wastes.
   Rockwell has been stockpiling wastes at Rocky Flats since Idaho
Gov. Cecil Andrus refused to accept further shipments at a temporary
storage site in Idaho.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa was still in
serious condition although the fever and the chest pains she
suffered for more than two weeks had subsided, her doctor said today.
   ``But her condition is not critical,'' said Dr. Rajen Wats at the
Woodlands Nursing Home, the hospital where the 79-year-old Roman
Catholic nun was admitted Sept. 5 with a high fever and irregular
heartbeat.
   Mother Teresa's condition twice become critical after she
suffered a heart attack in the hospital's intensive care unit Sept.
8 and occasional chest pains since then.
   ``We will have to observe her for two more weeks before we can
say if she is out of danger or not,'' Wats said.
   Doctors have said that after she leaves the hospital, Mother
Teresa will have to give up the hectic schedule that is partly
blamed for her illness.
   Despite poor health in recent years, she has traveled widely to
help the destitute and the dying, work that earned her a Nobel Peace
Prize in 1979.

   A nude sunbather was gunned down at
a secluded beach by an attacker demanding drugs, jolting this sleepy
tourist area where random violence is rare.
   Phillip Bogdanoff, 49, was lying on a beach blanket with his wife
Thursday afternoon when two men approached the couple and demanded
marijuana, Santa Barbara County sheriff's Sgt. Jan Bullard said.
   When Bogdanoff said he had none, one of the men shot him twice in
the head, killing him, Ms. Bullard said.
   Both men fled and remain at large, police said. Bogdanoff's wife,
Diana, 41, was not attacked.
   Nudity did not appear to figure as a motive in the killing, Ms.
Bullard said.
   ``There were no sexual overtones,'' she said. ``Nothing more to
it. Just a random, violent act.''
   The slaying at the beach about 20 miles up the coast from this

residents.
   ``We don't expect this kind of thing to happen around here,'' Ms.
Bullard said. ``It woke up a sleepy county.''

<TEXT>
   Some state legislators say the U.S.
Constitution must be amended to give states power that has been
seized by Congress.
   Leaders of the Council on State Governments, here for a three-day
conference, were scheduled to vote today on a proposal to float two
constitutional amendments intended to return power to the states.
   One would have the courts settle disputes between state
governments and Congress, and the other would allow states to
initiate amendments to the Constitution.
   If the council, which consists of about 175 legislators,
governors, attorneys general and state judges, decides to back the
amendments, the proposal would be forwarded to the National Council
of State Legislatures.
   If that 8,000-member group approves the proposed amendments,
members could begin seeking congressional approval in early 1990, he
said.
   ``This is where it really starts moving,'' Ohio Senate President
Stanley Aronoff, a member of the council, said Friday.
   Utah Senate President Arnold Christensen, chairman of the
council's executive committee, said he expects the proposed
amendments to win approval easily from the council. ``I haven't
heard of any opposition,'' he said.
   A resolution approved Friday by the council says the changes are
needed because Congress has intruded on state and local government
powers by requiring states to offer certain programs without
providing federal funds to pay for them.
   Aronoff, a Republican, said an amendment calling on the courts to
settle federal-state disputes is needed because the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled such disputes are purely political and aren't court
matters.
   The proposed change in the process for amending the Constitution
would let a three-fourths vote by states enact constitutional
amendments. Those amendments would take effect unless Congress
vetoed them within two years.
   Currently, constitutional amendments can be proposed by a
two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress, or put forth by a
constitutional convention called by the legislatures of two-thirds
of the states. In either case, amendments must be ratified by
legislatures in three-fourths of the states.

<HEAD>Company Claims Diabetes Testing Breakthrough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company says it has developed a painless
way for diabetics to test their blood sugar level without having to
prick their fingers for blood samples.
   David Purdy, president of Biocontrol Technology Inc. of Indiana,
said Friday that the company's new sensor uses electromagnetic
technology to measure blood glucose levels.
   A sensor about the size of a cereal box should be ready for sale
in about a year for use in doctors' offices, Purdy said. A home-use
model about the size of a portable telephone should be available in
two years.
   ``It's an intriguing development. If it works and does what they
claim, it would be a very important contribution to the care of the
patient with diabetes,'' said Jay S. Skyler, vice president of
American Diabetes Assocation and professor of medicine at the
University of Miami.
   ``One of the major things patients complain about is having to
stick their fingers. It really does get to be a nuisance,'' he said.
   The new glucose sensor uses a wand to direct an electromagnetic
beam through the skin, usually on the inside of the wrist, Purdy
said. The beam is refracted by varying amounts of blood glucose and
returns through the wand to the sensor's circuitry.
   The test takes two seconds, Purdy said, and the sensor provides a
visual readout and a paper printout of the analysis.
   ``Such a device would be a major breakthrough in care for
patients with diabetes,'' said Dr. David Finegold, pediatrics
endocrinologist at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and president
of the western Pennsylvania affiliate of the American Diabetes
Association.
   Finegold said Type I diabetics, who are usually younger, are a
minority of diabetics but require the most intensive treatment,
including regular insulin injections. Pregnant women who are
diabetic also are often in the Type I category, he said.
   Many physicians recommend Type I diabetics draw blood as often as
four times daily to regulate their insulin dosage, Finegold said.
Physicians often recommend that pregnant diabetics draw blood
samples as many as seven times each day.
   More than 11 million Americans have diabetes, including more than
6.5 million who have been diagnosed, according to the American
Diabetes Association in Alexandria, Va.
   The World Health Organization has estimated there are about 80

   Thousands of returning residents jammed
highways to the devastated capital today after Christian army Gen.
Michel Aoun accepted an Arab peace plan and fighting ebbed between
Syria troops and Aoun's forces.
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi, entrusted with supervising
the cease-fire, held contacts with army and militia commanders ahead
of the first meeting later today of a proposed security committee to
check any violations.
   Police said traditional front lines in Beirut, northern Lebanon
and in eastern mountains were ``generally quiet.''
   A police spokesman said no major clashes had been reported since
10 p.m. Friday.
   ``Volleys of automatic gunfire can be heard every now and then,
but no clashes in the military sense of the word,'' he said on
condition of anonymity in line with standing regulations.
   Six months of fighting have killed 929 people, wounded 2,738
others and forced all but 150,000 people of Beirut's 1.5 million
residents to flee. Some sought refuge in safer areas in Lebanon;
others left the country altogether.
   Thousands of cars packed with families, suitcases, mattresses and
blankets, jammed the main entrances to the city today.
   Khalil Hatab said he, his wife and six children had been living
in a room they rented in southern Lebanon shortly after the latest
round of fighting broke out March 8.
   ``Can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a
year. At certain times, we even had guests, relatives, neighbors and
friends who also escaped with no where to go,'' Hatab said during a
traffic jam on Ouzai, the southern entrance to Beirut.
   He said he was returning to his home in the west Beirut
neighborhood of Ras al-Nabaa because he believed the worst was over.
   Bahjat Jaber, a local reporter in Jounieh, north of Beirut, said
lines of bumper-to-bumper cars crowded the northern entrance into
the Christian heartland, which has been besieged by the Syrians and
their Moslem allies for six months.
   ``It seems like all the entire Lebanese population is heading to
Beirut today,'' he said.
   He said scores of school buses also were rolling into the city
apparently in preparation for the resumption of classes, which were
suspended during the violence.
   ``It's like magic. Yesterday Beirut was a ghost city. Today it is
bustling with life,'' Jaber said.
   The security committee proposed under the peace plan would
oversee implementation of a truce and the lifting of blockades
imposed by the warring factions on each other's ports.
   It also would monitor maritime operations to assure no weapons
shipments reach any of the Lebanese factions and set the stage for a
political settlement of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The proposal calls for a meeting outside Lebanon of the nation's
parliament to recommend political reforms that would distribute
power equally between Christians and Moslems.
   Christians have dominated the government, judiciary and army
since Lebanon's independence from France in 1943, when they were
thought to be the majority.
   Although no official census has been taken since 1932, Moslems
are now believed to make up 55 percent of the 4 million population.

Rally</HEAD>

   Police blocked entrances to the
capital today and strung barbed wire down a main street to stop an
unauthorized march by anti-apartheid women's groups. Organizers said
about 200 people were arrested.
   Police also used batons to clear black bystanders from Pretoria's
central square after scuffles broke out when right-wing whites in
swastika-marked khaki uniforms began hustling blacks away from the
site of an approved pro-apartheid rally. One white right-winger and
several blacks were arrested.
   The white extremists had received permission for their rally, but
the women's planned march to government headquarters was banned
because organizers refused to apply for a permit. The church where
marchers were to meet was blocked off with rolls of barbed wire and
guarded by scores of police officers.
   Zeni Tshongweni, a spokeswoman for the march organizers, said
about 200 people were arrested when they tried to assemble near the
Union Buildings, the government headquarters which was the intended
destination of the march. She said several people were injured when
police used whips and dogs to disperse the crowd.
   Police detained Richard Sergay, correspondent for the American
television network ABC, and several other journalists.
   Two buses, carrying Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and other blacks were
chased through the streets by about 25 yellow police vehicles with
sirens screaming and lights flashing. The police stopped the buses
and ordered Mrs. Mandela and the other occupants to leave Pretoria.
   ``We came here peacefully but they are seeking violence,'' Mrs.
Mandela told CBS News.
   ``It is the same as any other country in the world. People can't
break the law,'' said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, standing
among riot police behind the barbed wire that blocked the entrance
to St. Alban's Anglican Cathedral.
   A two-page notice was tacked to the door of the church, saying
the government obtained a court order to stop a church service and
the planned march to the Union Buildings.
   Two tear gas cannon trucks were parked nearby and hundreds of
police lined the streets as the city center came to a standstill.
   The government banned the march because the organizers refused to
ask for official permission, although women's groups said they had
notified top government officials including President F.W. de Klerk
and talked with Pretoria traffic police.
   The government granted permission for two white supremacist
groups to hold rallies two blocks from the cathedral because they
had sought permission, officials said.
   At the first rally a banner called for the hanging of Nelson
Mandela and for the release from prison of Barend Strydom, a white
former policeman convicted early this year of killing seven black
people in a shooting spree in the center of Pretoria.
   As the meeting ended, an altercation began when about 40 blacks
tried to walk across the square where the rally was held and were
stopped by members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, who wear
khaki uniforms and use swastika symbols.
   Police began herding away the blacks, who were flashing peace
signs, and calling out to the whites, ``Peace, we all have the same
blood.'' Suddenly police began running through the square, arresting
blacks, letting their dogs loose and ordering reporters and everyone
else from the area.
   It was not immediately clear whether the second right-wing rally
would be allowed to go ahead.
   Organizers of the women's march said police blocked almost all
traffic from the black townships around Pretoria.
   Traffic was backed up from Pretoria's main thoroughfare to the
freeway leading north from Johannesburg as police at roadblocks
stopped and searched buses and cars filled with women and turned
them away.
   About 30,000 women had been expected to defy the ban and try to
march.
   About 200 women, most of them white, made their way to a park at
the bottom of the ridge where the Union Buildings stand, but police
arrived and ordered them to leave. They did not move quickly enough
and several were arrested.
   A.R. Dawood of the Transvaal Indian Congress said police hit some
of the women with their batons.
   In obtaining a court order against the women's march, lawyers for
the police had argued that the proximity of the right-wing rallies
might lead to conflict.
   The women's groups said they had made extensive arrangements,
including training parade marshals and setting up first-aid
stations, to ensure their march was peaceful.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate neighborhoods, schools and health services.

   OPEC ministers will take a new look at the world
oil market over the weekend and decide whether they can increase
production without sending crude prices tumbling.
   On the eve of their talks, some ministers of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries seemed reluctant to tamper with the
cartel's current output accord.
   The meeting was to begin today, but there was no indication of
how long it would last.
   Algeria's oil minister, Sadek Boussena, insisted upon arriving
Friday in Geneva, ``There's no need to raise the (production)
ceiling as long as the price objective is not met.''
   Rilwanu Lukman, president of OPEC, was the last to arrive in
Geneva for the opening round of talks later in the day.
   Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister, said the price of oil ``could
do a little bit more.''
   ``We would like it to be 18 (dollars a barrel),'' he told
reporters at the hotel where the ministers are staying.
   Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said he favored
a ``reasonable increase'' in the supply cap. He gave no specifics.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed in June on a production ceiling of
19.5 million barrels a day in the last six months of the year. Its
price target was set at $18 a 42-gallon barrel.
   But analysts say heavy cheating by Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates has helped kick supply up to 22 million barrels a day or
more.
   Prices have remained fairly firm, but they are under OPEC's
target.
   ``We still have to obtain the goal of $18 ... We should work on
it,'' said Ecuador's oil minister, Diego Tamariz.
   Shakshuki said, ``Eighteen dollars is better than increasing the
quota.''
   Prices haven't hit the $18 mark in the past three months.
   A basket of seven major crudes monitored by OPEC averaged $17.04
a barrel last week. It went above $18 last spring.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of American oil, has
been trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 a barrel.
   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,
predicted prices would slip from 50 cents to $1 a barrel if the
cartel increased production without halting members' cheating.
   OPEC ministers agreed in June to meet this month and decide
whether to raise their output 500,000 barrels a day in the final
three months of 1989.
   MacLeod said such an increase probably would translate into total
production of 22.5 million barrels a day.
   The organization's secretary-general, Subroto of Indonesia, said
that 22 million barrels a day ``looks like the demand for OPEC oil
in the fourth quarter'' of the year.
   In addition to the supply ceiling, the ministers' agenda included
a discussion of the best way to set their quotas. Each country is
assigned a daily quota.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want bigger shares as do some
other nations. To press their demands, the two countries have been
pumping as much as double their daily quotas of about a million
barrels each, analysts say.
   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, told reporters
that his pledge in June to rein in production had been
``conditional.''
   ``If everybody sticks to the quota, fine. If anybody breaks it,
the others have the same right,'' he said.
   The talks will officially be held by an OPEC monitoring panel
made up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela.
   The cartel other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates _ also were invited to attend.

   Irving Berlin, the Russian cantor's son whose
songs such as ``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``White
Christmas'' and ``God Bless America'' became the essence of American
music, has died at age 101.
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
   Of Berlin's music, Gould said: ``It's become part of our
language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul.
   ``It's the kind of finish of an era.''
   Berlin died in his sleep at his Manhattan town house Friday
afternoon, said his son-in-law, Alton E. Peters. Asked if Berlin had
been ill, Peters said, ``No, he was 101 years old. ... He just fell
asleep.''
   An actor, singer, and songwriter, Berlin began his career in the
early days of vaudeville and his songs for a time so dominated the
stage and screen that the late composer, Jerome Kern, said: ``Berlin
has no place in American music. He is American music.''
   In a musical career that began with a job as a singing waiter,
Berlin wrote nearly 1,000 songs, from his first big hit,
``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1911, to ``Puttin' on the Ritz,''
which was revived in 1983 by the Dutch singer Taco and was a hit on
the rock charts.
   Berlin was an immigrant Russian whose ``God Bless America''
became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. A Jew, his
``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' became Christian holiday
traditions.
   ``American music was born at his piano,'' violinist Isaac Stern
said on Berlin's 100th birthday.
   So timeless was his appeal that his songs have become hits over
and over, performed by such artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra
Streisand and Diana Ross. ASCAP records show 25 of his songs have
topped the popular music charts.
   ``Blue Skies,'' a top hit when he penned it in 1926, reached the
charts again 51 years later on an album by country singer Willie
Nelson.
   Berlin played the piano by ear and never stopped making what he
described as ``songs with heart.'' Even in his 90s, he talked of
adding yet another musical to his credits, which included 19 stage
musicals and 15 movie scores.
   At his peak, one smash followed another so readily that Cole
Porter once said Berlin ``can't help but write hits.''
   Berlin, along with 11 other American immigrants, received a medal
from President Reagan during the Statue of Liberty centennial
celebrations in July 1986.
   Reagan the actor was featured in the mammoth, flag-waving 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' with songs from Berlin.
   ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully
talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions,
and will live on forever,'' Reagan said.
   Always a private man, Berlin declined to attend a Carnegie Hall
gala, led by Sinatra and Leonard Bernstein, to mark his 100th
birthday on May 11, 1988.
   He was mourned by artists from across the spectrum of American
music.
   ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter,'' said
opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's songs. ``He was
not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote the 1969 Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music.''
   ``One could hear the dancing by just singing the lyrics,''
cabaret singer Bobby Short said. ``He is perhaps the last of the
giants _ and I think that's not a bad way to go.''
   Actress and dancer Ginger Rogers remembered Berlin with a bit of
song from his ``Cheek to Cheek,'' from the movie ``Top Hat.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang, then broke off. ``It was like
heaven,'' she said, describing the thrill of working with the likes
of Berlin and Fred Astaire.
   The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes,
which began in the World War I era with ``Watch Your Step,''
starring Irene and Vernon Castle, and ran through such post-World
War II hits as ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' both
with Ethel Merman.
   ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many Berlin wrote for
the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every
Ziegfeld extravaganza.
   In Hollywood, Berlin did the scores of ``Top Hat,'' starring
Astaire and Miss Rogers; ``Holiday Inn'' with Astaire and Bing
Crosby; ``Blue Skies''; ``Easter Parade''; ``White Christmas''; and
``There's No Business Like Show Business.''
   His last Broadway show was ``Mr. President'' in 1962. His last
song, ``An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966.
   His music-publishing empire earned him a fortune, which he
readily shared with his country in wartime or with favorite causes.
Since 1939 the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America have been
getting the royalties from ``God Bless America.''
   Berlin was awarded three medals for his works and a special Tony
award for his contribution to the musical theater. He won a
congressional medal for the acclaimed World War II musical, ``This
is the Army,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for
``White Christmas.''
   Explaining the seemingly endless gusher of successful songs,
Berlin said his tunes were merely rewrites of a handful of his best
numbers. ``All good songwriters have no more than half a dozen good
tunes in their systems, and if they have that many they're liberally
blessed,'' he once said.
   Berlin never learned to read or write music and his piano playing
was confined to the key of F sharp. He called songwriting hard work,
but director Josh Logan once recalled that Berlin dashed off the
first verse of ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better'' during a
six-minute cab ride.
   Celebrity and wealth didn't seem to touch the shy personality of
the intense, short man with wavy, slicked-down hair and dark
glasses. He lived a simple life, centered on his songwriting and his
family _ his late wife, Ellin, and their three daughters.
   Berlin was brought up in poverty amid the immigrant swarm on
Manhattan's Lower East Side. Born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, he
was 5 when his family emigrated from Temun in eastern Russia. He was
one of eight children and acquired his earliest musical education
from his father, a cantor. But his father's death put an end to
Berlin's formal education and, at age 8, he went from the second
grade to the streets to earn a living.
   Known as Izzy, Berlin sold newspapers, guided a blind, singing
beggar and worked in vaudeville. In 1907, he wrote the words to his
first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy'' in collaboration with the piano
player at the Chinatown bar where he worked as a singing waiter.
   The song earned him 37 cents in royalties and a new name _ the
sheet music cover erroneously credited the words to ``I. Berlin.''
   In 1911, at the age of 23, he was contributing songs to the
Ziegfeld Follies. His ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' with its ``ragged
meter'' ushered jazz onto the popular scene and established Berlin
as a master of Tin Pan Alley.
   Berlin's marriage to Dorothy Goetz the following year ended after
six months when his bride died of typhoid contracted during their
honeymoon in Havana. In his grief, Berlin composed ``When I Lost
You.''
   His marriage in 1926 to Ellin Mackay followed one of the most
widely reported courtships of the decade. His wife's father, a
prominent Roman Catholic layman and head of Postal Telegraph Co.,
had opposed the union.
   Berlin's wife died of a stroke at age 85 in July 1988. Berlin is
survived by his three daughters, Mary Ellin, Linda and Elizabeth.
   Services will be private, said Bill Hartgrove, evening manager at
the Frank Campbell funeral home in Manhattan.

<HEAD>ETA Claims Parcel Bombing That Killed Fish Store Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Basque separatist group ETA claimed
responsibility today for the parcel bombing death of the owner of a
fish store in this northern city and said it had mistaken the man
for a policeman.
   In a statement published in the radical Basque newspaper Egin,
ETA said the killing Sept. 12 was ``an irreparable error and
mistake'' and apologized to the victim's family.
   ETA claimed the bomb was intended for a policeman who used the
name of the dead man as a cover, but added: ``The sole
responsibility is ours for this death.''
   Luis Reina Mesonera died of injuries suffered when a parcel he
received in the mail exploded as he tried to open it, police said.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region. In its 21-year campaign of violence, ETA has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people, including 13 so far
this year.
   ETA recently claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb that killed
a prison guard's mother Aug. 11 and for another parcel bomb sent to
a Basque businessman Sept. 5 that was detected and safely detonated.
   On Wednesday, a parcel bomb explosion killed a postman in the
Basque city of San Sebastian. No group claimed responsibility, but
Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told SER radio today that ETA
was probably responsible.
   ETA is an acronym for Basque Land and Liberty in the Basque
language.

   Irving Berlin's songs were so much a part of
America for generations that it would be hard to think of life
without him, his admirers said.
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone,'' said opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's
songs.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' Merrill said. ``He was not a
great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Berlin, whose most memorable compositions included ``White
Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade'' and ``God Bless America,'' died
Friday night at his home at the age of 101.
   Cabaret singer Bobby Short said he thought Berlin would be
remembered as ``a very, very, very important, very great American
composer. He is perhaps the last of the giants _ and I think that's
not a bad way to go.''
   ``His musicality was constantly astonishing. People who thought
they could pin down the Irving Berlin style would be surprised to
find his newest song a complete turnabout,'' Short said.
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers paid tribute to Berlin by humming a
phrase from his ``Cheek to Cheek.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang sadly in a telephone interview from
her home in Eagle Point, Ore.
   Breaking off to describe the thrill of working with Berlin and
Fred Astaire on the movie ``Top Hat,'' she said: ``It was like
heaven.''
   Miss Rogers recalled the songwriter's kindness when she was first
breaking into show business.
   ``I went into his music company to get some songs,'' she said.
``He had no reason to make charming conversation to me, but he made
very gentle conversation and encouraged me because I was very new to
show business.''
   Ronald Reagan, who in his acting days was featured in the 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' said: ``Nancy and I are deeply
saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical
genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``The
generations of people, millions of people, have danced to it, have
lived it, have romanced it.
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul. It's the kind of finish of an era,'' Gould said.``I
can't believe that he's not here.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote 1969's Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music. His contributions to American popular music are
immeasurable.''
   Singer Paul Anka said: ``Throughout my career as a writer of
songs, I've always idolized Irving Berlin as the consummate master
of words and music.
   ``He wrote `God Bless America' _ May God bless Irving Berlin.''

<TEXT>
   The red star, the symbol of Communist
rule in the Soviet bloc for four decades, will be removed from all
public buildings in Hungary to reflect the country's move to a
multiparty democracy.
   Government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok told reporters Friday the time
had come to replace the red star with the Hungarian coat of arms.
   ``In previous decades, the symbols of the working class movement
were widely used, but now state symbols will take their place on
public buildings,'' he said.
   Bajnok did not say exactly when the red star will be removed from
the top of Budapest's sprawling Parliament building. He said removal
of the huge symbol would be quite expensive, involving the use of
helicopters.
   Currently the red star decorates all Hungarian public buildings,
including government ministries, radio and television, regional and
local government buildings and factories.

man in connection with the fatal shooting of Frank Budd, father of
track star Zola Budd, officers said today.
   Police said they found a shotgun and pickup truck which were
missing from Budd's farmhouse when they arrested the 24-year-old man
Friday night in Welkom, 60 miles north of the farm near Bloemfontein.
   Police did not identify the man, but the independent South
African Press Association said he was expected to appear in court
Monday on a charge of murder. Newspapers said today that police had
been seeking a young man who had been doing construction work on the
farm, where Budd's body was found Friday.
   Police said the 56-year-old retired printer had two shotgun
wounds in the left side of his body when it was found in the bedroom
of a house he built on the farm of a friend.
   Ms. Budd and her father did not communicate in recent years and
he did not attend his daughter's April 15 wedding in Bloemfontein,
saying he had not been invited. ``I don't know what to say. What can
a person say?'' Ms. Budd said upon learning of her father's death
Friday ngith.
   Budd was divorced from Ms. Budd's mother.
   Zola Budd rose to prominence as a frail, barefooted teen-ager who
broke a string of South African and world records.
   Many sports fans remember her collision with American runner Mary
Decker during the 3,000-meter run in the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles.
   Decker, the favorite, was knocked out of the race, while Budd
finished seventh to a chorus of boos.
   Ms. Budd set several distance running world records during her
career and twice won the world cross-country championship while
living and training in Britain. But she was constantly dogged by
anti-apartheid protesters who said she should not be allowed to
compete because of her South African connections.
   Ms. Budd, 23, returned to South Africa in May 1988 and, after
marryig South African businessman Mike Pieterse, said she would
remain in her homeland.

<HEAD>Black Box Confirms Bomb on UTA Flight</HEAD>

   Analysis of the black box retrieved from the
wreckage of a French airliner confirmed that explosives blew the
plane apart above the Tenere Desert, killing all 171 people aboard,
the government said today.
   Examination of the DC-10's flight data and voice recorder ``show
that the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a total
interruption, indicating an in-flight explosion,'' said a statement
from the Transport Ministry.
   The announcement signals the start of an intensive search for the
individual or group responsible for the bombing Tuesday of UTA
Flight 772 en route from Brazzaville, Congo to Paris.
   Police are examining the plane's passenger list for suspects,
concentrating on nine people who got off in the Chad capital,
N'Djamena, the plane's last stop before it exploded over the desert
in eastern Niger.
   Investigators now will attempt to determine the precise nature of
the explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and, most
importantly, how it got on board.
   The pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad, based in
Lebanon, claimed responsiblity for the crash in telephone calls in
London and Paris. Officials said they could not authenticate the
claim.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting an
unidentifed source at the presidential Elysee Palace, said Friday
that authorities would focus their manhunt among the ``Shiite
network'' in Africa.
   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, quoted Islamic militants loyal to
Iran earlier this week as charging France with reneging on a 1988
deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held in
Lebanon. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks on
French interests in Africa.
   France continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyond
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
   Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a deal
in which France secured release of the hostages by agreeing to free
Anis Naccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a life
sentence for attempting to murder former Iranian Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar in France in 1980.
   The French news magazine L'Express reported Friday that French
agents were trying to dismantle Islamic terrorist cells based in
France's former West African colonies.
   French officials denied portions of the L'Express article that
indicated officials in Paris had prior knowledge of a possible
terrorist attack.
   French soldiers and military doctors working at the wreckage site
were to begin airlifting the bodies of victims to Agadez, a village
in central Niger, and then on to the capital Niamey for
identification, French military sources in Chad said. Rugged desert
conditions and temperatures of up to 113 have hampered rescue work.

   Pope John Paul II today visited a maximum
security prison for Mafia criminals, blessing the inmates and urging
them to break free from their ``moral chains.''
   The pope, who is on a three-day tour of Tuscany, said he was a
``brother among brothers'' with the 150 convicts housed in the 15th
century fortress prison that sits atop this medieval hill town.
   Known as the Fortezza (fort), the prison was a castle begun by
Walter de Brienne, Duke of Athens, in 1343 and completed by Lorenzo
the Magnificent in 1472. It has been used as a prison since 1848.
   Prison officials said most of the inmates were convicted of
belonging to organized crime syndicates such as the Sicilian Mafia,
Neapolitan Camorra and Calabrian 'ndrangheta. Many were convicted of
murder, and 15 are serving life sentences.
   The inmates clapped and sang as the pope entered the prison
courtyard. The area, enclosed by iron bars, normally serves as space
for the inmates to play sports.
   Many prisoners bowed and kissed John Paul's ring as he walked
down the carpeted aisle and patted them on the head.
   ``Here I am among you, brother among brothers,'' the pope said,
``for a visit looked forward to not only by you, but also by me for
the affection that I bring you, to people who wish to reconcile
themselves with society and find a new place to collaborate
constructively for the common good.''
   ``There is a liberation of physical chains, which for human
beings certainly has great importance, as you can testify. But there
is also ... a liberation from moral chains.''
   The pope said he was praying that the inmates show ``perseverance
in your desire to collaborate in the construction of a free and just
society.''
   Before the pope spoke, a 26-year-old murder convict gave the pope
a welcoming speech.
   ``Your salute and your blessing are very important for making us
accept ourselves and making us accepted by the whole community,''
said Rocco Morano, serving a 21-year sentence for murder in
Calabria. ``This meeting is a turning point of redemption for all of
us.''
   It was the third time John Paul has visited an Italian prison. In
December 1983, he went to Rome's Rebibbia prison to forgive Mehmet
Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot him in St. Peter's Square in
1981. The pope has also visited the prison in Civitavecchia near
Rome.
   The pope celebrated Mass in Voleterra's Piazza dei Priori,
bordered by medieval mansions, before heading for nearby Lucca. On
Sunday he will visit Pisa before returning to Rome.

<HEAD>Opposition Journalist Picked to Head State Media Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki today
named an opposition journalist and specialist in Soviet affairs to
head the committee that controls state media, the official news
agency announced.
   Andrzej Drawicz, 57, a Solidarity activist and former political
prisoner, will take over the chairmanship of the Radio and
Television Committee from the former longtime government spokesman
Jerzy Urban, the PAP agency said.
   The appointment is considered one of the most important for the
East bloc's first government not led by Communists, removing control
of the mass media from the Communist Party for the first time since
World War II.
   Mazowiecki has promised that the state-owned mass media will
become pluralistic and honest.
   ``The government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of
speech for all sections of public opinion. The right of access to
radio and television must be equal to all,'' he said in unveiling
his government to parliament earlier this month.
   The Mazowiecki Cabinet, installed Sept. 12, includes four
Communists among its 24 members.
   The head of radio and television was the biggest remaining
question mark of Mazowiecki's government. The post will not retain
Cabinet status, reflecting the new government's view that there
should be nothing like an ``information minister'' shaping public
opinion.
   ``This change is not just a replacement at the post of chairman,
but it is an issue of credibility, and that is why it is so
significant for the new government,'' said Krzysztof Kozlowski, a
Solidarity senator from Krakow who negotiated mass media reforms
during ``round-table'' negotiations this year.
   Drawicz, a Warsaw native, has no significant experience in
broadcasting, but he is respected as a journalist and known for his
admiration of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of
perestroika and glasnost, or economic restructuring and openness.
   Like Mazowiecki and thousands of other Solidarity activists,
Drawicz was jailed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown on
Solidarity. The Communist Party reversed itself this year and agreed
to reinstate Solidarity's legal status.
   Solidarity then scored a landslide victory in June parliamentary
elections, enabling it to form a coalition and take control of the
government.
   Drawicz has published many articles both in the state-sanctioned
and underground press about the changes taking place in the Soviet
Union under Gorbachev. He is also a translator of Russian literature.
   Urban, whom Drawicz replaces, was the chief defender of Communist
policies as government spokesman from 1981 until this year.

   The main guerrilla group fighting to end
white rule in South Africa has dismissed President F.W. de Klerk's
pledges of reform and called for continued violence against the
Pretoria government.
   The African National Congress released a statement Friday night
saying, ``The rhetoric mouthed by de Klerk at his inauguration once
more bears out our firm conviction that no white minority regime
possesses either the will or the capacity to bring about a
fundamental change of South Africa.
   ``The promises to execute his mandate for change over five years
are as empty as they are insolent.''
   De Klerk said in his inaugural address Wednesday that the
government would deal firmly with unrest and terrorism.
   The ANC responded, ``His undisguised threat to persist in a
policy of repression against people testifies to the violence
intrinsic to the system over which he presides.''
   ``This intransigent attitude leaves us no option but to
continuously escalate our multipronged offensive including its armed
component, to overthrow the regime of racist tyranny,'' the ANC said.
   The African National Congress formed an exile headquarters in
Zambia and began a campaign of sabotage in 1961, a year after it was
banned in South Africa.

<TEXT>
   College students are smart enough to tell a spoof
of Cliff's Notes from the real thing _ especially because the parody
publication is labeled ``satire'' five times on the cover _ a court
said.
   The explanation, released Friday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, gives the background for the court's Sept. 5 decision to
let Spy magazine sell its send-up of Cliff's student guide to
classic literature.
   The ruling overturns a lower court order issued at the request of
Cliff's Notes Inc., which sued the Spy Notes publisher, Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc., over the satire.
   The publisher complained that Spy Notes _ which pokes fun at two
novels popular with the yuppie set _ looks too much like the slender
Cliff's pamphlets students have been using for years to crib
comments for book reports.
   Spy Notes gives humorous plot summaries, commentary and questions
for review on the contemporary novel ``Bright Lights, Big City'' by
Jay McInerney and ``Slaves of New York,'' a short story collection
by Tama Janowitz.
   It includes the Novel-O-Matic, a slide rule-like device so
readers can create their own 1980s novels.
   The three-judge appeals panel wrote: ``We conclude that the
parody cover of Spy Notes, although it surely conjures up the
original and goes to great lengths to use some of the identical
colors and aspects of the cover design of Cliff's Notes, raises only
a slight risk of consumer confusion that is outweighed by the public
interest in free expression.''
   The judges noted that the cover of Spy Notes carries the words
``a satire'' five times in bright red letters on the front cover and
four times on the back. They also said that a substantial portion of
Spy Notes' potential audience, college students or college-educated
adults, overlaps with Cliff's Notes' audience.
   ``As a result, the name `Spy' in the title, the notation, `A Spy
Book' emblazoned on the cover of Spy Notes and the use of a prepack
marketing device prominently displaying the `Spy' name should alert
the buyer that Spy Notes is a parody of some sort, or at least, that
it is not the same product as Cliff's Notes,'' the judges said.
   Doubleday spokeswoman Jacqueline Deval said Spy Notes would be on
sale in two weeks.

   Michelin Group of France agreed to acquire the
privately held Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. in a $1.5 billion deal
that will allow the company to overtake Goodyear as the world's
largest tire maker.
   The deal announced Friday was the latest in a string of takeovers
in recent years that have put American tire brands like Firestone
and General in foreign hands.
   Michelin will pay $690 million for Uniroyal and assume $810
million in debt, company officials said.
   ``We believe this is a fine opportunity for the Uniroyal Goodrich
Tire Co.,'' said B. Charles Ames, chairman of Uniroyal Goodrich and
a principal in Clayton &amp; Dubilier, a private New York investment
firm that helped structure the deal.
   Uniroyal Goodrich will operate as a subsidiary of Michelin and
keep its headquarters in Akron. The company will continue to make
and distribute Uniroyal, BFGoodrich and other well-known brands of
tires and retain its corporate identity, Michelin spokesman Jim
Morton said.
   Michelin, based in Clermont-Ferrand, France, was locked in a
three-way contest with Akron-based Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and
Bridgestone of Japan to be the world's largest tire company.
   If regulators in the United States and Canada approve the deal,
Michelin will surpass Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. as the world's
largest tire company, said Saul Ludwig, a tire analyst with the
Cleveland-based Raulston &amp; Co.
   The Michelin Group reported 1988 sales of $8.7 billion. Uniroyal
Goodrich had sales of $2.2 billion in 1988.
   Goodyear had sales of $10.8 billion in 1988.
   Bridgestone Corp. of Japan became the third-largest tire maker
with its $2.4 billion acquition of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in
1987.
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier took Uniroyal private in a management-led $950
million buyout in 1985. Martin H. Dubilier, the firm's chairman,
said Uniroyal needed a partner to help finance $600 million in
improvements over the next five years to remain competitive.
   ``We saw the need in the long term for a partner,'' Dubilier
said. ``Michelin approached us. They have the resources to make us
more competitive.''
   Uniroyal Goodrich became the second-largest tire manufacturer in
North America and fifth-largest in the world when B.F. Goodrich Co.
and Uniroyal Inc. of Middlebury, Conn., merged their tire operations
in 1986.
   Last year, Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy acquired Armstrong Tire Co. of
New Haven, Conn., and in 1984, Continental Ag of West Germany bought
Akron, Ohio-based General Tire Co.

   Iran denied today it was involved in two
bomb blasts in Mecca in July, and Tehran-supported terrorists vowed
to avenge Saudi Arabia's execution of 16 Shiite Moslems convicted of
setting the explosions.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic New Agency and Tehran Radio
quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as urging Moslems around the
world to ``break their silence over these atrocities'' by Saudi
Arabia's royal rulers.
   A statement from the fundamentalist Hezbollah said the executions
were ``a terrorist act ... The deep grudge which rules the actions
of the terrorist pagan regime ... will be a motive for avenging the
blood of the oppressed.''
   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the pro-Iranian umbrella group
thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   A Pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims were wounded in
the bombings on July 10 near the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's
holiest city.
   Sixteen Kuwaiti nationals were beheaded Thursday for the blasts,
believed connected to an age-old feud between Sunni and Shiite
Moslems. Most Iranians are Shiites, while Saudis and other gulf
state Arabs are mainly Sunnis.
   Iran's spokesman, who was not identified, denied Saudi charges
that Iranian diplomats in Kuwait trained and equipped the terrorists
who set off explosions at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage, or
hajj.
   He said recorded confessions of the condemned men, screened by
Saudi television, were ``false allegations disseminated by the
Riyadh government.''
   Saudi Arabia said the executed men all were Kuwaiti nationals,
but most were of Iranian, Saudi or Qatari origin. Four other
defendants were sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison and 1,000 to
1,500 whiplashes for the bombings. Another nine people were
acquitted. The rulings were made and upheld by lower and appeal
courts made up of Islamic scholars.
   The Iranian spokesman rejected confessions by the condemned men
that they were provided with explosives and timing devices by two
Iranian officers at the embassy in Kuwait, Mohammed Reza Gholoum and
Sadek Ali Reza.
   ``Those people were never employed in the Iranian Embassy in
Kuwait, and the Kuwaiti government is fully aware of this,'' the
spokesman said.
   Kuwait has not commented on the executions.
   The Iranian spokesman said the attacks were carried out by
``mercenaries working for Saudi Arabia ... to suppress Moslems who
... reject the Saudi rulers' control of the two holy shrines'' _
Mecca and Medina.
   Two years ago, he charged, Saudi Arabia pushed pilgrims ``into
blood and dust for the crime of disavowing the pagans.''
   More than 400 people, mostly Iranians, died in clashes with Saudi
security forces in Mecca in 1987.
   The disturbances were the most serious of a series of incidents
during pilgrimages since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, fueled
by Iranian efforts to politicize the hajj and encourage other Moslem
nations to seize shrines at Mecca and Medina from the control of the
kingdom's Saud royal family.
   After the violence, Saudi Arabia limited the number of pilgrims
and two years ago broke relations with Tehran, citing subversion and
terrorism.
   Lately, Iran's new President Hashemi Rafsanjani has indicated he
would like to mend the rift.
   The Iranian spokesman said Riyadh's accusations against Tehran
are part of a campaign by Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan and
Interior Minister Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz to keep relations strained.
   ``This faction strongly desires continuation of enmity,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, taking a break today from
recreation and work on his United Nations speech, called on lawyers
to involve themselves in community service and ``protect the
unprotected.''
   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of the
Catholic Lawyers Guild, also urged the legal community to work for
rights of the unborn in the fight over abortion.
   ``Use your talents, your energy, and your professional resources
to reaffirm the right to life as the most fundamental freedom,'' he
said.
   The president travelled to Boston from his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he is spending the weekend before
heading to the United Nations on Monday.
   Hitting one of his favorite themes _ the call to community
service _ Bush told the lawyers in his speech to help the
illiterate, the homeless and others in need.
   ``I challenge you, as Catholic lawyers, not to give in to the
dismay of those today, who in the error of alarm have wandered from
the basic convictions to which our nation is pledged. I challenge
you to rekindle and foster a love of justice.''
   ``Part of your task is to use your talents _ to speak for those
unable to speak for themselves ... We must remember the
unremembered. Protect the unprotected. And stand up for those who
live in a world of pain,'' Bush said.
   At Kennebunkport, preparations for his first speech as president
to the U.N. on Monday were dominating Bush's work agenda over the
weekend, an administration official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
central part of Bush's address would be East-West relations,
including the talks that were concluding in Wyoming today between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Officials in Wyoming said Baker and Shevardnadze reached
agreement on on-site inspections of each other's underground nuclear
test sites and on ``trial verification'' of each other's stockpiles
of long-range nuclear weapons.
   Bush met with Shevardnadze at the White House on Thursday and
received a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on arms
control issues.
   Bush stopped on the way to Kennebunkport to stump for the GOP's
embattled gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey, Rep. Jim Courter.
   Courter is in an uphill race against Democratic Rep. James Florio
to replace the outgoing Republican Gov. Thomas Kean.
   In sharply partisan remarks, Bush told a fund-raising luncheon
the contest represents ``the future versus the past. Policies that
work versus policies that don't. A better future for our children,
or one of lost opportunity.''
   He also defended his plan to cut the capital gains tax against
Democratic charges that it would be a tax break for the rich. ``It
is a tax adjustment that is going to create jobs in America and that
is why I am going to continue to fight for it,'' said Bush.
   Before heading to his seaside compound, Bush also made a brief
stop at a remote tree farm in nearby Wells to underscore his
position on capital gains taxes, which are levied on profits from
sales of real estate, stocks and other assets.
   Farm owner Martin Morse told Bush that 1986 changes in the
capital gains tax law had cost him more than $4,000 in one year.
Morse said tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on sales of their
trees because the trees are considered tangible assets rather than
merchandise.
   Bush also squeezed in nine holes of golf before nightfall with
his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and fished for a
short time.

<TEXT>
   Less than two years after the United
States withdrew from Cambodia, Khmer Rouge guerrillas swept in from
the bush to unleash one of the most barbaric revolutions of modern
times.
   This month, as Vietnam withdraws troops that have propped up the
Communist government, the Khmer Rouge again are poised to strike
from the jungles. And many fear that Cambodia will again become the
land of the killing fields.
   Led by a ruthless Communist with the alias of Pol Pot, the Khmer
Rouge withstood massive U.S. bombing and won the Cambodian war with
probably no more than 60,000 fighters in 1975. Their opponents _ the
government of U.S.-backed Gen. Lon Nol _ fielded 300,000 men.
   The ratio is roughly the same today. Khmer Rouge strength is
estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 and Phnom Penh's at about 150,000.
   While there are new power brokers in Phnom Penh, the top Khmer
Rouge leadership remains unchanged. Although the 61-year-old Pol Pot
claimed he resigned from his last official post in June, he still is
believed to be in firm command.
   The secretive guerrilla chief, who has refused interviews for 10
years, spends his time along the Thai-Cambodian border and in China,
the key Khmer Rouge arms supplier.
   Other durable veterans are Pol Pot's right-hand man Ieng Sary and
nominal Khmer Rouge head Khieu Samphan, whose doctoral thesis was
the blueprint for a bloody agrarian revolution.
   Heading the Khmer Rouge army is Son Sen, who approved the grisly
tortures and executions of 20,000 alleged dissidents at Phnom Penh's
Tuol Sleng prison during the 1975-78 reign of terror. Another key
commander is Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher'' for his murderous ways.
   These men have admitted to only ``some mistakes,'' and claim to
have changed policies and methods.
   After being driven from Phnom Penh by a Vietnamese invasion in
January 1979, the Khmer Rouge operated from bases along the rugged
Thai-Cambodian frontier. From there, its leaders announced they had
shed radical Communism in favor of private property, freedom of
religion, and a non-aligned foreign policy.
   It was a dramatic shift _ one met by instant skepticism. In their
heydey, the Khmer Rouge had ``cleansed the old society'' by killing
hundreds of thousands, driving Buddhist monks from their monasteries
and turning Cambodia into a slave labor camp where even knives and
forks were considered communal property.
   No mass executions have been reported in Khmer Rouge-controlled
areas since 1979. But defectors, international aid workers and human
rights groups indicate life under the Khmer Rouge remains slave-like.
   Beatings and occasional executions are meted out for violating
decrees. Women and youngsters are conscripted as porters for the
military and forced at times to trek through minefields. Religious
worship is permitted only at showcase camps. Contact with foreigners
is severely restricted _ to the point of denying the gravely ill
medical treatment offered by aid agencies.
   Perhaps the most damning testimony comes from Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, non-Communist leader of a three-party guerrilla resistance
that includes the Khmer Rouge.
   ``One has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the
Khmer Rouge of the 80s can be different from the Khmer Rouge of the
70s,'' he has said.
   The Khmer Rouge _ a term coined by Sihanouk meaning ``Red
Cambodians'' _ emerged in the 1960s and began its armed struggle in
1968 as the war in neighboring Vietnam was reaching a climax.
   With ideology borrowed from Mao Tse-tung and French leftists, and
with support from Vietnam's Communists and a segment of Cambodia's
rural population, the small, ragged band quickly grew into a
movement. Its initial appeal sprang from real grievances of the
peasantry and centuries of humiliation by Cambodia's more powerful
neighbors.
   On April 17, 1975, Phnom Penh fell and its more than 2 million
people were forced at gunpoint to march into the countryside and
plant rice under appalling conditions.
   For the victors, it was ``Year Zero'' _ the re-making of society
from scratch. For most of Cambodia's 8 million people it was the
beginning of an agony that lasted three years, eight months and 20
days.
   The defeated Khmer Rouge army and its civilian followers
straggled to the Thai border in 1979, sapped by malaria, hunger and
Hanoi's juggernaut. It appeared Pol Pot's days were numbered.
   But the Khmer Rouge was saved by geopolitics and international
relief aid. The United States, China, non-communist Southeast Asia
and others were eager to bring Vietnam to its knees, and the Khmer
Rouge was the most readily available instrument.
   China provided weapons, Thailand allowed the use of its territory
and the majority of U.N. member states vote year after year to
include the Khmer Rouge as part of the Sihanouk coalition to
represent Cambodia at the world body.
   Critics charge this is the moral equivalent of inviting Hitler to
sit in the United Nations after World War II. And Western aid
officials struggle with the fact that they kept what some call a
monster alive by continuing food, medical and other aid along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   After 11 years of war and the breakdown of peace talks, the Khmer
Rouge faces a new turning point.
   With Hanoi's soldiers still on the way out, the Khmer Rouge and
Phnom Penh forces already are testing each other in a major battle
for the the gem-rich border town of Pailin.
   Western analysts regard the Khmer Rouge as the strongest of the
three guerrilla factions and probably tougher than the government's
Soviet-supplied army.
   ``The Khmer Rouge in the last three months controls much more
territory than they did before,'' said Mao Souen, a defector from
the Cambodian government army.

   An annual swim across the biblical Sea of
Galilee turned into a hike on Saturday after a drop in water level
forced bathers to walk the final 400 yards.
   About 6,000 youths began the traditional 4-mile swim from the
sea's southern shore. They swam most of the way, but ended up
trudging the last leg across the dried mud bottom, Israel radio said.
   Last winter's low rainfall has caused the sea to drop nearly 3
feet below normal.
   The swim took place 11 miles south of the site where many
Christians believe Jesus walked on the sea.

<TEXT>
   Reach into your pocket for a quarter two or
three years from now and you may find a different portrait of George
Washington on the front and a flag instead of an eagle on the back.
   A majority of the nation's senators and representatives are bored
with the nation's money _ not how it's spent but how it looks.
They're tired of the eagle, Thomas Jefferson's home and the Lincoln
Memorial on the reverse _ or ``tails'' _ side of quarters, nickels
and pennies and believe Americans want new coins not so ``fixed in
the past.''
   At least 260 of the 435 House members and 66 of the 100 senators
have signed on as cosponsors of legislation originated by the U.S.
Commission of Fine Arts calling for new coins.
   Under a bill approved by the Senate in June without opposition
and now working its way through the House, the Treasury Department
would be required to modernize their designs, beginning with the
quarter.
   The weight, size and color of each coin would not change. And
portraits _ although not the same ones _ of Abraham Lincoln,
Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Washington and John F. Kennedy _
would still adorn the obverse or ``heads'' sides of the penny,
nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar.
   But the eagle now emblazoned on the reverse side of quarters and
half dollars, Monticello on the nickel and the Lincoln Memorial on
the penny would be replaced by themes celebrating the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.
   Similar legislation was approved by the Senate last year with
hopes of having the new coins in circulation for the 1989-91
Bicentennial celebration of the Constitution.
   It never got anywhere in the House because of opposition from
Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., then chairman of the House Banking
Committee's subcommittee on coinage.
   Annunzio, who now chairs another subcommittee, likes the present
designs and looks upon efforts by coin collectors to change them as
a low if not minuscule priority.
   ``Changes in our money make Americans very, very uneasy,'' he
said. ``We have plenty of serious issues confronting us that need
our attention ... a trade imbalance, a budget deficit, a drug
epidemic, an education crisis. On a scale of importance from one to
10, coin design change rates a zero.''
   His successor as the panel's chairman, Rep. Richard Lehman,
D-Calif., has no strong views one way or the other. But after an
emotional hearing this summer, he wants to proceed cautiously.
   ``There are some people who are very vocal about redesigning
coins, but there's no public clamor out there for it,'' Lehman said
in an interview.
   The Treasury is not too keen on the idea, even though the
department calculates it would raise an additional $250 million in
sorely needed government revenues over the next six years.
   The revenues would be in the form of ``seniorage'' _ the
difference between the face value of the coin and what it costs the
U.S. Mint to produce it. For example it costs the Mint only three
cents to strike a quarter, creating a ``seniorage'' of 22 cents.
   Mint Director Donna Pope said officials anticipate that a new
design would slightly increase the demand for coins in circulation _
raising seniorage revenues _ as some people hold on to either the
old or new editions.
   But the revenues are not great enough to alone justify a change,
she maintains, a point echoed by some congressmen. ``I think the
public would be very cynical of our efforts if that's why we're
doing it,'' said Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind.
   ``Missing from the coin redesign debate,'' said Ms. Pope, ``is
any evidence that the general American public _ the non-collecting
public _ is dissatisfied with current coin designs, or even favors
new ones.''
   Several lawmakers also remember what happened the last time
Congress decided to order a change in coinage other than the special
commemorative editions for collectors now produced by the U.S. Mint.
   About 300 million Susan B. Anthony silver dollars that Congress
ordered in 1978 now sit in government vaults because of an
overwhelming rejection by the public.
   Annunzio blames the Anthony dollar and its failure on the women's
caucus in Congress.
   ``The women on the banking committee collared every male member
of that committee, and the poor guys couldn't say no,'' he said.
``They created an atmosphere of hysteria. That's the reason it
passed.''
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, now the banking committee's
chairman and a vehement supporter for redesigning the nation's
coins, questioned during a hearing last year how many people knew
who Susan B. Anthony was. (She was a leader of the women's suffrage
movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s.)
   ``Maybe if we'd had Marilyn Monroe, there would have been more
popularity,'' Gonzalez joked.
   But to Annunzio's charge that the Anthony dollar was a poorly
conceived product of the women's movement, Gonzalez said, ``That's
what happens when you don't have sex equality.''
   The biggest advocate for changing the design of U.S. coins is
Diane Wolfe, a New Yorker who, as an appointee of President Reagan
to the National Commission on Fine Arts, adopted the issue as a
cause in 1987.
   Ms. Wolfe persuaded the commission to call for new designs, found
sponsors for the legislation and then generated letter-writing
campaigns on its behalf among thousands of coin collectors.
   ``The current designs are ordinary and boring,'' Ms. Wolfe says.
``The images and symbols from the Great Depression will no longer
suffice. We need images and symbols created by our best artists for
this generation and for our time.''
   Lehman, however, wants to amend the legislation to call for a
temporary change in only one coin, most likely the quarter. A new
edition reflecting the 200th anniversary of the Constitution would
be struck, but only for two years.
   During that time, the Treasury Department would be instructed to
come up with possible new designs but the decision on adopting each
would return to Congress.
   The Treasury now has the authority to redesign coins every 25
years. But except for the Susan Anthony dollar and special editions
of the quarter, half dollar and silver dollar in 1975-76
commemorating the bicentennial of the American Revolution, the last
design change was the adoption of the Kennedy half dollar in 1964.
   ``We should not minimize the psychological impact on the public
of any change, especially touching on the national economy, as it
seems to threaten its personal and national sense of security,''
says Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, executive director of the Smithsonian
Institution's coin collection.
   As an example, Ms. Clain-Stefanelli cites V.D. Brenner's design
of the Lincoln penny. The reverse or tails side was changed in 1959
to the Lincoln Memorial but the obverse or heads side has been
unchanged since 1909.
   ``Brenner's creation has been endowed with the same immortality
as that of the national figure it depicts,'' she said.
   Changing it now, she said, gives her ``a slightly uneasy
feeling.''
   Ms. Wolf dismisses many of the concerns as ``downright
laughable'' and contends that skeptics who cite the failure of the
Susan Anthony dollar are ``mixing soup and nuts.''
   ``We're the only Western World country stuck in a rut, and our
coins should not be stuck in a rut,'' she says.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain today
predicted success for the sweeping reform agenda of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, saying change has gone too far to be stopped.
   ``I believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go
through to success,'' the British leader told a news conference
after four hours of talks with the Soviet president during her
one-day stopover between Tokyo and London.
   The two leaders met amid reports of a breakthrough in U.S.-Soviet
arms negotiations.
   It was their fifth meeting since Gorbachev was named Communist
Party chief in 1985. Mrs. Thatcher was the first major Western
leader to see Gorbachev since this summer's wave of strikes by
miners in the Ukraine and Siberia and flareups of ethnic violence in
Georgia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   She expressed great confidence in the 58-year-old Kremlin leader
and his program for economic and social reforms, saying it ``opens
up vistas and horizons not available to the people of the Soviet
Union for some 70 years.''
   Asked about current domestic woes faced by Gorbachev's reform
drive, she replied, ``Anything bold and purposeful will have
difficulties to it.''
   One of the topics discussed by the leaders was arms control, and
Mrs. Thatcher said she had been ``in touch'' with President Bush on
the matter before meeting with Gorbachev at the Kremlin.
   However, she declined to comment on anything Gorbachev may have
told her on the reported dramatic swing in the Soviet position on a
superpower treaty being negotiated to slash long-range nuclear
weapons arsenals.
   Some observers said Mrs. Thatcher's good relations with Bush and
Gorbachev could help produce a breakthrough in superpower
negotiations to cut the number of long-range nuclear missiles in
half.
   But the breakthrough came in Wyoming, where Shevardnadze met
Friday and today with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   U.S. officials said Friday the Soviet Union was dropping its
insistence on limits on the Star Wars missile defense system before
signing a treaty that would slash the number of long-range bombers,
missiles and nuclear submarines. The two sides also were reported
near agreement on inspection of each other's underground nuclear
test sites.
   Asked whether Gorbachev had mentioned the switch in the Soviet
position, Mrs. Thatcher told reporters at the Soviet Foreign
Ministry Press Center that any announcement on that subject should
be made in the United States.
   On other disarmament topics, she said she left her meeting with
Gorbachev believing East and West can reach an agreement reducing
coventional weaponry by next year. She also said prospects were
``encouraging' for a ban on chemical weapons.
   Mrs. Thatcher's personal relationship with Gorbachev is warm,
although she retains a watchful eye on Soviet military power.
   Relations between Britain and the Soviet Union slid several
months ago when the British expelled 11 Soviet journalists and
diplomats on complaints of spying and the Soviets retaliated by
expelling 11 Britons.
   But the Tass news agency said today: ``In Soviet diplomatic
circles, it is believed that these differences should not be viewed
as an obstacle to the development of relations between the two
nations.''

   The remnants of Hurricane Hugo brought thunderstorms and gusty
winds over parts of the northeastern quarter of the nation early
today, and officials warned of flooding from Virginia to Vermont.
   Elsewhere, a cold front settled over the northern Plains,
dropping temperatures below freezing early today in some sections.
   Today marks the first full day of autumn in the Northern
Hemisphere. The autumnal equinox, the time when the sun crosses the
equator making night and day of equal length, occured at 9:20 p.m.
EDT Friday.
   Forecasters stopped tracking Hugo in Pittsburgh on Friday night
as it lost the characteristics of a tropical storm.
   Showers and thunderstorms swept across the Ohio Valley, the lower
Great Lakes and the central Appalachians.
   Earlier, Hugo blasted the Carolinas. Hurricane-force winds
pummeled coastal South Carolina around Charleston early Friday. The
storm's strength also was felt about 200 miles inland at Charlotte,
N.C., where nearly 3 inches of rain fell Friday, a city record for
the date.
   More than 2 inches of rain fell at Lexington, Ky., and more than
an inch fell at Akron, Ohio, and Erie, Pa.
   Gusty winds were reported over a large area from Virginia to New
York, with gusts of 60 mph at Snowshoe, W.Va.
   A flood watch was posted for today for much of western Virginia,
the Berkshires of Massachusetts and the northwest hills of
Connecticut. Flash flood watches were posted in Vermont and upstate
New York.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms extended across the
Tennessee Valley, the central Gulf Coast, Florida and southern
Georgia.
   Strong northwesterly winds brought cool air into the
south-central states, with high winds in the middle Mississippi
Valley.
   Light snow fell across parts of northern Wisconsin, and
temperatures hovered around freezing in South Dakota, Minnesota,
most of Wisconsin, northern and west-central Iowa and much of
eastern Nebraska.
   Out West, unseasonably warm weather prevailed with record high
temperatures reported at a number of cities. Seattle hit 91 degrees,
their latest day of 90 degree weather on record.
   Phoenix' temperature soared to a record 109 degrees on Friday,
while Tuscon sizzled at 106 degrees. It was the 90th day of
100-degree heat this year for Tuscon, a record.
   Temperature readings at 3 a.m. EDT included:

   The Soviets are making tracks to the tourist
industry by building a replica of a luxurious, turn-of-the-century
train that once ferried the nation's now-reviled aristocracy.
   Forgetting their typical disdain for the old days of czarist
Russia, the Soviets are planning a new Paris-to-Vladivostok train
that is to feature a sauna, two dining cars and roomy passenger
cars, the Tass news agency said.
   Conductors also will sport czarist-era uniforms. Dubbed the
Trans-Siberian Express, the train will be pulled by steam engines
along some stretches to enhance the historical experience.
   Tass did not say how long the trip would last or how much it
would cost. Travel time from Paris to Vladivostok is 10 to 11 days
on current trains.

   Heavy fog and high speeds caused five
huge pileups Saturday involving at least 265 vehicles on autobahns
in Bavaria, police and radio reports said.
   West German radio reports said 16 people were seriously hurt on
the autobans, the famed West German highways where there are no

   Bavarian police blamed the crackups on excessive speeds combined
with the dense fog that limited visibility to less than 50 yards. At
least 150 of the vehicles were involved in two single accidents,
both on the autobahn linking Nuremburg and Wuerzburg.

<HEAD>Buyers Want Big Cars, Not Big Gas Mileage, Industry Argues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern about the environment is prompting a
new push for automakers to produce more fuel efficient cars, but the
industry says with gasoline prices low their customers want
performance and size over fuel economy.
   According to Environmental Protection Agency figures, the auto
industry's move toward higher mileage cars has all but come to a
halt in recent years.
   Average fleet-wide mileage jumped from 13.1 mpg in 1975 to 21.1
mpg in 1982. Since then it has been creeping and often standing
still. The EPA mileage list announced last week reflected a fleet
average of 24 mpg, the same as a year earlier.
   But growing environmental concerns and the link between
automobile pollution and global warming, has unleashed new calls for
the industry to produce more fuel efficient vehicles.
   Legislation by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., to require a 40
percent increase in average automobile fuel efficiency by the turn
of the century, is given a good chance of passing the Senate.
   That would put the average fleet-wide mileage for most
manufacturers at about 40 mpg. Only some of the stingiest and
smallest subcompacts are able to obtain those kinds of mileage
figures today.
   No similar proposal has emerged in the House where it would face
the strong opposition of Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   But even serious discussion of such sharp increases in auto
mileage is a far cry from only a year ago, when a Reagan
administration proposal to scrap federal fuel efficiency standards
altogether received considerable support on Capitol Hill. President
Bush has made no such suggestion.
   Past demands for higher auto mileage were prompted by oil
shortages and high gasoline prices. Today there is neither.
   So what is driving the renewed interest in fuel efficiency?
   ``The first and foremost reason is concern about global
warming,'' says Robert Dewey an analyst for the Energy Conservation
Coalition, a group that includes many of the largest environmental
and conservation organizations.
   Environmentalists also have argued that cutting the demand for
gasoline is the best way to curb the need for oil _ and, thereby,
preserve pristine wilderness and environmentally delicate coastal
areas that otherwise might be opened for drilling.
   There also is continuing concern about the growing dependence on
imported oil. ``In 1985, oil imports accounted for 32 percent of all
oil used in this country. Last July imports exceeded 50 percent,''
said Deborah Bleviss, executive director of the International
Institute for Energy Conservation.
   But it is the automobile's link to global warming that has given
the issue a new spark.
   Motor vehicles account for about a fourth of the releases in the
United States of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to what many
scientists believe is a warming of the earth because of manmade
pollution.
   Carbon dioxide combines with other chemicals to form a gaseous
veil in the atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse. Many
scientists believe this ``greenhouse effect'' _ if left unchecked _
will cause a dangerous warming of the earth by the middle of the
next century.
   ``It's time Detroit stopped protecting their gas guzzlers and
started protecting our planet by producing safe, efficient vehicles
citizens want,'' Ruth Caplan, executive director of the
Environmental Action Foundation, said recently as her group unveiled
plans to distribute a series of 30-second television ads linking
cars to global warming.
   But the auto industry argues that it is being picked on unfairly.
   A requirement for cars to achieve and average fuel economy of 40
mpg ``does little to address the global warming problems'' because
carbon dioxide releases from U.S. cars account for only 2.5 percent
of all the world's greenhouse gases, maintains Helen Petrauskas,
vice president for environmental and safety engineering at Ford
Motor Co.
   And to achieve such mileage increases will require automakers to
reduce the size of their cars, she and other auto executives insist.
   There may be a lot of talk about higher mileage requirements, but
market indicators are just the opposite, says Ronald Boltz, a vice
president for Chrysler Corp. He said customers are ``placing a
premium on vehicle performance ... and less emphasis on fuel
economy.''
   Cars such as the high-mileage Geo Metro _ a Japanese-made
subcompact sold by General Motors _ account for only 1 percent of
U.S. passenger car sales, echoed Marina Whitman, a GM vice president.

<HEAD>Audit a Case Study in HUD's `Revolving Door'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When government auditors in May 1988 asked
Benton Mortgage Co. President Thomas Ford whether he knew an agency
official named Deborah Gore Dean, he responded that he ``had been
introduced to her.''
   Six months later, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
auditors traveled to Tennessee to brief Benton officials on their
critical findings. They encountered a familiar face.
   It was Deborah Gore Dean, then a privately employed housing
consultant.
   Ms. Dean, the former top aide to HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce,
objected on the spot to the strong and harsh language used in
various portions of the report,'' one auditor wrote in his notes.
   The notes are among boxes of working papers used to compile the
audit. The documents, made available to The Associated Press,
provide a case study of the ``revolving door'' at HUD that agency
and congressional investigators believe contributed to scandals
during the Reagan administration.
   Ms. Dean is just one of more than a dozen former HUD officials
who had dealings with Benton, a major lender in HUD programs now
facing an FBI investigation of its conduct.
   Some of the former HUD officials work at Benton, others are
consultants to the firm and others still were developers who got
financing through the Knoxville lender.
   The auditors concluded that three former HUD officials, including
Ambassador to Switzerland Philip Winn, reaped millions in
``unjustified profits'' by using their knowledge of HUD rules to
create ``paper'' development and construction companies to increase
HUD subsidies.
   The former officials often financed their projects through
Benton, which has handled more than $2 billion in HUD financing in
the past 25 years.
   The federal investigators reviewed 14 of the more than 250 HUD
projects in which Benton has participated, and found in none of the
14 did the company use prudent underwriting practices.
   In fact, the report said many of the properties were appraised by
Benton at exorbitant levels, allowing the company to reap larger
fees on its HUD-backed mortgages.
   The audit recommended administrative sanctions against Benton.
The company has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying it received
HUD clearances for items questioned by the auditors.
   Still, the working papers indicate that Benton officials made it
no secret that they retained former HUD officials to win favors at
the agency.
   Ford told the auditors Benton retained Washington attorney Lynda
Murphy, a former HUD official and a close friend of Ms. Dean's,
``when Benton needed a waiver from HUD,'' according to the working
papers.
   Michael Karem, another former HUD official who occassionally
worked for Benton, ``is paid to do waivers,'' Ford told the
auditors, according to their notes.
   Half the 14 Benton projects reviewed received waivers, in most
cases permission to charge the maximum allowable rents in HUD
projects involved in a rehabilitation program. Since low-income
tenants pay only a fraction of their income as rent, higher rents
mean higher costs for HUD.
   While Murphy, Karem and other former HUD officials were helping
Benton and developers of projects it financed win waivers, another
former HUD official was being called on by the company to appraise
property.
   The auditors found it peculiar that Benton on five occassions
hired a Washington-based appraiser to review properties located in
the South and Southwest, because of the higher fees for travel.
   The auditors, according to their notes, said they could find no
reason for hiring the appraiser, a former HUD official, ``unless the
distant firm gave the mortgagee the appraisal value that it wanted
for the project.''
   The 14 projects reviewed participated in HUD's Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program. A nationwide audit of that program triggered
the HUD investigations.
   In that report HUD's inspector general found that former agency
officials appeared to have received special treatment, as well as
donors to a charity that a ranking HUD official helped found.
   Winn and partners Philip Abrams and J. Michael Queenan were
developers or consultants on many of the 14 projects reviewed,
increasing their profits by setting up development and contracting
companies that the auditors said were in most cases disbanded after
a project was completed. In essence, the Winn group made profits as
builders and developers of projects in addition to their profits as
owners.
   When not involved in the ownership of a Benton-financed project,
Queenan often served as a consultant, as did a partner, former HUD
official Ronny Mahon.
   Included in the audit papers are canceled checks showing Queenan
made at least $216,000 in consulting fees from Benton; Mahon,
$363,578.
   Also among the canceled checks are a handful of Benton donations
to FOOD for Africa, a charity that former HUD Assistant Secretary
Thomas Demery helped establish. It was Demery, who was in charge of
most housing programs, who granted most of the waivers Benton got on
the audited projects. The canceled checks to FOOD total $19,000.
   ``All expenses appear to be legal, however, contributions to an
organization which Tom Demery ... is secretary is a strong indicator
that contributions are made if you want to be involved in HUD's mod
rehab program,'' the auditors wrote.
   They also found that Benton contributed $15,000 to the
``President's Dinner'' a fund-raiser to help former President Reagan
buy a house in California.
   ``The $15,000 payment for the `President's Dinner' is another
indicator of mod rehab units being awarded based on political
consideration,'' the auditors said.

<HEAD>Bork Adds to Proliferation of Writings on Confirmation Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Bork says the conservative direction of
the Supreme Court with newest member Anthony Kennedy on board is
little different from how the court would have leaned had he won
confirmation instead.
   Bork, whose appointment to a Supreme Court seat in 1987 touched
off a bitter fight between liberal and conservative groups, says he
has generally agreed with the justices, with just one notable
exception: he would have voted to uphold a Texas law banning flag
burning.
   Bork made the comments in an interview about his new book, ``The
Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law,'' to be
published in the next few months. Although it is not specifically
about the failed nomination, a number of pages discuss the Supreme
Court bid, Bork said.
   Other books about Bork's fight for a Supreme Court seat also are
about to roll off the presses, two years after the defeat of the
conservative legal scholar.
   ``I just think there will be a lot of these books in the next few
years _ this is one people are going to chew on for a long time,''
says conservative activist Patrick B. McGuigan, whose forthcoming
book, ``The Ninth Justice: Our Fight for Bork,'' was written with
Dawn Weyrich.
   It tells the inside story of the conservative battle to swing the
Senate in favor of Bork.
   A view from the liberal side is upcoming in ``The People Rising:
The Campaign Against the Bork Nomination,'' by former Federal Trade
Commission Chairman Michael Pertschuk and journalist Wendy Schaetzel.
   Bork's own book looks at the broad sweep of American history and
argues that the law fell prey to politics, he said. He declined to
go into much detail about the contents but said that if he had it to
do over, he would change ``very little'' about his testimony before
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``What I said was what I think,'' said Bork.
   At a distance of two years, Bork takes his rejection by the
Senate philosophically. ``I don't like what happened, but do I go
around being bitter? No.''
   After Bork's rejection, then-President Reagan nominated federal
judge Douglas Ginsburg for the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice
Lewis F. Powell. Ginsburg, however, withdrew in the midst of a furor
over his earlier marijuana use. Reagan then nominated Kennedy, who
was easily confirmed by the Senate.
   One Bork book already on the shelves, ``Battle for Justice,'' by
reporter Ethan Bronner, recently brought a complaint from Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist. He said the book was incorrect in
saying he informed the White House of Powell's retirement plans the
same day Powell informed him _ and thus broke a promise of overnight
secrecy.
   ``That statement is in error,'' Rehnquist said. He said he did
not contact the White House until the following day.
   Liberal critics of Bork who are grumbling privately that they
should have been portrayed more favorably by Bronner's book are
virtually guaranteed to be consoled by Pertschuk's account.
   Pertschuk acknowledges that his book takes as its heroes such
groups as People for the American Way and the Alliance for Justice,
which crusaded against Bork. ``We consider it an example of high
democracy,'' he says.
   Washington attorney Mark Gittenstein, chief counsel to the Senate
Judiciary Committee during the Bork hearings, also is at work on a
Bork book.
   ``I guess my slant is the role of the Senate,'' he says. ``I'm
looking at it from where I was. ... I'm also trying to look a little
deeper at some of the issues that were involved.''
   McGuigan says Ohio State University political scientist Greg
Caldeira is writing what could be ``the definitive book'' about the
struggle.
   ``It will be scholarly,'' he said. ``It will be more detached. He
has been interviewing me and a lot of the leftists as well.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jose Napoleon Duarte slept well,
breathing without difficulty, and rose without assistance today from
what earlier this week seemed certain to be his death bed.
   Fidelina Menjivar, a nurse attending to the former president,
said in a telephone interview this morning that Duarte's condition
remains stable, slightly improved from the previous night.
   Dr. Jose Luis Saca, the former president's personal physician,
reported on Friday that Duarte had made a dramatic and surprising
recovery from a bout with pneumonia that very nearly killed him.
   Miss Menjivar said X-rays taken last night showed that
antibiotics were steadily shrinking the spot of pneumonia doctors
had discovered in Duarte's right lung. The infection provoked a
crisis that three times between Tuesday and Wednesday carried the
cancer-ravaged Duarte to the verge of death from asphyxiation.
   ``The threat of imminent death has disappeared,'' Saca told the
AP late Friday. ``That man is some other kind of human being than
yourself or myself.''
   ``It is like night and day. From a moribund state, an agonizing
state, he has progressed to a stable state,'' he said at midday
after the former president's dramatic overnight improvement.
   Saca cautioned that Duarte's conditon, because of the liver
cancer, ``is still serious.'' He said it was impossible to predict
when Duarte will die from the incurable disease. When the cancer was
diagnosed in June 1988, doctors gave Duarte between six and 18
months to live.
   Saca and the medical team attending Duarte at his home took chest
X-rays on Friday. The physician said they showed a spot of pneumonia
in the right lung.
   ``The crisis was the result of that infection,'' said Saca. He
said antibiotics administered over the past two days have countered
the infection.
   ``He is breathing well,'' said Saca, who added that the
ex-president was talking lucidly with family and friends.
   Duarte, a civil engineer-turned-politician, was president from
1984 until last June 1 and was Washington's staunchest ally in the
Western Hemsiphere.
   He handed power to Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, which trounced Duarte's Christian Democrats in
March voting.

   An army general said two men in custody
have confessed to assassinating presidential candidate Luis Carlos
Galan, a killing that resulted in the government's declaration of
war on drug traffickers, newspapers reported today.
   The reports quoted Gen. Ramon Niebles as saying the army now
knows who hired the two gunmen, but the newspapers said he did not
say who ordered the killing or if it was drug traffickers.
   On Friday, the government asked the U.S. Embassy to respond to
reports it has a secret list of Colombians suspected of having ties
to drug lords and said such a list could damage relations between
the countries.
   Also Friday, President Virgilio Barco accepted the resignation of
Justice Minister Monica de Greiff, long rumored to be quitting
because of death threats by cocaine traffickers. Ms. de Greiff said
she resigned at Barco's request.
   Sen. Galan, who was seeking the Liberal Party's nomination for
March's presidential election, was killed Aug. 18 in a hail of
machine gun fire at a Bogota rally. Barco blamed traffickers and
declared an all-out war on them.
   The general's comments, at a news conference Friday in Bogota,
got front- page attention in Bogota's half dozen dailies today, even
though the two men in custody have not been arraigned or charged.
   The army has a reputation of forcing confessions from people who
later recant in civilian courts. Colombia's armed forces have the
authority to arrest and detain people under a state of siege that
has existed in Colombia for all but a few months of the last 40
years.
   Human rights groups such as the London-based Amnesty
International and the Colombian Human Rights Committee have also
said in reports that the Colombian army tortures civilians it has
arrested.
   In 1979, President Julio Cesar Turbay gave the army authority to
arrest civilians suspected of leftist activities. The army still has
that authority.
   The two men who confessed were part of a band called The
Blackies, the general said. Two other men in the band are thought to
have set off a 500-pound bomb Sept. 2 that seriously damaged the
Bogota daily El Espectador.
   The four men were captured Thursday in a house in Bogota where
the army found weapons, ammunition and 220 pounds of dynamite packed
under a car seat, the army said.
   Two more bombs exploded Friday night in Bogota, one at a
classified advertising office of the anti-drug crusading newspaper
El Espectador, and the other at a substation of the government-owned
telephone company, police said.
   No injuries were reported in the blasts. They have occurred
almost daily since the government began the crackdown after Galan's
death.
   Nearly 80 percent of the cocaine in the United States is believed
to come from Colombia and the U.S. government has given Barco more
than $65 million for his war on drugs.
   A letter sent Friday to the U.S. Embassy marked the first open
division between the nations since the crackdown began.
   The letter by Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes came a day
after Colombian media published the names of 25 Colombians,
including federal lawmakers, who are on the U.S. Embassy's alleged
blacklist.
   Londono said such a list ``without an adequate clarification and
precise explanation, could generate a climate of undesirable
relations between our two countries.''
   The contents of the letter, sent to U.S. charge d'affaires
Phillip McLain, was broadcast by the Colombian radio chain Caracol.
   Senators on the alleged list charged that they were being
persecuted for disagreeing with U.S. policy and calling for the
legalization fo drugs.
   After meeting with Londono at the Foreign Ministry, McLain told
reporters the United States does not ``make lists of people who
receive visas or don't receive visas because of social or political
activities. There is no blacklist or list of any other color.''
   In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman said U.S.
embassies do have computer lists of foreign nationals involved in
allegations of wrongdoing.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied the
Bogota embassy had a blacklist but said the mission's visa officer
considers any allegations in deciding whether to approve a visa
application.
   All applicants have an opportunity to rebut allegations, he said.

   A man sought in France for a string of
holdups and prison escapes committed suicide today during a shootout
with police that occurred after he released three hostages, police
said.
   Police first reported they killed Philippe Delaire, 28, of France
and seriously wounded one of his Belgian accomplices, Tony Wagemans,
31, during the shootout in an apartment building. But prosecutor
Anne Bourguignont later told reporters that Delaire killed himself
during the confrontation.
   A third gunman, Belgian Edouard Delecki, 36, was arrested
unharmed.
   The shootout ended a standoff that began Sept. 16 when the three
men kidnapped a bank manager, his wife and their two daughters in
their home in Tilff, a residential southern suburb of Liege.
   The banker escaped and alerted police, who surrounded the villa.
   After a week of negotiations with policemen, the three gunmen
agreed to release their hostages for a ransom of $750,000 and an
Mercedes-Benz.
   They released the two girls, Gaelle, 10, and Francoise, 12, on
Friday and drove away with the mother, whom they later freed on the
road toward Holland.
   Two police helicopters chased the men, and all main roads and
border crossings were guarded. Spotting policemen at the border, the
three men drove back to a 28-story apartment building in Liege,
where the shootout occurred.
   Police said Delaire shot first and was killed by a bullet in the
head. The wounds of Wagemans were not described.
   Delaire, who was born in northern France, had a brief but wild
criminal career there, police said.
   Jailed for holdups, he escaped for the first time from a prison
in Lille, France, in 1985. He committed other holdups in France and
Belgium, many in the Liege area, taking hostages to cover his
escape. Arrested several times in France and Belgium, he escaped
again and again. Last year, he forced a helicopter pilot to free a
friend from a prison in Nice, southern France.
   Police said he also was sought for questioning in the killing a
20-year-old African boxer in a Liege bar in 1985.
   In several cases, police said, he molested or injured his
hostages. But no injuries were reported to his hostages In Tilff.

<HEAD>Iraqis Launch New Push Against Guerrillas, Kurds Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's army has launched a new offensive
against Kurdish guerrillas in their northern stronghold near the
Iranian border, the first major assault in a year, a guerrilla
spokesman said Saturday.
   The 24th Division or the Iraqi army, supported by artillery and
helicopter gunships, has sought to ``encircle the region controlled
by the (guerrillas) and move in to captures Kurdish bases,'' said
the official of the outlawed Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
   At least 57 Iraqi soldiers have been killed in clashes since
Sept. 18 in Iraq's northeastern mountains, he said.
   He put losses among the guerrillas, known as Peshmergas or
``those who face death,'' at three killed and 12 wounded.
   The official, who is known to The Associated Press, spoke in a
telephone interview from a West European capital. He asked that his
name and location not be mentioned for security reasons.
   Fighting centered north of Qala Diza, the city whose population
was forcibly evacuated by the Iraqis several months ago in a drive
to create a buffer zone along the Iranian border to prevent the
guerrillas from receiving support from the Iran, the official
charged.
   Earlier this year, he said, tens of thousands of Kurds from
scores of villages around Qala Diza were forced out and their
settlements were razed. The city is 15 miles west of the border.
   ``So far all the Iraqi assaults have been repulsed,'' he reported.
   ``The Iraqis have turned the area into one big free-fire zone in
recent months. They claim we've been crushed, but this shows that
the Kurdish resistance is alive and kicking.''
   Diplomats in Baghdad and Kurdish officials estimate more than
250,000 Kurds have been relocated forcibly over the past two years
and hundreds of villages have been razed in Iraqi efforts to isolate
the guerrillas.
   The Iraqi government admits it has moved large numbers of Kurdish
civilians to other regions. But officials say this was for
unspecified security reasons and to provide villagers with modern
housing.
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting on and off for more
than 50 years for an autonomous homeland.
   The government promises limited autonomy and earlier this month
held elections in Kurdistan for a legislative assembly.
   Kurdish separatists charge the assembly is powerless and branded
the voting ``no different to previous sham elections held since
1975,'' when the assembly first was established.
   Iraq's last major offensive against the Iranian-backed Kurdish
guerrillas was August 1988, soon after a U.N.-sponsored truce halted
its eight-year war with Iran. The Iraqis allegedly used poison gas
in attacks that forced tens of thousands of Kurds to flee into
neighboring Iran and Turkey. Baghdad denies the charges.
   About 19 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the
borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet. Another 1 million are
scattered in the southwestern Soviet Union and northeastern Syria.

<HEAD>New President De Klerk May Find Promised Reforms Difficult</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk has
brought a new style and new possibilities to South African politics,
but an array of obstacles stands in the way of his professed goals
of peace, justice and black-white power-sharing.
   Yet the fact that de Klerk states these goals, repeatedly and
earnestly, sets him apart from the men who preceded him in power.
   Prominent black opponents of his government are deeply skeptical,
and they may be proved right. Some of them concede, however, that
the government for the first time has adopted a rhetoric, if not yet
a policy, that reflects some of their own hopes.
   ``His vision of a new South Africa ... is the vision we want,''
said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize and one of the government's most persistent critics.
   So sweeping are some of de Klerk's statements _ no more white
domination, a phasing out of discrimination _ that he may find he
has raised expectations he cannot meet.
   He acknowledged this in his inaugural speech Wednesday, saying he
would not accept responsibility for ``overenthusiastic or twisted
versions'' of his policy.
   He will be under heavy pressure to move quickly, with
anti-apartheid leaders and Western governments saying they want
decisive steps taken within the next several months. Among the moves
de Klerk will consider:
   _Releasing Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other jailed leaders
of the African National Congress guerrilla movement. De Klerk knows
that a broad range of black leaders will refuse to negotiate on a
new constitution unless Mandela goes free, and is likely to approve
the release despite fears in some government quarters that it could
spark a wave of unrest.
   _Modifying or repealing the remaining legislative cornerstones of
apartheid, the laws which classify South Africans by race, allow
municipalities to segregate public facilities, and establish
segregated residential districts.
   ``The continued removal of discrimination is an important
objective,'' said de Klerk in his inaugural speech. But he has yet
to renounce his support for segregated schools and neighborhoods.
   _Lifting the state of emergency, which has been in effect since
June 1986. De Klerk says hopes to ``create a climate'' in which the
emergency can be ended, and he already has negated some of impact by
ordering police to allow peaceful mass protest marches. But police
continue to detain activists without charge.
   Gavin Relly, chairman of South Africa's largest conglomerate and
frequent critic of apartheid, has urged the international community
to give de Klerk a chance to carry out his program without imposing
a timetable or threatening further sanctions.
   ``Just as Mikhail Gorbachev (in the Soviet Union) has found that
perestroika cannot be achieved in the twinkling of an eye, and that
serious attitudinal and institutional obstacles have to be
confronted and gradually overcome, so Mr. de Klerk will have to
confront difficulties of the same order,'' said Relly, chairman of
the Anglo American Corp.
   The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper in Jonhannesburg,
also likened de Klerk to Gorbachev, saying both leaders were
learning that the process of reform ``is not to direct change, but
to ease controls and wait for the unknowable to happen.''
   For de Klerk, this syndrome is most evident in his decision two
weeks ago, while acting president, to allow mass protest marches.
Tens of thousands of people of all races have joined anti-government
parades in major cities, including militants displaying banners of
the African National Congress.
   ``Like Gorbachev, de Klerk has a security establishment who
prefer the old way of doing things,'' said The Weekly Mail.
``Perhaps the biggest question if whether de Klerk shares
Gorbachev's resolve and wile to outmaneuver the 'securocrats.''
   The centerpiece of de Klerk's program is a vague proposal to
negotiate a new constitution that will extend political rights to
the country's 28 million blacks while protecting the 5 million
whites from black domination.
   In effect, de Klerk is suggesting that each racial group would
have veto power over major policy decisions, with deadlocks to be
broken by some sort of independent arbitrator.
   It is highly unlikely that even moderate black leaders, let alone
the ANC, would accept an outcome that falls so far short of a
one-person, one-vote system.
   The ANC released a statement Friday night dismissing de Klerk's
pledges of reform and calling for a continued armed struggle against
the government.
   ``The rhetoric mouthed by de Klerk at his inauguration once more
bears out our firm conviction that no white minority regime
possesses either the will or the capacity to bring about a
fundamental change of South Africa,'' said the statement, released
in Lusaka, Zambia.
   But blacks might be willing to sit down and talk if de Klerk
takes the preliminary steps they have demanded _ freeing Mandela,
legalizing the ANC, lifting the emergency and curbs on political
activity.
   The most powerful black moderate, Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, said he was convinced de Klerk intended to move forward.
   He called on blacks to ``move away from the weak position of
revolution and internal violence, which can never bring victory for
democracy, and move toward the politics of negotiation.''
   An indication of the flux in South Africa came last week in an
editorial in the Kenya Times, a newspaper published by Kenya's
ruling party that customarily depicts the white government in
Pretoria as evil and racist.
   ``One still needs to avoid celebrating,'' it said. ``One needs
time to see whether the de Klerk government will make significant
follow-ups to these promising beginnings. ... But if this is a sign
of things to come, then all of us need to encourage the president.''

   Finance officials of the world's seven biggest
economic powers met today amid renewed calls for the Bush
administration to curb the U.S. budget deficit as its contribution
toward stabilizing world currency markets.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan hosted the private talks at the Blair House, across
the street from the White House, with their counterparts from Japan,
West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ the
so-called Group of Seven.
   The finance ministers and central bankers from the seven nations
were expected to discuss their seeming failure to stabilize world
currency markets. The dollar is trading above the targets they set
despite a declaration at the officials' last meeting in April
seeking no further increase.
   A strong dollar hurts U.S. efforts to reduce its trade deficit
because it raises the price of American exports overseas and makes
foreign goods cheaper in the United States.
   The dollar's rise since the spring has come in the face of
repeated and heavy selling by the G-7 nations' central banks in an
effort to drive its value down.
   In advance of the session, the Bush administration insisted
coordination efforts had not broken down. But officials of other
nations said more was needed.
   Specifically, the U.S. must reduce the demand for dollars created
by its budget deficit, said a senior Canadian official, speaking to
reporters on condition she not be identified by name.
   ``One of the values of these meetings is peer pressure and the
need to make the U.S. repeatedly aware, the administration and
Congress, that the key to the imbalances problem is not some sort of
exchange rate policy that brings down an overly strong dollar. ...
The best way to do that is a tighter fiscal policy,'' the official
said.
   A senior official at the U.S. Treasury acknowledged, ``We all
recognize that more needs to be done. ... The United States must
reduce its budget deficit,'' but said that nations with trade
surpluses (Japan and West Germany) must stimulate consumer demand at
home so they are less dependent on export sales.
   The U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
if the dollar were to continue its upswing ``for a lengthy period of
time, this obviously, is a matter of concern ... because obviously
we have more (trade adjustments) to accomplish.''
   Despite the talk before today's meeting, many private economists
said they were expecting little more than vague rhetoric when the
G-7 issues a communique at the end of the session.
   ``I would be shocked if anything really happened,'' said Michael
K. Evans, an economic consultant in Washington. ``But I think they
will reiterate the fact that stable currencies are better and that
they will work together to keep the fluctuations down without saying
very much about where they should go,''
   Trading in currency markets Friday seemed to reflect that
skepticism. The dollar rose in thin, erratic trading despite the
fourth straight day of Federal Reserve dollar selling. At the end of
the day in New York the dollar rose to 146.05 yen from 145.65 on
Thursday.
   The Group of Seven discussions were being held before the start
of the annual meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund
and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.
   IMF officials are pushing for a doubling of the fund's resources
to allow it to better handle the crushing $1.3 trillion Third World
debt burden. A senior Treasury official said Friday the United
States had not reached a conclusion that such an increase is needed.

<HEAD>Hurricane Ravaged Islands Teetered on Anarchy, Officials Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say FBI agents and Coast
Guard officers found anarchy on hurricane-ravaged St. Croix just
hours after the Virgin Islands' governor gave emphatic assurances
the island was peaceful.
   A Coast Guard helicopter crew that flew over the island Wednesday
morning to survey damage from Hurricane Hugo spotted bands of
looters armed with machetes and guns, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   ``Basically there was total lawlessness from everything they
saw,'' said the spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis.
   A team of five FBI agents dispatched by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh arrived about the same time and by Wednesday afternoon
reported that ``there had been a complete breakdown of law and
order,'' said an administration official.
   The agents found ``roving bands of thugs'' looting shops and
attacking homes, the official said. Some 150 convicts who had
escaped from two prisons were also on the loose.
   Until federal agents arrived Wednesday morning, it was difficult
for officials in Washington to get information because
communications had been cut off with the storm-ravaged island.
   The accounts of FBI agents and the Coast Guard conflicted starkly
with the report the Pentagon received from Gov. Alexander Farrelly
on Tuesday night.
   ``The governor emphatically stated there was no law-and-order
problem and matters we well in hand,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The governor's statement was also at odds with a plea made over
ham radio earlier Tuesday night by an assistant U.S. attorney on St.
Croix, who expressed fear that looting convicts might exact revenge
on law enforcement officers and judges, the official said.
   The prosecutor's report was the basis for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's decision to send in the team of five FBI agents to
survey the situation, the official said.
   As that team was arriving in St. Croix on Wednesday morning, the
Justice Department established contact with the U.S. marshal for the
Virgin Islands ``who reported that there was anarchy, it was very
serious situation,'' the official said.
   As the picture of violence and lawlessness became more detailed,
Pentagon officials went to the Justice Department to develop
contingency plans for dealing with the situation.
   After consulting with the White House, Thornburgh decided to send
the FBI's hostage rescue team and the U.S. Marshals Services'
special operations group to St. Croix to protect federal officials
and property.
   At 2 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, Farrelly met with the senior
FBI agent in the Virgin Islands and requested a battalion of
military police to help restore order, said the official.
   A presidential proclamation was quickly drafted at the Justice
Department and orders were issued to send in military police to
restore order. Farrelly's request was reported to the White House by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   But the presidential order was based on a law that allows the
chief executive to send in troops without a governor's request.
   President Bush ``was relying on his own judgment based on other
reports that it was important to restore law and order,'' the
official said.
   The decision to send in troops was made after ``federal
authorities on the scene were reporting chaos, and near anarchy and
the situation as being out of control,'' Admiral William Crowe Jr.,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week in an
interview.
   Later Wednesday afternoon, Farrelly publicly denied that he had
asked for troops. During interviews Thursday, the governor said
reports of lawlessness and looting were exaggerated.
   He made the comments after 1,100 U.S. troops and 100 FBI and
deputy U.S. marshals had arrived in St. Croix.
   By Friday, Farrelly had ceded all law enforcement power to the
Justice Department, which now has comprehensive authority to make
arrests and conduct prosecutions for violations of both federal and
territorial law.

<HEAD>Study Finds Hope for Reduced Military Spending Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved U.S.-Soviet relations along with other
factors offer the rare prospect of a decline in worldwide military
spending, according to a new study released Saturday.
   ``In many respects, the decade of the 1980s is ending on a more
hopeful note than it had at the start,'' says the study, ``World
Military and Social Expenditures 1989.''
   The report was written by Ruth Sivard, a former official of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Each year she publishes an
updated version of global military spending and how it compares with
spending on human resources.
   Her principle thesis is that defense spending absorbs funds
desperately needed for social programs.
   Ms. Sivard writes that the positive trends at the end of the
decade have not as yet had a measureable impact on government
budgets and that world military spending is still at record levels.
   Nonetheless, Ms. Sivard cites as causes for optimism the
superpower rapprochement, the winding down of wars in Afghanistan,
Central America, southern Africa and Southeast Asia and the revival
of the United Nations' role as a peacemaker.
   The report also notes that China, the Soviet Union and Vietnam _
countries which large military establishments _ all have undertaken
personnel cutbacks. Beyond that, she says, no new wars started over
the past year for the first time in 31 years.
   Still, in real terms, military expenditures have continued to
rise with the expansion of the global economy and may have reached
the $1 trillion mark worldwide for the first time last year, the
report says.
   In 1986, the last year for which complete figures are available,
the United States spent about $281 billion on defense and the Soviet
Union $271 billion, accounting for about 62 per cent of global
military spending, the report says.
   It adds the global ``obsession'' with military force since World
War II has produced hundreds of millions of casualties, not only
from war but from neglect of urgent human needs.
   As an example, the study cites ``the appalling number of lives
lost to hunger and to other killer-diseases that are preventable at
the cost of a few dollars for an individual life.''
   The study also makes these obsevations:
   _Six times as much public research money goes for research on
weapons as for research on health protection.
   _Every minute, 15 children in the world die for want of essential
food and inexpensive vaccines, and the world military machine takes
$1.9 million from the public treasury.
   _The chances of dying from social neglect are 33 times greater
than the chances of dying in war.
   _In the developing world, there is one soldier per 240
inhabitants, one physician per 1,950.
   _The U.S. and the U.S.S.R., the top ranking military powers, rank
17th and 45th among all nations in infant mortality rates.
   _Since 1960, developing countries have increased military
expenditures more than twice as fast as living standards, measured
by per capita income.

   Hundreds of National Guardsmen patrolled
ravaged streets against looting today, and police reported more than
90 arrests as residents returned to begin the long task of
rebuilding from Hurricane Hugo.
   Chainsaws buzzed, crews worked around the clock to restore power
and telephone communications, and insurance agents across the
Carolinas braced for claims that could run into the billions from
the region's most devastating hurricane in 30 years.
   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seen
anywhere,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said after surveying the
destruction by helicopter. ``We're going to be a long time digging
out of this and rebuilding.''
   The hurricane was blamed for 18 deaths in the Carolinas and two
in Virginia.
   In the six hours Hugo and its 135 mph winds surged through South
Carolina, it flattened dozens of homes and buildings, snapped trees,
twisted bridges and washed scores of boats ashore. Mayor Joseph P.
Riley Jr. said damage in his 3-century-old city alone might reach $1
billion.
   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Riley, who imposed
a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew.
   Police reported isolated cases of looting. Fifty people were
arrested in Mount Pleasant, across the Cooper River from Charleston;
12 in North Charleston; and at least three in Charlotte, N.C. In
Charleston, police Sgt. Thomas Gardner said today that 27 people
were arrested Friday and early today for looting and one for
violating curfew.
   ``It was very quiet last night. I left at 1 a.m. and the only
thing I saw were police cars and National Guardsmen,'' Gardner said.
Two people from New Orleans, he said, were posing as relief workers
who then would take people's possessions; they had not been charged
yet.
   The governor deployed 2,600 National Guardsmen to patrol streets,
enforce the curfew, help remove debris, purify water and perform
other duties.
   At a news conference today, Riley said power should be restored
by tonight at hospitals, but he could not estimate when residents
might get power. Mail delivery could resume Monday, and he
recommended that people boil water before drinking it.
   Up to half a million customers across the state were without
power as of late Friday. In inland Columbia, people lined up at an
ice warehouse with coolers. Some areas of Charleston were without
water, and residents were told to boil their drinking water.
   Two hundred miles inland, Charlotte, N.C., also sustained heavy
damage, and nearly 80 percent of the customers in the city of
375,000 were still without power this morning, said Duke Power Co.
spokesman Joe Maher.
   There were 14 deaths in South Carolina from the storm itself,
related traffic accidents, and heart attacks suffered during
cleanup, according to the state Emergency Preparedness Division. In
North Carolina, three deaths in the Charlotte area were blamed on
the storm, and a 6-month-old baby died in Union County when a tree
crashed into a house.
   Two people were killed by Hugo after it moved into Virginia as a
tropical storm. In the Caribbean, where Hugo first touched land, the
storm killed at least 27 people and left 50,000 homeless.
   ``All things considered, we lucked out in a lot of ways,'' said
Chipp Bailey, spokesman for Mecklenburg County Emergency Management
in Charlotte, where the most serious injury reported was a broken
pelvis suffered by a woman when a tree crashed through her roof.
   The hurricane and its tidal waves of up to 17 feet smashed ashore
at Charleston late Thursday. After being downgraded to a tropical
storm, Hugo advanced farther west than expected, whisking through
Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, where the
National Hurricane Center stopped tracking it.
   By the time it reached Pittsburgh on Friday night, Hugo was
generating winds under 40 mph and was no longer classified as a
tropical storm. As it fizzled early today, Hugo's dying remnants
darted through Canada's St. Lawrence Valley and became lost in
another weather front, according to meteorologist Joe Harrison of
the National Weather Service in New York.
   ``We really can't find it anymore,'' Harrison said.
   President Bush declared seven South Carolina counties _ with a
total of 750,000 residents _ a disaster area. The declaration frees
up federal aid for housing, loans and grants for rebuilding.
   Hundreds of insurance adjusters have come to South Carolina to
process the damage claims, but it will be days before they begin to
catch up, said state Insurance Commissioner John G. Richards.
   Along the coast, Folly Beach, Isle of Palms, Pawley's Island,
Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove and Garden City were devastated.
   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said Horry
County administrator M.L. Love after he toured the small
unincorporated town near Myrtle Beach. He said damage there could
run in the hundreds of millions.
   Residents of the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island, which were
among the hardest-hit barrier islands, were kept from even
inspecting their homes because the Ben Sawyer swing bridge _ the
only link to the mainland _ was knocked out. About 100 boats that
had been berthed at one marina were ``stacked up like cordwood,''
said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department
official.
   Pawley's Island had a 100-foot channel of water through it.
   ``There are now two Pawley's Islands, if you will,'' pilot Jack
Sellers said after flying over the island.
   Although the Pentagon had dispatched planes and ships from
Charleston's Air Force and Naval bases as Hugo approached, the
installations suffered perhaps $50 million in damage, said Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
   Charleston, a city of about 65,000 people, took the full force of
Hugo.
   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harbor
weathered the storm, but Fort Sumter, the first Union stronghold
fired upon by the Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War,
suffered $1 million damage when a 17-foot wall of water roared over
it, federal officials said.

   Advocates for the mentally retarded hope a
judge has set an example for others around the country by ordering
Pennsylvania officials to seek money to restore services for
retarded Philadelphians who live at home.
   ``This decision is the first in the nation holding that people
with retardation have a right to those services,'' said David
Ferleger, attorney for an advocacy group that joined the city in
seeking the state money.
   The decision also marks the beginning of a move to state courts
instead of federal court, where Ferleger's group, the Philadelphia
Police and Fire Association for Handicapped Children, lost earlier
this year in a similar case.
   Commonwealth Court Judge James Crumlish Jr. last week gave the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare until Oct. 2 to ask the
Legislature to provide the $7.56 million needed for services that
had been cut or canceled for up to 7,750 mentally retarded
Philadelphians.
   The order does not cover the Legislature, but Ferleger said if
the lawmakers turn down the request, he would ask the judge to order
the department to find the funds elsewhere in its budget.
   The judge ruled that state officials breached their
responsibility under state law to assure ``adequate mental
retardation services for all persons who need them.''
   Crumlish's opinion took state officials to task for failing to
evaluate the needs of Philadelphia's mentally retarded in coming up
with a budget. Instead, the state just added a little more to what
had been budgeted before, whether that previous amount met actual
needs.
   The ruling dealt only with the state's handling of one county.
   But ``that thing will be widely disseminated,'' said Allan
Bergman, deputy director for governmental activities for the United
Cerebral Palsy Associations.
   ``I would suggest there are other parties in other states where
they have similar grounds under their state laws,'' Bergman said.
   ``Very few states base their budgets on actual client need. That
issue will be true everywhere,'' Ferleger said.
   A 1987 survey by the Association for Retarded Citizens found
76,000 people waiting for day programs around the country.
   Richard Gold, deputy city solicitor for Philadelphia, isn't
convinced of a national effect of Crumlish's ruling. ``Our lawsuit
is under state law,'' he said simply.
   However, state law is becoming the chosen legal strategy as
groups push for services to keep people out of institutions,
integrate them into society and help them do things for themselves.
   The move to state courts began with a U.S. Supreme Court decision
in February that held the state of Wisconsin did not have a
constitutional duty to protect a boy who suffered brain damage from
repeated beatings by his father.
   Ferleger's group won an initial victory in federal court on
rights for the retarded to community services under the U.S.
Constitution. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
case, citing the Wisconsin ruling as grounds.
   In New Jersey, the state public advocate has sued the state
Department of Human Services in state court, contending the agency
wasn't providing appropriate community services to about 3,300
people.
   ``In recent years the federal Constitution has been interpreted
increasingly narrowly on disabilities issues. And some of the state
constitutions have been providing greater protection,'' said Linda
Headley, an attorney for the public advocate.
   Advocates like to see efforts succeed in other states.
   ``It's always important that some other judge somewhere else was
willing to do this,'' said Robert Fleischner, attorney for the
Center for Public Representation in Northampton, Mass.
   Tannis Fox, attorney for the Arizona Center for Law in the Public
Interest, said her group won a ruling by the Arizona Supreme Court
that state law required community treatment for the chronically
mentally ill.
   A national solution could come from outside the courts.
   The Senate Finance Committee in the next two weeks may consider a
bill sponsored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and co-sponsored by 53
others, that would eventually make such services a federal right _
the way Congress mandated in 1975 that disabled children have a
right to go to school.

   The co-pilot of the USAir jet that crashed into
the East River was making his first takeoff in a passenger-carrying
Boeing 737-400 when he mistakenly pushed a button that cut the
throttle, investigators said.
   The pilot tried to remedy the error by increasing engine thrust
manually, but then decided to abort the takeoff, James Kohlstad,
acting administrator of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said at a news conference Friday night.
   Also Friday, authorities suspended the pilot's and co-pilot's
flight licenses for leaving the scene of the crash.
   Two passengers died when the Charlotte, N.C.-bound plane skidded
off the end of LaGuardia Airport runway Wednesday night.
   Though he described the mistake by co-pilot Constantine Kleissaf,
29, and detailed his lack of experience on that model of aircraft,
Kohlstad didn't explicitly blame pilot error for the crash or say if
investigators had pinpointed the cause.
   The co-pilot was in charge of the highly computerized controls
when he mistakenly pushed the ``auto-throttle disconnect button'' as
the aircraft was rolling down the runway, Kohlstad said.
   The automatic throttles are programmed by the flight crew. The
button Kleissaf should have pushed would have accelerated the plane
automatically to a preset speed for takeoff, he said.
   As the plane continued down the runway, the pilot, 36-year-old
Michael Martin, jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually,
Kohlstad said.
   The plane started drifting to the left and ``the pilot felt and
heard a vibration which concerned him,'' and then cut power to abort
the takeoff, Kohlstad said.
   The pilots also failed to call out the jetliner's speed as it
rolled down the runway as required, Kohlstad said. ``It was clearly
a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit,'' he said.
   Kleissaf had controlled takeoffs in 737-400s in training,
Kohlstad said, but had never taken off in that model plane with
passengers aboard.
   Martin has been a captain since July 1 and had flown only 138
hours in that capacity on the 737-400, The New York Times reported
Saturday. He had about 4,000 hours on all models of 737s, mostly as
a co-pilot, the paper said, quoting unnamed government and industry
sources.
   FAA records show Kleissaf received his commercial pilot's license
in October 1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His
FAA record is clean, said FAA spokesman Bob Hoppers in Oklahoma
City, Okla.
   Investigators questioned Martin and Kleissaf separately for five
hours Friday. Both men later submitted to urine tests for drug and
alcohol, but the results weren't immediately available, Kohlstad
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration Friday suspended Martin's and
Kleissaf's flight licenses because they left the scene after the
crash and could not be questioned immediately by investigators, FAA
Administrator James B. Busey said. He called their conduct ``highly
questionable.''
   At his news conference, Kohlstad also criticized the pair for not
volunteering for alcohol and drug tests earlier.
   ``The provision of urine samples and no blood samples almost two
days after this accident seriously impedes our investigation and
unnecessarily creates an environment of suspicion,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Kohlstad noted that Martin and Kleissaf helped
passengers out of the plane after the crash, and that airline
regulations didn't require them to remain at the scene.
   He also said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment
Thursday, which partly explained their absence.
   Immediately after the crash, Martin took a rescue boat to the
airport and then a taxi to a nearby hotel, where he called his union
representative, Kohlstad said.
   The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement Friday
defending the crew. ``There was nothing unusual in the crew's
performance, no federal rules were broken and the crew has
cooperated completely with the investigation,'' it said.
   Martin tried to check into a hotel as ordered by USAir, and when
he couldn't get a room, went to the home of another pilot to rest,
the union said, adding that he stayed in touch with USAir officials.
   But USAir spokesman Dave Shipley denied that.
   ``He did not contact us and we did not tell him to go to the
hotel,'' Shipley said.
   The co-pilot was quoted after the crash as saying the pilot was
incoherent before the flight. But Kohlstad said other crew members
hadn't noticed anything unusual in his behavior. Kleissaf has
apologized for his remarks, the investigator said.
   Workers on Friday began removing the partially submerged
aircraft, which cracked into three pieces, from the water.
   The plane had been delivered in January and had no history of
mechanical problems, said airline spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan.

   A mural project sponsored by an anti-AIDS group to
remind drug users to avoid sharing needles has run into trouble with
Denver's beautification campaign. The problem _ the murals look a
lot like graffiti.
   Businesses and city officials are complaining about the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center effort called Project
Safe. It involved asking local artists to paint murals in three
drug-ridden neighborhoods to provide AIDS warnings such as, ``Don't
Share. Use Bleach.''
   To appeal to their intended audience, the state-funded artists
spray painted their messages in bold colors _ making it look like
the graffiti the city is trying to wipe out in the same
neighborhoods.
   ``(We are) looking at some other ways of getting that message
across rather than using walls,'' said Valeria Purser of the Keep
Denver Beautiful anti-graffiti campaign.
   ``To sanction any type of graffiti murals would be detrimental to
the campaign,'' said Purser.
   But the message has to reach those whose lifestyles make them
susceptible to AIDS, said Jean Finn, a spokeswoman for the state
Health Department's division for sexually transmitted diseases,
which helped with the project.
   ``At this point, we're just trying to figure out the value and
effectiveness of the murals, and take into consideration the
concerns in the areas they have voiced,'' said Finn.
   The mural campaign resulted from suggestions by prostitutes and
intravenous drug abusers at the Denver jail, said Stephanie Marusich
of the health department. The inmates were brought together in a
``focus group,'' a sort of bull session of the type used by
advertising people to learn about the preferences of average
citizens.
   ``You've got to reach people on the street in a way they're going
to respond and recognize,'' Ms. Marusich said. ``We're trying to
reach our audience first of all ... the appropriate audience with
the appropriate message.''
   Information about AIDS transmission must reach people who live in
a very different way, she said.
   ``We're talking about drug dens with blood sprayed on the
ceiling, where people stay in the dark, shoot their drugs and really
try and shut out the outside world,'' she said. ``We've been inside
shooting galleries to get a real good feel for what is happening.''
   Tom Gleason, an aide to Mayor Federico Pena, said the project's
intentions are good, but the method is not.
   ``In our experience, anything that resembles graffiti attracts
more graffiti,'' he said. ``Obviously their goal is an important
one.''
   The Five Points Business Association, in a lower middle-class
neighborhood, is objecting to one of the murals.
   ``We're addressing a letter to the governor,'' said association
president Sarah Foster. ``We do not want that kind of a mural in our
area. We are trying to clean it up.''
   Foster said the money for the murals, about $1,500 from a state
health department grant, would have been spent better on other forms
of education.
   Purser said the money private landowners, businesses and the city
have invested in such neighborhoods as Five Points could be
jeopardized by the murals.
   ``We're trying to revitalize,'' she said. ``Then you have this
huge sign right there in the middle of it. As a developer, you're
saying, `Why is this graffiti-type drug message there?'''
   Alternatives such as ordinary signs, plywood panels attached to
buildings and bench advertisements are being considered, Purser said.
   Marusich said the group hopes to produce several murals _ in some
form _ every three or four months.
   ``The point is there is drugs in Five Points,'' she said. ``There
are people who are becoming infected and infecting others.''
   The most rapid spread of AIDS at this point in the epidemic
involves the sharing of contaminated needles or syringes by drug
abusers and subsequent sexual contact involving those infected
through drug use. Federal officials said at the end of June that
intravenous drug abusers made up 23 percent of the more than 100,000
cases of AIDS in the United States.

   For three decades, NASA has launched
unmanned rockets from this spaceport _ more than 400 of them. On
Monday it plans to fire its last one here, closing an illustrious
chapter in American space history.
   The fiery finale will be staged by an Atlas-Centaur rocket which
is to blast off at 4:12 a.m. with a military communications
satellite to link land, sea and air forces around the world with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Command Authority and the
president.
   Once the Atlas-Centaur is gone, NASA's only launch vehicle at
Cape Canaveral will be the manned space shuttle. When the agency has
a need for an expendable rocket, it will have to buy the launch
services from private industry.
   In the past, NASA has purchased unmanned boosters from companies
such as General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas and used its own
crews to launch them. In the future, crews from private companies
will conduct the countdowns at the Cape as the nation's budding
commercial launch industry takes off.
   The space agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, Delta and other
space boosters early in the 1980s, opting instead to launch all its
payloads from the space shuttle.
   Officials admitted that was a mistake after the shuttle
Challenger exploded in 1986. Following the explosion, then-President
Reagan directed NASA to get out of the business of launching
commercial payloads, opening the way for rocket companies to start a
new enterprise.
   A backlog of government payloads and a desire to keep space
business from being sent abroad to France, China or even the Soviet
Union spurred the policy change.
   After the launch of the last Atlas-Centaur, the agency will have
one large unmanned rocket left, a Delta that is to lift a scientific
satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in November. And
the government will continue to launch military space rockets from
Vandenberg and the Cape.
   Still, Monday's launch is a milestone for Cape Canaveral, where
NASA got its start and where it has launched more than 95 percent of
its boosters.
   ``It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said James L.
Womack, NASA's director of expendable launch vehicles, who will be
in the launch control center Monday.
   ``There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have
done have been fabulous,'' said Joseph Mahon, the agency's assistant
administrator for space flight.
   Among the achievements: The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyager
missions to the planets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyor
and Lunar Orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of
American astronauts landing there; 94 communications satellites;
scores of scientific payloads; dozens of unmanned test launches for
the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects.
   NASA's first launch vehicle was a Thor Able that lifted off Oct.
11, 1958, propelling the Pioneer 1 probe toward a flyby of the moon.
It failed, as did four more rockets before a Juno 2 hurled Pioneer 3
within 37,300 miles of the moon and into orbit around the sun on
March 3, 1959.
   Three more failures followed before the successful launch of
Explorer 6, a radiation-study satellite, on Aug. 7, 1959.
   Other failures followed, but the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's overall success rate stands at more than 90 percent
of 447 launches.
   In recent years the burden has been borne by two workhorse
rockets, the Atlas-Centaur, which will be making its 68th appearance
on Monday, and the Delta, with 184 liftoffs. Both have a success
rate of more than 95 percent.
   NASA has ordered launch services starting next year from General
Dynamics for four Atlas-Centaurs to boost three weather satellites
and a sun-studying payload, and the agency plans to use three Titan
rockets launched by Martin Marietta to hoist planetary probes in the
1990s.
   The change involves no layoffs, since private contractors already
filled many of the ranks of NASA's launch teams and some personnel
are being shifted to the shuttle or other space agency programs.

   Police arrested more than 150
people, clashed with angry blacks and cordoned off a cathedral with
barbed wire Saturday in a massive operation to stop a march by
anti-apartheid women's groups.
   Two blocks from the church, where thousands of women had planned
to assemble, white extremists went ahead with two
government-approved rallies. Fights broke out between the khaki-clad
neo-Nazis and black onlookers. Police made several arrests and
chased blacks away with batons.
   Downtown Pretoria resembled a militarized zone, with major
streets closed to civilian traffic throughout normally busy morning
shopping hours. Hundreds of policemen and scores of riot-control
vehicles were deployed to prevent the women's march and monitor the
right-wing rallies.
   The white extremists sought and received permission to
demonstrate, but the women's planned march to government
headquarters was banned because organizers refused to seek a permit.
   Authorities also said they feared simultaneous protests by such
diverse factions might spark violence.
   Zeni Tshongweni, a spokeswoman for organizers of the women's
march, said many would-be marchers were arrested when they tried to
assemble near the Union Buildings, their intended destination. Other
activists said several people, including children and elderly women,
were injured when police used clubs and dogs to disperse the crowd.
   Police said 154 people were arrested, all released after being
told to appear in court Monday. Police headquarters said most of the
arrests came when officers were pelted with stones and bottles while
confronting scores of blacks, including well-known activist Winnie
Mandela, at a trade union office after the march was canceled.
   Police said three people were injured, but gave no details.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of imprisoned African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, and other blacks aboard two buses later were chased
by a convoy of police vehicles and ordered to leave Pretoria.
   ``We came here peacefully but they are seeking violence,'' Mrs.
Mandela said.
   Some of the biggest marches in South Africa's history have taken
place in the past two weeks, after new President F.W. de Klerk said
his government would allow peaceful protests. Authorities announced
Friday that leaders of such marches must obtain advance approval.
   An authorized anti-apartheid march was held Saturday in Boksburg,
near Johannesburg. An estimated 2,500 mixed-race residents paraded
peacefully from their segregated neighborhood to the downtown area
to protest the right-wing-controlled city council's reimposition of
strict segregation ordinances.
   In Pretoria, anti-apartheid lawyer Ismail Ayob was at St. Alban's
Anglican Cathedral when it became apparent the women would be unable
to assemble there.
   ``It's been a great success for the government,'' he said.
``Roadblocks as far back as Soweto (a black township an hour's drive
away), barbed wire, security vehicles. The government has made its
point.''
   A notice tacked to a church door said the government had obtained
a court order banning a pre-march service and the march itself. Two
trucks mounted with tear gas cannons were parked beside the church.
   ``It is the same as any other country in the world. People can't
break the law,'' said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, standing
with riot police outside St. Alban's.
   Police briefly detained Richard Sergay, correspondent for ABC
News, and several other journalists.
   March organizers said police blocked most traffic from black
townships around Pretoria. Roadblocks were set up at entrances into
the city, with officers searching many vehicles and turning back
some.
   At Church Square, the heart of the capital, about 500 white
extremists sang Afrikaans hymns and listened to Bible readings as
hundreds of blacks watched from the plaza's perimeter.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, assailed de Klerk's proposals to give the black majority a
share of political power. If the government capitulates, he said,
his group would use force to regain white dominance.
   One neo-Nazi banner said, ``Apartheid: Solution for AIDS.''
Another demanded the hanging of Nelson Mandela and freedom for
Barend Strydom, a white ex-policeman sentenced to death for killing
seven blacks in a shooting spree in Pretoria last year.
   About 40 blacks trying to cross the square were accosted by
members of the resistance movement, who wear kahki uniforms with
swastika-like symbols.
   Officers ran through the square, arresting blacks and ordering
people out of the area. At least one white extremist also was
arrested.
   Police then allowed a second rally by right-wingers who split
from the Afrikaner Resistance Movement earlier this year.
   The right-wing rallies were convened in response to a protest in
the square last week by blacks condemning police brutality. Some
blacks had climbed atop a statue of Paul Kruger, a folk hero of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who now control the government.

<HEAD>Thatcher Predicts Success for Gorbachev Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher predicted
Saturday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sweeping reform
agenda will ultimately triumph over the current wave of domestic
unrest.
   ``I believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go
through to success,'' the British leader told a news conference
following four hours of meetings with Gorbachev.
   Mrs. Thatcher was on a one-day stopover between Tokyo and London.
   The meeting _ which Mrs. Thatcher termed a ``milestone'' _ was
the fifth between the two leaders since Gorbachev was named
Communist Party chief in 1985. Mrs. Thatcher also was guest at a
luncheon hosted by Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa.
   The British prime minister was the first major Western leader to
see Gorbachev since this summer's wave of strikes by miners in the
Ukraine and Siberia and deadly flareups of ethnic violence in
Georgia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   In her remarks to reporters, she expressed great confidence in
the 58-year-old Kremlin leader and his program for economic and
social reform, saying it ``opens up vistas and horizons not
available to the people of the Soviet Union for some 70 years.''
   Asked about current domestic woes faced by Gorbachev's reform
drive, she replied that ``anything bold and purposeful will have
difficulties to it.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks amounted to a vote of confidence in
Gorbachev from a Western leader regarded by many Soviets as
hardheaded, practical and not at all favorably disposed to Communism.
   One of the topics discussed by the two leaders was arms control,
and Mrs. Thatcher said she had been ``in touch'' with President Bush
on the matter before meeting with Gorbachev at St. Catherine's Hall
in the Kremlin.
   However, she declined to comment on anything Gorbachev may have
told her on a dramatic swing in the Soviet position on a superpower
treaty now being negotiated to slash long-range nuclear weapons
arsenals.
   At Jackson Hole, Wyo., where Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met,
U.S. officials said Friday the Soviets had dropped demands that a
treaty be concluded to limit space-based defenses before a separate
pact to slash long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines.
   Since the United States had refused to yield to Soviet demands to
trim its ``Star Wars'' space-defense program, a superpower treaty to
reduce strategic weapons by 30 to 50 percent had seemed improbable.
   Asked whether Gorbachev had mentioned the switch in the Soviet
bargaining position, Mrs. Thatcher told reporters gathered at the
Soviet Foreign Ministry press room that any announcement on the
subject should be made in the United States.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said only that
``information'' had been exchanged on new developments in superpower
arms negotiations.
   On other disarmament topics, Mrs. Thatcher said she left her
meeting with Gorbachev believing that East and West can reach an
agreement reducing coventional weaponry in Europe by next year. She
also said prospects were ``encouraging' for a ban on chemical
weapons.
   Before the leaders met, Tass said Soviet concerns in the talks
would include Mrs. Thatcher's support for Western plans to modernize
short-range nuclear weapons. It said the Soviet side also would
raise questions about European plans for a single market in 1992,
cooperation on ecological problems, and economic joint ventures.
   Mrs. Thatcher did not directly address those issues at her
half-hour news conference. Tass said only that the issue of tactical
nuclear weapons in Europe ``had not been skirted.''
   The British leader's personal relationship with Gorbachev is
warm, even though she retains a watchful eye on Soviet military
power. Relations between London and Moscow slid in May when the
British expelled 11 Soviet journalists and diplomats on allegations
of spying, and the Soviets retaliated by expelling 11 Britons.
   But Tass said that ``in Soviet diplomatic circles, it is believed
that these differences should not be viewed as an obstacle to the
development of relations between the two nations.''

   A Soviet music student who disappeared before
a performance by a Leningrad State Conservatory troupe at Towson
State University apparently is seeking to defect, school and Soviet
officials said.
   The 19-year-old musician was reported to be at an undisclosed
Immigration and Naturalization Service site Friday, Towson State
spokesman Dan McCarthy said Saturday.
   ``The State Department has confirmed that he is at some location,
and that is the only fact we know for certain,'' Towson State
president Hoke L. Smith said.
   INS and State Department officials do not comment on cases
involving political asylum, officials from both agencies said
Saturday.
   The student, Pyotr Zaytsev, 19, was one of 20 students and 10
faculty members from the Leningrad State Conservatory who arrived in
Maryland on Tuesday. The group is scheduled to leave Thursday.
   Zaytsev failed to show up Friday morning to board a bus that was
to take him from a hotel to the school. Soviet and school officials
filed a missing person report and were informed later Friday of
Zaytsev's status, McCarthy said.
   The vice president of the Leningrad State Conservatory, Gintas
Zhalvys, said through an interpreter that no decision had been made
whether to leave without Zaytsev.
   ``Pyotr has to think it over, appraise the situation and make up
his mind,'' Zhalvys said.
   Zaytsev plays the balalaika, a triangular, stringed instrument
played like a guitar, McCarthy said. Zhalvys said a scheduled
performance was held as planned Friday and the remainder of the
group's schedule would not change.
   ``This boy had a very small part in our program, so it was very
easy to substitute that part,'' Zhalvys said. ``We came here to meet
our friends and share the warmth of our hearts, but we never
intended to impose on them in this way.''

   Branden Burdick's invention might not mow the
lawn, take out the trash or give a kid the keys to the car, but it
has a couple of other tricks that make it The Portable Dad.
   ``When you pull the string, a boxing glove punches you in the
face, and when you release it, a boot kicks you'' in the rear, said
Branden, 13, of Lenexa.
   The invention, worn on one's back, is meant to help children
break bad habits, said Branden, an eighth-grader who said he created
the device last winter for science class.
   The Portable Dad impressed Paul Osgood, Branden's science
teacher, who felt it should be shared with the rest of the world.
Osgood alerted ``The Dr. Fad Show,'' a nationally syndicated
children's television program.
   Last week, Branden and the Portable Dad traveled to Philadelphia
to appear on the show and compete with other inventors.
   ``There was stuff like an air-conditioned hat, a
remote-controlled food server, jewelry made out of bottle caps,''
Branden said.
   None could top The Portable Dad. Branden won the show's grand
prize, a weekend trip for two to EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World
in Florida.
   Branden said he didn't fancy himself an inventor, but he is not
standing pat with the first model.
   ``I'm working on a remote-control version,'' he said.

   A 35-year-old welder who won
Pennsylvania's $31.6 million lottery jackpot did what many people
say they would do. He quit his job. Then his sister and brother and
sister-in-law followed suit.
   Curtis Newnum's sister Nora turned in her notice at a deli. His
brother, Randy, is no longer working as a prison guard and Randy's
wife, Sandy, gave up a new job at McDonald's.
   ``The first thing he said was: `It's for all of us,''' his
mother, Betty Newnum, said Friday at a news conference in Linwood,
Pa.
   Last week, Newnum, of Smyrna, Del., was standing in line for
lottery tickets at a corner convenience store just over the
Pennsylvania line in Linwood. His lifelong friend, Paul Shetzler,
was in front of him.
   Newnum and several friends had decided the prize in the Sept. 13
lottery was worth the trip. But Shetzler was distracted by an
attractive woman and left the line in an attempt to strike up a
conversation with her.
   Newnum took his place and drew the winning computer-generated
number.
   The $31.6 million prize makes Newnum the largest single prize
winner in Pennsylvania lottery history. He'll receive 26 annual
after-tax installments of $973,055.39.
   Was the woman worth $31.6 million? a reporter asked Shetzler.
   ``I don't know, maybe she is,'' he said. ``If I could find her
address ....''

   Hawaiian authorities besieged by epidemic use of
a smokable crystalline form of the illegal drug methamphetamine have
a warning for police on the mainland: Highly addictive ``ice'' is
heading their way.
   ``We're not trying to glamorize this drug, nor are we proud that
it's hit Hawaii first, but we need to alert law enforcement people
everywhere and prepare them to handle it,'' said Maj. Mike Carvalho
of the Honolulu Police Department's narcotics division.
   Since 1985, there have been 32 deaths related to the crystal meth
in Honolulu, including 12 in the first six months of 1989, according
to Medical Examiner Mary Flynn. They included eight homicides and
seven suicides in which the victims had crystal meth in their
systems, she said.
   The drug causes symptoms of psychosis and many users are
misdiagnosed as mentally ill, especially schizophrenic.
   ``This drug makes people bananas. People become violent, they
kill themselves, drive crazy, pick fights,'' she said. ``And we just
know about the victims; who knows what the assailants were on?''
   Since Sept. 5, when drug czar William Bennett unveiled a national
anti-drug plan, nearly 50 U.S. agencies have requested background on
crystal meth, Carvalho said.
   ``Last week we had a video conference projected to 600 precincts
in Texas during roll call,'' Carvalho said. ``We had slides on what
it looks like, the effects, what symptoms to look for and how it's
being packaged and smoked.''
   Although labs making methamphetamine, also known as speed or
crank, in its common powdered form are busted in California every
year, the crystals smoked here come mainly from Asia, Carvalho said.
Some mainland authorities familiar with meth don't even recognize
the crystalline form, which looks like rock salt or candy, he said.
   Crystal meth is already turning up all along the West Coast, as
well as Arizona, Texas and Florida, he said.
   The crystalline form also is known as ``ice,'' ``crystals'' or
``batu.'' It has been smoked here for at least a decade by a small
number of Asian immigrants, but surged to widespread use about two
years ago, he said.
   So far this year, about 400 people have been investigated for the
possession or sale of crystal meth, described as cheaper than
cocaine, with a longer high than the smokable ``crack'' form of
cocaine and more addictive than heroin.
   ``That's really the crux of the epidemic,'' said Dr. Joseph
Giannasio, medical director of Castle Medical Center's Alcohol and
Addictions Program. ``Anytime you can get a drug that causes a very
rapid high in a high dosage without having to use a needle, it's
going to be a lot more popular.''
   Ice smokers get an energizing high than can last 14 hours,
compared with about 15 minutes for crack. But the psychological
crash is much worse and can last for days, or until the next smoke,
Giannasio said.
   A recent study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse called use
here ``epidemic.''
   Although no one can say for sure how many people here smoke ice,
about 700 people required emergency treatment in the past six months
after using it.
   Ironically, many users switched from crack to crystal meth
because they considered it safer; instead, they found themselves
addicted from ``practically the first smoke,'' Giannasio said.
   ``The typical user turns into a paranoid person who goes days
without sleep, loses weight, is very suspicious that people are out
to get him. They feel like they're going crazy,'' Giannasio said.
``But that's not how it starts out. At first when they use the drug,
they feel extremely alert, like they can accomplish anything.''
   The drug can also be fatal, leading to strokes, heart attacks and
pulmonary edema, which means victims drown in their own bodily
fluids, he said.
   Police Maj. David Benson, head of the juvenile crime division,
said Filipino youth gangs control distribution of ice here.
   The gangs are heavily armed, and violence has escalated recently
as rival gangs and even factions of the same group compete for
control of the drug. It is commonly sold in ``papers'' containing
one hit, or about a tenth of a gram, for $50.
   ``We're just getting the tip of the iceberg,'' he said. ``This
stuff is as bad as crack and if it explodes on the national scene
without the police being prepared, we're just going to have more
violence, more addicts and more dead.''

   Family members on Saturday grieved for their
slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the
Royal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10
military musicians.
   Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was killed, joined local
residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of
private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other
military establishments in Britain.
   ``The security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal. We had
seen it for ourselves. We have always said how easy it would be for
anyone to get in ... What could ordinary security men do to stop
terrorists?'' she said.
   British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA's
campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemen
were fatally wounded in bombings in central London.
   Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to lay
flowers in tribute to the young men they called the ``Bandies.''
   An 11-year-old Royal Marines cadet in full dress uniform marched
to the barracks and smartly saluted the Royal Marines sign.
   ``I'm proud of my uniform and I'm proud of all the Marines I
knew. I hate the people who did this to them,'' said Scott Roberts.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, visited the injured and said he was impressed
``by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat
them.''
   Runcie said one of the men's main concerns was that their hands
would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical
instruments.
   Police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house
that had been rented briefly by three men with Irish accents.
   ``We know when the men arrived and when they left,'' Cmdr. George
Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad,
said at a news conference. ``It appears the men left several days
before the explosion.''
   He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation center
destroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its English
owners to three men for two to three weeks.
   There was no proof the house was an IRA hideout, the commander
said.
   ``By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and
the men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them,'' he said.
   Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were
painstakingly examining the house Saturday, and Churchill-Coleman
said they would continue for the next two or three days.
   Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between
morning band practices were servicemen. Of 22 men injured, 12
remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition.
   The Irish Republican Army on Friday claimed responsibility for
the explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses.
   Police have not determined what caused the blast, but
Churchill-Coleman said, ``It would seem to be some form of
improvised device using high explosives.'' The IRA did not specify
how it caused the blast.

   In Washington, where some people still speak of
``simplicity'' and ``tax law'' in the same sentence and $100,000 is
described as middle income, they've just discovered a new tax
outrage. They call it ``the bubble.''
   Here's what it means: If the president (who's paid $200,000) and
your bachelor governor with no income except an $85,000 salary win
$1,000 each in the lottery, the president must pay $280 in tax on
that additional income and the governor must pay $330.
   To House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., ``the bubble ... is a
distortion, it is totally topsy-turvy, upside down of everything
that we have ever considered fair, reasonable tax policy.''
   Americans have grown up with the notion that the more you make,
the greater portion of each dollar you pay in tax. The stripped-down
tax-rate structure enacted in 1986 conflicts with that tradition.
   Draw a bar graph of traditional income tax rates and you see a
series of stairsteps leading upward. But the new law has three steps
up and then _ for the really high-income earners _ one step down.
   That step down is ``the bubble,'' which benefits the nation's
richest 600,000 couples and individuals.
   The quirk is at the heart of a steaming tax battle between
congressional Democrats and President Bush.
   As part of their plan to kill Bush's proposed capital-gains tax
cut, Foley and fellow Democratic leaders in the House are trying to
burst ``the bubble.'' Eliminating it would take more taxes from the
wealthiest and use the money to allow deductible Individual
Retirement Accounts for all workers and to cut the budget deficit.
   Here's what ``the bubble'' is all about:

   The tax law now has three tax rates: 15 percent, 28 percent and
33 percent. Every taxpayer pays the lowest rate. For about 80
percent of Americans, it is the only rate they pay; every taxable
dollar they earn is taxed at a rate of 15 percent.
   For a single person, the bottom rate applies to all taxable
income _ what is left after deductions and personal exemptions are
subtracted _ up to $18,550. For a couple filing a joint return, the
15 percent bracket covers taxable income up to $30,950.
   Suppose Jill Lunchbucket has taxable income of $18,000 and gets a
$1,000 pay raise. Step 2 of the rate structure comes into play. The
first $18,550 is taxed at 15 percent and the additional $450 is
taxed at 28 percent.
   Jill has moved up into the 28 percent marginal tax bracket,
meaning that any additional income _ another pay raise, winning a
football pool or interest on a new savings account _ will be taxed
at 28 percent.
   Suppose she's elected football commissioner and gets a $70,000
raise. Assuming she has no extra deductions, that pushes her taxable
income to $89,000 and produces this tax picture:
   _$18,550 is taxed at 15 percent, resulting in $2,782.50 in tax.
   _The next $26,350 is taxed at 28 percent, or $7,378.
   _The remaining $44,900 is taxed at 33 percent, or $14,553.
   That means a total tax of $24,713.50.
   ``The bubble'' does not affect Jill because her taxable income is
under the $93,130 level at which it comes into play.
   But consider Jack Bigbucks, who also is single, makes $500,000 a
year and has taxable income of $400,000. He has to figure his taxes
differently.
   That is because congressional tax-writers, in crafting the 1986
overhaul, decreed that singles with taxable incomes above $93,130
and couples above $155,320 with no dependents pay a flat 28 percent
rate on every penny of taxable income. Also, the very rich get no
tax benefit from personal exemptions.
   So, for Jack:
   _The entire $400,000 is taxed at 28 percent, for a tax of
$112,000.
   _Losing the tax saving from his $2,000 personal exemption adds
$560 (28 percent of $2,000) to his tax bill.
   That gives Jack a tax liability of $112,560.
   The Democrats want to remove that ``bubble'' _ prevent the 33
percent rate from dropping back to 28 percent. They would tax all of
Jack's taxable income over $44,900 at 33 percent. That would mean:
   _$18,550 taxed at 15 percent, a tax of $2,782.50.
   _The next $26,350 taxed at 28 percent, or $7,378.
   _The remaining $355,100 taxed at 33 percent, or $117,183.
   Jack would have a total tax bill of $127,343.50 _ or $14,783.50
more than under present law.

   Lake for sale. Some maintenance
required. Best offer.
   It's not your average auction, but on Monday, Hoosac Lake goes on
the block as lawyers try to liquidate the last remaining, and
already fairly liquid, asset of a defunct printing works. And
shorefront residents are not eager to see it fall into the hands of
a developer.
   ``We're selling this thing as is, where is. Whatever we have you
get,'' said Joseph H. Reinhardt, a lawyer with the Springfield firm
handling the sale, the last item in an 8-year-old bankruptcy case
involving the defunct Arnold Print Works.
   Part of Hoosac's shoreline runs through the Berkshires town of
Cheshire, and residents there are worried.
   ``Our concern is if it is a private buyer, what does he have in
mind for us?'' said Raymond Fisher, chairman of the Hoosac Lake
Committee. ``It's what people in the big cities like New York and
Boston and Los Angeles dream about. It's very picturesque, quiet,
Arcadian.''
   Despite its scenic qualities, town officials say the lake would
be a bad buy because of the costs of weeding, expected to be $31,000
this year, and because it includes an aging, 120-year-old dam.
Fisher said he hopes Monday's auction will be a flop, proving the
lake doesn't have commercial potential and possibly opening the door
for its donation to the town or state.
   ``I personally don't think anyone's going to be interested,''
said Selectman Frank Polastri. The town doesn't plan to make a bid,
but ``all of us are going to be there,'' he said.
   Cheshire had been paying $750 a year for an annual lease to use
the lake, Polastri said.
   ``What the town would do after the sale is anybody's guess at
this point,'' he said.
   About five years ago, the state offered about $115,000 for the
566-acre lake, but was unable to reach an agreement on price, said
state Sen. Peter Webber. With the state in a budget crisis, the
money isn't there this year, he said.
   Reinhardt says the property, which includes about 50 acres of
land, might be good for someone who wants to build a resort.
   The lake dates to the 1860s, when manufacturers banded together
to buy land, dam the Hoosac River and create water power for their
mills.
   In 1912 the Hoosac Reservoir Co. was formed to oversee management
of the water. Arnold Print Works was the last remaining shareholder
of that company, Reinhardt said. Principals of the company are no
longer involved in the case, he said.
   Terms of the auction will be outlined Monday, but the auctioneer
has announced that a $25,000 deposit is required, Reinhardt said.
   ``I have no idea what we're going to sell it for,'' he said.
   A sale would be subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Worcester and any proceeds would be divided among unsecured
creditors of the print works.

   President Bush said Saturday that composer Irvin
Berlin, was ``a legendary man whose words and music will help define
the history of our nation.''
   Just minutes before Bush's statement was released, the president
joined a crowd of thousands to sing ``God Bless America,'' one of
the many songs written by Berlin. The occasion was a luncheon of
Roman Catholic lawyers where Bush spoke.
   ``Very few people have come to touch and move the soul of a
nation, reflecting its spirit and traditions,'' Bush said of Berlin,
who died Friday at the age of 101.
   ``Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a legendary man
whose words and music will help define the history of our nation,''
Bush said.
   ``His love of country and fellow man, so vividly demonstrated in
his songs, were characteristics which we all admired and which will
be part of his legacy.
   ``His songs have become woven into the very fabric of American
society, touching the lives of generations of Americans,'' the
president said.
   ``Barbara and I extend our sympathies to his family and join the
American people in mourning the loss of this great American.''

<TEXT>
   Just how Pablo Picasso and his lesser-known
friend Georges Braque invented cubism eight decades ago is the topic
of a major exhibit opening Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art.
   The show, described by the museum as the first attempt to examine
cubism ``through an in-depth concentration on its core,'' deals with
the artists' work between 1907 and 1914.
   ``During the cubist years both artists were at their best when
they were closest to one another,'' exhibition organizer William
Rubin writes in the catalog. ``Cubism as we know it was a vision
that neither artist could have realized alone.''
   A New York Times critic described the exhibit as ``the show of
the decade.''
   The exhibition consists of 390 works, including paintings,
drawings, prints, sculptures and collages. They were borrowed from
museums and collections all over the United States and Europe, and
from the Soviet Union.
   The French-born Braque lived from 1882 to 1963. Picasso, a native
of Spain who spent most of his life in France, lived from 1881 to
1973. They were colleagues in Paris at the time they developed the
abstract style known as cubism in the early years of the century.

<TEXT>
   Finance officials of the nation's seven largest
industrial nations gathered Saturday amid growing evidence their
efforts to stabilize world currency markets have become ineffective.
   In their first meeting since April, the officials of the Group of
Seven _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain,
France, Canada and Italy _ are reviewing this year's rise in the
value of the dollar, which is endangering the improvement in the
American trade deficit.
   A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of
U.S. goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper
for American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent last year
and has continued to improve this year, although at only about half
of 1988's rate.
   When the finance officials and central bank governors of the
seven nations last met, they agreed to try to curb a further
increase in the dollar. They've backed the rhetoric with heavy
intervention in currency markets, the process in which central banks
buy and sell dollars in an attempt to influence dollar prices.
   But even though the central banks have sold billions, the price
of the dollar continued to rise. Analysts say intervention is
becoming less effective because government sales amount to an
increasingly smaller fraction of the mushrooming volume of daily
currency trading.
   Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about
10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the West
German mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks,
well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading
range sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks.
   In advance of Saturday's meeting, conducted in private, analysts
were expecting the G-7 to do little more than issue a vague
communique expressing concern about the dollar's strength.
   However, economists were holding out the possibility that the
United States, Japan and Germany may show more willingness in the
months ahead to raise or lower interest rates as a means of
influencing exchange markets.
   An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates would make
investing in those countries more attractive and would thus raise
the value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in the United
States would push the dollar lower.
   ``The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the
long run,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``The only
long-term solution really is to change monetary policy.''
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York, speculated that the Japanese and West
German officials would agree at Saturday's meeting to raise their
interest rates if the dollar threatened to rise above 2.00 marks and
150 yen.
   ``There is also the possibility, and I'd underscore the word
`possibility,' of Fed loosening'' in the fourth quarter, he said.
``I think the G-7 is going to speak softly but carry a big stick on
the dollar this time.''
   In addition to the narrow question of exhange rates, finance
officials were expected to discuss the broader issue of economic
coordination. The United States has been pressing West Germany and
Japan to stimulate consumer demand in their countries as a means of
cutting their trade surpluses and reducing the U.S. deficit. The
United States, in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curb
its budget deficit, which is believed to contribute to the trade
deficit.
   The Third World debt problem was also expected to be discussed by
the officials. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who hosted the
G-7 meeting with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, has
been promoting a new strategy to relieve developing nations of their
crushing $1.3 trillion debt burden.
   However, the decision by three large U.S. banks last week to add
$4 billion to their loss reserves for Third World debt is raising
concern that the banks will be unwilling to make the new loans
needed by developing countries for economic growth.
   The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of the
annual meetings this week of the 152-nation International Monetary
Fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.
   The finance ministers and central banks governors arrived in
limousines at the Blair House, across the street from the White
House, before lunch. The G-7 session was preceded by a Group of Five
meeting _ the G-7 excluding Canada and Italy _ at the Treasury.
   Brady met one-on-one with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new Japanese
minister of finance, and Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance
minister. It was Brady's first meeting with Hashimoto.

   Rough weather with waves up to 12 feet
high Saturday forced suspension of a search for a car that went over
a guardrail and fell from the Mackinac Bridge 170 feet into the
stormy Straits of Mackinac.
   The car was about halfway across the 5-mile-long bridge between
Upper and Lower Michigan when it apparently went out of control and
flipped over a 3{-foot guardrail Friday, state Trooper Don Tillery
said.
   The car fell about 170 feet from the bridge carrying Interstate
75 over the confluence of lakes Michigan and Huron into 170 to 190
feet of water, Tillery said.
   Witnesses disagreed on whether there were one or three people in
the car, said state Trooper Don Tillery said. No reports of missing
persons had been received Saturday, he said.
   ``People come up north to these rural cabins and (relatives)
don't expect a phone call for four or five days,'' he said. ``And a
lot of these rural cabins don't have phones.''
   The Coast Guard cutter Katmai Bay returned to St. Ignace early
Saturday after an overnight search failed to locate debris or other
evidence, Lt. John Lt. John Andrzejewski said from Sault Ste. Marie.
The Coast Guard had no immediate plans to resume the search, he said.
   ``The seas are too rough to put down any divers right now,''
Tillery said. ``We've got 6- to 12-foot waves.''
   It was the first accident of its kind on the 32-yer-old bridge,
Sgt. Kenneth Hardy said.

   Guerrilla forces have seized
territory surrounding a gem-rich western town, taking advantage of
Vietnam's troop withdrawal from Cambodia, the defense minister said
Saturday.
   It is the first government acknowledgment that the resistance has
captured territory in a battle seen as a crucial test of the
Cambodian army, which is fighting for once without Vietnamese troop
support.
   Gen. Tea Banh also said that less than 20,000 government soldiers
have been killed or wounded since January 1979, when Vietnam invaded
and installed Cambodia's present government.
   ``I am speaking to you frankly. We do not claim that we control
all of Pailin,'' the general said of the ruby-rich town near the
Thai border.
   Cambodia's ruby mines are centered in a 16-square-mile area near
Pailin. The general said Khmer Rouge troops have seized parts of the
mining center.
   A Soviet military observer said the Cambodian government and
Khmer Rouge guerrillas have thrown their best troops into the battle
for Pailin.
   He said fighting was fierce and most residents had fled or been
evacuated. The observer, who requested anonymity, spoke in Russian
to an East European reporter who made his comments available to The
Associated Press.
   Tea Banh told a news conference that soldiers are exchanging
mostly mortar and artillery shells.
   But he said the fighting is not a serious security threat to the
government, which has been supported by Vietnamese troops since the
invasion that ended a bloody reign of terror by the communist Khmer
Rouge.
   ``Only some parts of the forest have been captured and most of
the district is in our hands,'' he said.
   He indicated the government is willing to hold another round of
peace talks with the guerrilla coalition it is battling.
   In Bangkok on Saturday, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
announced his mediation had won agreement from Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen and leaders of the three guerrilla factions to
resume peace talks some time in the future.
   ``We would like to continue with our national reconciliation,''
Tea Banh said. ``It is very important for us to get peace _ peace
that is for the sake of the people of our country. ... If this peace
comes along with the return of the genocidal regime (of the Khmer
Rouge), it cannot be accepted.''
   The government refuses to allow the Khmer Rouge to take part in a
transitional government. Non-Communist guerrilla leaders say they
prefer to share power with the hard-line Communist Khmer Rouge than
fight it.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in
attempts at an agrarian revolution in 1975-1978.
   Also Saturday, Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Nhim Vanda told
Vietnamese troops celebrating their withdrawal that Cambodian troops
will be able to defend the country.
   ``During the 10 years our Vietnamese comrades have been in
Cambodia, the Cambodian military has improved step-by-step,'' he
told a Phnom Penh gathering of Vietnamese forces from three
Cambodian provinces.
   The guerrillas have their bases near the Thai border, both in
Thailand and Cambodia, and receive the bulk of their arms via
Thailand from China. They hope in the Pailin battle to secure a base
deeper inside the country as well as revenue from the ruby mines.
   Vietnam says the last of 26,000 troops in Cambodia will depart
Tuesday, ending involvement in a war that took lives of 25,000
Vietnamese troops. Guerrilla leaders say the pullout is a ploy and
that Hanoi is hiding troops in Cambodia.
   Tea Banh said about 10,000 Cambodian soldiers have been killed or
wounded in combat and another 10,000 died or were hurt by sickness
or landmines.

<HEAD>Genscher Denounces East German Ban of Fledgling Pro-Democracy Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's foreign minister on
Saturday denounced East Germany's ban on a dissident group, and East
Germany's former intelligence chief reportedly said he favors change
in his Communist homeland.
   The East German Interior Ministry on Thursday outlawed the
fledgling Neues Forum, pro-democracy group, saying it harbored
``anti-state'' policies. Activists say the group has grown from 30
to more than 3,000 members in two weeks.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher denounced the
East German government's action.
   ``Can it be anti-state when people want to make contributions
toward reforms of state and society? Why are they being shoved into
illegality, instead of being listened to and taken seriously?''
Genscher said in a speech in the West Germany city of Kaiserslautern.
   His speech was made available to reporters in Bonn in advance.
   Neues Forum is among a host of pro-democracy groups that has
sprung up across the country as East Germany's aging leaders
continue to reject Kremlin-style reforms despite the emigration of
thousands of East Germans to the West in recent weeks.
   Neues Forum leaders have vowed to challenge the government's
action in court.
   There have been signs of disunity over the question of reforms
within East Germany's ruling Communist Party, with some East German
officials conceding in recent days that changes are necessary.
   A West German newspaper on Saturday quoted East Germany's former
head of intellingence, Marcus Wolf, as saying ``changes are
important and belong to the huge theme of Socialist renewal.''
   The Sueddeutsche Zeiting also quoted the former spymaster, who
retired in 1987 and still lives in East Germany, as saying it is
important to ``think over the causes'' of the exodus of thousands of
East Germans to the West ``and also speak about it.''
   Wolf also said Communist East Germany stands on ``solid
foundations'' and that ``we can look into the future with
optimism,'' the newspaper reported.
   The Hamburg-based newspaper Bild am Sonntag quoted East Berlin
pastor Rainer Eppelmann, who is also a leading pro-democracy
activist, as saying many people within the East German Communist
Party favor reforms.
   Eppelman said the banning of Neues Forum is the ``futile attempt
... of a small leadership group'' within the party to ``head off
historic developments that are to come,'' the newspaper said.
   ``The Communist Party is no longer a monolithic block. The desire
for openness and change is now even driving Communist Party
members,'' Eppelmann was quoted as saying.
   Eppelmann also said the current reform movement in East Germany
is ``only the tip of the iceberg'' and will grow dramatically, the
newspaper reported.
   ``There will be more voices, and they will become more urgent,''
the Lutheran Church pastor was quoted as saying.
   Bild am Sonntag is a Sunday newspaper. It telexed copies of its
interview with Eppelmann to other news agencies in advance.
   Thousands of East Germans have been fleeing to the West in recent
years. Hungary acclerated that flood on Sept. 10, when it began
allowing thousands of vacationing East Germans unrestricted access
into Austria, where they traveled to get to West Germany.
   Since then, nearly 20,000 refugees have reached West Germany.
   Hundreds of other East Germans in Czechoslovakia and Poland have
converged on West German embassies in recent weeks, seeking asylum.
   On Saturday, Bild am Sonntag quoted unidentified diplomats as
saying that East Germany tentatively has agreed to allow its
citizens holed up inside the West German Embassy in Warsaw leave for
the West.
   In Prague, more than 100 East Germans climbed a fence to the West
Germany Embassy compound there Friday night and Saturday, bringing
to 720 the number of people in the tent encampments at the embassy.

   Flashing the thumbs-up sign, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze today moved through the final rounds of talks to put
the finishing touches on a series of arms control agreements.
   The most significant step was the Soviets' dropping their
insistence that curbs on the U.S. Star Wars missile defense be
completed before a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   That appeared to break an impasse over talks to slash long-range
nuclear weapons arsenals, said a senior U.S. official.
   A senior official traveling with President Bush in Boston, said
Baker and Shevardnadze are expected to announce that a summit will
be held within the first six months of 1990, mostly likely in the
spring.
   The two both flashed the thumbs-up sign as they strolled briefly
through the woods before resuming their discussions.
   ``We are working very hard,'' Baker said.
   The announcement that the Soviets had dropped a major demand came
Friday night as Baker and Shevardnadze also neared agreement on an
accord to open each other's underground nuclear tests to on-site
inspection.
   The foreign ministers began their final talks at a Rocky Mountain
lodge today, with expectations high that they would set a target
date for a summit between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The foreign secretaries also made progress toward several other
arms control agreements they were expected to sign before heading to
New York on Sunday for a United Nations meeting.
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition that he not be
further identified, said the Soviet agreement to separate
negotiations on the Star Wars missile defense system and START talks
breaks a four-year deadlock on the issue.
   ``Minister Shevardnadze said they had dropped their linkage
between completing and implementing in START and achieving a defense
in space accord,'' said the official.
   The U.S. official stressed ``the need to clarify'' the Soviet
position, but said, ``this looks like a positive development.''
   Many lesser points of disagreement remain in the proposed
450-page START agreement, but resolution of the space defense issue
could accelerate the START pact, the official said.
   Until now, said the official, ``the Soviets have said they would
not want to enter into a START agreement until there was an
understanding on defense in space.''
   A Soviet spokesman, Boris Malakhov, said there would be no
immediate Soviet response to the American comments.
   The agreement on on-site inspections would clear the way for
Senate ratification of two U.S.-Soviet treaties that were signed in
1974 and 1976. The pacts have been observed by both sides, but they
have never agreed on how to monitor them.
   Details on the agreements were left to be resolved after Friday's
session, said a second senior U.S. official.
   The other issues that were ready or near completion were:
   _A protocol on determining the size of superpower chemical
weapons stockpiles, to assist completion of a multilateral
convention to stop production of such substances.
   _An umbrella agreement covering verification of means of counting
weapons to be eliminated under START.
   _A pact under which the two sides would give each other prior
notification of strategic exercises involving weapons which in
wartime would threaten the other.
   _A statement to expand the superpower human rights dialogue from
emigration issues to cover revisions in the Soviet criminal code,
occupational health and the environment.
   _A pact to lift the so-called ``Ice Curtain'' that since 1948 has
prevented Alaskan Eskimos from visiting their distant relations in
Soviet Siberia.
   Despite the friendly atmosphere, the two sides remained divided
over the major negotiation before them, START.
   Shevardnadze presented the Americans with what one Soviet
official called ``exhilarating'' proposals to clear a main obstacle
to START, an agreement on adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. That pact curbs development of space-based defenses
such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars plan is
formally known.
   The proposals dealt with space tests of potential weapons, but
American negotiators said they did not mark a sharp departure from
previous Soviet ideas.
   A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said most of the Baker-Shevardnadze session was devoted
to U.S. complaints that the Soviets were boosting military shipments
to allies involved in wars in Central America, Asia and Africa.
   Asked whether Shevardnadze promised to curtail the arms flow, the
official said, ``Each side has a more complete understanding of some
of the other's concerns.''
   Disagreement over regional conflicts, however, likely would be
overshadowed by the five agreements.
   Under the protocol on testing-site inspections, Soviet inspectors
would monitor the Nevada test site and U.S. inspectors would observe
tests in Soviet Kazakhstan.
   U.S. inspectors using a system known as CORRTEX would be notified
in advance of a test explosion at the Soviets' Semipalatinsk site.
   They would drop a cable into a nearby four-foot-wide hole. The
force of the explosion would be measured by the speed at which the
cable was smashed.
   Under the 1974 and 1976 treaties, U.S. and Soviet underground
nuclear blasts _ the only kind not outlawed _ are limited to 150
kilotons.

   Irving Berlin's death at age 101 marked the end
of an era in American music, but his legacy lives on in his music,
friends and admirers said Saturday.
   ``Just knowing he was there'' was an inspiration, said John
Wallowitch, a composer and cabaret performer who had organized
Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan town house for
more than 20 years.
   Upon hearing of Berlin's death, Wallowitch said, he and three
friends went to the reclusive songwriter's home.
   ``We just stood there and cried a lot and sang, `I'll be loving
you, always,''' he said. He said he planned to organize a larger,
candlelight vigil for Sunday night.
   Berlin, who wrote ``Always,'' ``God Bless America,'' ``White
Christmas,'' and more than 1,000 other songs in his long career,
died in his sleep at his home about 5:30 p.m. Friday.
   A spokesman said the funeral would be private, but plans for a
memorial service would be announced.
   Broadway theaters planned to dim their lights Saturday night in
honor of the man who wrote the scores for 19 shows, including
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam.''
   The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of
which Berlin was a charter member, planned to take out a full-page
testimonial in Monday's New York Times, said former president
Stanley Adams. ASCAP, which organized an all-star Carnegie Hall
salute to Berlin for his 100th birthday last year, also planned a
memorial.
   ``I think he's the greatest songwriter the world has ever had,''
Adams said.
   Composer-conductor Morton Gould, the president of ASCAP, said
Berlin's music has become ``part of our language, part of our
heartbeat, part of our soul.''
   In Boston, President Bush joined a crowd of thousands Saturday to
sing ``God Bless America.'' Bush was speaking at a luncheon of Roman
Catholic lawyers.
   Later, he said in a statement: ``Very few people have come to
touch and move the soul of a nation, reflecting its spirit and
traditions. Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a
legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of
our nation.''
   Former President Reagan, who as an actor was featured along with
Berlin's songs in the flag-waving 1943 movie musical ``This is the
Army,'' said in a statement: ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by
the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius
delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers said working with Berlin and her
longtime partner Fred Astaire in ``Top Hat,'' was ``like heaven,''
referring to the lyrics of Berlin's Oscar-nominated ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' which was featured in the classic 1935 film.
   Jack Horvath, a salesman at Carl Fischer Music in Manhattan, said
Berlin sheet music is still in demand. The nearly 50-year-old
``White Christmas'' is the store's No. 1 seller during the holidays,
he said.
   ``I personally went up to his office last Christmas and picked up
500 copies because it had gone so fast,'' Horvath said.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' said opera singer Robert
Merrill. ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter.
He was not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a
feeling for melody and words that was precious.''
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone.''

   Syrian and Christian forces clashed with
mortars and machine guns in the hills overlooking Beirut Saturday,
shattering a truce that had brought thousands of hopeful refugees
flooding back to their ravaged city.
   Police reported three people were wounded in the Christian
enclave north of Beirut when mortar rounds exploded in residential
neighborhoods.
   Officials said the clashes appeared to be limited. But residents
who have seen several cease-fires collapse were anxious.
   A newly formed committee made up of officials from the various
factions met at a horse track on Beirut's dividing Green Line and
announced that shipping blockades imposed by both sides would be
lifted immediately.
   The Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, told reporters that the
group agreed ``to work immediately on consolidating a cease-fire''
and to reopen Beirut airport, the country's only public airport
which has been closed since March 12.
   But three hours later, the fighting flared. Ibrahimi told the
Christian Voice of Lebanon radio: ``These are unnecessary setbacks.
I'm getting in touch with the members of the committee to curb this
deterioration.''
   The committee's next meeting was scheduled for Sunday.
   The clashes were the first reported since 10 p.m. Friday.
Sporadic bursts of automatic weapons fire and occasional
rocket-propelled grenade explosions had been heard throughout the
day along the Green Line.
   After rejecting numerous other truce attempts by the Arab League,
both Christians and Moslems agreed last week to adhere to the latest
peace proposal.
   The committee comprises representatives from Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun's command, the rival Moslem army command of Maj.
Gen. Sami Khatib and Syria's two militia allies, the Shiite Moslem
Amal and the Druse Moslem Progressive Socialist Party.
   But the Syrians were not represented. Although their army has
been the main force fighting Aoun's troops, they claim they were not
involved and that the committee is a matter for the Lebanese only.
   All but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million population had fled the
shelling for safer areas.
   Buoyed by the glimmer of hope that peace may be at hand, tens of
thousands of people jammed the highways Saturday leading into the
city from south Lebanon, where many Moslems stayed.
   Khalil Hatab said that he, his wife and six children had lived in
one room they rented in the south Lebanonese village of Barja for
the last six months.
   ``Can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a
year?'' he said as he was caught in a traffic jam at Ouzai on
Beirut's southern outskirts.
   ``Some of the time we even had relatives, neighbors and friends
who escaped with nowhere to go.''
   At the Christian port of Jounieh, cars were bumper-to-bumper on
highways leading into the Christian heartland from the north.
   By police count, 929 people have been killed and 2,738 wounded,
nearly all of them civilians, since the bombardments began March 8,
two days after Aoun imposed a blockade on ports south of Beirut
operated by Druse and Shiite militias.
   The Syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling the
Christians' 310-square-mile homeland enclave north of Beirut and
blockading it.
   Aoun initially rejected the Arab League plan because the security
committee would not include the Syrians. But he changed his mind
Friday after pressure from Christian leaders and Arab governments.
   The Arab League plan seeks a political settlement of the civil
war in which more than 150,000 have been killed.
   It calls for the 73 surviving members of Lebanon's 99-seat
parliament to meet outside Lebanon to formulate political reforms
that would distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems.
   The predominantly Maronite Catholic Christians have dominated the
government, parliament, the judiciary and army since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   At that time they were considered the majority. Although there
has been no census since 1932, Moslems now form an estimated 55
percent of the 4 million population.
   Hardline Maronites, who are mostly pro-European, have resisted
surrendering their traditional privileges, which include the
presidency, for fear of being swamped by the Moslems.
   Aoun had gambled that Western powers, including France and the
United States, would come to his rescue when he launched his ``war
of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians.
   But that did not happen and it was a major blow when Washington
closed the U.S. Embassy in Christian east Beirut Sept. 6 after he
accused Washington of supporting the Syrians.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Tells Soviets About the Wonders of America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years in the thick of the Communist Party's
struggle to build Soviet socialism, Boris N. Yeltsin says he knows a
place where the average working man is happy and secure.
   That place, he is telling his Soviet supporters, is the United
States.
   The silver-haired populist, who has spent the last two years
irritating President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet
establishment, returned from a nine-city tour of the United States
on Monday to face two pressing controversies.
   One was resolved within days when the powerful Communist Party
daily Pravda publicly apologized for reprinting an article alleging
Yeltsin boozed and spent his way across the United States.
   The other surrounds his comments about life in America,
reminiscent of tales that have drawn immigrants to the New World for
generations.
   The comments were rosier than many Americans would venture. They
are bound to be noticed by party officials who question Yeltsin's
loyalty to Communist ideals, whether he has any firm program to cure
the Soviet Union's economic ills, and wonder whether his long-term
plan is to elbow out Gorbachev.
   ``Their supermarkets have 30,000 food items,'' Yeltsin told
20,000 supporters Friday in his first public appearance since
returning. ``You can't imagine it. It makes the people feel secure.''
   In order to understand what they're missing and therefore change
their own society, Yeltsin said, ``at least 100 million Soviets must
pass through the American school of supermarkets. The leaders must
be first.''
   The 58-year-old Siberian who came to Moscow in 1985 and was named
by Gorbachev to run the capital's party organization, also cited
U.S. bounty in the popular weekly Arguments and Facts.
   The point is obvious for Soviets struggling through shortages of
items such as cigarettes, meat, matches and soap in the fifth year
of Gorbachev's reforms. Americans, Yeltsin told his supporters,
``know how to work. They enjoy life, and they are humane. They live
very well.''
   He pointed a finger at the Soviet approach to building a
socialist society:
   ``Our decades-old slogan to `Catch up with America and leave it
behind' was of great damage to us because it exists for itself, for
the sake of prestige, not for the people.
   ``We will never catch up with them and never leave them behind
and we do not need to strive for this. We must strive for a better
life for our people.'' In both his address to the crowd in
Zelenograd, outside Moscow, and his newspaper interview, Yeltsin
noted America too has its problems, primarily unemployment. But he
glanced over them.
   Yeltsin says he supports Gorbachev's restructuring program, but
differs on tactics. He says conservatives are keeping Gorbachev from
moving faster and warns Gorbachev's program is losing steam.
   He told the crowd the Soviet Union should work for more favorable
trade agreements with the United States, invite American farmers to
till Soviet land on long-term leases and allow Americans to build 1
million apartments and sell them to whoever can afford them.
   Yeltsin's barbed criticisms have not been lost on Gorbachev, who
fired him as Moscow party chief in November 1987 after he questioned
the party's policies and pace of reform.
   Yeltsin subsequently was stripped of his candidate membership of
the ruling party Politburo, but has become something of a folk hero
for his attacks on privileges for party and government officials.
   In March, Muscovites gave him 89 percent of the vote for the
capital's seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   Yeltsin told the Zelenograd crowd he thought Pravda's publication
of the article alleging misconduct was an effort to help force him
off the Central Committee at an upcoming meeting.
   But Pravda itself acknowledged doubts about the accuracy of the
story it reprinted from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, and no
such move emerged.
   However, according to Yeltsin, his criticisms did come up.
   ``At the end of the plenum, Gorbachev says, `Yeltsin returned
from America. He talks about how good it is in America, and we all
were criticized by him, including we Central Committee members and
the Presidium which I head,''' Yeltsin told the crowd.
   ``I told him, `Right, that's the way it was,''' he added.
   The crowd applauded.

   Former Police guitarist Andy Summers
considers the band's tunes ``banal'' and ``boring'' and said he is
no longer interested in rock 'n' roll.
   ``I don't follow it. Most of it is terrible,'' he said.
   Summers begins a seven-city tour Sunday in Scottsdale to promote
his new instrumental album, ``The Golden Wire.'' The album combines
jazz, blues, rock, classical, Indian and New Age music, Summers said
Thursday.
   ``I would call it new fusion,'' he said. ``It's closer to jazz,
but more exotic with modern production sound.''
   Summers said the album's lack of lyrics reflects his new taste in
music.
   ``Most lyrics are not interesting to listen to. They say things
you've heard a million times before,'' he said. ``Instrumental music
leaves you free to imagine your own scene. It's purer.''
   The Police, including singer-bassist Sting, sold more than 40
million albums before members of the trio went their separate ways
several years ago.

   Ronald and Nancy Reagan are inviting spouses
and dependents of U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan to fly
with them to Tokyo in October, the United Service Organization
announced.
   The former president and first lady have chartered a TWA Boeing
747 jetliner for the Oct. 19 flight from Los Angeles, returning Oct.
28, USO spokesman Kevin McCarthy said Friday.
   The Reagans will be in Japan at the invitation of the Japanese
government and the Fujisankei Communications Group to attend several
charitable events and meet with the prime minister, emperor and
other government figures.
   At the Reagans' suggestion, Fujisankei will provide the jumbo
jetliner to ferry military families to Japan free of charge, said
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   ``Nancy and I promised ourselves that if we ever had a chance to
bring families together, we would,'' Reagan said in a statement.
   ``When we learned we would have so many extra seats on the
airplane being provided to us, we knew immediately what to do,'' he
said.
   Seats on the plane have been allocated to individual services
based on each branch's percentage of military population in Japan
and Okinawa, the USO said.
   Unit commanders in Japan were to explain to military personnel
how to apply for the trip, McCarthy said.
   ``It's a free round-trip to Tokyo with the (former) president if
you can get yourself to Los Angeles,'' he said, adding the USO was
exploring ways to subsidize family members' travel to Los Angeles.

   The 84-year-old Fulbright spoke to about 50 students at the
University of Arkansas, which he headed between 1939 and 1941.
   ``It is absurd for us to contemplate a war,'' he said Friday. ``I
suppose you could call me in a sense a pacifist, but I don't think a
foolish pacifist. I don't think warfare is a very productive
activity.''
   Fulbright, who served in the Senate from 1944 to 1974, proposed

<HEAD>ACLU Challenges Arkansas Abortion Notification Law in Federal Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas' law requiring notification of
parents 48 hours before a minor undergoes an abortion interferes
with a doctor's right to practice medicine and a woman's right to
the operation, a lawsuit contends.
   Among the plaintiffs is a 16-year-old girl in her 11th week of
pregnancy.
   The 1989 law also assigns jurisdiction for granting exceptions to
the law to Arkansas' probate courts, which under state law have no
jurisdiction over minors, the American Civil Liberties Union alleged
in the suit filed Friday in federal court.
   The lawsuit seeks to declare the law unconstitutional, and asks
for an immediate injunction against enforcing the law. However, no
hearing date has been scheduled.
   The law was passed last spring, before the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling on July 3 that gave states more leeway on restricting
abortions through such things as banning them at public hospitals.
The high court is due to consider the constitutionality other types
of abortion restrictions in the coming term, which begins next month.
   Attorney Stephen Engstrom of Little Rock, who filed the suit
along with attorney N.M. ``Mac'' Norton of Little Rock, said he
asked Attorney General Steve Clark on Friday to allow an abortion
for the 16-year-old, identified only as Sally X.
   ``He refused. He told us to take our best shot. I think that was
insensitive,'' Engstrom said.
   The suit, filed later Friday, names Clark and the state as
defendants.
   ``I'm ready to defend this law; I believe it's constitutional,''
Clark said, adding that he did not believe the plaintiffs had tried
to use all legal procedures outlined in the law.
   Cooperating in the lawsuit is Planned Parenthood of Greater
Arkansas, which offers abortion counseling. Another plaintiff is Dr.
Curtis Stover of Little Rock, who performs abortions.
   ``Parental notice is unjustified because it increases the medical
risk to the teen-ager,'' said Nancy Libbe, a Planned Parenthood
spokeswoman.
   The lawsuit contends that the law places an undue burden on the
teen-ager's right to an abortion, and an excessive burden on either
the teen-ager or the doctor in locating both parents. There is an
exception if the whereabouts of one of the parents is unknown.
   In addition, the law is so vague that a physician could be
subject to criminal penalties, yet cannot understand what the law
requires of him, the lawsuit said.

   Iran and two pro-Iranian terrorist groups
threatened Saturday to punish Saudi Arabia's ``pagan regime'' for
beheading 16 Shiite Moslems accused of bombing Mecca during a
pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrine.
   Iran rejected Saudi allegations that the Iranian Embassy in
Kuwait trained and equipped the 16 Kuwaitis to carry out the
bombings in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
   Tehran Radio quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, Iran's spiritual
leader, as saying the consequences of the executions Thursday ``will
plague'' the Saudis.
   He branded the beheadings ``another crime at the hands of the
rulers of Saudi Arabia ... These dear martyrs were killed for the
crime of supporting the Islamic republic and their love'' for Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.
   The radio quoted Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying:
``The Saudi government, with baseless allegations, is striving to
create divisions within the Kuwaiti nation. This is against the
interests of Saudi Arabia.''
   The executions of the Shiite Moslems, members of Iran's dominant
religion, appeared to scuttle recent moves aimed at restoring
relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, where Sunni Moslems
predominate.
   The two branches of Islam have feuded for centuries.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also vowed in a
statement published in Beirut to avenge the execution of the
Kuwaitis.
   Hezollah, the umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostages
in Lebanon, said the executions were ``a terrorist act and an
organized crime.
   ``The deep grudge that rules the actions of the pagan regime ...
will be a motive for avenging the blood of the oppressed.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, said a similar threat was made by a group calling itself
the Organization of the Islamic Revolution in the Arab Peninsula.
   In June, the group claimed responsibility for the slaying of an
Egyptian driver working for the Saudi Embassy in Brussels, Belgium.
Several Saudi diplomats have also been killed in recent months
around the world.
   IRNA quoted a statement by the group saying the executions ``will
further speed up retaliatory moves by Moslems and strengthen their
determination to eradicate this unholy root from the most sacred
land on earth.''
   IRNA also quoted an unidentified Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying that recorded confessions of the convicted
Kuwaitis broadcast by Saudi television were ``false allegations
disseminated by the Saudi government.
   In their confessions, the Kuwaitis said they had received
sabotage training from Iranians in a remote area of Kuwait. They
also said two Iranians at the embassy in Kuwait provided them with
explosives and timing devices.
   The spokesman blamed the attacks on ``mercenaries working for
Saudi Arabia ... to suppress Moslems who reject Saudi control of the
holy shrines.''
   ``With the execution of a number of oppressed Kuwaiti Moslems the
Saudi regime has further exposed its anti-Islamic nature,'' the
spokesman said. He urged the world's Moslems ``to break their
silence over these atrocities.''
   Otherwise, he said, ``The Islamic world will continue to witness
torture and bloodshed at the hands of the Saudi rulers during the
hajj,'' the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca.
   On July 10, two bombs exploded in Mecca, birthplace of Mohammed,
Islam's founder, killing a Pakistani man and wounding 16 other
pilgrims.
   Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were severly strained in
July 1987 when more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims,
were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca during
the pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April
1988, citing subversion and terrorism.
   The Saudis imposed a limit on the number of pilgrims in 1988 in
an effort to improve security. Iran boycotted the pilgrimage because
its quota was cut from the usual 150,000 to less than 50,000.

   A strong earthquake that slammed southwest China's
Sichuan province injured 54 people and destroyed 4,269 houses, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Saturday.
   The report said the Friday morning quake also killed 300 animals.
No human fatalities were reported.
   Human casualties were relatively light because the quake hit when
most people were working in the fields and not inside homes that
collapsed, it said.
   Eight of the victims were seriously injured, it said.
   Xinhua said the quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, and
rocked a 24-square-mile area in central Sichuan's Xiaojin County.
   On Friday, Xinhua put the strength of the quake at 6.6. The
Richter scale measures energy released by an earthquake in relation
to ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one
digit indicates a 10-fold increase in severity.
   Five earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.7 on the Richter
scale, struck western Sichuan in a three-week period in June and
July, killing 11 people.

   On Folly Beach, a house sat in the road;
in some places, houses had disappeared. And on Sullivan's Island and
the Isle of Palms, Hurricane Hugo had damaged virtually every
building, an aerial tour showed Saturday.
   Hugo tore a wide path along the South Carolina coast, but areas
less than 20 miles from some of the worst-hit areas appeared
unscathed. About 680,000 people live along South Carolina's 220
miles of coast.
   Over Hilton Head Island and, about 150 miles to the south, over
the islands of St. Helena, Fripp and Paris, there were few telltale
signs of Friday's storm aside from boarded-up houses and trees on
the ground.
   Edisto Island, just south of Charleston, suffered serious erosion
when water rushed over the road and under most seaward houses, many
of which rest on supports. No homes were leveled, however.
   But heading north, a band of devastation stretched for 90 miles
from Folly Beach, five miles southeast of Charleston, to Garden City.
   As many as 30 percent of the homes on Folly Beach had either
disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared that all the
others had suffered some damage from the rains and wind above 100
mph. One house had been tossed onto a road.
   From the air above James Island, a Charleston suburb that lies on
the inland side of Folly Beach, most of the roads and homes could be
seen in areas that once were hidden by thick woods. But the damage
to buildings was less than on Folly Beach.
   Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms bore the brunt of Hugo's
fury, and every structure on both islands appeared damaged.
   Many houses were buckled and had their supports ripped away, and
sometimes nothing was left but a roof or pilings in the sand.
Several houses were in roads, roofs were peeled off, and trees were
uprooted.
   The Ben Sawyer Bridge, the swing bridge that links the two
islands to the mainland, was twisted and tilted so that one end
dipped 35 feet down to the Intracoastal Waterway.
   At the Wild Dunes marina on the Isle of Palms, about 40 boats
were blown across the shore and heaped into a pile. At Folly Beach,
other boats were stacked up between a bridge and condominium project.
   Just to the north, homes in the Bull's Island area also were
heavily damaged, and a marina in Winyah Bay near Georgetown had
disappeared.
   Massive oceanfront homes in the wealthy residential community of
Debidue Beach fell from their pilings to the surf, and wind had
ripped off the fronts of houses, exposing rooms. More than
three-quarters of the homes were damaged.
   On Pawley's Island, south of Myrtle Beach, at least three homes
were across or in the creek that separates the island from the
mainland. Some had been moved more than 100 yards. A channel of
water approximately 20 feet wide had sliced the island in two.
   Roads in Pawley's Island and Garden City were covered with sand
as far as three blocks from the beach.
   Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach suffered severe erosion that
exposed brown soil beneath the beach sand, but wind damage was
minor. And an amusement park roller coaster appeared intact.

<BYLINE>Eds: INSERTS one graf after 8th pvs, ``The post ...'' to UPDATE
with Drawicz to meet Urban, start new duties Monday; picks up 9th, ``The
power ...'' ^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Solidarity journalist was named Saturday
to run Poland's state-owned television and radio, removing Communist
Party control of the powerful broadcast media for the first time
since World War II.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki chose Andrzej Drawicz, 57, a
specialist in Soviet affairs and a former political prsoner.
   The choice to head radio and television was the major remaining
question mark in Mazowiecki's government. The post will not retain
its Cabinet rank, reflecting the new government's view that there
should be nothing like an ``information minister'' trying to shape
public opinion.
   ``TV is the mass medium that lied the most,'' said Krzysztof
Kozlowski, a Solidarity senator who negotiated media reform with the
Communists during their historic negotiations earlier this year.
   Gaining control of the electronic media was a non-negotiable
point for Solidarity during talks to form the East bloc's first
government not led by Communists.
   ``The government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of
speech for all sections of public opinion,'' Mazowiecki told
parliament Sept. 12.
   ``The right of access to radio and televison must be equal to
all,'' he said. ``Gone are the times of limiting the freedom of
Polish journalists.''
   The post was held since April 17 _ the same day legal status was
restored to Solidarity after a seven-year ban _ by Jerzy Urban, who
as government spokesman aggressively dueled with Solidarity when it
was in opposition.
   Drawicz will meet with Urban on Sunday and begin his new duties
Monday, his wife, Vera, said in a telephone interview. She said
Drawicz was outside the city and could not be reached for comment.
   The power of the mass media has been carefully guarded by the
Communists since they came to power in the late 1940s.
   Poles eager for even a glimpse of the outside world are hooked on
television. Nonetheless, they have railed against what was shown _
riots and mayhem in the United States, for example _ and what
wasn't: Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, for seven years after the
1981 martial-law crackdown.
   After martial law was imposed, journalists were required to go
through a ``verification'' of their loyalty to Communist
authorities. Many were forced out.
   At the talks that led to restoration of Solidarity's legal
status, Kozlowski said, union negotiators concluded that ``for
Communists the world created by television, the artificial world, is
more important than the real world.''
   Drawicz, who was jailed along with thousands of others after
martial law, has no significant experience in television. But he is
a respected journalist known for his admiration of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.
   There has been considerable debate over the new structure of
state television. The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza has
been running a back-page forum under the headline, ``What kind of
television?''
   Some have suggested that the Communist Party be given 45 minutes
a week on TV _ just what Solidarty got when it won limited access to
the airwaves in April.
   Control of broadcasting likely will be transferred from the
Cabinet to parliament under the committee headed by Drawicz and
including deputy chairmen from its allied parties and the Communists.
   The committee will be run publicly, Kozlowski said, unlike the
past when the names of all members but the chairman were kept secret.
   Viewers say news reports have become more even-handed in recent
months, and one satirical program even poked fun at communsit
President Wojciech Jaruzelski _ something that would have been
unthinkable a year ago.

<HEAD>Judges Declares Sentencing Law Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has struck down a portion of
federal sentencing law as unconstitutional, saying Congress gave
prosecutors too much _ and judges too little _ authority to decide
prison sentences.
   U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm acted in a case involving a
woman who cooperated with the government and gave key testimony in a
drug case. The prosecution did not recommend a reduced sentence for
this cooperation and the 1987 law gave the judge no option but to
impose the full sentence.
   Since Congress granted only federal prosecutors the power to
request a sentence reduction, Mihm said Thursday, the executive
branch of government has more authority in sentencing than the
judiciary and that imbalance must be corrected.
   The sentencing guidelines were enacted to ensure uniform
sentencing among judges nationwide so that all criminals are treated
fairly no matter what part of the country they are in.
   U.S. Attorney William Roberts said the decision is still being
reviewed, and no decision has been made on an appeal to the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   ``It's been a very strong tool for effecting cooperation,''
Roberts said. ``It's certainly my sense that that's exactly the way
Congress intended it to be used.''
   Mihm said Congress violated the separation of power doctrine.
   If the government lets the decision stand, it will apply only in
Mihm's courtroom unless other judges around the country follow his
lead. If the government appeals and loses again, Mihm's ruling would
be the law in the entire 7th Circuit, which includes all of
Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.
   Mihm acted at the request of attorney Richard Parsons, who was
representing a woman sentenced to four years in prison after being
convicted of cocaine conspiracy charges.
   Parsons argued his client, Kim Curran, 26, should get a reduced
sentence based on her cooperation in convicting two other drug
dealers.
   ``This `girl' helped the government a great deal, at a great
personal risk, and her cooperation resulted in the conviction of a
drug kingpin in central Illinois,'' Parsons said. ``But Congress
said the judge can't consider that in sentencing unless the
prosecution agrees. That power should be equally shared by the
prosecution and the judiciary.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Tate Chambers said he was unable to
recommend a reduced sentence because Ms. Curran had not gone under
cover to help convict Charles ``Blackie'' Spears or Donald Meeks on
drug dealing charges, as required by regional policy.
   FBI agent Robert Norton told the court Ms. Curran probably placed
herself and her family in jeopardy by cooperating completely with
the prosecution.
   ``There's no question that (Curran's testimony) was a significant
factor in the Donald Meeks trial,'' Mihm said, adding that the
17-year prison term given to Spears ``would have been considerably
less'' without her cooperation.
   He said those facts should have been considered by the
prosecutors and warranted a reduced sentence.

<HEAD>Hospital Records Depict Wesbecker As Beset By Mental Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pressman who killed eight former
co-workers in a printing plant before shooting himself felt
worthless and isolated, attempted suicide before and mentioned
hurting other people, hospital records show.
   ``Here we are dealing with a man who had a long history of
chronic mental illness and chronic mental depression,'' said Dr.
Richard Greathouse, Jefferson County coroner.
   Joseph Wesbecker was ``oftentimes tortured, oftentimes seeking
help from various psychiatrists and doctors wherever he could find
it, but never really finding any peace with his treatment or any of
his psychiatric therapies.
   ``This man was tortured by what he felt,'' Greathouse said Friday.
   The records show that Wesbecker, 47, fought mental illness and
depression for the past 11 years. He was beset by racing thoughts,
sleeplessness, tremors, blurred vision, confusion, anxiety,
headaches, dizziness and anger, according to the records.
   On Sept. 14, Wesbecker fatally wounded eight people at Standard
Gravure Corp. and injured 12 with an AK-47 assault rifle before
killing himself with a pistol. Nine people remained hospitalized
Saturday.
   The records show that Wesbecker had difficulty concentrating and
once couldn't recall his own address. He felt isolated from others,
and he sometimes felt worthless.
   Wesbecker told psychiatrists he had thoughts of taking his own
life and had acted on those thoughts 12 to 15 times. He took pills,
clogged his car's exhaust pipe and tried to hang himself.
   Wesbecker, who was placed on long-term mental disability in
February, also had occasional thoughts of hurting other people, the
records indicate. He had mentioned his wife's ex-husband and his
foreman at Standard Gravure as possible targets.
   Greathouse is trying along with police to reconstruct Wesbecker's
life and illness. Under court order, Our Lady of Peace Hospital
turned over the records Friday to Greathouse, who released a summary
of the material.
   Greathouse said that:
   _Wesbecker was voluntarily admitted to hospitals at least three
times for psychiatric treatment between 1978 and 1987.
   _The hospital records reflect a man who withdrew from other
people and had difficulty with on-the-job stress, once declining a
promotion and a $4-an-hour raise because he found the job ``too
stressful and demanding.''
   _Wesbecker complained that exposure to toluene in his 17 years at
the company caused memory loss, dizziness and ``blackout spells.''
   Greathouse said the records suggested that Wesbecker posed a
threat to himself and others.
   ``I think they knew this man was quite ill mentally but were
still hopefully wishing their treatment might work,'' he said.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Declares Itself Sovereign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Azerbaijan on Saturday became the latest Soviet
republic to declare itself ``sovereign,'' meaning decrees from
Moscow don't have to be obeyed if they conflict with local law,
local journalists reported.
   The vote by the Supreme Soviet parliament in the mostly Moslem
republic in the Caucasus also indirectly reasserts Azerbaijan's
right to rule Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Christian and
Armenian enclave that has belonged to Azerbaijan since the 1920s.
   Moscow put Nagorno-Karabakh under its direct administration in
February because of ethnic violence that has now lasted for 19
months. But the Azerbaijan parliament earlier this month rejected
that step as an infringement on its right to govern territory
granted it by the Soviet Constitution.
   The law on sovereignty approved Saturday by the republic's
Supreme Soviet establishes the ``integrity, indivisibility and
inviolability'' of Azerbaijan's territory, said Arif Aliev, an
independent journalist. He spoke by telephone from Baku, the
republic's capital.
   Azerbaijan also was declared ``independent'' in all matters
except those it delegates voluntarily to national authorities in
Moscow, Aliev said.
   The parliament reportedly rejected as illegal an assembly of
ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh who in August again voted to
secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia.
   Estonia on the Baltic Sea was the first of the 15 Soviet
republics to challenge Moscow's rule by declaring the republic
``sovereign'' last November. The Kremlin leadership immediately
rejected the move as unconstitutional, but government and Communist
Party policy have since been altered to give more powers to the
republics.
   Since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985,
ethnic regions throughout their nation have increasingly asserted
their independence and embraced their nationalist heritage,
outgrowths of Gorbachev's more open society.

   OPEC ministers met Saturday to try to close ranks
and agree on whether they can boost their crude production without
upsetting the oil market.
   The officials of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries held their first round of talks in a luxury
hotel in this picturesque Swiss city.
   They met for nearly three hours behind closed doors to thrash out
a range of issues, including a long-term strategy and plans for
marking their 30th anniversary in 1990.
   But they decided to huddle privately before returning late Sunday
afternoon to take a look at the world oil market and decide a course
of action for the last three months of the year.
   The ministers are divided over whether the cartel should raise
its output by 500,000 barrels a day or so in the October-December
period.
   Some worried a pickup in output would hurt oil prices and their
countries' needed revenues from crude sales.
   The cartel's secretary-general, Subroto, said the ministers had
eight items on their agenda, ranging from plotting a long-term
strategy to marking the organization's 30th anniversary in 1990.
   But the most heated discussions will no doubt center on the
question of whether the cartel should raise its output by 500,000
barrels a day or so in the last three months of the year.
   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the cartel already is
producing well over its production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a
day for the last half of the year.
   Without reining in the overproducers, analysts say, prices could
slip a bit with increased supply. Gasoline prices at the pump would
likely be little affected, though.
   Even before the talks began, the ministers were divided over
their next step.
   One side appeared to feel the market was steady enough and
consumer demand strong enough to absorb an increase.
   Mana Saeed Otaiba, petroleum minister for the United Arab
Emirates, said that ``there are some indications'' the market could
absorb an increase.
   A final decision, he said, ``depends on the market.''
   ``If the market is allowing that, we will do it. If not ... we
will not increase the ceiling,'' he told reporters before the start
of the evening meeting.
   The other set of ministers clearly wanted the cartel to
concentrate on getting prices up to the its target of $18 a barrel.
They feared higher production would weaken prices.
   ``We hope that everybody will come down ... with what he is
producing so we can get to 18,'' said Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi
Shakshuki.
   Nigeria's oil chief, Rilwanu Lukman, who is also president of the
cartel, said the price of oil ``could do a little bit more.''
   ``We would like it to be 18,'' he told reporters after his
mid-day arrival in Geneva.
   In June, the cartel set its target price at $18 a 42-gallon
barrel for the June-December period.
   A benchmark of seven crudes monitored by OPEC recently averaged
$17.04 a barrel. It was more than $18 last spring.
   West Texas Intermediate, the key American brand, has been trading
in the range of $19.50 to $20 a barrel.

<HEAD>Quayle Calls for Return of Soviet-Occupied Islands</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The following was compiled from a wire service pool report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on Saturday called for
Moscow to return several islands claimed by Japan but occupied by
the Soviets since the end of World War II.
   He also warned Japan's leading opposition party, the Socialists,
that their desire to modify a mutual security treaty with the United
States is wrong.
   The Socialists, helped by scandals and a controversial tax reform
that have eroded support for the long-governing conservatives,
currently are riding a wave of popularity in Japan.
   ``Anybody that thinks you ought to tamper or rewrite or modify
the security treaty is wrong,'' Quayle told reporters traveling with
him on Air Force II. ``It is not just a mere piece of paper. It is
an alliance, security, deterrence.''
   More than 50,000 U.S. troopers are stationed throughout Japan
under the treaty the Socialists want modified.
   The Socialists also have urged strict checks to ensure U.S. Navy
vessels calling on Japanese ports do not have nuclear weapons on
board _ a call in conflict with Washington's policy of refusing to
say whether or not its ships carry nuclear arms.
   During a visit to Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido,
Quayle said America shares Japan's ``heartfelt desire'' for a return
of several small islands off Hokkaido's northern shores, which Japan
calls its ``northern territories.''
   ``We hope the idea of glasnost and perestroika will someday come
to the northern territories and that they will be rightfully
returned to Japan,'' Quayle said in a speech at the official
residence of Hokkaido's Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi.
   Soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of World
War II in 1945, and Japanese civilians were evacuated.
   The territorial dispute has stalled completion of a treaty
formally ending the war and a visit to Japan by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev's reforms are based on his policies of glasnost, or
openness, and perestroika, the restructing of the government and
economy.
   Quayle traveled to the Japanese Air Self Defense Force base at
Chitose, where he was briefed on Soviet military strength in the
area.
   Col. Minoru Hoso, flight group commander of the Second Air Wing,
told Quayle the Soviets have stationed one army division, or about
10,000 troops, in the disputed islands. He said they also have
400,000 troops in the region, along with 800 ships and 2,400
aircraft.
   Quayle later visited the American Misawa Air Base, on the
northern tip of Honshu, Japan's main island, where he spoke to about
1,000 military personnel and their families before returning to
Tokyo in the evening.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and the U.S. ambassador
to Japan, Michael Armacost, and his wife.
   Quayle arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from South Korea on the
second leg of an Asia tour that will take him to the Philippines and
Malaysia.

<HEAD>Judge Bars City from Enforcing Pit Bull Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge barred the city from enforcing its strict
regulations of pit bull dogs, including a ban on all new pit bulls
after Oct. 1.
   In a ruling released Friday, State Supreme Court Justice Leland
DeGrasse called the Board of Health regulations irrational and
vague, saying the agency had not shown pit bull terriers were more
dangerous than other breeds.
   ``Vicious dog laws are already in place and can be enforced,'' he
said.
   City Council member Carolyn Maloney called DeGrasse's ruling ``a
resounding victory for dog owners and citizens concerned with sane
dog safety laws.'' She had opposed the regulations and submitted her
own legislation.
   The board, which enacted rules at Mayor Edward I. Koch's request,
called the pit bull ``a unique public health problem'' and cited the
dog's ``unusual savagery.''
   The American Kennel Club sued to challenge the rules, which
required the dogs to be neutered, tatooed with a registration number
and leashed and muzzled or confined at all times.
   The city argued that while pit bulls were 2 percent of the city's
dog population, they inflicted 14 percent of the bites over a
10-month period beginning November 1987.
   The name pit bull is used for several breeds, including the
Staffordshire bull terrier, the American Staffordshire terrier, the
American pit bull terrier and sometimes the bull terrier. Bred over
the centuries for dog fighting, they have powerful chest, neck and
jaw muscles.

   Smoke and ash billowed from Mount Etna on
Saturday but officials said there was no immediate danger from the
volcano to any nearby towns.
   The Italian news agency AGI said Europe's most active volcano
spilled lava from its southeast crater Friday night, but that the
flow came to a halt in a desert-like valley on Etna's slopes 8,700
feet above sea level.
   The mountain continued to rumble Saturday morning and coughed up
glowing material. Seismographs at the international vulcanology
institute in Catania reported tremors caused by magma movements
within the mountain.
   Although the volcano currently poses no danger to surrounding
areas, flights to and from Catania have been rerouted around Etna
because of recent volcano activity, and tourists have been forbidden
to enter those slopes deemed to be at risk.
   Meanwhile, natives and tourists alike enjoyed the fireworks
offered by one of Sicily's major tourist attractions.

   Two rare books printed or written by Benjamin
Franklin and worth up to $60,000 were stolen from the University of
Pennsylvania library, police said Saturday.
   The first book, ``A Sermon on Education,'' was written by Richard
Peters and printed by Franklin in 1751. It is valued at $10,000. The
book includes a pamphlet by Franklin titled, ``An Idea of an English
School.''
   Franklin wrote the second book, ``A Log of Books to be Sold,'' in
1744. It is valued at $25,000 to $50,000.
   The books are part of a collection that is open for perusal in a
library reading room, but not available for checking out. A man
duped a library worker when he signed for the two books and five
others Aug. 16. He returned seven books, but the Franklin books were
not included.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents are outraged after learning
that the owner of their children's private school, arrested for
possessing child pornography, was once convicted of child molesting.
   ``It just sickens you to think that your child is in that type of
environment,'' added the mother of a 5-year-old girl who attended
the Fast Track fo Learning school in Daytona Beach.
   Parents were surprised the state does so little to monitor
private schools.
   ``If all this has happened before, why is that school there?''
asked a woman whose 6-year-old has attended Bowen's school for the
past two years. ``Why should we have to check this out? Why was it
allowed to open?''
   Parents, speaking on condition of anonymity, talked about the
school and its owner-teacher in stories published Saturday by The
Daytona Beach News-Journal and The Orlando Sentinel.
   The school's 18 students ranged from kindergarten to the fifth
grade.
   James N. and Lulu T. Bowen were arrested Thursday after
authorities searched their South Daytona home and found ``numerous
photographic items of child pornography,'' according to court
documents. Bowen, 51, and his 56-year-old wife were each charged
with 84 counts of possessing child pornography.
   Bowen was being held in lieu of $420,000 bail. Mrs. Bowen's bail
was set at $252,000.
   State Attorney John Tanner is asking parents of Fast Track
students to contact his office to determine if any of their children
are pictured in the approximately 100 photographs.
   The Bowens previously operated a day-care center in South
Daytona, but in 1984, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services refused to renew the center's license because Bowen worked
there. The state claimed the couple lied on the license application
by not including his conviction. Anyone convicted of a felony cannot
work in a day-care center, according to a 1984 Florida law.
   They opened the Fast Track school in 1986.
   In 1966, Bowen had pleaded guilty to fondling a minor at a public
school in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich. He paid a $250 fine and served
five years of probation.
   Police obtained a search warrant for the Bowens' home after a
woman reported seeing child pornography there when she went to pick
up her 7-year-old son after class.
   Because Fast Track was a private school, and not a public
day-care center, it was basically exempt from strenuous state
supervision, said Frederick J. Simpson, district counsel for the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   ``The problem with schools is just that they have to register
with the Department of Education, which does no investigation,'' he
said. ``There's just no regulation of private schools at all.''
   The only requirement of non-public schools in Florida is that
they comply with compulsory-attendance laws, retain student records
and meet building codes, officials said.
   In court documents, prosecutors say they are investigating the
possibility of ``assaults upon children'' by Bowen. But they
declined to elaborate on the evidence, including whether current
students have been identified in the photos or if any molestation
has been alleged.
   Parents said Bowen was the school's primary teacher, although
Mrs. Bowen occasionally helped out. Mrs. Bowen also has been working
at the City Island Library in Daytona Beach, planning exhibits and
running puppet shows for children.

   Charleston gingerly moved to recover from
the fury of Hurricane Hugo on Saturday, with residents taking stock
of destroyed homes, boats and businesses and damage estimates
topping $3 billion.
   The storm wore itself out over Canada's St. Lawrence Valley after
progressively weakening through Virginia, West Virginia, western
Pennsylvania and western New York state.
   Hugo, which left at least 27 people dead in the Caribbean, was
blamed for an additional 21 deaths in the Carolinas, Virginia and
New York.
   In Charleston, the hardest-hit city on the mainland, many
residents remained without electricity or telephone service
Saturday. Long lines formed at the few service stations that had
generators to pump gas.
   National Guard troops remained on the streets to protect homes
and businesses from looting. They will remain, Gov. Carroll Campbell
said, ``just as long as we need to to maintain the safety for
people.''
   Running water was restored to most places, although residents
were warned to boil it before drinking it, and mail service could
resume Monday, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said at a news conference.
Banks of pay telephones were to be set up in city parks.
   South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas hoped to have power restored to
hospitals, which had been operating on generators, by late Saturday,
Riley said. But utility officials had no idea when residential power
would be restored.
   As many as a half-million people were without power statewide,
and ice for coolers was scarce to non-existent in the state capital
of Columbia.
   ``If you're a camper, you're going to be in good shape,'' said
John E. Bourne Jr., mayor of North Charleston, in a wry observation
about the primitive conditions.
   Riley said damage in Charleston alone might reach $1 billion, but
accurate assessments of the damage from the region's most
devastating storm in 30 years would take days, at the least.
   Two billion dollars is a conservative estimate of damage to
buildings and other structures associated with the tourism industry,
said Robert G. Liming, state tourism director.
   ``Our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a little
rugged'' for a while, he said.
   ``I have never in my life seen anything like it,'' Campbell said
after flying over the state for a second day Saturday. ``It's beyond
your worst nightmare. It's devastating.''
   He estimated that 65 percent of the buildings were destroyed
along the coastline from Folly Beach, just south of Charleston, to
the North Carolina border.
   Sheila and Robert Pringle returned to their home in Mount
Pleasant, across the Cooper River from Charleston, to find half of
it gone. A neighbor had a swimming pool filled with mud, Mrs.
Pringle said.
   ``There's no water, there's no fences left, and there's marsh
grass everywhere. There's nothing called landscaping anymore. And
there's six feet of water in our basement,'' she said.
   ``The marsh animals are dead everywhere,'' she added. ``In fact,
Robert says one's hanging up on our garage door opener.''
   At least 14 people died in South Carolina, authorities said. Four
more died in North Carolina, two in Virginia and one in New York
state when the storm churned north.
   In the storm's aftermath, three waterspouts _ tornadoes spawned
over water _ moved ashore along the Outer Banks of North Carolina on
Saturday, damaging several homes and cars. No one was injured.
   Hugo, which first struck land at the Caribbean island of
Guadaloupe on Monday, traveled 2,500 miles before slamming into
Charleston late Thursday with winds of 135 mph. As it made its way
inland, it was downgraded to a tropical storm and lost that
designation when its winds dropped below 40 mph around Pittsburgh
late Friday.
   By Saturday morning, the remnants of Hugo had been absorbed by a
stronger weather front in eastern Canada, National Weather Service
meteorologist Joe Harrison said in New York.
   ``We really can't find it anymore,'' he said.
   Dave Langston, assistant director of Eastern Relief Operations
for the American Red Cross, said the Hugo relief effort in the
Caribbean and on the mainland will cost the Red Cross $38 million,
the largest storm-relief operation ever mounted by the agency.
   ``We estimate that more than 73,000 people have received
assistance to date, and this is just the beginning'' Langston said.

   Flight data recovered from the wreckage of a French
airliner confirmed Saturday that explosives caused the crash that
killed 171 people over an African desert, the government said.
   Information obtained from the plane's black boxes ``showed that
the flight proceded in a normal manner until a total interruption,
which translates as an explosion in flight'' at an altitude of about
30,000 feet, said a statement issued by the Transport Ministry.
   ``The work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recording
of words and electronic data abruptly stopped,'' the statement said.
   It said data from the black boxes backed up the preliminary
findings of an investigative commission at the site that ``leads us
to accept the hypothesis of the presence of explosives on board.''
   Workers searching wreckage in the northern African nation of
Niger recovered both the cockpit recorder, which records in-flight
conversations by the crew, and the flight data recorder, which
records information such as altitude and speed. Both devices arrived
in France late Friday night.
   The conclusion drawn from the data signals the start of an
intensive search for the individual or group responsible for the
bombing of UTA Flight 772, which was flying to Paris from
Brazzaville, Congo, when it crashed Tuesday.
   The victims included seven Americans, among them Bonnie Pugh,
wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad, Robert L. Pugh.
   In Beirut, a previously unknown group calling itself the Secret
Chadian Resistance claimed responsibility on Saturday for the
bombing.
   In a typed a statement sent to Western news agencies, the group
said: ``The struggle will continue until the complete withdrawal of
all military colonial forces from Africa.''
   France maintains 1,200 soldiers in Chad to help the former French
colony in its 16-year-old war with Libya. But Libya and Chad signed
an agreement Aug. 31 putting an end to the conflict.
   Responsiblity for the UTA bombing earlier had been claimed by the
Iran-backed Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad.
   Islamic Jihad is among several radcal fundamentalist groups
believed to be part of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
Iranian-supported umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   Callers claiming to represent Islamic Jihad demanded the release
of Shiite Moslem religious leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who was
kidnapped from southern Lebanon on July 28 by Israeli forces. France
has not been linked to the kidnapping.
   However, Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, recently quoted Islamic
militants loyal to Iran as charging France with reneging on a 1988
deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held in
Lebanon. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks on
French interests in Africa.
   France continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyond
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
   Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a deal
in which France secured release of the hostages by agreeing to free
Anis Naccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a life
sentence for attempting to kill former Iranian Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar in France in 1980.
   Before the latest claim, an unidentified source at the
presidential Elysee Palace was quoted by the French news agency
Agence France-Presse as saying that the manhunt for the plane
bombers would be focused on the ``Shiite network'' in Africa.
   Police, meanwhile, were examining the plane's passenger list for
suspects, concentrating on nine people who got off in the Chadian
capital, N'Djamena, the plane's last stop before exploding over the
Tenere Desert in eastern Niger.
   Investigators also are loking for clues about the precise nature
of the explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and how it
got on board.
   Autopies on the bodies of the victims were expected to reveal
traces of material or toxic substances that would help answer these
questions.
   A brief statement by the Transport Ministry late Friday night
confirmed that an investigating commission of officials from France,
Niger and Chad had found indications of explosives aboard the
flight, but it provided no details until the announcement on
Saturday.
   The French army, in charge of recovering the victims, flew 200
body bags to the site Saturday where paratroopers and military
doctors have been working in 120-degree heat. The violence of the
explosion and the rapid decomposition of the bodies are expected to
make identification of some victims difficult.
   About 100 bodies, already gathered for transport, were to be
flown Saturday by helicopter to Agadez, a village in central Niger,
and then on to Niamey, the capital, said Col. Jean Job, who is
supervising the operation. The rest of the passengers remain
scattered across miles of sand.
   Among the dead retrieved from the wreckage is the pilot, Georges
Raveneau, and four other crew members found in the cockpit of the
plane and identified by their uniforms, Job said. Workers at the
site said watches on the victims indicate that the explosion
occurred at 2:08 p.m. Tuesday.

   Boats at Wild Dunes Marina were stacked
``like toys,'' three fishing piers at Myrtle Beach were severely
damaged, and the shoreline at Surfside Beach moved two blocks
inland.
   South Carolina's tourism industry suffered at least $2 billion
in damage to buildings and other structures in Hurricane Hugo,
state Tourism Director Robert G. Liming said Saturday.
   ``Our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a
little rugged'' for a while, Liming said. ``But we have positive
attitudes. We've been saying `When I breathe, I hope.' That's one
of our state mottoes.''
   Liming said the storm appeared to hit at random, one house or
business destroyed while the one next door was left intact. Some
tourism businesses already have reopened.
   In 1988, tourists spent $4.7 billion in South Carolina, with the
impact of that spending estimated to be close to $7.5 billion, he
said. Before Hugo, Liming said, the state predicted a 6 percent to
8 percent growth in tourist spending this year. Now, he said, that
should reach only 4 percent.
   Details about damage were somewhat sketchy since people have not
yet been allowed to return to much of the coast and electricity and
telephone lines were down. Here is a list of how individual areas
fared along South Carolina's 220 miles of coast:
   _CHARLESTON: Most of the historic buildings downtown suffered
some wind and water damage, but the main structures remained
intact. ``That's a blessing because that's what makes Charleston,''
Liming said.
   _NORTH MYRTLE BEACH: From Cherry Grove south to Windy Hill,
beachfront motels were heavily damaged; some were destroyed.
Several high-rise hotels had erosion under their foundations, but
none appeared likely to collapse. An 8 p.m. - 7 a.m. curfew was in
effect to prevent looting.
   Ocean Boulevard was covered with sand and in some places under
several feet of water. Most of the dozens of structures destroyed
were valued at more than $100,000, said state Rep. Dick Elliott.
   _ATLANTIC BEACH: A Holiday Inn had palm trees in its oceanfront
rooms. Furniture was pushed up against the back walls, with carpet
peeled up. Most swimming pools had severe cracks. Some were filled
with sand.
   _MYRTLE BEACH: Three fishing piers were severely damaged or
destroyed. The high-rise hotels along the Grand Strand remained
intact, with damage to swimming pools, first-floor lobbies and
restaurants. Parking lots were covered with sand and water.
   _SURFSIDE BEACH: Downed trees and power lines; refrigerators,
air conditioners, toilets, chairs and tables littered streets. Mud
on Ocean Boulevard was 10 inches deep in some places. The shoreline
moved inland two blocks. The town's best-known landmark, the
Surfside Fishing Pier, was gone.
   _GARDEN CITY: Erosion beneath houses and condominiums left them
perched precariously on cliffs of sand. Roads were covered with
sand as far as three blocks inland. The city pier was destroyed.
   _PAWLEYS ISLAND: At least 14 homes were destroyed, and numerous
others were damaged. At least three homes wound up across or in the
creek that separates the island from the mainland. A channel of
water about 20 feet wide sliced the island in two.
   _GEORGETOWN: The marina suffered extensive damage. A sailboat
that was securely tied down pulled apart a dock. Condominums on the
bayside were demolished.
   _ISLE OF PALMS and SULLIVAN'S ISLAND: Every building on both
islands appeared to have been damaged. Many houses were buckled and
had their supports ripped away. Several houses were in roads.
   The Wild Dunes resort, known for its golf course and tennis
courts, on the north end of Isle of Palms, just north of
Charleston, suffered heavy damage.
   The larger of the high-rise buildings in the resort apparently
remained intact, but Liming estimated only 10 percent of the houses
remained. Gov. Carroll Campbell said boats at the Wild Dunes marina
were stacked atop one another ``like toys.''
   _FOLLY BEACH: As many as 30 percent of the homes had either
disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared all the others
suffered some damage.
   _EDISTO ISLAND: Suffered serious erosion with water rushing over
the road along the waterfront and under most oceanfront homes, many
of which were on poles.
   South of Edisto Island, the damage was mostly roof and water
damage, with some windows broken and trees and power lines downed.
An official with emergency preparedness in Beaufort County compared
it to the damage done by a severe thunderstorm.
   The southern portion of South Carolina's coast includes the
resort areas of Hunting Island, Fripp Island and Hilton Head Island.

   Many victims of Hurricane Hugo are
relying on flashlights, candles and antique kerosene lamps during
the dark, eerie nights in a city deprived of electricity, running
water and other basic services.
   Thirty mobile feeding vans were to arrive Saturday to provide
food for hurricane victims, said Glen Ellis, executive director of
the Carolina-Low Countries chapter of the Red Cross.
   ``We're going to feed everybody that needs feeding and is
hungry,'' he said. ``Some people don't have any electricity. Some
people don't have a house to cook in.''
   Since Hugo hit Thursday, the Red Cross has been passing out
sandwiches and drinks at its damaged headquarters in North
Charleston. On Saturday afternoon, 1,500 people remained in 14
shelters, Ellis said. Dozens of Red Cross volunteers with chain
saws were helping homeowners remove trees and other debris.
   Almost 200 Red Cross staff members have been dispatched to the
Carolina coast to work with hundreds of volunteers, said Dave
Langston, assistant director of Eastern Relief Operations for the
Red Cross. He said the Red Cross expects to provide 5,000 cots and
blankets and 9,000 cleanup kits for homes, as well as cash grants
so families can buy emergency supplies.
   Except for power provided by emergency generators at hospitals
and other high-priority facilities, Charleston remained without
electricity. Phone service was greatly reduced. Callers sometimes
could not call around the block but could reach relatives across
the continent.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Saturday morning that running
water has been restored, but he advised residents to boil drinking
water. Thousands of residents were unable to take showers, wash
dishes or flush toilets for about 36 hours.
   ``I had a shower this morning. Don't I look beautiful?'' said
Loving Phillips. ``I feel wonderful.''
   Her friend Myriam Buvinger said she was cooking on a gas stove,
but had to use candles at night and, until water was restored,
scooped dirty water from sinks to flush toilets.
   Like many residents who have electric stoves, Mrs. Phillips has
not been able to cook since the storm.
   ``I had cereal and my very last banana for breakfast,'' Mrs.
Phillips noted Saturday morning. ``I don't have any other breakfast
plans. I had tuna fish salad with wilted lettuce last night.''
   Patsy Narth said the storm left her with useless credit cards
and no cash. Without electricity, businesses could not run the
usual credit checks.
   ``We have no water, no electricity and no phone,'' she said as
she walked along Meeting Street with her son and daughter, trying
to find a restaurant. The owner of the only open restaurant in the
neighborhood refused to take a credit card.
   At Aaron's Deli, customers lined up for a $3 breakfast of hot
coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon and hashed brown potatoes cooked on a
gas grill.
   ``We're the only place in town that's got it at that price,''
said co-owner Eli Hyman. ``We're trying to help ourselves by
getting rid of perishable items and help the people because they
don't have anything to eat.''
   Hyman said he would offer shrimp and other seafood for lunch and
dinner to lessen the risk that $12,000 worth of seafood in
refrigerators and freezers will spoil.
   Long lines formed at two gas stations that re-opened Saturday
morning using generators for power.
   C.B. Branan, surveying the uprooted trees and damaged historic
homes in his downtown neighborhood, said he and his 17-year-old son
were using kerosene lamps and a propane lantern for light. He is a
hunter, he said, and is used to roughing it.
   ``We're not doing a lot of cooking,'' he added. ``We have
hard-boiled eggs. I guess everybody is so hyped up we don't feel
like eating very much. The adrenalin is still in us.''

   This 319-year-old city suffered some
damage from Hurricane Hugo to its wealth of historic buildings and
sites, but history was on its side.
   The most famous monument, Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor,
where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, suffered about
$1 million in damage to tourist areas but was mostly intact,
according to the Interior Department.
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation, based in
Washington, will send representatives to Charleston to assess the
damage to historic buildings, Mary Hoyt, an official with the
group, said Saturday.
   The organization was worried that Hugo had dealt a major blow to
the nation's architectural history, but early reports indicated a
remarkable lack of damage, she said.
   No other city has as many historic landmarks, Ms. Hoyt said.
Charleston's historic district is home to about 2,000 buildings,
including 73 built before the Revolutionary War.
   Among them are the Drayton Hall plantation, set on a bluff over
the Ashley River, northwest of Charleston, which was built in the
1730s. The plantation house, a two-story red brick building with
white columns, suffered some water and wind damage but apparently
is structurally sound, Ms. Hoyt said.
   The city's elegant Battery district, an area of palatial
2-century-old homes that look through massive oaks draped with
Spanish moss to Charleston Harbor beyond, are still occupied by
families. A walking tour Saturday found many missing shingles and
shutters _ and countless shredded oak trees _ but the Colonial and
Georgian mansions stood unbroken.
   Broken oak trees damaged some formal gardens and blocked some
streets.
   ``We have seen lots of roof damage, lots of fallen trees and
lots of garden walls knocked down,'' said Kitty Robinson of the
Historic Charleston Foundation. ``There is a great deal of mud and
water on the first floors of some of the houses on the Battery, but
fortunately there appears to be little structural damage.''
   ``This house has been here for 269 years,'' said John McCrady,
who along with his neighbors was cleaning up Hugo's mess Saturday.
``We just lost a few slates off the roof.''
   McCrady's house was built in 1730 by William Bull, who later
became the lieutenant governor of the colony of South Carolina for
the British.
   Wayne Jordan, a history professor at Charleston College, said
most of the oldest city structures had already withstood a furious
hurricane in the late 1750s as well as the famous 1886 earthquake
that destroyed dozens of lesser buildings.
   ``The oldest buildings we have were designed to withstand
storms, and the ones that are left have been through this before,''
Jordan said. ``But I'd say there hasn't been a storm of this
magnitude for 200 years.''
   Two-foot-thick walls, raised foundations and sturdy storm
shutters all are staples of the old structures, Jordan said _
safeguards not found in newer buildings that in some cases crumbled
like matchsticks under Hugo's force.

   A rocket struck one of Kabul's crowded
bazaars Saturday, killing at least 11 people, hospital officials
reported.
   There have been scores of rocket attacks against the capital
this summer and the Marxist government blames them on U.S.-backed
guerrillas.
   Saturday at midafternoon when the area was bustling with
shoppers a rocket hit an ice cream vendor's shop in stalls jammed
together on the south bank of the Kabul River.
   The explosion left shreds of cloth dangling from the shattered
windows of stores around the muddy site.
   Officials at the Ebnisina Hospital said the rocket killed 11
people and wounded 19.
   However, government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani put the number
at 20 people killed and 45 injured. He said three rockets fell in
and around Kabul on Saturday.
   A rocket attack in the same area of bazaars Friday killed 17
people and injured 38, the hospital offficials said.
   More than 300 people have been killed and 700 wounded since June
in the rocket attacks on the capital.
   The guerrillas say they only fire at military targets and claim
the Soviet-supplied government aims rockets at its own civilians.

   President Bush on Saturday signed a bill
designed to free a Washington mother jailed 25 months ago in a
bitter child custody dispute and attorneys filed an emergency
motion for her.release.
?????yokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush signed the
bill to free Dr. Elizabeth Morgan ``out of compassion for her
plight.''
   The bill was approved by Congress amid growing national
attention for the case. It applies retroactively to Morgan, who was
jailed for failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, for
court-ordered visits with the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich.
   Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, hid her daughter and went
to jail after alleging that Foretich had sexually abused the girl.
Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and at one point
offered a $5,000 reward for information that would help find the
girl.
   The child's whereabouts, however, remain secret.
   Hours after Bush signed the bill, Morgan's attorney, Adrian Roe,
filed the papers with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
seeking her release.
   Court Clerk Richard Hoffman then began telephoning each of the
nine judges on the panel in hopes that one could come to the
courthouse and review the request. Despite the new law, Morgan
cannot be freed without a judge's order.
   ``I'm doing my best to transmit it to the judges, and that's all
I can do,'' Hoffman said.
   Roe said he was ``hopeful the court will act promptly, but we
have no guarantees,'' Roe said.
   The bill takes advantage of Congress' authority to review
district laws and among other things sets a 12-month cap for civil
contempt child-custody jailings. It also contains a so-called
sunset provision that means it automatically goes off the books in
18 months.
   As clamor over the case grew, the House and Senate accelerated
action on the bill. A late-working Senate approved the measure on
Friday morning, shortly after midnight, and sent it to the
president's desk.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the House sponsor, and Utah Republican
Orrin Hatch, who pushed the measure in the Senate, both have said
they were motivated by concern for Morgan's dilemma.
   Foretich and his attorney, Elaine Mittleman, have complained
that the bill does not require Morgan to produce Hilary.
   ``President Bush has been badly served by his advisors,''
Mittleman said in a telephone interview Saturday. ``President Bush
obviously loves children, but this bill does nothing to insure that
Hilary will ever see her father again.''
   As the bill raced through the Congress and to the president, the
entire appeals court was reviewing an August decision by a
three-judge appeals panel that Morgan should go free.
   In that earlier decision, the judges had ruled that Morgan
should be released because the coercive basis for her jailing had
become unconstitutionally punitive.

   Anti-poverty crusader Mother Teresa, who
suffered a heart attack earlier this month, was resting comfortably
Saturday and had a good appetite, a hospital statement said.
   Doctors said earlier the chest pains she suffered for more than
two weeks had further subsided.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Woodlands
Nursing Home in Calcutta on Sept. 5 with a high fever and irregular
heart beat. Three days later she suffered a heart attack.
   A hospital statement Saturday said, ``She had a good appetite
and has rested comfortably throughout the day.
   ``There has been no chest pain, but her cardiac state continued
to be closely monitored.''
   Mother Teresa's personal physician, Dr. Rajen Wats, said, ``We
will have to observe her for two more weeks before we can say if
she is out of danger.''
   Despite her poor health in recent years, the Yugoslavia-born nun
travels widely to offer care and comfort to the destitute and the
sick.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950 to care for the
poor of this eastern Indian city's slums. The order has expanded to
3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.
   Her work earned her a Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.

   Government efforts to restore peace
suffered another setback with 14 people killed in ethnic strife,
military officials said Saturday.
   The officials said the latest victims, all Sinhalese, were
killed Friday. They gave no details.
   Independent sources said at least 35 people were killed in
ethnic violence in the previous 24 hours.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as did the
military officials, said 24 people were killed in south and central
areas of this Indian Ocean nation, and 11 bodies were found in
Kandy, 55 miles northeast of Colombo. Most of the recent killings
have been blamed on Sinhalese militants waging a campaign against
the Sinhalese-controlled government.
   Justice Minister Vincent Perara told Parliament that 865 people
were killed in ethnic violence between Aug. 15 to Sept. 15.
Military officials said since Sept. 15 at least 350 more people
have been slain, raising the known death toll to 1,215 since Aug.
15.
   In its latest peace initiative, the government announced
Saturday it will include members of an extremist Sinhalese group,
the People's Liberation Front, in a multiparty committee to monitor
peace efforts in Tamil-dominated northern and eastern zones of the
country.
   Indian peacekeeping forces have been patrolling that region, but
about 600 of Insidan soldiers left for home Friday.
   It was the first Indian withdrawal since Sri Lanka and India
signed an agreement Monday stipulating that India will pull out all
of its troops by Dec. 31.
   India deployed an estimated 47,000 soldiers in July 1987 to
supervise a Sri Lankan-Indian peace accord that offered Tamil
rebels limited autonomy if they laid down their arms.
   But the largest Tamil group rejected the accord and began
fighting the Indians in a push for an independent Tamil homeland.
   The presence of Indian troops ignited a backlash by the
Sinhalese militants. They claimed the government had offered too
many concessions to the minority Tamils and compromised the
nation's sovereignty by accepting Indian soldiers to the country.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's population of 16 million and claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   The Tamil revolt and attacks by Sinhalese militants have claimed
at least 16,000 lives since the Tamil insurgency broke out in 1983.

   President Bush, disclosing plans for
a 1990 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
Saturday he hoped the talks would produce an agreement on arms
control.
   The president also said he was ``very pleased'' with agreements
reached by Secretary of State James A. Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during talks at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   ``I'm very pleased with what the secretary has been able to
accomplish out there,'' the president said to reporters while
golfing at his vacation home. ``I think around the world people
will be pleased with this announcement.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze signed a chemical weapons accord and a
half-dozen other agreements aimed at lowering superpower tensions
during talks in Jackson Hole over the weekend. They also worked on
an agreement for inspection of U.S. and Soviet underground nuclear
weapons test.
   Bush took a break from golfing through a rain storm with his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to receive a phone call
from Baker on the 10th hole at the Cape Arundel golf course. He
summoned reporters to tell them the news.
   The president said he hoped the summit would produce agreements
on arms control and added that ``there'll be plenty of other things
to discuss in addition to arms control.''
   Asked what he hoped to achieve in the meeting, the president
said he would be talking about achieving further arms reductions.
``There's a chance for agreement of that nature.''
   As for accomplishments during the summit, Bush said: ``A wide
array of subjects, we will be continuing to work on the arms
control agenda, it's not my view that summits must have arms
control agreements, but we're going to be working toward it.''
   The president, in a written statement released by the White
House in Kennebunkport, said: ``I envision a broad discussion of
the full agenda that the two sides have established _ human rights,
bilateral relations, arms control, regional issues and
transnational issues,''
   Bush said the summit with Gorbachev would be held late spring or
early summer most likely in Washington, which he described as
``proper for this one.'' He added: ``Undoubtedly it will be in the
United States.''
   Asked about the timing of the summit next year, he said, ``It
could be sooner but this is the agreed timetable.'' He said it
would give time for the bureaucracy to ``move forward on a lot of
fronts'' and work on a more results-oriented summit.
   Bush said there was a commitment by the Soviets to hold the
summit in the United States and that he had discussed that with
Shevardnadze when they met in the Oval Office last week.
   Bush told reporters that at the summit he would be ``going
forward in every way to achieve further arms reductions.''
   On another topic, Bush was asked whether Colombia's Monica de
Greiff, who has been the target of death threats from drug lords,
meant the drug lords were not fazed by the crackdown against them,
Bush said, ``I don't think so.''
   ``I see no reason that a single resignation will signal or lead
to or lessen'' the resolve by Colombian President Virgilio Barco to
rid his country of drug traffickers, he replied.
   Earlier in the day, Bush traveled to Boston to addressed the
annual luncheon of the Catholic Lawyers Guild of the Archdiocese of
Boston.
   He was greeted by loud, sustained cheers, whistles and applause.
He shook hands and shared the head table with Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the Democrat he defeated to win the presidency.

<TEXT>
   Freedom of the press and religion are on the
agenda of the Soviet legislature's second session starting Monday
and debate is expected to be sharp even though many proposed
reforms have little chance of approval.
   The 4-month-old legislative session during the spring and summer
reacted to Kremlin proposals, but this time a group of 345 reform
deputies spent Saturday discussing an alternative platform. One
concept they considered was the freedom for anyone to start a
newspaper.
   The Inter-Regional Group, which includes such figures as human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and maverick Communist Boris N.
Yeltsin, also proposes the open sale of paper, printing presses and
copy machines. Under the continuing system of censorship,
distribution of these items is strictly limited.
   Gavriil Popov, an economist, said the group plans to vote on its
platform Sunday.
   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, has a formidable agenda. It
plans to act on 80 bills in 45 working days. Items include human
rights, ethnic strife and salvaging the economy.
   ``All are very important,'' deputy Sergei S. Alekseyev told a
government-sponsored news conference Friday. ``All should be
adopted.''
   But the Supreme Soviet, once a rubber-stamp body that met a few
days a year to approve the Kremlin's actions, has changed under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of restructuring and
glasnost, or openess.
   Alekseyev said there are no fewer than four versions of a new
law on the press and glasnost. One calls for a complete ban on
censorship, state-run Radio Moscow reported Friday.
   The draft platform of the Inter-Regional Group calls for the
elimination of internal passports, freedom to move in and out of
the country, access for defense lawyers to investigative reports,
public financing of parliamentary factions, the creation of
non-government television and unemployment insurance.
   But even the Inter-Regional Group does not suggest ending the
ban on private ownership of land _ a vital concept of Soviet
communism.
   Legislators also will consider bills on the right to strike, on
raising pensions, private cooperatives and taxation, said Rafik N.
Nishanov, a legislative leader and one-time Communist Party leader
of Uzbekistan.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Juan residents on Saturday
hauled water from swimming pools, rivers and parts of the island
unaffected by Hurricane Hugo as crews worked around the clock to
restore water and electricity.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and a group of U.S. congressmen
arrived in Puerto Rico for a two-day fact-finding trip to Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Officials say Hugo caused at least 27 deaths and billions of
dollars in damage in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and other
islands of the eastern Caribbean before hitting the U.S. coast on
Thursday.
   President Bush has declared both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas. In addition, 1,200 military police and
other troops were dispatched to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands to
halt widespread looting.
   Officials in the Virgin Islands complained that the Bush
administration was more interested in deploying troops than
airlifting relief supplies to the stricken U.S. territory.
   At a news conference here Saturday, Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., who headed the congressional fact-finding team, was asked
why federal assistance did not start arriving in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico until four or five days after the storm.
   ``That is one of the reasons we are here,'' Miller said.
   In Washington, the Defense Department said the islands had
already received relief aid including 100,000 Army field rations,
15,000 cots, four electrical generators with operating crews and
medical personnel from the 109th Evacuation Hospital of the Alabama
Army National Guard.
   It said more nonperishable food and plastic sheeting for home
repairs would also be sent.
   The Defense Department reported the Navy ship Pensacola had
arrived at St. Croix and was producing 58,600 gallons of water per
day. It said truck-mounted water purification units were being set
up in Puerto Rico to provide about 270,000 gallons of fresh water
daily.
   Virgin Islands Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said the territory was
receiving large amounts of aid, but distribution of the supplies
was disorganized.
   He said he expected the mainland military troops to remain
another week or so.
   Puerto Rico was returning to normal, despite millions of dollars
in damage, particularly in the eastern part of the island.
   In the capital of San Juan, roads were cleared and supermarkets
and some restaurants were open. But two-thirds of the city of 1.1
million people still had no running water Saturday, and one-quarter
had no electricity, utility officials said.
   They said 70 percent of the island was without running water and
up to 35 percent without electricity.
   Utility officials said water service could be restored to San
Juan by Saturday night if work was completed as planned on
installing four electric motors to run pumps at a dam servicing the
metropolitan area. A U.S. Army C-130 flew into the capital Saturday
night with 20,000 gallons of water for distribution.
   With a steady downpour Saturday, radio station WOSO suggested
that listeners catch rainwater.
   The government was distributing water in National Guard tanker
trucks. The Department of Health advised residents to boil any
drinking water collected from other sources.
   Hodge said Friday that Hugo left homeless more than 45,000
people _ about 90 percent of St. Croix's population. St. Croix, 70
miles east of Puerto Rico, is one of the three main islands of the
group, which also includes St. Thomas and St. John.
   He said damage was tentatively estimated at $4 billion.
   However, Gerald Connolly, a Federal Emergency Management
Administration coordinator in the Virgin Islands, said Saturday his
office had made a preliminary estimate of $400 million.
   The Justice Department obtained authority Friday from Virgin
Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly to order FBI agents and deputy U.S.
marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any
looters, officials said.
   There were no reports of looting Friday, but virtually every
store in Christiansted, the capital of St. Croix, appeared to have
been cleaned out in earlier looting.
   The National Guard has acknowledged that some of its members
took part in the looting, and several witnesses said some police
also were involved.

   Terrified by a new wave of political
violence, the family of an abducted human rights activist fled this
country Saturday after spending nearly six weeks holed up in a room
at the Red Cross.
   Maria Rumalda Camey's husband, her two babies, her brother and
his family left for Madrid under Spanish diplomatic protection.
   They were following six other relatives who were granted
political asylum by Spain last week.
   ``It is incredible how this family has been persecuted,'' Angel
Alfredo Figueroa, the deputy federal attorney general for human
rights, told The Associated Press.
   Their flight began Aug. 15, when armed men burst into the
activist's modest home in Esquintla province at 5 a.m. and dragged
her off.
   ``I heard the shots and the screams. It was her. Kidnapped,''
said her husband, Jose Gonzalo Camey, who was interviewed last week
in the crowded room where he and his family had taken refuge.
   His 23-year-old wife was the fourth person in her family to
disappear in 10 months. The others eventually turned up _ all shot
dead and dumped on roadsides. Camey, a 23-year-old farmer, doesn't
believe his wife survived either.
   Under the rightist generals who ruled in the early 1980s, tens
of thousands of Guatemalans died or disappeared, including Camey's
father. His wife has been a member of the Mutual Support Group, an
organization made up of relatives of the missing.
   Human rights groups put the toll of dead and disappeared as a
result of activities of right-wing death squads at 40,000. They say
many of the squads were linked to the army or other security forces.
   Tens of thousands of others have been displaced, fleeing the
military's scorched earth campaign against leftist guerrillas in
the countryside.
   After his wife was abducted, Camey's family and his
brother-in-law's family, fearing for their own safety, sought
refuge at Mutual Support's office in the capital of Guatemala City
30 miles away.
   About thirty minutes after they arrived, a grenade was lobbed
through the window. They were evacuated to the Red Cross, where
they remained for nearly six weeks.
   With the advent of civilian rule three years ago, human rights
abuses began to abate.
   But in the last two months, there has been a surge of killings
and bombings. Bodies have been found along the roads, their hands
cut off. Fear has returned.
   ``Guatemala is returning to the bloody times,'' Camey said,
cradling his children. ``There is terrible violence, not just in my
home, but in many homes.''
   Human rights workers blame the latest violence on right-wing
extremists who believe that President Vinicio Cerezo's rule is too
liberal. Cerezo, who has survived two coup attempts, has denied any
security forces are involved in the current violence.

   Officials declared a forest disaster in
South Carolina on Saturday after Hurricane Hugo left half the
state's 43 counties with extensive or moderate timber damage.
   ``It certainly is one of the worst forest disasters that South
Carolina has seen in many, many years,'' said Steve Scott, a
forester with the state Forestry Commission.
   The storm, which came ashore near Charleston packing sustained
winds of 135 mph, tore a path across South Carolina's coast early
Friday. Although its strength was dissipated once it hit land, Hugo
uprooted trees and broke limbs as it quickly moved north into North
Carolina.
   Extensive timber damage, defined as an area that will require a
great deal of salvage, occurred in nine counties on or near the
coast. Moderate timber damage _ requiring some salvage _ occurred
in 12 counties, and all the rest of the state's counties suffered
light timber damage, Scott said.
   Forestry is the third-largest manufacturing industry in South
Carolina, generating $4.3 billion annually and employing more than
30,000.
   Seventy-five state personnel were surveying damage in the
hardest-hit areas Saturday, and 35 tractors were brought in to help
salvage efforts, he said.
   Scott said he could not yet estimate the cost of the damage, and
it was still too early to develop a replanting plan or ask for
relief aid, he said.
   ``We will be working with all the private landowners in trying
to salvage the material,'' he added. ``It's going to be a big job.''

<TEXT>
   Finance officials of the world's seven largest
economic powers Saturday expressed dismay at the persistent
increase in the value of the dollar this year and pledged to take
coordinated action if necessary to drive the U.S. currency lower.
   In their first meeting since April, the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the so-called Group of Seven _ the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and
Italy _ stepped up their rhetoric aimed at curbing the buoyant
dollar, a development threatening to derail improvement in the U.S.
trade deficit.
   The group had expressed a similar concern last spring, but the
tone of the statement released Saturday was considerably stronger,
holding out the threat that if the dollar rises any further the
economic powers would intervene together in world currency markets.
   ``The ministers and governors considered the rise in recent
months of the dollar inconsistent with longer run economic
fundamentals,'' the group said in a two-page communique released
after the eight-hour meeting.
   ``They agreed that a rise of the dollar above current levels ...
could adversely affect prospects for the world economy ... (and)
agreed to cooperate closely in exchange markets,'' the statement
said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady emphasized this part of the
communique in a briefing for reporters but he refused to say what
specific actions the countries would be willing to take if the
dollar goes higher.
   In April, the officials used milder language and simply said
they agreed that ``a rise of the dollar which undermined adjustment
efforts ... would be counterproductive,'' not any rise.
   The group, meeting two hours longer than expected at Blair
House, across the street from the White House, also addressed
topics ranging from the Third World's crushing $1.3 trillion debt
to Western efforts to aid economic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Officials told reporters the extra time was devoted to
discussing events in Poland and Hungary, which the communique
termed ``historic.''
   ``The whole meeting of the G-7 became electric when we started
talking about the events going on in the Soviet Union and Poland,''
Brady said, adding that the finance ministers hoped the 152-nation
International Monetary Fund would be able to reach quick agreement
on a loan package for Poland.
   On Third World debt, the communique praised Brady's latest
initiative for achieving ``substantial progress.''
   Since the Brady plan was announced in March, commercial banks
have struck tentative agreements granting relief to Mexico and the
Philippines.
   Last week, however, three major U.S. banks added more than $4
billion to their loss reserves for developing country loans.
Analysts are expressing concern that this could signal
unwillingness to make enough new money available to sustain growth
in the developing nations, most of them in Latin America.
   The communique noted the development, saying ``diversified
financial support from the banks is needed to support sound
economic reform programs through a broad array of new lending and
debt@debt service reduction mechanisms.''
   But, it was the group's remarks on the dollar that were most
eagerly awaited by financial markets.
   ``That's a much stronger statement against any rise in the
dollar,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer. ``I would expect on the heels of that
statement more aggressive dollar selling from central banks.''
   He said the G-7 countries likely now will be willing to
accelerate the decline of the dollar when it is falling on its own,
not just counter any rise. And, he speculated that Japan and
Germany would show more willingness in the months ahead to raise
their interest rates as a means of influencing exchange markets.
Possibly, he said the Federal Reserve may nudge U.S. rates lower.
   An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates would
make investing in those countries more attractive and would thus
raise the value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in the
United States would push the dollar lower.
   The G-7 has issued statements in the past pledging to hold the
dollar down. But despite heavy intervention in currency markets,
efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The volume of private
currency trading has grown so huge that it dwarfs any buying or
selling that central banks can do.
   Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about
10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the West
German mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks,
well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading
range sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks.
   A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of
U.S. goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper
for American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent last
year, but progress has slowed in 1989, with the deficit shrinking
at only about half of last year's rate.
   In addition to the narrow question of exchange rates, finance
officials discussed the broader issue of economic coordination. The
United States has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate
consumer demand in their countries as a means of cutting their
trade surpluses and reducing the U.S. deficit. The United States,
in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curb its budget
deficit, which is believed to contribute to the trade deficit.
   The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of the
annual meetings this week of the IMF and its sister lending
organization, the World Bank.
   The G-7 session was preceded by a Group of Five meeting _ the
G-7 excluding Canada and Italy _ at the Treasury.
   Brady met one-on-one with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new Japanese
minister of finance, and Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance
minister. It was Brady's first meeting with Hashimoto.

   A slight temblor jolted downtown Los Angeles
on Saturday about two hours after another minor quake shook an area
east of the city, but no injuries or damages were reported.
   ``The ceiling shook a little bit and the desks shook a few
seconds,'' said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Deputy Van
Mosely.
   The afternoon earthquake measured 2.4 on the Richter scale, said
Hall Daily of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
Its epicenter was about three miles north of downtown and six miles
south-southwest of Pasadena, he said.
   About two hours earlier, a quake measuring 2.9 on the Richer
scale shook an area about 55 miles east of Los Angeles, near Rialto
in San Bernardino County, Daily said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number on the scale means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.
A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas.

   President Bush and Soviet Leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will hold their first summit meeting next
year, officials announced Saturday as the two superpowers completed
a half-dozen accords and cleared a major roadblock to a treaty on
slashing long-range nuclear weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who spent the
weekend in talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said
the summit would be held in ``spring or early summer.'' He
announced a key concession from Moscow to move ahead toward a
long-range weapons agreement despite its objections to the U.S.
Star Wars program.
   First official word of the summit plans came from Bush, who
informed reporters on a golf course near his vacation home in Maine
after taking a telephone call from Baker. ``I think around the
world people will be pleased,'' he said. Bush expressed pleasure
with the outcome of the weekend talks and said he would meet
Gorbachev in the United States, possibly in Washington.
   Later, in a written statement, Bush said: ``I envision a broad
discussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established _
human rights, bilateral relations, arms control, regional issues
and transnational issues,''
   Bush spoke more than a thousand miles from the snow-capped Rocky
Mountain resort where Shevardnadze and Baker _ obviously pleased
with their diplomacy _ reached agreement on a chemical weapons
accord and several other points.
   The agreements include:
   _ Exchange of data on chemical weapons by the end of the year
and visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants
by June 30. In a second phase, there would be more intensive
on-site inspections of the submitted data.
   _ An ``umbrella agreement'' in principle that there should be
verification of missile plants and information exchanged even
before a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons is completed.
   _ Advance notification to the other side of exercises with
long-range bombers and other strategic weapons.
   _ A ceiling of 10 on launchers carrying mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles at any one base. Some of the launchers would be
exposed for monitoring.
   _ Cooperating to enhance the power of the International Court of
Justice to settle disputes.
   _ Two agreements to facilitate movement across the Bering
Straits of Eskimos in Alaska and Eskimos in Siberia for visits.
   _ Agreement on interpreting international rules for ship
movements.
   Baker later told reporters that the two sides ``took a series of
steps across the full arms control agenda to overcome old
misconceptions and build trust.''
   In one of a pair of conciliatory gestures, Shevardnadze said the
Soviets would dismantle their Krasnoyarsk radar facility. The
United States has charged the Siberian radar was intended to be
part of a space-based defense outlawed in a 1972 treaty.
   The Soviet foreign minister insisted, however, the United States
should ``remove our concerns'' about U.S. radar stationed in
Greenland and Britain.
   Baker said later he would be surprised if the Soviets were
demanding that the U.S. facilities be dismantled.
   Baker said Shevardnadze wanted to send Soviet inspectors to the
sites to make sure the radar is legal under the 1972 treaty.
   In fact, Baker said, the installations are ``totally legal'' and
any action on them required the approval of Denmark and Britain.
   The Soviets also removed another key impediment to a strategic
arms agreement, dropping their demand the pact include limits on
submarine-launched cruise missiles, Shevardnadze and Baker said in
back-to-back news conferences.
   During the talks, the Soviets said a deal to limit
nuclear-tipped SLCMs can be reached in a separate, simultaneous
agreement, Shevardnadze and his aides said.
   But the United States remains skeptical that means can be found
to monitor nuclear SLCMs, said Baker. And senior U.S. arms control
aides predicted the Soviets might not insist on completing the SLCM
agreement before signing the more sweeping strategic arms accord.
   Shevardnadze also told reporters that Moscow was making a major
concession in arms control negotiations, announcing that his
government would not let its objections to the U.S. Star Wars
program block completion of a treaty to cut long range nuclear
submarines, missiles and bombers by 30 to 50 percent.
   ``The preparation and signing of a treaty now appears to be
quite in reach,'' he said.
   Baker hailed the move but stressed ``there are some difficult
issues that still remain.'' He cited keeping track of cruise
missiles aboard airplanes, submarines and combat surface ships.
   ``We have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now to
cooperation,'' he said of the evolving superpower relationship.
   The long-range weapons talks in Geneva have been deadlocked over
the Soviet demand that the treaty depend on completion of a
separate agreement on space-based defense. Since the United States
declined to give ground on the search for a Star Wars defense in
space against Soviet ballistic missiles, that made an arms
reduction accord improbable.
   Baker acknowledged the Soviet concession on Star Wars, stressed
Bush's commitment to proceeding with the U.S. space-based defense
program and said he had offered the Soviets the opportunity to
visit research facilities associated with the program.
   Baker also said the Bush administration's willingness to lift a
ban on mobile ICBM's ``made it possible for us to move ahead on
developing verification measures for mobile missiles.''
   Shevardnadze said, ``This agreement (for a summit) reflects the
confidence of both sides that they will be able to reach important
mutually acceptable agreements and generally to achieve substantial
progress in relations between our two countries. And here I am
referring above all to the sphere of disarmament and security.''
   The two-stage chemical weapons agreement provides for an
exchange of data by the end of the year and inspection of U.S. and
Soviet stockpiles and plants beginning next June 30.
   More detailed inspections would be held later, if the 40 nations
meeting in Geneva are within reach of an international treaty to
ban the deadly weapons.
   Additional last-minute work remained to be done on another
agreement for inspection of U.S. and Soviet underground nuclear
weapons test. Baker said he hoped it could be completed before the
windup of his talks with his Soviet counterpart.
   After a fishing expedition on Sunday morning, Baker and
Shevardnadze head for New York for the opening of the United
Nations General Assembly on Monday.
   Their work on the ground was also far-reaching. The chemical
weapons accord will open U.S. and Soviet arsenals and plants to
cross-inspection and the two sides will exchange data on the deadly
weapon.
   Apart from the formal agreements, Baker invited a group of
Soviet experts to visit Los Alamos National Laboratory and the TRW
Corp.'s test facility in San Juan Capistrano to learn more about
U.S. research on space defenses.
   An announcement said the Soviets also would visit a particle
beam project at Los Alamos and observe a laser project at the TRW
test plant.
   ``The U.S. believes that such visits would be useful
confidence-building measures and would reduce the risk of
technological surprise,'' the announcement said.
   But, it added:``Our invitation ... is not preconditioned on a
reciprocal invitation by the Soviets.''

<TEXT>
   The United Nations has agreed to
send 700 unarmed observers to patrol the borders of five Central
American nations to deter guerrilla incursions, President Jose
Azcona Hoyo of Honduras said Saturday.
   A peacekeeping force of 100 observers had initially been
scheduled to arrive in October, but Azcona said at a press
conference that a larger force had been agreed upon.
   He said members will patrol border areas of El Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.
   He also said that the demobilization, repatriation and
resettlement of Contra guerrillas fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government ``is progressing.''
   ``Central America is about to enter into a stage of true
democracy,'' Azcona said. He said, ``The Contras must accept
demobilization because they haven't got the resources to do
anything else.''
   The U.S.-supported Contras have been based in the hills of
eastern Honduras near the border with Nicaragua since 1981. For
most of that time, they operated with Honduran knowledge and
consent, but Azcona and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua signed
an agreement Aug. 7 calling for disbanding the Contras by Dec. 8.
   Most of the Contras retreated to Yamales, along the border with
Nicaragua, in March 1988 when the United States cut off weapons
aid. However, U.S. support at the latest count was still feeding
12,000 fighters and 42,000 relatives.
   While some Contras have deserted, others have marched back into
Nicaragua with their weapons to await the outcome of Nicaraguan
elections scheduled for February. Both the Sandinista government
and the Contras have said they will refrain from ``offensive
operations.''
   The Aug. 7 agreement, also signed by Guatemala, El Salvador and
Costa Rica, called for 100 observers from West Germany, Spain and
Canada to monitor the accords.
   Azcona said the larger U.N. peace force will be made up of
military personnel and civilians based in all five countries. He
said they will patrol border areas to discourage armed guerrilla
incursions.
   He gave no date for their arrival.
   Nicaragua has accused Honduras and Costa Rica of harboring the
Contras, while El Salvador has accused Nicaragua of supporting and
arming Salvadoran leftist guerrillas.
   Teams from the United Nations and the Organization of American
States, as well as other international observers, have been
visiting Central American nations in preparation for disbanding the
Contras and holding the Nicaraguan elections.

   Nothing could stop Constance Bland and
Thomas Newberry from getting married Saturday, including the plane
crash he survived and Hurricane Hugo, which wiped out both wedding
site and honeymoon plans.
   The couple had to borrow a ring too. Theirs got lost in the mail.
   But four days of trauma ended Saturday night when the couple
exchanged their vows.
   ``This is a very special occasion in ordinary circumstances, but
it is a great occasion today,'' said Horace Hilton, the pastor
emeritus of Myrtle Grove Presbyterian Church.
   ``I honestly believe with all my heart that God spared your
life,'' Hilton told them at the altar. ``This wedding was intended
to be.''
   But it wasn't intended to be smooth.
   Newberry, a New York City banker, was on his way to Wilmington
for the wedding when his plane _ USAir flight 5050 to Charlotte _
slid into New York's East River while attempting to take off from
LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday. Two people died and 59 others were
rescued.
   The plane went down with his luggage, inside which were his
passport and tuxedo.
   Then came Hurricane Hugo, which threatened to slam into
Wilmington all day Thursday. The hurricane hit in Charleston, S.C.,
instead, but its path still managed to foul up the wedding plans.
   The couple had intended to spend part of their honeymoon in the
Virgin Islands, but the rioting and looting that followed Hugo's
path through the Caribbean gave them pause.
   ``We'll discuss it over breakfast,'' Mrs. Newberry said.
   About 100 people attended the ceremony, and some of their
friends got to help out with another last-minute problem.
   The wedding ring was lost in the mail and a new one had to be
sent from New York to Wilmington, but it arrived too late for the
ceremony.
   ``We're just lucky our friends had a ring,'' Newberry said
afterward.
   The ceremony was over at last, and most of the guests had
already gone on to the reception. The wedding party was delayed,
however, because the limousine was a half-hour late.
   ``What else can happen?'' asked the bride's father, David Bland.
``Is my car going to blow up?''

   Pope John Paul II called Saturday for
increased national and international efforts to fight the drug
trade but said addicts should be treated with compassion.
   ``The various public institutions, on the national and
international level, are called on to put a brake to the expansion
of the market of narcotics substances,'' the pope said during a
visit to a drug rehabilitation clinic on his three-day tour of
Tuscany in nordhern Irtaly.
   ``The interests that gain financially from such a trade must be
brought to light,'' John Paul said.
   ``Then the instruments and mechanisms they use must be
identified, and finally one will proceed to their coordinated and
efficient dismantling.''
   The pope, without mentioning any countries by name, said there
is a need to promote development in those regions where residents
depend on production of drugs for their livelihood.
   John Paul also praised the work of rehabilitation clinics and
social programs that offer addicts ``alternative models of life''
to lead them away from drugs and reintegrate them into society.
   ``Drugs are fought not only by health and judicial means but
also _ and especially _ by installing new human relationships, rich
in spiritual and tender values,'' he said.
   The pope said drug abuse is a ``clear symptom of a society that
no longer succeeds in living true values and pushes those who use
(drugs) into egoism and solitude.''
   ``In this climate, the goals to pursue become money, power,
career, consumer goods. One is ready to pay whatever price to
obtain them,'' he said.

   Armed leftist rebels forced their way into the
offices of two foreign news services in Lima Saturday and made
staff members transmit statements, according to employees at the
agencies.
   Members of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
raided the offices of Agence-France Presse, a French news agency,
and United Press International, an American wire service.
   No one was injured in either incident.
   Employees of both agencies said three rebels with pistols took
over each office Saturday morning, painted slogans on the walls,
ordered that statements be transmitted and then left.
   The communiques criticized the International Monetary Fund,
which has been negotiating with Peru on its loan payments.

   The City Council on Saturday enacted an
emergency ordinance barring price-gouging in this hurricane-ravaged
city, where 5-pound bags of ice were being sold for $10 and long
lines snaked outside stores that opened.
   ``It would be an unfair trade practice to charge something
higher than pre-hurricane prices,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.,
who called for the emergency legislation the council passed in a
vote by telephone.
   ``If I hear of the instance of someone doing that, not only will
they be arrested, but I will personally take pleasure in
participating in the arrest,'' Riley said.
   Violators would be subjected to fines of $200 and jail terms of
30 days.
   The emergency ordinance is in effect until commerce returns to
normal, Riley said.
   Authorities reported that gas at some locations was selling for
$3 to $4.50 a gallon.
   Riley cited the instance of ice being sold for $10. The state
Emergency Operations Center requested that merchants charge no more
than $2 a bag.
   ``There is a problem with gouging,'' said John Lawson, a
spokesman for the state Emergency Preparedness Division.
   Long lines flowed from stores that managed to open Saturday,
partly because police asked that no more than 10 people be allowed
in stores at any one time. Robbie Roberts, manager of a Food Lion
grocery store in Charleston that suffered only a few damaged
ceiling tiles, said ``a couple of thousand'' customers showed up
Saturday before the store was forced to close because it had no
lights.
   Lines ``were going out the parking lot and into the street,''
Roberts said. ``It takes them about four hours to get into the
store.
   ``It was hairy at times but it worked out all right,'' Roberts
said. ``It was hot and people were irritated _ others were cutting
in line.''
   Cashiers used pocket calculators.
   People bought ``anything they could get their hands on,'' he
said. And trucks outside gave dry ice to people, he said.
   A crowd hoping to get ice in the parking lot at the Citadel Mall
started pushing and shoving and police were called, but there were
no injuries or arrests, Maj. Charles Wiley said.
   ``Frankly, some people were panicking over ice,'' Wiley said,
noting that food could begin spoiling after two days without
electricity.
   ``It wasn't a riot, but it could have been,'' said Police Lt.
Mike Connolly, one of the first officers on the scene. ``There was
some pushing and shoving, cursing, just some hot tempers.''
   At another mall, motorists turned one lane of a road into a
parking lot when they jumped out of their cars to get ice that was
being given out.
   The city has been without electricity since Thursday, when
Hurricane Hugo toppled power lines in much of the state, leaving
hundreds of thousands of people without power.
   Restoring electricity ``may take a very long time,'' Riley said.
``There's no electricity coming into the transmission lines and the
generating capacity down here is gone.''
   Utility crews from Georgia, Alabama and Florida have been sent
to South Carolina to help, he said.
   Riley said the city surveyed 2,000 buildings, one-third the
total in Charleston, and found 24 in varying degrees of collapse.
He said there also were a number of collapsed chimneys in danger of
sliding off sloped roofs and ``extraordinary'' tree damage in the
city.
   Despite the difficulties, the mayor said he was inspired by the
spirit in which Charleston residents endured the hardships.
   ``Throughout the city today, people are upbeat and they are
thankful,'' he said. ``They're thankful they're alive and that the
city is essentially intact.''
   The American Red Cross expects Hurricane Hugo relief efforts to
be the costliest in the organization's history, a spokesman said
Saturday.
   Dave Langston, assistant director of Eastern Relief Operations
of the Red Cross, said the storm will cost the agency an estimated
$38 million.
   ``We estimate that more than 73,000 people have received
assistance to date, and this is just the beginning,'' Langston said
at a news conference.
   More than 150 volunteers and paid disaster specialists will be
brought into Carolinas and other affected areas, he said.

   The driver of a truck that collided with a
school bus and knocked it into a water-filled pit refused Saturday
to answer questions about the accident that killed 20 teen-agers,
an accident investigator said.
   Also Saturday, Lee Dickinson of the National Transportation
Safety Board said an examination of the truck's braking system
found ``the brakes did work.'' The truck driver had told police
after Thursday's accident that the brakes failed.
   On the advice of his attorneys, Ruben Perez, 25, chose not to
talk to NTSB board members who are investigating the accident that
injured at least 63 others, Dickinson said. Perez's refusal will
not hinder the federal probe, he added.
   An examination of the brakes found they were working, he said,
but added that they were not perfectly adjusted. The truck passed
state inspection last month, Dickinson said.
   There were 81 aboard the bus when the accident occurred and the
vehicle had a capacity of 83, Dickinson said.
   Investigators planned Sunday to question the driver of the bus,
Gilberto Pena, who was in stable condition Saturday night at
Mission General Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Estella Alvarez.
   One student still was listed in critical condition in Mission
General's intensive care unit on Saturday.
   Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Company Inc., the owner of the truck
that rammed the school bus, offered Saturday ``to pay all medical
and funeral expenses of the families involved in Thursday's tragic
bus accident,'' according to a statement issued by Dan Fairley,
manager of the McAllen-based company.
   Earlier Saturday, funerals were held for 15 of the 20 teen-agers
who died in the accident.
   ``If you want to shout, shout. If you want to cry, cry,'' the
Rev. Francisco Quezada told 4,000 people who crowded a funeral for
four of the victims. ``If you want to strike your chest, those are
all natural human reactions, but we need to transform the shouts
and cheers into hope.''
   The multitude, many of them standing, packed the San Juan del
Valle cathedral for the funerals of Marta Lozano, 13, Carmen
Canales, 16, Veronica Perez, 14, and her cousin Yesenia Perez, 15.
   Many who attended the Mass at San Juan del Valle, about 15 miles
from this border town of 3,700, did not know the girls but said
they felt like they had lost some neighbors.
   Rosie Gutierrez, 25, of McAllen, said she attended because ``it
felt like it was part of us. It felt like it was part of my
family.''
   Quezada asked the mourners ``not to wait for another tragedy for
the opportunity to be close and loving to each other.''
   Mariachi musicians played religious songs for the bilingual Mass.
   At another crowded Mass at St. Paul's Catholic Church in nearby
Mission, about 400 family members and friends remembered Michael
Saenz, 14, and his brother, David, 12.
   Michael had escaped moments after the bus plunged into a
water-filled pit, but died while trying to save his younger brother
and others trapped in the submerged bus.
   The Rev. Jerry Frank said the bus tragedy was not God's will,
but he asked God to help the community to accept the deaths of the
20 young people.
   ``We all know that something is terribly wrong and it just ain't
right that this terrible tragedy had to happen,'' Frank said. ``It
just doesn't fit when the young people die and they carry their
future with them before the Lord.''
   A steady stream of curious Valley residents continued to drive
past the accident site Saturday. Some parked their cars and got out
to look at the pit.
   ``I have kids and I wouldn't like for my kids to go in the bus
and have this happen,'' Evangelina Churbe of Pharr said, standing
with her four children. ``It would drive me crazy if one of my kids
would drown.''

   The state's Republican committee on
Saturday declined to censure state Rep. David Duke for his past as
a leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
   The committee has no authority to kick Duke out of the party,
but two committee members who worked on the censure said they had
done so because of Duke's past of ``promoting racial violence, his
anti-Semitism and his neo-Nazi philosophies.''
   Neil Curran and Elizabeth Rickey, both of New Orleans, tried to
introduce the resolution at the party's quarterly meeting. The
resolution was tabled without debate.
   Curran, an advertising and media consultant, and Rickey, worked
for Duke's, opponent, John Treen, during the legislative campaign,
Duke said.
   ``Basically they can't accuse me of doing anything wrong. They
can't question my stated platforms. They have to go back in my
past,'' Duke said.
   Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
censured Duke after he won his legislative seat in February. But
the state Republican Party has shied away from any move to censure
Duke.
   ``They voted, in effect, that they don't think it's proper to
deal with it,'' state party chairman William Nungesser said after
Saturday's vote.
   Duke, from Metairie, joined the Klan in 1968 and left in 1980
after six years as Grand Wizard, a national post. Duke later
founded a group called the National Association for the Advancement
of White People, which he still heads.

   An investigation into the crash of USAir Flight
5050 focused Saturday on the possibility of mechanical failure,
although officials said the rookie co-pilot had punched the wrong
cockpit button just before the craft plunged into the East River.
   Investigators continued removing pieces of the plane's fuselage
from the water off a runway at LaGuardia Airport, National
Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said. The
parts will be examined to determine if there were any mechanical
problems in addition to the pilot error, he said.
   Speaking of the co-pilot's mistake, Lopatkiewicz said, ``It may
turn out that was unrelated to what happened.''
   Another factor under investigation was the plane's unexplained
veer to the left, acting National Transportation Safety Board
chairman James Kolstad said at a news conference Saturday night. He
also said investigators found marks on the runway that showed the
plane's three sets of wheels were skidding down the runway.
   The flight's pilot and co-pilot had their flight licenses
suspended for leaving the accident scene and were strongly
criticized Friday by federal officials for failing to immediately
submit to drug and alcohol testing.
   ``At a time when drug abuse has become a major national problem,
we believe the American public has a right to know that its
transportation system is alcohol and drug free,'' Kolstad said.
   ``The failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug testing
following a major accident is inexcusable,'' he said, echoing an
angry statement by Federal Aviation Administration head James B.
Busey.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the union that issued a
statement defending the pilots Friday, offered no response Saturday
to the testing comments or the suspensions. The pilots are not
required by law to submit to testing after a crash.
   Pilot Michael Martin, 36, and co-pilot Constantine Kleissas, 29,
submitted to urinalysis Friday following five hours of questioning
by federal investigators. The results of the tests were not
available Saturday.
   Flight 5050 crashed into the East River late Wednesday when its
takeoff was aborted. Two people died and 59 others were rescued.
The flight had been headed to Charlotte, N.C.
   At a news conference late Friday, Kolstad revealed that Kleissas
_ attempting his first operational takeoff of a Boeing 737-400 _
inadvertently pressed a button that caused the plane to decelerate.
   Martin then accelerated the plane, but decided to abort the
takeoff because the craft began drifting to the left and ``the
pilot felt and heard a vibration which concerned him,'' Kolstad
said.
   He said Saturday that two passengers _ one of them a frequent
flier _ told investigators they also felt the vibrations.
   Martin believed he had enough room on the runway to stop the
plane, but it instead skidded off the runway and into the water,
cracking the fuselage into three sections.
   Kolstad also said that, as the plane accelerated down the
runway, the captain, acting as co-pilot, did not call out the jet's
speed as required.
   ``It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in
the cockpit,'' Kolstad said. Lopatkiewicz said investigators were
trying to find out what made the plane drift to the left.
   Flight data recordings that would indicate the plane's actual
speed when it aborted were still being studied.
   Kolstad also noted the lack of experience in the cockpit, noting
it was Kleissas' first actual takeoff on a 737-400 following
completion of flight training.
   Kleissas, 29, received his commercial pilot's license in October
1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His FAA record
shows no previous problems, said FAA spokesman Bob Hoppers in
Oklahoma City, Okla.
   Martin, 36, became a captain on July 1 and had flown only 138
hours in that capacity on the 737-400, though he had about 4,000
hours on 737s, mostly as a co-pilot.
   Kolstad also said reports quoting Kleissas as saying that Martin
mumbled and appeared incoherent in the cockpit before the crash
were not true, and Kleissas apologized for making those remarks.
   Kolstad Saturday said that what Kleissas had heard was Martin
reciting to himself a safety checkoff list.

   Thousands of Caribbean
residents remained at the mercy of the elements nearly a week after
Hurricane Hugo destroyed their homes and communities.
   Officials in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico complained
Friday that while Washington readily flew in troops to stop the
looting and restore order, disaster relief was slow in coming.
   Tens of thousands of people remained in shelters or were roughing
it wherever they could.
   ``I think the governor was wrong in telling the people the
military was coming without telling them (when) food was coming,
water was coming,'' said territorial Sen. Lilliana Belardo de O'Neal.

   The co-pilot of the USAir jet that crashed into
the East River was making his first takeoff in a passenger-carrying
Boeing 737-400 when he mistakenly pushed a button that cut the
throttle, investigators said.
   The pilot tried to remedy the error by increasing engine thrust
manually, but then decided to abort the takeoff, James Kohlstad,
acting administrator of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said at a news conference Friday night.
   Also Friday, authorities suspended the pilot's and co-pilot's
flight licenses for leaving the scene of the crash.
   Two passengers died when the Charlotte, N.C.-bound plane skidded
off the end of LaGuardia Airport runway Wednesday night.

   The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew
apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons
and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
   A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled
the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between
practice sessions on the school's parade ground.
   Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them
in serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead were
bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.
   Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English
seaside town of Deal were damaged.

   President Bush's war on drugs is caught in a
partisan battle in the Senate, with Democrats trying to add
prevention and treatment money and Republicans arguing the revision
would weaken the defense budget.
   ``If we're not willing to spend $150 million more, this is no
war,'' Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Friday after a week of
closed-door efforts to reach a compromise failed.
   The talks broke off Friday and no new negotiations were scheduled.
   Republicans were proposing to add $850 million to the $7.9
billion program Bush announced two weeks ago and Democrats were
holding out for an additional $1 billion, with no further talks
scheduled.

   President Bush says it doesn't really matter
that a drug dealer was coaxed into selling crack cocaine near the
White House _ just so the president could tell the American people
that's where the sale took place.
   ``The man went there and sold drugs in front of the White House,
didn't he?'' the president told reporters in Maine on Friday.
``That's the bottom line. That's what the man did.''
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, and the Drug
Enforcement Administration concede the drug dealer was maneuvered
into making a previously arranged sale in Lafayette Park, across the
street from the White House.
   The president displayed the cocaine in a see-through plastic bag
in his nationally televised drug strategy speech on Sept. 5. He told
the audience the crack had been ``seized a few days ago in a park
across the street from the White House.''
