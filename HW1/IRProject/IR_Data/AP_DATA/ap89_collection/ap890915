   ABC News wouldn't have used former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger as a paid expert on a China special last June
had it known of his business ties there, a spokeswoman said Friday.
   However, L. Paul Bremer, a Kissinger business associate, said
there was no conflict of interest in Kissinger's appearance on the
broadcast. On it, Kissinger was asked about possible U.S. military
sanctions against China for its violence against the student-led
demonstrations in Beijing.
   In his reply, the former Secretary of State in the Ford and Nixon
administrations stressed the importance of U.S. relations with the
Beijing regime. ``I wouldn't do any sanctions,'' he told anchor
Peter Jennings.
   Kissinger at the time was appearing under a special agreement
with ABC that he terminated Wednesday after his election as a board
member of CBS, Inc.
   The ABC deal, struck in 1982, paid him as a consultant and gave
ABC the right to interview him first on any of its broadcasts,
including ``World News Tonight'' and Ted Koppel's ``Nightline,'' but
only on breaking stories.
   He wasn't paid for appearances as a guest on these shows,
including as ``Nightline'' and ``World News Tonight'' when his
interviews didn't concern breaking news, said ABC spokeswoman Elise
Adde.
   Had ABC News known of his business ties in China, she said, ``we
would not have had him on that broadcast'' in June.
   Kissinger has extensive business interests in China, including
the establishment of a $75 million fund to be raised from U.S.
investors for joint ventures with the merchant banking arm of the
Chinese government, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
   In addition, his consulting firm Kissinger Associates counsels
several businesses on how to conduct operations overseas and,
specifically, in their dealings with China, the Journal reported.
   Kissinger's remarks on the June special were ``not motivated by
commercial concerns,'' said Bremer, State Department employee for 23
years, now a senior partner in Kissinger Associates, Inc., an
international consulting firm.
   Kissinger's remarks on issues like the situation in China last
June are solely ``based on what he thinks are the (U.S.) nation's
interest,'' said Bremer, a former U.S. ambassador.
   Kissinger's ABC deal was not his first with a network news
division. He previously had worked for NBC's news division after
after his White House service.
   Since 1977, he has been a member of the American Federation of
Radio and Television Artists but under the union's news contract
with networks, according union membership rolls.
   AFTRA represents on-air news correspondents and anchors at CBS,
NBC and ABC. The news contract and the entertainers' contract
stipulate different pay scales.
   Kissinger was busy Friday and was not available for comment,
Bremer said.
   His election to the 14-member CBS board was by a unanimous vote,
a source election said Friday. CBS policy is not to comment on
internal board matters.
   As a CBS board member, Kissinger will paid the same as other
board members, $22,000 annually, and $750 for each meeting he
attends, CBS spokesman George Schweitzer said.
   There is no contract that would make Kissinger exclusive to CBS
News, and his board membership ``has absolutely nothing to do with
CBS on-air appearances,`` Schweitzer said.
   ``In that regard,'' he said, referring to news matters, ``he is
Henry Kissinger, private citizen and businessman. And he can be
interviewed by anyone.''

<HEAD>U.S. Reported Concerned North Korea Developing Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is ``gravely
concerned'' that communist North Korea may be developing nuclear
weapons, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported from
Washington on Friday.
   It said the State Department is keeping a close watch on possible
efforts in North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. Yonhap quoted
Spencer Richardson, the head of the department's Korea section, as
saying Moscow would be as concerned as Washington if North Korea
produced such weapons.
   Secretary of State James Baker is expected to discuss North
Korea's nuclear capability with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze at a meeting in the United States this month, Yonhap
reported.
   While denying it has nuclear weapons, North Korea has repeatedly
charged that U.S. forces based in South Korea are equipped with
nuclear arms and are preparing for a nuclear war on the divided
Korean peninsula. U.S. officials reject the North Korean claims.
   The United States keeps about 43,000 troops in South Korea under
a defense pact. The Soviet Union is the North's main arms supplier.
   Chances are dim for an improvement soon in the strained relations
between the United States and North Korea despite diplomatic
contacts between the two sides in Beijing, the report quoted
Richardson as saying.
   North Korea demands immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Korea. Seoul says U.S. forces are vital to prevent a North
Korean attack.
   North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, setting off the 3-year
Korean War. U.S. forces intervened on the side of South Korea and
fought under the United Nations banner. U.S. troops have remained in
the South ever since.

<HEAD>In Interview, Benazir Bhutto Says She's Fighting Evil in Pakistan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 9{ months as prime minister,
Benazir Bhutto sees herself as a crusader to save Pakistan from the
clutches of drugs, ethnic violence and rancorous politics.
   ``I see things in terms of knights in shining armor trying to
root out evil,'' Ms. Bhutto said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``That may be a sort of simplistic way to put it, but I am an
optimist. I have great dreams for my country and I want to achieve
them.''
   But she acknowledged her vision might be a bit fanciful.
   ``I think I am too much of an idealist.''
   Educated at Harvard and England's Oxford University, the
36-year-old Ms. Bhutto is the first woman to lead a Moslem nation
and as she spoke she had a scarf called a ``dupatta'' draped over
her shoulder. When in public she wears the scarf over her head _ the
custom of Moslem women _ as a concession to Pakistan's religious
right wing, a powerful minority that opposes female rule.
   Ms. Bhutto and her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party govern a
restless nation of 107 million people burdened by poverty,
illiteracy and civil war across the border in Afghanistan.
   She said death threats after her government declared war on the
heroin trade and drug barons have forced her to think of her safety,
something she has resisted since assuming office Dec. 2.
   ``I don't believe in a life that is crowded with security,'' she
said. ``I think it's kind of nice to be able to slip away, ... after
having worked hard for a few days to be able to go for a half an
hour walk.
   ``I just consider it important for a person in public life to try
and maintain a sense of normalacy _ to have their feet on the
ground.''
   As for the drug war, she said, ``We are really now just going
after the big people, but it's a much bigger problem. It's just
proliferated all over the country like a cancer.''
   Western countries estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin
arriving in the United States and Europe comes from Pakistan. Drug
addiction in Pakistan has soared from near zero in 1979 to an
estimated 1 million addicts in 1989.
   Ms. Bhutto is also doing battle with an opposition made up of
Islamic fundamentalists, conservatives and loyalists of the late
president, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and his military government.
   Zia overthrew her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in
a 1977 coup and had him hanged two years later for his alleged
complicity in a murder plot.
   Zia, many of his top generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L.
Raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, clearing the
way for Pakistan's first free elections in more than a decade and
resulting in Mrs. Bhutto's election Nov. 16.
   Ms. Bhutto says the most serious threat to her government is
ethnic. Hundreds of Pakistanis have died and thousands have been
injured since 1986 in violence in her southern home province of
Sindh in fighting among militant secessionists, Indian Moslem
immigrants and internal migrants from poorer provinces.
   ``During General Zia's time ethnic groups became very strong,''
she said. ``They set up armed camps and they trained their people,
so it's a situation of almost a mini-kind of a guerrilla war. It's
not a guerrilla war against the government, but it's almost a state
of anarchy and a rebellion against authority.''
   Ms. Bhutto claims that her right-wing political opposition, the
nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, has had a hand in the Sindh
violence.
   She also has implicated neighboring India in the Sindh troubles.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they became
independent from Britain in 1947 and they routinely accuse each
other of fueling their internal problems.
   To the west, Ms. Bhutto inherited Pakistan's sponsorship of
Moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government of
Afghanistan.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees huddle in camps dotting
Pakistan's western frontier.
   ``Pakistan can't afford to keep the refugees,'' she said, ``but
are the refugees going to go back without political stability?
   ``So far we have not seen any message or any method that would
enable the emergence of an independent Afghanistan or the return of
the Afghan refugees. Those remain our goals.''
   She also said her political opposition is doomed because of its
links to the Zia era, when Pakistan was under martial law and
political parties were barred from elections.
   ``Pakistan just can't afford a return to the decade of
repression,'' she said. ``All those who are patriots in the
different sectors of life, whether it is civilian or military,
recognize that. Therefore, I see no imminent threat to democracy in
Pakistan.''
   But she added that law and order cannot survive without economic
development in a country where the average yearly wage is under $400.
   ``First you've got to try and create a system, create a rule of
law which gives security and, side by side, you've got to have
economic improvement and opportunitiees so people can (give) better
meaning (to) their lives,'' she said.

<HEAD>Granddaughter Portrays Maria von Trapp in Sound of Music</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As a girl, Elizabeth von Trapp ran through
the hills near her home singing songs from ``The Sound of Music.''
It wasn't so much theatrics, though, as family tradition.
   Now she will fill another family role by stepping onto a stage to
portray her grandmother, Maria von Trapp, whose flight from
Nazi-occupied Austria inspired the musical.
   Elizabeth von Trapp makes her debut as Maria in a local theater
production of the story made famous by the 1965 movie in which Julie
Andrews portrayed Maria von Trapp, the matriarch of the family who
died two years ago at age 82.
   ``I grew up listening to the album with my cousins, and we'd all
take parts,'' said Elizabeth, 35, who learned the tale of the
family's flight on her grandmother's knee. ``We used the fields to
practice in.''
   Trapp, who has sung professionally at the Trapp Family Lodge in
Stowe for three years, also shares the local stage with her
8-year-old cousin Kiersten von Trapp, cast as another of Maria's
children.
   ``I've seen the movie five zillion times,'' said Kiersten,
squirming impatiently during rehearsal and tugging at her hot-pink
T-shirt and miniskirt. ``Until I was 7, I thought it was just about
nuns.''
   Music, which first brought Maria, Baron Georg von Trapp and his
10 children together as a family during the war, continues to be a
shared bond between the younger von Trapp generation _ as does the
family legacy.
   Six of Maria's children remain in Vermont where the family moved
after the escape and their subsequent worldwide tours as the Trapp
Family Singers, with two others buried in Stowe and two living in
other states.
   Elizabeth said the youngsters would gather around her father,
Werner von Trapp, one of the children who fled Austria a half
century ago, and learn folk songs.
   ``Acting is a whole new challenge,'' said Elizabeth, standing
before a hand-painted set of the Austrian mountains in the Hyde Park
Opera House. ``I am so excited. I think my grandmother was that way.
She was excited about life. She wasn't discouraged about the
problems she encountered.''
   Today Elizabeth records her own folk songs and designs Austrian
clothing for sale at the lodge gift shop. She designed some of the
costumes for the local production, which premieres at the end of the
month.
   ``Being a von Trapp, people are so in awe of you and they treat
you differently,'' she said. ``When you grow up with it, you live
with that everyday. People say, `So, you are one of THE von Trapps.'
   ``Everyone remembers our story. It's universal. I've met people
at the lodge who went through the same thing, but we had a story
written about it,'' she added.
   Elizabeth likened the current flood of refugees from East Germany
into Austria to her family's situation years ago.
   ``It's happening right now, although the direction people are
going has changed,'' she said. ``Isn't it ironic that here I am in
little Vermont playing the part, and yet the exact same thing is
happening there.''
   Maria von Trapp attended the Hyde Park annual performance six
years ago to watch Elizabeth perform a bit-part as a nun. After the
performance, the baroness took a bow for the crowd and drew a
standing ovation.
   Elizabeth remembers that her grandmother, who gave up her plans
to become a nun to marry the baron, always wore a silver cross on a
chain around her neck, and until her final years dressed in Austrian
costume.
   ``There was a charm about her that I really appreciated. She had
a great sense of humor, and a great way of telling stories. She'd
have us rolling on the floor.''
   ``Everybody is interested in the von Trapps _ they are news,''
said the play's director Steven Hall. ``People visit the lodge, and
then come back year after year to see the show.''
   Elizabeth said her performance as Maria adds a new twist to the
story, however.
   ``Some of my family members might say it's just rehashing the
story, but I'm experiencing new people and challenges. That's what
art's all about.''

<HEAD>Hungary's Reform Course Opens Cracks in Warsaw Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cracks are opening in the Warsaw Pact as
Hungary's Communist leadership abandons agreements with its military
allies in the East in pursuit of new friends and business ties in
the West.
   Hungary, along with Poland, is in the front rank of reform in the
Soviet bloc, eclipsing Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's more
modest campaigns.
   Where the Soviets have adjusted their Communist-dominated system
to introduce a measure of democracy and personal freedom, Hungary's
Communist leadership has pledged to allow free elections by next
June that could end the party's 43-year-old hold on power.
   Poland this week installed the East bloc's first government not
led by Communists.
   Where the Soviets favor reducing central control of industries,
sentiment in Hungary has swung to scrapping all state interference
in the economy in favor of market forces.
   This week, Hungary enraged Communist hard-liner East Germany by
allowing thousands of East Germans to cross its border to the West.
   Hungarian officials have been candid about the risks of the
country's shift.
   ``There is a danger of Hungary becoming isolated in Eastern
Europe as some of the things Hungary is doing irritate our neighbors
and allies,'' Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told Hungarian radio Aug.
29. ``Altering our approach, however, would mean curtailing our
freedom of action.''
   An unprecedented plan announced Sept. 8 to cooperate with neutral
Austria and non-aligned Yugoslavia in setting up demilitarized zones
along common borders is perhaps the clearest sign of a cautious move
away from the Warsaw Pact.
   Hungary's aspirations extend even farther westward, with leaders
knocking on the doors of the 12-nation European Economic Community,
the world's largest trading bloc.
   Hungary already has privileges with the EEC unique within the
Soviet bloc. It signed a 10-year agreement with the EEC in June 1988
granting it reduced tariffs on its exports to EEC nations. The
accord is the most liberal the EEC has signed with a Soviet bloc
country.
   Hungarian leaders used the recent East German refugee standoff to
press their case with West Germany for a political voice in the bloc.
   West Germany did not go public with a promise to support those
wishes. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl subsequently said his country
will give full backing to Hungary's economic reforms, and
expectations are that West German gratitude over the East German
exodus will translate into generous financial aid.
   President Bush praised Hungarian reforms during a July visit, and
Congress last week voted to extend by three years instead of the
customary one year Hungary's Most Favored Nation trading status,
which offers the best tariff rates.
   Hungary's leaders say they have Soviet blessings for the
increasing independence that is moving them closer to the West, but
the reforms are breaking Budapest away from some other traditional
allies.
   Relations are worst with Romania because of disputes over the
fate of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Hungary says they
are being systematically persecuted, an accusation Romania denies.
   Tensions exploded after Hungary broke an agreement two years ago
that had committed it to return those fleeing Romania's Stalinist
system. Since then, more than 20,000 Romanians, mostly ethnic
Hungarians, have found sanctuary in Hungary.
   Relations hit bottom in July after Horn, Hungary's foreign
minister, expressed anxiety that the war of words could escalate to
violence.
   Horn, referring to Romania's boast in April that it could build
nuclear missiles, expressed fears Hungary could be a target of such
weapons one day.
   The Defense Ministry gave up all pretense of ``fraternal'' ties
with the Romanian military Sept. 7, announcing that Romania's deputy
defense minister would not visit as planned.
   Tensions of a different kind have been building on Hungary's
northern border with Czechoslovakia.
   Because of budgetary and environmental pressures, Hungary
abruptly stopped work in May on a joint Danube River dam project
agreed to in 1977. This enraged Czechoslovak partners.
   The Czechoslovaks accused Hungary of breaking their word. The
Hungarians said the Czechosklovaks were planning to ``violate
international law'' by unilaterally diverting a river that forms
part of the countries' common boundary.
   Growing bitterness over the dam project has been exacerbated by
political differences.
   Hungary's leaders used the Aug 21 anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to denounce the move, which crushed
a Czechoslovak reform movement. Polish leaders also criticized the
invasion.
   East Germany is the latest to join the chorus of East European
critics of the reform-minded Hungarians, its ire raised by
Budapest's decision to open a westward escape route for thousands of
East Germans.
   State-controlled East German media accused Hungary of being
bought by the West Germans, and the East Berlin Foreign Ministry
filed a formal protest over the action.
   The Soviet reaction to change in Hungary has ranged from praise
to tolerance. Gorbachev has pointed to Hungarian economic reforms as
examples to inspire Soviet workers, and Hungarian electoral reforms
are reported broadly in state-run Soviet media.
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov indicated
Kremlin reservations about the refugee exodus, describing it as
``unusual.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted his order that would
have required Energy Secretary James Watkins to testify on the
Energy Department's proposed $78 million settlement with neighbors
of the nuclear weapons plant at Fernald.
   However, U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel also criticized
Watkins on Wednesday as appearing insensitive to the worries of
people who live near the Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium
processing plant.
   ``It's no secret that the Department of Energy has estimated that
it will cost millions, maybe billions, to clean up the site,''
Spiegel said, adding that Watkins could have reassured to neighbors
concerned about cleanup costs.
   Several businesses near the plant say they interpret the
settlement to mean that they cannot sue to recover from the Energy
Department any costs of radioactive materials cleanup on private
property. The Energy Department agrees with that assessment, but
lawyers for the neighbors disagree.
   Spiegel first invited, then last week ordered, Watkins to testify
on that issue, saying a final word was needed from the Energy
Department's top official. But Department of Justice lawyers opposed
Spiegel's request, saying it was unnecessary and beyond his
authority.
   Justice Department lawyer Richard Stearns said, in papers filed
with Spiegel, the government would appeal if the judge insisted on
compelling testimony from Watkins, a Cabinet officer. Stearns said
the issue had ``constitutional implications.''
   After hearing from both sides Wednesday, Spiegel ruled from the
bench that he would decide the issue of cleanup costs on the basis
of the case record and would not require Watkins' testimony.
   Spiegel said that to do otherwise would probably prompt a
time-consuming government appeal that would further delay a
resolution for the plant's neighbors.
   Spiegel directed lawyers for the government and neighbors to meet
and resolve the issue this week.
   The 38-year-old plant, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnti,
processes uranium for use elsewhere in making the government's
nuclear weapons.
   Neighbors of the plant filed their class-action suit in 1985 on
behalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of the plant. The
suit contended that radioactive pollution from the plant lowered
property values and caused them emotional distress. The settlement
was reached June 30.
   Ruetgers Nease Chemical Co. and the Mobil Corp., which have
operations near the plant, argued at a hearing on the settlement
Aug. 23 that its terms would prevent them from suing to recover the
cost of any future environmental cleanup on their properties.

   Near the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, skulls
pierced by bullet holes were found where gold once was mined.
   In Kolpashova, a Siberian village on the Ob River, excavations
released a stream of mummified corpses to float down the river.
   In the Ukrainian city of Poltava, diggers at a sand quarry
uncovered a series of trenches full of bones _ the remains of an
estimated 5,000 people.
   ``This is a country built on bones,'' says Oleg Golovanov, a
member of a group called Memorial that is dedicated to the memory of
Josef Stalin's victims.
   The bones lay undisturbed for decades while the Soviet government
refused to acknowledge the estimated 20 million victims of Stalin's
bloody years of terror.
   Now they are coming back to haunt the country. About once a month
for the past year, the official press has reported the unearthing of
another mass grave as the Soviet Union reveals the horror of its
past.
   On Tuesday, Soviet television carried another report, this one
about the reburial of 350 skeletons found on a mountain near
Chelyabinsk. A correspondent said innocent ``men, women, old people
and even children'' _ possibly as many as 300,000 _ were loaded onto
trucks and shot at night.
   The Memorial group found the remains buried in a former gold mine
where authorities wanted to build houses. Now officials plan to turn
the area into a memorial, the correspondent said.
   A reburial ceremony is also planned Saturday for the remains of
540 of Stalin's victims found at a garbage dump in the Ukrainian
coal center of Donetsk.
   Golovanov coordinates efforts to track down the mass graves for
Memorial, the national group lobbying to clear the names of Stalin's
``enemies of the people,'' as well as help their families and those
who survived years in labor camps.
   He believes there could be as many as 100,000 unmarked mass
graves left as a legacy from the purges, repressions and labor camps
Stalin oversaw from the late 1920s until his death in 1953.
   Press coverage of the graves began last year when a killing field
was found in the Kuropaty forest of Byelorussia. It escalated with a
similar discovery in Bykovnya in the Ukraine.
   Memorial receives a steady stream of letters with information
about newly revealed sites, and Golovanov said he sometimes wonders,
``What is your goal in digging them up?''
   He answers: to make sure people know all the evil of the Stalin
years. He believes there is a need to restore respect to the dead.
   ``You're walking, and they're lying there under you, and not a
single person knows about their fate,'' he said.
   Golovanov believes the caches of bones also make a forceful
statement about the country's Communist rulers.
   ``The people in the government are the same now as they were
then,'' he said. ``People can't help but see that.''
   The party's policy-making Central Committee last month ordered
local governments to do all they could to redress Stalin-era wrongs,
including cooperating with groups like Memorial. ``Mass burial
places should be recognized as official cemeteries,'' the decree
said, and ``organs of the police and the KGB should be more involved
in this work.''
   But Golovanov said revealing and marking the old graves remains
fraught with conflicts.
   The KGB, whose predecessor, the NKVD, carried out much of the
killing, often does not open its files to help find graves and
identify victims. KGB officials say their archives are in such
terrible shape they aren't worth examining.
   Even after the grave sites are identified, some local authorities
insist on using the land for new housing, garages or other projects.
   In Donetsk, the local government had turned the killing field
over to developers and was reluctant to change its plans, the youth
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Wednesday. Eventually,
authorities agreed to turn most of the land into a memorial park.
   In Poltava, the grave site is now a dump.
   An unsigned letter to Memorial from Poltava described how a man
unearthed the trenches of corpses at a sand quarry in 1968 and was
ordered by authorities to cover them.
   ``Once a year, since then, I've visited that area, since I
supposed that my father was resting there too,'' he wrote. ``He was
rehabilitated in 1959,'' posthumously.

   The former president of an Indianapolis generic
drug manufacturer who paid $32,000 in bribes to three U.S. Food and
Drug Administration officials has been fined $250,000 and ordered to
serve a year working for the American Cancer Society.
   Dilip P. Shah, 43, formerly of Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., was
convicted of bribing FDA officials in exchange for their
recommendations for approval of Quad products.
   In addition to the community service and fine, U.S. District
Judge John R. Hargrove also sentenced Shah on Wednesday to 60 days
in jail and imposed two years of probation after the defendant
completes his prison time.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Gary P. Jordan said Shah paid $23,000
worth in illegal gratuities to Charles Y. Chang, former branch chief
of the FDA's Division of Generic Drugs; $8,000 in cash to David
Brancato, an FDA review chemist; and $1,000 in department store gift
certificates to Walter Kletch, another agency chemist.
   Jordan said Shah's cooperation in the case helped prosecutors
convict Kletch and Brancato. Chang also has pleaded guilty in the
case.
   So far, the investigation has resulted in the convictions of the
three FDA officials and three pharmaceutical company officials. Two
companies also have been found guilty of criminal wrongdoing and are
facing heavy fines.
   Jordan said additional charges are expected as the investigation
continues.

   Emigration from Eastern Europe is rising
sharply, both from reform-minded nations relaxing requirements for
Western departures and from hard-line Communist nations.
   Here are the available figures on departures from Eastern Europe
and explanations of the procedures in each country:
   SOVIET UNION _ Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev rose to power in May
1985 and embarked on a broad reform course, the Soviet Union has let
increasing numbers of citizens emigrate. In 1988, a record 108,000
Soviets left for permanent resettlement abroad, mostly ethnic
Germans, Armenians and Jews. This year authorities expect the figure
to reach 200,000, compared to less than 1,000 per year in the early
1980s. Soviets must submit to a lengthy and bureaucratic process to
gain permission to emigrate, but refusals are now reported to be
less than 1 percent of applications.
   EAST GERMANY _ Both legal emigration to West Germany and
unauthorized flight to the West are up dramatically this year, as
East Germany witnesses the largest migration westward since the
Berlin Wall was built in 1961. West Germany expects well over
100,000 East Germans to arrive this year, both legal immigrants and
a growing number of escapees fleeing through Hungary's newly opened
borders.
   East Germans get automatic citizenship in West Germany. Less than
40,000 East Germans have been allowed to leave for the West in each
of the past 28 years, with the numbers dipping to below 1,000
annually in the 1960s. The recent migration wave stems from
dissatisfaction among East Germans with their leadership's refusal
to emulate the reforms sweeping Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   POLAND _ Since passport laws were revised Jan. 1 to allow
virtually any citizen to travel abroad, the issue for Poles has not
so much been getting permission to leave as getting visas to get
into other countries. Most emigres are ethnic Germans resettling in
West Germany, or those with close relatives in the United States who
leave to join them. More than 140,000 Poles of German origin
emigrated last year, and 3,500 left for the United States. U.S.
visas will rise to 4,500 this year, while the exodus to West Germany
has tapered off somewhat, though official figures are unavailable.
Warsaw reported at the end of last year that during the 1980s, more
than 400,000 Poles failed to return from trips abroad.
   HUNGARY _ Figures are not available for legal emigration from
Hungary prior to liberalized travel codes adopted in January 1988,
but the departures are thought to have been limited to a few hundred
family reunification cases each year. Budapest officials have also
acknowledged that an average of 2,500 to 3,000 Hungarians failed to
return from authorized trips aboard each year during the 1980s,
accounting for the majority of departures. Those desiring to leave
now are awaiting a new emigration law being drafted by the Hungarian
Parliament. It is expected to result in a system similar to Poland's
in which anyone with a sponsor abroad will be allowed to leave.
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ The last sizeable wave of emigres from
Czechoslovakia was in 1969, when 110,000 fled after the Warsaw Pact
invasion the previous year and before the borders were sealed.
Czechoslovaks now can get to the West only to join spouses abroad,
by failing to return from authorized foreign trips or in rare
circumstances when they are allowed to join close relatives abroad.
   Unofficial sources say the number leaving, both legally and
illegally, ranges between 6,000 and 8,000 per year.
   ROMANIA _ In the most hard-line Warsaw Pact state, legal
emigration is steady under fixed quotas while escapes have increased
as Romanians driven to despair chance dangerous departures to
Yugoslavia or Hungary. The West German government takes in about
12,000 ethnic Germans freed from Romania each year. About 1,000 Jews
are allowed to go to Israel annually, and 2,000 to 3,000 other
departures are permitted, mostly to Canada, the United States and
Australia.
   More than 20,000 Romanians of Hungarian descent have been given
refuge in Hungary after fleeing illegally, and thousands more have
escaped to the West through Yugoslavia.
   BULGARIA _ Emigration from Bulgaria consists primarily of ethnic
Turks leaving for Turkey. Nearly 270,000 Turkish Bulgarians have
fled or been expelled just since May, when Sofia began issuing
passports to those claiming repression under a forced assimilation
campaign that began in 1984.
   Legal emigration and escapes over the years are thought to be
only a few hundred annually, and no official figures are available.

   Damaso Perez Prado, who was credited with
popularizing the Caribbean music known as mambo in the 1940s and
'50s, died Thursday after suffering a stroke, his son said. He was
72.
   He died at home in the upper middle-class Mexico City suburb of
Colonia del Valle after being in a coma for eight days, said his
son, Gerardo Perez Salinas.
   Perez Prado was born Dec. 11, 1916, in Matanzas, Cuba, and
studied classical music as a youth. He moved to Mexico after World
War II, but had been in ill health since last year, his son said. In
July, he suffered a stroke, and doctors amputated a leg.
   Historians consider Perez Prado one of the founders of mambo, a
bouncy blend of tropical music highlighting trumpets and drums that
became popular after the war in such cities as New York and Chicago.
Popular songs included ``Patricia'' and ``Mambo No. 8.''
   The dance known as the mambo is similar to the cha-cha. It
features a syncopated beat with lots of hip motion.
   Perez Prado, affectionately called ``seal face'' by his fans for
the barking sound he made while playing his music, was in some ways
a prisoner of his own success. He tried to change his musical style
after the mambo craze died down, but ardent fans kept demanding the
rhythms they were used to.
   He is survived by a wife and two children. He is to be buried
Friday in Mexico City.

   Negotiators for the Salvadoran government and
leftist rebels reached an agreement Thursday night on a framework
for negotiations to end their nearly 10-year-old war, an observer to
the talks said.
   ``It's clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement
that they should be attempting to reach not just a cease-fire but an
end to hostilities,'' said Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary
bishop of El Salvador.
   A preliminary statement by Rosa Chavez said the sides had reached
an accord on how to prepare the meetings and on participation of the
church in the talks. He said substantive themes would be discussed
at the next meeting. The current round of talks began Wednesday with
a two-day schedule, but the two sides were still negotiating late
into the night Thursday on a final statement. Rosa Chavez said he
``had the impression'' the future meetings would be held on a
monthly basis and that they would include international observers.
He added that the talks would take place inside and outside El
Salvador.
   Earlier in the day, the Marxist rebels and U.S.-backed government
argued about the pace of peace talks to end the war, which has taken
70,000 lives.
   One rebel leader, Shafick Handal, told reporters the government's
concern for procedural matters was ``very restrictive.''
   Fighting continued in El Salvador, despite a unilateral truce
declared by the guerrillas. Army spokesmen in San Salvador said four
guerrillas were killed, two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded,
a helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched.
   In San Salvador, Col. Orlando Zepeda, the vice minister of
defense, called the rebel proposal to reorganize and reduce the size
of the armed forces a thinly disguised attempt to seize power. ``We
continue to be the object of Marxist aggression,'' Zepeda said.
   Government representatives had insisted that procedural issues be
settled first, setting aside discussion of a rebel offer to lay down
their arms and reorganize as a political party in exchange for
democratic reforms.
   Sources for both sides also said they were divided on whether
some negotiating sessions should take place without the presence of
observers or Roman Catholic Church mediators.
   The guerrillas made the proposal Wednesday in their first talks
with the government in two years.
   El Salvador's government has not presented a peace plan, but the
five-man delegation arrived with a proposal calling for two days of
talks every two months.
   Rebels leaders said they want a faster-paced negotiating plan.
   Both sides say they want to end the war.
   Salvadoran Ambassador Sigfrido Munes Cruz told reporters Thursday
that the rebel proposal shows ``a new attitude, a more realistic
attitude.''
   Munes is not a member of the government delegation, but he said
he feels optimistic.
   The meeting is the first between the rebels and the elected
Republican Nationalist Alliance government of President Alfredo
Cristiani, who took office June 1 after elections boycotted by the
insurgents.
   The rebels' peace proposal calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in
exchange for broad reforms, including appointing a new Supreme Court
and justice minister and moving up legislative and municipal
elections scheduled for 1991.
   The guerrillas also say a truce is conditional on military
reorganization, including a reduction in the number of troops,
expanded land reform and the prosecution of death squad members.
   Roberto d'Aubuisson, founder of Cristiani's party, has been
accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that have
murdered thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and other
government opponents.
   Under the final stage of their proposal, the guerrillas call for
constitutional and electoral reforms and U.S. agreement to replace
military aid to the Salvadoran government with economic aid.
   El Salvador is the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the
hemisphere.
   The rebel plan contains many proposals rejected before, but the
wording this time is much milder and the rebels have dropped a
longstanding insistence on merging their army with the goverment
armed forces.
   Their offer to become a political party also is new.
   Negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed.

<DATELINE>BEIT ARYEH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank say they are trapped between stone-throwing Arabs
and an indecisive government.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began 21 months ago, nails have
been strewn on their roads and their cars are targets of stones and
firebombs. Glass window panes have been replaced with plastic and
travel is often safest in convoy.
   The settlers complain bitterly that the government is torn on how
to put down the uprising and, indeed, on the future of the occupied
land itself. The result, they say, is that the army is not doing
enough to protect them.
   ``Of course I am fearful,'' settler Mark Barat told visitors to
this fenced, hilltop settlement east of Tel Aviv. ``If there is
debate in Israel, it undercuts us.''
   Barat, 40, a computer scientist, is among more than 70,000 Jews
who have moved to the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the territories
were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Some are ``ideological'' settlers, convinced that Jews must
reclaim the biblical land of Israel. Others, like Barat, see
themselves as part of a front line against a Palestinian state.
Still others are lured by the promise of free land and subsidized
mortgages.
   Settlers have become targets in the uprising since many
Palestinians see them as one more encroachment on Arab land. Almost
half the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories are refugees
whose families fled Israel when it was founded in 1948.
   The settlers say the army, which recently began deploying extra
troops along highways and stepped up escorts for settler convoys at
night, still needs to do more.
   ``Instead of soldiers killing mosquito after mosquito, let them
drain the swamp,'' said Kiryat Arba lawyer Eliyakim Haetzni, a
leader of the settlers' umbrella group, Gush Emunim, or Bloc of the
Faithful.
   ``We demand the deportation of 5,000 people _ members of the PLO
establishment, stone-throwers and their families _ to show them that
stone throwing is not a national sport,'' Haetzni said.
   ``Arabs must know that they can live here only if we can live
here.''
   Some Jewish settlers have poisoned Arab vineyards, raided
villages and fired on suspected stone throwers, killing at least 23
Palestinians in the past 21 months.
   Tensions also have increased because of the government's proposal
for elections in the territories leading to an interim peace
solution.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has repeatedly said he will refuse
to give up any occupied land, and his right-wing Likud bloc urges
creation of more Jewish communities in the territories.
   But the left-leaning Labor Party, partner in the coalition
Cabinet with Likud, advocates trading land for peace and calls for
suspending the creation of more settlements if peace talks get under
way.
   The 130 settlements built so far run counter to the U.S.-backed
land-for-peace solution, which the Palestinians demand.
   By far the largest number of settlers live in communities close
to the pre-1967 border. Some of the settlements deeper in the
territories have populations of only several hundred people.
   Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli analyst who has studied development
in the territories for a decade, notes that more than three-quarters
of the settlers live within commuting distance of Jerusalem or Tel
Aviv.
   ``They have come to see themselves as suburbanites of the major
cities,'' he said.
   Benvenisti said the settlements depend heavily on government
subsidies for survival.
   He calculates that the government and the World Zionist
Organization have spent $2.5 billion in the past 20 years building
the new communities, providing basic services like water and roads
and resettling Jewish families.
   Settlers often live rent-free in mobile homes while they build
their houses. There is no cost for the land. Mortgages are
subsidized, and fees for sewer and water connections are
considerably less than in Israeli towns.
   The goverment plans at least seven new settlements by 1992, but
budget constraints have forced the focus of late on trying to
increase the population in existing communities.
   The number of new settlers fell to 4,500 last year from an
average of 8,000 in previous years, apparently because of fears over
the uprising, said Michael Dekel, the prime minister's adviser on
settlement affairs.
   But settlement advocates hope the trend can be reversed. Dekel
predicted that the Jewish population in the territories would reach
125,000 in five years, even if the Arab revolt continues. ``People
have become used to the uprising,'' he said.

<HEAD>US Food Aid to Poland to be Doubled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is doubling food aid to Poland
to $100 million next year ``to support the process of change''
there, but the Democratic author of a rival plan calls it a merely a
stopgap effort.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said Bush's plan does not go nearly far enough to help
Poland meet its long-term needs.
   Bush announced the food aid increase for fiscal 1990 on Thursday,
just hours after Leahy unveiled his own $2.5 billion ``food for
peace'' package.
   The president's plan calls for shipments to Poland of beef, pork,
corn, butter, butter oil, sunflower oil, cotton and rice. The new
$50 million infusion was in addition to $50 million in food Bush
announced in early August for the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   It is on top of $8.4 million in emergency food assistance Bush
ordered for the current fiscal year. Most of the food shipments will
come from U.S. surpluses.
   Poland has been affected by severe food shortages and increasing
prices.
   Bush had been under mounting pressure from Congress to do more to
aid Poland's new Solidarity-led government, not only from Democrats
but from Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Dole called Bush's decision Thursday ``a good investment in
democracy and political reform for Poland.''
   ``The president's original proposal was made at a time when
Poland, while taking some important steps in political reform, still
had a communist-dominated government,'' Dole said.
   ``It seemed important to me to signal our intent to do more for a
democratic government than we had for a communist regime,'' said
Dole, who visited Poland last month with his wife, Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   However, Leahy called Bush's plan ``a welcome but stopgap effort
that fails to give Poland the long-term help it needs to restructure
its agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest
democracy.''
   The Democrat's $2.5 billion rival program includes forgiveness of
Poland's $2 billion agricultural debt, $150 million in food
shipments, $100 million in foreign aid and a series of trade
concessions and other assistance.
   Bush called his Polish food aid package ``one element of our
continuing effort, working with our allies and others, to support
the process of change that is underway in Poland.''
   The overall $108.4 million food package _ which does not require
congressional approval _ is in addition to a $119 million plan of
economic assistance Bush announced in July when he visited Poland.
   ``We expect that shipments of the new (food) assistance will
arrive in time for the difficult winter months,'' he said in a
statement. He said high prices and food shortages have placed a
``heavy burden on the Polish people.''
   ``It is intended that the food aid will support long-term reform
of the Polish agricultural system by providing much needed
commodities during a transitional period toward a market economy,''
the president said.
   The package ``underscores our continuing commitment to assist the
Polish government and people in their efforts to introduce market
principles and to build a private sector that will enable Poland to
invigorate its economy,'' he continued.
   While the initial $50 million is mostly in food grants, the new
$50 million installment will be composed of direct shipments,
subsidized sales and some low-interest loans, administration
officials said.

<HEAD>Air Board Orders New Anti-Pollution Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Air Resources Board on Thursday
ordered that as of 1994, new cars in California must offer advanced
computerized systems to warn drivers about faulty automobile
equipment that causes pollution.
   The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a public
hearing crowded with more than 75 auto industry representatives and
environmental advocates.
   The advanced system, state officials said, would result in
quicker repairs of defective parts, leading to lower emissions of
smog-producing hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.
   Resulting reductions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would
amount to more than 100 tons a day apiece statewide, according to an
air board staff report.
   Almost half the reduction would be in the South Coast Air Basin,
which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, the area that suffers the most polluted air in the nation.
   The dashboard diagnostic system, which air board staff members
estimate could cost manufacturers $45 per vehicle, would have two
purposes: to improve air quality and to help mechanics repair
high-tech auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious
emissions.
   Air board engineering studies chief Steve Albu said it would have
a ``greater impact on emissions than any other single control
measure adopted by the board.''
   Among those supporting the new regulation were the South Coast
Air Quality Management District, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the American Lung Association and the Automobile Club of
Southern California.
   Engineers for major auto makers said they like the idea of
expanded on-board diagnostics but raised technical questions and
requested more time to devise the detection systems.
   ``Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology,
considerable lead-time is needed,'' said Suanne K. Thomas, a staff
scientist for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the
United States.
   She said the association urged that implementation be delayed
until the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 model
year.
   The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry group that
includes Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The state board,
however, decided to order the changes in 1994, with full compliance
ordered by 1996.
   ``In the state of California, we have to be aggressive,'' said
Jananne Sharpless, board chairman.
   Board member John Lagarias said the dashboard system would
provide for ``smart warning lights'' as opposed to current ``idiot
lights.''
   On-board monitor lights the air board ordered on new cars
beginning in 1988 warn drivers they need repairs only when basic
emission-related parts such as the fuel system fail to work.
   The new system will require improved monitoring of the fuel
system but also monitor engine misfiring, catalytic converter
efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air conditioning systems.
   The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data that
would help repairmen identify faulty equipment. It also calls for
standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool
so any repair shop can access the data in the vehicle computer.

   The Miss America Pageant is playing
down the swimsuit competition this year, but a competitor hopes to
draw viewers interested in more flesh.
   The Platinum Doll Bikini Contest, with comedian John Byner as
host, is one in a series of naughty contests that have sprung up
over the years to counter the pageant's wholesome image.
   Today's contest features 36 go-go girls from Florida, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and New York, said contest producer Neil Cirucci.
   Instead of the scholarship offered by the Miss America program,
the go-go girls will be competing for a $10,000 cash prize and the
``platinum G-string award,'' Cirucci said. The second-prize winner
gets $5,000 and third prize is $3,000. Fourth- and fifth-place
runners-up get trips to Mexico.
   The contestants were auditioned by the contest organizers _ not
selected in state ``pageants'' _ and no interview was required, he
said. No evening gowns in this contest _ a selection of costumes
will be stripped off to reveal halters and G-strings.
   ``We have one girl wearing a nun outfit, another who's a cowboy,
one who will be a nurse,'' he said.
   The winner will not be serenaded by ``There She Is'' but instead
will dance down the stage to ``a good rock 'n' roll band,'' Cirucci
said.
   ``We hope to steal some thunder away from the Miss America
Pageant,'' Cirucci said.
   Leonard Horn, director of the venerable Miss America Pageant,
which crowns Miss America on Saturday night, called the G-string
contest ``ludicrous'' and said it will not take away his audience.
   ``It doesn't mean a thing to us,'' he said. `It's somebody just
trying to exploit us, and it will not affect us at all.''
   Judges for the Platinum Doll Bikini Contest include former
Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Larry Christensen; Tony Bongiovi,
uncle of rock star Jon Bon Jovi and owner of a recording studio; and
Gennaro Meoli, a fashion designer for Frank Sinatra, Cirucci said.
   The G-string contest is not the first time a promoter has tried
to strip away some of the Miss America Pageant's luster. In the
1970s, several Miss Nude USA pageants were held the week before Miss
America.
   The G-string contest was to be held at a Boardwalk nightclub.

   The United States may be land of the free and
home of the brave, but it's also the country of the fat.
   A researcher on obesity says that 33 million adult Americans,
about 20 percent of the adult population, are significantly obese,
giving the United States one of the highest populations of fat
people in the world.
   ``It's clear that significant obesity appears to be more
prevalent in the United States than elsewhere,'' Dr. George A. Bray,
a professor of medicine at Louisiana State University, said Thursday.
   ``The greater the excess weight, the greater excess risk'' of
resulting health problems, he said.
   Obesity is a public health concern only in Europe and North
America, and the percentage of significantly overweight people is
highest by far in the United States, Bray said.
   The scientist said researchers don't know why there is a higher
percentage of fat adults in America than elsewhere, though he
suggests it could be because of the highly mechanized U.S.
civilization that makes it easy to avoid walking or climbing stairs.
   Bray says statistics suggest Americans are eating a better diet
now _ avoiding meats and other foods high in animal fats _ but the
number of significantly obese people ``continues to creep up.''
   The effects of excess weight is showing up in health studies that
show the obese are suffering more heart attacks, more high blood
pressure, more diabetes and more gall bladder disease.
   Being extremely fat, Bray said, is only slightly less of a health
risk than smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
   Bray, president-elect of the North American Association for the
Study of Obesity, said doctors consider significant obesity to be a
weight about 30 percent above what would be ideal for a person's
age, stature and gender.
   Thus, a man whose ideal weight is 170 to 180 pounds becomes
``significantly'' obese if his weight balloons to 221 to 234. At
that point, he becomes almost twice as likely to develop a
life-shortening ailment, Bray said.
   But numbers on the weight scale don't tell the full story.
   ``It's not just how fat you are, but where the fat is located,
that will determine your risk,'' said Bray.
   Researchers now believe that fat located within the abdominal
cavity poses a greater health hazard than does fat located in the
extremities or just under the skin.
   ``The reasons for this are not clear,'' said Bray. ``The most
widely accepted explanation is that when you've got more fat in your
belly around your organs, it is that fat that is released when you
eat fatty acids.''
   Because of its proximity, such fat is thought to go directly to
the liver, where ``it sets up risk factors that we associate with
heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and gall bladder disease,'' he
said.
   Adult men, said Bray, seem most at risk of developing this
unhealthy deposit of abdominal fat. Age also plays a factor, he
added, because few children or young adults develop this type of fat
deposit.
   ``For women, the visceral fat doesn't seem to increase until
there is a lot of total fat,'' he said. ``Women are protected
against visceral fat to some degree, for some reason.''
   Smoking affects visceral, or central, fat, said Bray, and
stopping smoking tends to cause this fat to disappear, even though
the former smoker may gain fat in other areas. Again, why this is so
is not well understood, but he said, ``this is another good reason
to stop smoking.''
   Another study elsewhere shows that American youth are becoming
more muscular, but also more sedentary _ a lifestyle that has made
them fatter and triggered an ``ominous'' loss of cardiovascular
health.
   A report by the Chrysler Fund-Amateur Athletic Union testing
program, which surveyed 12,000 youths from 1980 to 1989, said there
is no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups
studied and that weight gains can be attributed to poorer diet and
physical habits.

   The Senate's vote to halt smoking on all U.S.
airline flights leaves tobacco interests and advocates of the ban
jockeying over how severe the final version of the restrictions will
be.
   The Senate decided by voice vote to forbid cigarette smoking on
all domestic airline routes after routing an effort by tobacco
industry supporters to block the provision.
   Earlier, the Senate sent President Bush a separate measure
containing $225 million to begin construction of the government's
latest boon for Texas, the $5 billion super conducting supercollider.
   Final passage of the $11.9 billion transportation bill for fiscal
1990 containing the smoking restrictions was held up by a dispute
over unrelated anti-drug spending.
   But when that comes, the next step will be for Senate-House
negotiators to write compromise legislation that can be sent to
President Bush. The House last month approved a milder version of
the ban which would permanently bar smoking on flights of two hours
or shorter.
   Lobbyist Jo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of Flight
Attendants, one of several airline unions working for the total ban,
said lobbyists were trying to discern the leanings of lawmakers who
will negotiate on the measure.
   ``You can bet the ones who are unsure or leaning the other way
will be hearing from us over the next few days,'' she said.
   Spokesman Gary Miller of the cigarette industry's trade group,
the Tobacco Institute, said his side had not given up hope of toning
down the restrictions.
   ``It's not the law yet,'' he said. ``It's our positive outlook
that less extreme legislation will be the result'' of the
House-Senate bargaining.
   In the showdown 77-21 vote Thursday, senators forced a halt to
delaying tactics pro-smoking lawmakers had hoped would lead to
looser restrictions.
   ``We didn't undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat''
the proposed ban, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., who fought the proposal,
conceded.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who sponsored the ban proposal and
who cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airline
cabins, said, ``The American people are overwhelmingly in support of
this suspension of smoking on airliners.''
   The Senate version would extend the ban to all U.S. routes 95
days after the bill becomes law. Current restrictions prohibit
smoking on flights of two hours or less _ four-fifths of all routes
_ and will otherwise expire next April.
   Passengers caught smoking would be subject to $1,000 fines and
people found to have disabled smoke detectors in aircraft restrooms
would face penalties of up to $2,000.
   Opponents of the ban argued there is no proof that cigarette
fumes harm nonsmokers, and that the smoke is merely one of many
chemicals adrift in the recirculated air inside airliners. They
called on supporters to await a Transportation Department study on
airliner air quality expected by early next year.
   They also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers.
   But supporters cited several studies concluding that nonsmokers
risk cancer and other diseases by so-called passive smoking and said
there was no reason to wait for a total prohibition.
   The money for the Texas atom smasher was part of an $18.6 billion
energy and water measure approved on a voice vote. Bush, a Texas
resident, is expected to sign the bill.
   The circular, 53-mile-long supercollider is to be built 25 miles
south of Dallas. Scientists will use it to hurtle proton beams into
each other in a search for the basic building blocks of matter.
   The measure also contains $1.6 billion towards cleaning up the
nation's nuclear weapons plants, about 70 percent more than the $975
million provided this year and 27 percent more than Bush requested.
The overall task of removing radioactive waste from the facilities
has been estimated at $100 billion.

   No one would be caught outside in the upstate
New York winter without boots on, a state appeals court decided in
upholding the conviction of a man who kicked and injured another
person.
   Thomas Bidwell, who was convicted of assault with a dangerous
instrument, claimed there was no proof he was wearing shoes at the
time of the Dec. 29, 1984, fight in Binghamton.
   ``We disagree,'' said presiding Justice A. Franklin Mahoney of
the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in Thursday's
unanimous decision. ``The incident occurred at the end of December
and there was testimony that the temperature was cold, thereby
foreclosing the possibility that the attacker had bare feet.''
   The court also noted that Bidwell's brother testified that
Bidwell was wearing cowboy boots. The victim in the attack required
70 stitches, the court said.

   When Diane Kohutynski went to divorce court, the
key issue was visitation rights _ with the Moluccan cockatoo she and
her ex-husband had raised from a fledgling.
   ``It's a little weird, a little strange,'' she said in a
telephone interview Thursday. ``I walked into work and everybody was
laughing.''
   The couple has no children, but snowy white, orange-crested Magic
``is like a baby,'' said Ms. Kohutynski, 28, of Hickory Hills.
   ``He's very affectionate, very loving,'' she said of the $3,000
bird she has not seen in a year. ``He goes up on your arm and leans
against your shoulder for a hug.''
   The property settlement approved Wednesday requires her former
husband, Leroy Kohutynski, 28, of Palos Hills to allow her regular
visits with the bird.
   Her attorney, Norman Becker, told the judge that Kohutynski also
has agreed to execute an irrevocable will giving her possession of
Magic if he should die or decide he doesn't want the bird anymore.
   ``You want an irrevocable will on a bird?'' exclaimed Judge
Aubrey Kaplan.
   Magic, now 3, was less than 8 months old when the couple bought
him. Cockatoos can live more than 50 years.

   The hourly tolling of a church bell has
been a melodious tradition in this little farming community, but for
a couple that moved next door it's more like an all-night alarm
clock.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall, who bought their house next door to
the century-old clock last year, sued the town after the board of
selectmen declined to silence the clock between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
   The couple, who say the chiming ruins their sleep, lost their bid
for a preliminary injunction to silence the clock in April. But
Judge George C. Keady Jr. has said he will hear arguments on the
issue Oct. 5 in Hampshire Superior Court.
   Both sides have already made their case loud and clear. Richard
Carnall says he has given up trying to get to sleep before midnight,
when the bell tolls 12 times.
   And Dr. Donald B. Rogers of Northampton, who has prescribed
sleeping pills for Pamela Carnall, maintained in a letter to the
judge that the bell is ``affecting Mrs. Carnall's work and
well-being.''
   The Carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to the
bonging of the 1,800-pound bell on the First Congregational Church,
50 feet from their home.
   But Hatfield Town Counsel William O'Neil contended that the sound
of the bell is simply part of life in a New England village of 3,200
people. He said the Carnalls, both of whom were born and raised in
the area, should have noticed the bell tower and considered that
before buying the house.
   The selectmen contend the only previous complaint they ever
received about the bell was when it didn't sound. They said more
than 200 townsfolk signed petitions in support of the clock.

   Officials across Germany
struggling to house a crush of refugees have set up camping
trailers, commandeered school gymnasiums and even tried to persuade
new arrivals to go elsewhere.
   The East Germans are only the latest wave of refugees, who have
strained West Germany's social services and housing stock.
   More than 400,000 ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe are expected
this year alone; the number of East Germans will easily top previous
predictions of 100,000. In addition, tens of thousands of asylum
seekers from various countries arrive each year in West Germany,
already one of Europe's most densely populated countries.
   Social services and school and local budgets in many communities
already are stretched to the limit, and affordable housing is
increasingly rare in this country of 62 million people.
   The East Germans began arriving Monday when Hungary defied its
Warsaw Pact ally East Germany and allowed them to cross into Austria
en route to West Germany.
   By Thursday, at least 13,000 East Germans had arrived.
   ``I have full understanding for why they would especially like to
live in West Berlin, where they are closest to their homeland,'' the
city's mayor, Walter Momper, said Thursday.
   But he urged the new arrivals not to flood his city, saying it
already has cared for a disproportionately high number of other
refugees.
   ``People have more trouble finding housing and work here,''
Momper said in an address to the local parliament.
   He called on the federal government to solve the housing problem
as soon as possible for the East German refugees.
   ``Words about life in freedom don't fill up the stomach or put a
roof over anyone's head,'' he said.
   Most of the East Germans refugees are staying with friends and
relatives. Still, many have needed temporary shelter provided by
various West German states.
   Hamburg, for example, set up 60 camping trailers at a city camp
site.
   ``Trailers are better than tents,'' said Hamburg's social
services director, Ortwin Runde. ``They let the people have more
freedom, and they're better suited for the winter months.''
   In Wiesbaden, the No. 2 official of the Hesse state Social
Services Ministry said sports fans should not worry that local
school gymnasiums had been requisitioned as temporary shelters.
   ``They can be cleared out and used for sports again because the
majority of the newcomers have quickly gone on to friends and
relatives,'' Gerald Weiss said.
   Weiss said the centrally located state even planned to close 15
of the 20 emergency shelters now that the wave of East German
refugees apparently has peaked.
   Still, the long-term housing situation will remain a problem in a
country where families with two children live in two-bedroom
apartments measuring 120 square yards and often less.
   Many of the newcomers are young people in their 20s and 30s, and
many are families with young children.
   In Bonn, government spokesman Hans Klein said federal officials
will meet soon to map a housing strategy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked to Hear Challenge in Dalkon Shield Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of women has appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court to review A.H. Robins Co.'s reorganization plan and
its $2.5 billion settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield
birth-control device.
   The appeal was filed Thursday _ the deadline for opponents of the
Richmond-based company's bankruptcy reorganization plan to challenge
the plan to compensate about 195,000 women who claimed injuries from
the intrauterine device marketed by the company in the early 1970s.
   Douglas E. Bragg, a Denver attorney for more than 100 Dalkon
Shield appellants, said the $2.5 billion trust fund to pay claimants
is inadequate. He said full payment of claims could cost as much as
$7 billion.
   But the director of the Dalkon Shield Victims Association said
the appeal may cause some Dalkon claimants to wonder if they will
ever get paid.
   ``I'm worried mostly that women will lose heart,'' said Linda
Hightower. ``There have been so many delays. It's very difficult for
them to understand.''
   More than 94 percent of the claimants voted in favor of the
reorganization plan, confirmed by U.S. District Judge Robert R.
Merhige Jr. But about 900 women had rejected the plan, which was
upheld in June by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Alan B. Morrison, lead attorney for opponents of the
reorganization, said his clients object to the plan's prohibition on
the filing of separate lawsuits against Robins' corporate officers
and other third parties.
   But Ms. Hightower and company officials said the appeal will only
cause further delays.
   ``While I understand their reasoning it's very difficult to
explain when we have a good plan and most of these women have
already waited 18 years,'' Ms. Hightower said by telephone from her
home in Atlanta. ``I'm very upset by it because it means a delay to
all of the women.''
   Roscoe E. Puckett, a Robins spokesman, said the company also
regretted the appeal because it would delay compensation to
claimants. Puckett has said the trust could have been funded by
Sept. 28 if no further appeals had been filed.
   Robins has until Oct. 16 to file a response to the appeal with
the Supreme Court, after which the court will decide whether to
review the case.
   The reorganization plan was worked out over a three-year period
after Robins sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August
1985.
   The reorganization plan also included the acquisition of Robins,
through a $700 million exchange of stock, by the American Home
Products Corp. of New York.
   When Robins filed for protection, the company had settled about
two-thirds of approximately 15,000 lawsuits brought by women who
alleged injuries ranging from infections to sterility to miscarriage
from using the IUD.
   Under the reorganization plan, the $2.5 billion fund to pay
Dalkon Shield claims will be administered by trustees independent of
Robins. The plan also includes full payment to Robins' other
creditors.
   Pending a resolution of appeals, only $100 million of the trust
has been available to settle claims. As of this week, $52.8 million
had been paid to settle more than 81,000 claims, said Tom Morris, a
spokesman for the trust.

<TEXT>
   Brain scans can reveal a shrinkage in some tissue
that may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, even in people not
yet diagnosed, a new study suggests.
   The shrinkage appeared more frequently in Alzheimer's patients
and in people who were later diagnosed with the disease than in
other people, researchers reported.
   If further research confirms the result, scanning for the
abnormality may be useful as one step in diagnosing the disease,
study co-author Mony DeLeon said Thursday.
   The work is reported in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a British
medical journal, by DeLeon and colleagues at the New York University
Medical Center.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that attacks the
brain and impairs thinking, memory and behavior. It affects an
estimated 2.5 million American adults. No cause or cure is known.
   Researchers used a procedure involving computerized tomography,
an X-ray technique commonly called CT scanning, to study a portion
of the brain called the hippocampus.
   They examined 76 patients with mild to severe Alzheimer's, 27
with minimal age-related memory changes, and 72 normal volunteers,
all with an average age in their early 70's.
   Shrinkage in the hippocampus appeared in 87 percent of the
Alzheimer's group and 70 percent of those with mild memory
impairment, compared to 22 percent of the normal volunteers.
   Researchers also followed 20 patients with mild memory impairment
and 28 healthy people of similar ages. By three years later, 11 of
the subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Ten of them had shown
shrinkage in the hippocampus in the initial examination.
   Of the 37 people not diagnosed with Alzheimer's by three years
later, only seven had shown the hippocampus abnormality.
   Robert Terry of the University of California in San Diego said
results suggest the abnormality may help in diagnosis of
Alzheimer's, but because it also appears in normal people it cannot
be used by itself.
   DeLeon said the people who were not diagnosed with Alzheimer's
within three years may be at risk for developing outward symptoms
later.

<HEAD>Ag Department Defends Plan to Boost Wheat Plantings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity analysts in the Agriculture
Department believe wheat farmers won't go overboard in signing up
for a new option designed to boost 1990 production.
   The option announced this week by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter would let a farmer boost plantings by as much as 10 percent
from what otherwise would be allowed by the 1990 program.
   Yeutter said the increase is needed to help rebuild U.S. food
stockpiles, including a special ``food security reserve'' to meet
global food aid requirements.
   But some members of Congress fear production might rise more
sharply than USDA projects and push down market prices. And the
National Association of Wheat Growers has reservations about the
plan.
   William E. Penn, assistant deputy administrator for state and
county operations in the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, said the program contains ``some down sides''
that could discourage wheat farmers from planting too much wheat.
   The 1990 wheat program without the option calls for farmers to
idle 5 percent of their base acreage to qualify for price support
benefits. This ``acreage reserve'' program feature means farmers can
plant wheat on 95 percent of their base.
   With the option announced by Yeutter, producers can sign up to
plant wheat on more than 95 percent of their land _ up to 105
percent, or 10 percent more than they otherwise would be permitted
under the basic 1990 program.
   But Penn noted for ``every acre that you go over your normal
(base), you take an acre cut in the acres eligible for payment''
under the program's target-price formula.
   Another dampener, he said Thursday in a telephone interview, is
that the additional acres will not be counted as planting history
for the purpose of adjusting wheat bases in the future.
   ``So, if you plant 101 percent, you're not going to get credit
for that 1 percent as wheat for the purpose of calculating the base
for next year,'' Penn said.
   The signup for 1990 commodity programs will be held January 16
through April 13 at county ASCS offices, Penn said. Farmers will be
able to decide then whether to participate in the optional wheat
program.
   Meanwhile, wheat-state congressmen said the USDA's decision could
weaken prices and hurt producers in some regions.
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., whose state is the leading wheat
producer, said the move could send farmers ``back down the road of
low prices and overproduction.''
   Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., complained ``now is not the time to
gamble with wheat farmers' income.''
   Although the nation's wheat stockpiles have dropped because of
two years of drought, Roberts and Smith said USDA was overreacting
to the lower inventories.
   ``It's risky, very risky,'' said Smith. ``If increased crops do
not result in a significant price drop, then wheat farmers might
benefit. But that's assuming a lot. Basic laws of supply and demand
would dictate that the price could fall.''
   Roberts said the USDA option would come too late for some winter
wheat producers to alter their planting preparations, especially if
they had grown fall-harvested grain sorghum or soybeans after their
wheat crop failed earlier this year because of drought.
   Farmer are planting winter wheat now for harvest next year. It
accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. wheat total.
   ``Change for the sake of change to this degree is just going to
confuse farmers and irritate them, to say the least. And it's done
just that,'' said Roberts.
   The U.S. wheat carryover at the beginning of the current
marketing year on June 1 was about 694 million bushels, down from
1.261 billion bushels on June 1, 1988, and 1.821 billion bushels on
June 1, 1987.
   According to USDA projections, the carryover may be down to 494
million bushels by next June 1. Despite a larger harvest this year,
demand for wheat continues to outstrip production.
   Department analysts say the 1990 option is expected to boost the
acreage for harvest by 2.1 million acres to an estimated 69.6
million acres. As a result, they say, the 1990 harvest would rise
only 66 million bushels to 2.596 billion bushels.
   The National Association of Wheat Growers was less critical of
the USDA announcement, but association president Reggie Wyckoff said
U.S. export efforts should be stepped up if plantings increase.
   Producers ``want to be assured that they won't be caught holding
a mountain of surplus grain if this experiment fails,'' Wyckoff, a
Genoa, Colo., wheat farmer, said in a statement issued by the
association's Washington office.

   Hundreds of East German refugees have
driven into this country in a cloud of pollution from their tiny,
exhaust-belching cars.
   The East German Trabants have two cylinders and run on a mixture
of gasoline and oil.
   The cars do not meet West Germany's strict emission control laws,
and the environmental Green party says one should be put in a museum
with a sign: ``Forest Killer'' and the rest sent to the scrap heap.
   West German transportation officials have been issuing special
permits to allow the East Germans to drive the rickety
plastic-and-fiberglass cars.
   But the Greens object to a plan by the federal Transport Ministry
to give wholesale exemptions to the new drivers.
   Instead, they say the government should hand out annual federal
railway passes, worth about $4,000 each, in exchange for the
Trabants.
   ``We're going to have to come up with some imaginative solutions
to this problem,'' said Erhard Jauck, a spokesman for the Bavarian
Interior Ministry. East Germans typically wait more than 11 years
for a Trabant and more than 14 years for the larger Wartburg sedans
some refugees drive.
   But after they become established in West Germany, most refugees
probably will get rid of their cars.
   Some will do so for reasons other than pollution, however.
   West Berlin is surrounded by East German territory, and many of
the refugees who want to settle in the city are reluctant to drive
their car _ which still carry East German license plates _ 70 miles
across their homeland to reach West Berlin.

<HEAD>Hispanics Most Likely to Drop Out of School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The high school dropout rate for Hispanics is
nearing ``a national tragedy,'' says Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos who points to a new study showing dropout rates for other
students have fallen in the last decade.
   Cavazos said the study released Thursday by the National Center
for Education Statistics disputes the popular perception that
overall dropout rates have been rising.
   But he said statistics on Hispanics are troubling because they
show one-third of all Hispanics aged 16 to 24 were not enrolled in
school and were not high school graduates last year.
   The report, ``Dropout Rates in the United States: 1988,'' showed
4.4 percent of students in grades 10 through 12 dropped out of high
school annually in the years 1985-1988, down from 6.6 percent in
1978. Nearly 13 percent of all 16- to 24-year-olds were not in
school and had not completed school last year, down from 16 percent
in 1968.
   ``While the report shows some progress,'' Cavazos said, ``I find
much in it alarming. The nation cannot rest any easier based upon
our findings.
   ``As of 1988, 4.2 million young adults were without a high school
diploma. While overall rates may be down slightly, ... for our
Hispanic population, the dropout problem is a national tragedy.
One-third of Hispanic young adults were not high school graduates in
1988,'' said Cavazos, the first Hispanic to head the department.
   Overall, the dropout rates were 15 percent for whites, 22 percent
for blacks and 28 percent for Hispanics. The majority of dropouts
are whites, who accounted for 66 percent of all young adults without
diplomas.
   The dropout rates for American Indians and Alaskan natives were
35 percent, while those for Asian students were 8 percent.
   Cavazos said the ``glimmer of hope in the report is that the
disparity between white and black students has narrowed.'' The
report showed dropout rates for whites and blacks are similar when
individual and family backgrounds are taken into account, such as
the rates for blacks and whites living in central cities and those
living in suburbs.
   The center tracked a sample of students who were high school
sophomores in 1980 and found 17 percent had not graduated by 1982.
However, 46 percent of these dropouts had completed school by 1986.
   The study was required by the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and
Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988.

   Six topics will claim the attention of
President Bush and the nation's governors later this month at an
education summit that seeks to keep the school reform movement from
going ``the way of the hula hoop, twist and the Edsel.''
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton outlined the tentative agenda for the
summit Thursday and said the meetings slated for Sept. 27-28 in
Charlottesville, Va., must result in agreement on what children
should know before graduation.
   National performance targets or goals are essential to ``sustain
this education reform movement'' that started with the government's
1983 ``Nation at Risk'' report, which alerted the country to
schools' academic failures, Clinton told reporters.
   ``I wake up at night with a bad dream that the education reform
movement will go the way of the hula hoop, twist and the Edsel,'' he
said.
   Clinton, a Democrat, met with White House officials Wednesday,
along with South Carolina Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell, to
discuss the agenda and other details of the summit.
   Talks will focus on six topics that ``are broad enough to embrace
everything we need to discuss,'' Clinton said. The remaining dispute
is whether the meetings will be open.
   Clinton said the issues will include ``teaching as a
profession''; the learning environment of children, including the
special needs of the disadvantaged and drug-free schools;
restructuring schools, including ways to give parents and children
more options; ``lifelong learning,'' including adult literacy,
vocational and on-the-job training; higher education; and the
responsibilities of the various levels of government.
   ``I think it will be very interesting to see what will come out
of this in terms of specifics,'' said Clinton. ``But I wouldn't
minimize the importance of having a national set of performance
goals which the president embraces.''
   Clinton said he had not spoken to all of the governors about
setting national goals. But he said the idea ``has consistently been
our policy and I have no reason to believe they aren't'' in favor of
that approach.
   The White House officials, Clinton said, were ``pretty positive.''
   The Arkansas governor also is pushing to keep most of the summit
sessions open.
   Responding to reports that some governors are upset that the
working meetings will be closed, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the governors told the White House they wanted it
that way ``so they were free to tell (the president) what they
really thought.''
   ``The only sessions that are closed are the working sessions and
I think they prefer them that way,'' he said. Fitzwater promised
ample media access to the plenary sessions and ``press conferences
back-to-back every minute of the morning.''

<HEAD>Shipbuilder Says Destroyer is Ready to Launch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials and the manufacturer of the
Navy's new $1.2 billion destroyer are disputing charges the ship is
a ``procurement nightmare'' of cost overruns and schedule delays.
   ``The ship is ready in every respect to be launched,'' William E.
Haggett, chairman and chief executive officer of Bath Iron Works,
said Thursday.
   Haggett spoke after Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, wrote the Navy complaining the program is 18 months
behind schedule and the DDG-51 destroyer that Bath Iron Works will
launch Saturday is only 38 percent complete.
   ``The ship has suffered huge overruns, with the design costs
increasing by about 120 percent; and construction costs have
increased by more than 60 percent,'' Dingell said in a Sept. 12
letter to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III.
   Hailed as the world's most advanced surface combat ship, the
guided-missile destroyer is designed with a more expensive all-steel
superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone
to splintering and fire damage. It will be equipped with
sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   According to Dingell's letter, design costs have increased from
the original contract estimate of $111 million to $247 million and
construction costs have grown from $157 million to $252 million.
   A total of 760 change orders have been made, he said. One
involved the combat system and included 44 modifications to the
original ship design requiring revisions to 30 to 40 percent of the
ship's drawings.
   Dingell based his charges on a draft report from the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, which is
conducting an inquiry into the program. The GAO's final report is
expected later this year.
   ``The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement
nightmare,'' Dingell said in the letter.
   Haggett called Dingell's assessment a ``distortion of the overall
picture on the destroyer program'' and ``factually incorrect.'' Navy
Cmdr. Mark Baker said the service ``considers the program well under
control in both cost and schedule.''
   ``This launching represents the normal progression in the
construction, equipment activation and test plan. The remaining work
on the ship requires the ship to be afloat,'' Baker said in a
statement.
   According to Baker, the production schedule calls for the ship to
be delivered in February 1991. The original delivery date of October
1989 was changed due to a 99-day strike at Bath Iron Works in 1985,
a requirement of additional Navy testing of the combat system and
problems with computer-aided design.
   Haggett said the DDG-51 is ``47 to 51 percent complete, a higher
level than we launched our previous prototype ship.'' He disputed
Dingell's total of 760 change orders, saying the actual number is
less than 300.
   Haggett also questioned Dingell's claim that the company has
petitioned the Navy for an $85 million bailout or threatened to go
bankrupt. ``We repeatedly told the Navy that this company is
financially viable,'' Haggett said in a telephone interview from
Bath, Maine.
   Dingell also said Bath Iron Works, despite four years of work on
the design and construction of the destroyer, still has not supplied
the Navy with a validated design and production drawings.
   ``The design is in excellent condition. We have over 3,000
drawings,'' Haggett said.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials, played down the charges raised by Dingell.
   ``I don't see anything very scandalous,'' Bennett said in an
interview. ``It still will be the best ship of its class in the
world.''

<HEAD>Record Drug Seizures Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain last year made a record 38,000 drug
seizures and convicted a record 30,500 offenders, Home Secretary
Douglas Hurd said.
   The $13 million worth of drugs seized last year is nearly seven
times the $2 million total in 1987.
   Hurd said 94 percent of the increase was attributed to marijuana
seizures.
   The 700 pounds of cocaine seized last year is three times higher
than the 1986 level, although lower than the nearly 900 pounds
seized in 1987.
   ``This ... confirms the need for our action to choke off the
supply of this drug while maintaining our efforts to reduce demand
for it, particularly in the form of crack,'' Hurd said.
   The number of drug seizures in 1988 was 25 percent higher than in
1987, and the number of convictions for drug offenses was 16 percent
higher.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are some of the major
provisions of the bill approved late Thursday by the House Ways and
Means Committee.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAPITAL GAINS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits from the
selling of capital assets, such as real estate and stocks.
   Through the end of 1991, the current 33 percent top rate would be
reduced to 19.6 percent. The rate would then be raised to 28 percent
and the basis of assets ``indexed'' so that profit caused entirely
by inflation would not be taxed.
   The change is expected to bring the Treasury additional revenue
in the next three fiscal years _ $2.9 billion in fiscal 1990, $3.8
billion in fiscal 1991, and $2.7 billion in fiscal 1992 _ as people
take advantage of the lower rate and increase their capital activity.
   After the initial increase, the government's intake would drop
sharply with losses of more than $5 billion projected for fiscal
years 1993 and 1994.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CATASTROPHIC HEALTH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In response to complaints from the elderly, the bill would cut in
half the surtax paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees and
increase the flat monthly catastrophic premium paid by all but the
poorest Medicare beneficiaries.
   The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage
_ but only if they opt to drop out of Medicare Part B, the program
which pays physicians' fees.
   Aside from the catastrophic coverage, the bill would restrain
scheduled increases in payments to providers of Medicare services, a
spending cut of about $2.7 billion.
   It also would increase to $10,440 by 1991 the amount that a
Social Security recipient may earn without having benefits reduced.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHILD CARE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   An additional $16 billion in tax credits and state-administered
grants would be provided to lower-income families over the next five
years to help improve child care for working parents.
   The major change would liberalize the earned-income credit, which
benefits lower-income working families with children. The credit
would be worth more to larger families; it could range up to $1,790
a year for those with three or more children. A new credit of up to
$430 a year would help families with children under the age of 6.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CORPORATE TAXES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bill includes about $6.3 billion in net revenue increase for
fiscal 1990, including the capital gains cut.
   Significant among the others are repeal the completed-contract
method of accounting, by which big defense contractors may defer
taxes; eliminate special tax benefits for banks that lend money to
Employee Stock Ownership Plans, and end an interest break on big
banks' large loans to developing countries.
   The bill would also require companies to more quickly give the
government the payroll taxes they withhold from employees.
   The bill would effectively repeal a 1986 tax law provision, known
as Section 89, aimed at ensuring that employer-financed health plans
do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. Businesses
contended compliance with the law was an onerous burden.
   An amendment approved Thursday would extend the 25 percent
deduction for health insurance premiums paid by self-employed
workers, which was due to expire this year.
   That extension was tied a measure that would restrict refunds of
interest deductions related to leveraged buy-outs.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EXCISE TAXES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would cancel a scheduled reduction in the 8 percent tax
on airline tickets and 5 percent tax on air freight.
   The 3 percent federal tax on telephone service, which is
scheduled to expire at the end of next year, would be made permanent.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OZONE LAYER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would levy $4.3 billion in new taxes over the next five
years on profits of companies making ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The Bush administration sought the revenue-raising measure, which
targets windfall profits that chemical firms could earn after an
international treaty reduces supplies of chlorofluorocarbons. The
chemical industry denies there will be windfall profits.
   The so-called CFC's destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere
and increase risk of skin cancer. A similar provision is pending
before the Senate.

<HEAD>Congressional Black Caucus Celebrates its Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black members of Congress _ who in 20 years
have moved from outsiders demanding black power to insiders wielding
it _ are celebrating their successes this week while considering how
best to use a $2 million war chest.
   The money, much of it raised from corporate donors, was not on
the formal agenda for the Congressional Black Caucus' annual
``Legislative Weekend'' that opened Thursday and runs through
Saturday night.
   But it was a matter of behind-the-scenes debate among the 23
blacks who are members of Congress, as they were joined by thousands
of black political elite from around the country for the gala
fund-raiser, social event and policy discussion.
   Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a second-term Democrat representing Baltimore,
Md., who adopted an African name, said the 23 black members of
Congress are considering several proposals for spending the money.
Among them are to establish a think tank doing black-oriented
research, a recruitment center aimed at developing black political
candidates, and even a computerized library on African-American
culture.
   ``We ought to make ourselves more effective'' with the money,
Mfume said.
   A $300-a-plate black-tie dinner Saturday night is expected to
attract 4,000 guests, and more than 20,000 people will participate
in related events, including a black fashion show and numerous
parties.
   The Congressional Black Caucus is hosting the three-day session
at a time when black political leaders have successes to celebrate,
such as the victory in Tuesday's New York Democratic mayoral primary
of black candidate David Dinkins, and the candidacy in Virginia of
Democratic nominee Douglas Wilder, who seeks to become the first
black elected governor.
   Blacks in Congress are enjoying unprecedented power, too. Much of
it is the result of advances through the seniority system that
awards power to the most veteran members _ the same system that once
benefited white Southern conservatives who were re-elected with
little opposition time after time.
   Their numbers have grown since the Congressional Black Caucus was
formed in 1970, when there were 13 members. But more importantly,
caucus members now hold the chairmanships of five House committees
and 18 subcommittees, and young black newcomers are working their
way up some of the most influential congressional committees.
   ``The staying power of their members and the number of
chairmanships that they have make them an effective force,'' said
former Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma, who is white.
   One member, Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., has leapfrogged ahead,
serving last term as Budget Committee chairman and winning the House
Democrats' No. 3 leadership position this year as majority whip.
   The rise in power is limited to the House, however. The Senate
has no black members.
   The number of blacks in Congress has at least temporarily
declined with the death in an African plane crash last month of Rep.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas. Leland was mourned at several of the caucus'
opening events.
   President Bush earlier this year hosted the caucus at the White
House _ its first invitation there in eight years.
   In addition to the chance to discuss issues, members estimate
this year's Legislative Weekend event will raise $1 million for the
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a legally separate entity
with interlocking board members.
   With corporations donating sums of $50,000 in some cases, income
in recent years has exceeded spending on fellowships, internships
and scholarships, allowing the foundation to purchase its own
building and to accumulate a reserve of just over $2 million,
according to foundation financial records for the year ending Dec.
31, 1988.
   Another issue under debate by black members involves whether the
caucus should continue accepting large contributions to the
foundation from tobacco companies and liquor manufacturers, which
some members feel are contributing to health problems within the
black community. The caucus lists companies including Philip Morris,
RJR Nabisco, Anheuser-Busch, Courvoisier Cognac VSOP, Stroh Brewery
and Seagram Co. among its major contributors.

<HEAD>Broadcasters Oppose ESPN Exclusive Baseball Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadcasters are taking aim at the ESPN cable
network in a new campaign to preserve free, over-the-air televised
sports.
   Viewers ``are getting something now for free that in the future,
if the tide goes the way it has, they are going to have to pay
for,'' says Daniel Berkery, an executive of WSBK-TV, Boston.
   ESPN earlier this year snagged a four-year, $400 million contract
with Major League Baseball to carry games on Wednesday and Sunday
nights. Outraged broadcasters were shut out, and they said Thursday
they are going to fight _ on Capitol Hill if necessary.
   Television executives from stations with baseball broadcast
rights in 24 of the 26 Major League Baseball cities said they will
meet with ESPN and major league officials to demand access to
Wednesday and Sunday games, said John Serrao, chairman of the
Association of Independent Television Stations.
   ``An immediate effort will be made to seek the elimination of the
exclusive restrictions on the Wednesday and Sunday night
blackouts,'' Serrao said. ``These blackouts on free, over-the-air TV
are contrary to the public interest.''
   Local TV stations that already had contracted with individual
baseball teams to carry a certain number of games during the season
now have no access to Wednesdays and Sundays, the station executives
said. Meanwhile, regional cable sports networks can show the games,
the executives said.
   Local broadcasters have no legal recourse because Major League
Baseball agreements supersede contracts made by individual teams,
Berkery said.
   The same situation applies when college athletic conferences such
as the Big 10 and Pacific 10 make cable agreements that override
contracts between individual schools and local broadcasters, INTV
President Preston Padden said.
   Officials at the National Cable Television Association in
Washington were out of the office and not available for comment
Thursday. But the NCTA has said that local broadcasters are showing
40 percent more professional baseball games now than in 1975, and
that cable is not siphoning away free TV sports.
   Major League Baseball spokesman Richard Levin, reached by
telephone in Milwaukee where team owners are meeting, would not
comment on the broadcasters' allegations.
   The broadcasters said they will urge Congress to hold hearings
``to investigate the alarming siphoning of sports from free,
over-the-air television.''
   They said they were given assurances in meetings with Sens. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., and Al Gore, D-Tenn., that their concerns will be
heard on Capitol Hill.
   Gore told the broadcasters he will seek hearings this fall on his
bill to reregulate the cable TV industry and on other cable TV bills
now pending, Gore spokeswoman Marla Romash said later.
   ``One of Senator Gore's concerns is the flight of athletics from
free TV to pay TV,'' Romash said, noting that there is no pending
legislation that specifically addresses that issue.
   Gore is a member of the Senate Commerce communications
subcommittee, and Specter is on the Senate Judiciary antitrust,
monopolies and business rights subcommittee.
   Dan Craig, executive assistant to Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
chairman of the communications subcommittee, said, ``I don't see a
stand-alone (sports) hearing, but certainly during the cable
oversight hearings you're bound to get some hard questioning on the
migration of sports.''

<BYLINE>Critics Say Federal Study Denies Many Diabetics ^By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study in which expensive
orthopedic shoes will be bought for some diabetic Medicare patients
but not others is being criticized for jeopardizing health in the
name of medical economics.
   ``I consider it morally reprehensible'' to not provide the shoes
to some diabetics at high risk of foot amputations, said Stan Matek,
executive director of the New York State Podiatric Medical
Association.
   But project staff members say no one is being denied anything.
Rather, some Medicare recipients are getting something extra and
that the benefits of the study will reach all such patients, they
say.
   Under the study that began last month, Medicare is choosing
27,000 diabetic patients in New York, California and Florida who
have a high risk of hospitalization or amputation because of
circulatory problems in their feet. Half will be reimbursed for up
to $305 for a pair of therapeutic shoes or inserts, but the other
half will not, though they can still buy the footwear.
   The idea is to determine if the government would save money in
the long run by providing shoes to such patients.
   About 20,000 diabetics each year have parts of their legs and
feet removed. Many experts say specially-fitted shoes have been
shown to prevent the problems that lead to amputations.
   Matek said he finds it ``morally unacceptable to deny a
recognizably beneficial intervention to one out of every two people
at high risk for amputation.''
   And he says since Medicare patients in the study who are not
reimbursed can still buy the shoes, there's no point in doing a
cost-effectiveness comparison.
   But Judith Wooldridge, project director at Mathematica, a
Princeton, N.J., health policy study group commissioned by the
Health Care Financing Administration to do the study, dismisses the
ethical concerns as illogical.
   ``They interpret it as someone being denied something. But no one
is going to be denied anything. Some are going to receive something
extra,'' she said.
   The legislation that called for the study says the benefit will
not go into effect if the study shows money would not be saved in
the long run by paying for the shoes.
   Wooldridge and others in all likelihood therapeutic footwear for
diabetics will become a covered Medicare benefit, at least by 1993.
   The bill originally made the shoes a covered benefit but got
caught in the budget squeeze after the stock market crash in October
1987. Backers in Congress compromised to save the bill by calling
for a study to verify claims it would save $25 million a year by
avoiding costly hospitalizations and amputations.
   Sidney Trieger, director of the division of health systems and
special studies in HCFA's office of demonstrations, said, ``when
Congress says do a demonstration, that means there will be certain
people who get the benefit and certain people who don't.''
   About 2,500 podiatrists and other physicians in the three states
have expressed willingness to participate so far.
   Dr. Stephen Meritt, a Jacksonville, Fla., podiatrist who is
president of the Florida Podiatric Medical Association, said he will
participate in the study, though he is concerned patients who need
the shoes will hold off buying them until they find out whether
Medicare will pay for them.
   ``I'm going to recommend that they get the shoe'' regardless of
whether the government will pay, he said. ``I don't want my patients
waiting on the government. That could be hazardous, and that
concerns me.''

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Drug War Would Cost 22 States</HEAD>

   President Bush's plan to give states almost
$500 million to fight drugs will result in a net loss of federal
dollars in 22 states because of offsetting cuts in related programs,
a Democratic study group says.
   ``Each of the programs (being cut) deals in one way or another
with conditions in society which many experts argue are direct
contributing causes of drug abuse,'' the House of Representatives'
Democratic Study Group said Thursday.
   The group measured the total Bush said he would like to give
states for law enforcement and prevention and treatment against
losses in programs for immigration, economic development and
juvenile justice.
   According to the group, 43 states would lose federal assistance
equal to more than half their new drug fund allocation under the
Bush plan.
   Of those states, 22 would have losses exceeding estimated gains,
as would the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories, the
study said.
   The worst losses would be in California, where cuts would equal
nearly four times the amount of money received under the drug plan _
a net loss of $150 million.
   In Texas, cuts are expected to be twice as much, for a net loss
of $25.5 million, the study said. And in the District of Columbia
the cuts are expected to take about 70 percent more out of the
budget than the proposed new funding will put in, for a net loss of
$1.1 million, the study said.
   For the states, District of Columbia and the territories, the
total new spending is supposed to be $449 million under the Bush
plan, but the cuts in such programs as immigration, juvenile justice
and economic development will total $557 million, for a net loss of
$108 million, the study said.
   The study did not count the $50 million in Bush's proposal for
public housing programs because it comes out of an account already
earmarked for public housing. The funding request covers the 1990
fiscal year.

   The police chief of this city added his
voice to nationwide calls for a ban on assault weapons after a man
using an AK-47 rifle shot 20 former co-workers at a printing plant
before killing himself.
   ``You don't need these kinds of weapons unless you're a police
officer or a criminal,'' Police Chief Richard Dotson said at a news
conference where he held up the AK-47 and one of the two MAC-11
semiautomatic machine pistols used in Thursday's rampage.
   The gunman, Joseph T. Wesbecker, committed suicide after killing
seven and wounding 13 workers at the Standard Gravure Corp. where he
worked until a year ago.
   ``What do you need these for _ except for killing people?''
Dotson said.
   Police said Wesbecker also was armed with a .38-caliber handgun,
a 9mm Sig-Sauer pistol, and a bayonet that apparently fit the AK-47.
He carried several thousand rounds of ammunition.
   ``You've got to wonder whether these assault rifles ... should be
banned from the ability to purchase them within the confines of the
United States,'' said Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson, who was given
a tour through the carnage by police.
   ``I saw people in excruciating pain, with bodies strewn
throughout the three floors. The scene was like a Vietnam or World
War II.''
   A lobbyist for the National Rifle Association acknowledged the
massacre would put the organization in a more guarded position as it
attempts to deflect legislation to ban assault-style weapons.
   ``Any time there's a tragedy of this degree it's going to require
us to be responsive to increased concerns, but the bottom line issue
is the same: Would a gun law have stopped this kind of thing?'' said
Jim Baker, the lobbyist. ``We don't think so.''
   The Bush administration imposed an import ban on assault-type
rifles in July, but the ban didn't affect guns already owned by
Americans or similar weapons produced by U.S. companies.
   California in May became the first state to enact restrictions on
the possession or sale of the guns. The law was prompted by the
shooting of 35 people at a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunman
with an AK-47.
   ``How many more Louisville and Stockton massacres must happen
before our lawmakers have the courage to stand up to the gun
lobby?'' said Sarah Brady, chairwoman of the national Handgun
Control lobbying group.
   ``My heart goes out to the families of the victims of this
horrible tragedy in Louisville,'' she said in a news release. ``It's
too late for them, but we can prevent further massacres involving
assault weapons if Congress will approve pending legislation.''
   Mrs. Brady's husband, former White House press secretary James
Brady, was seriously injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Reagan.
   Ray Yeager, owner of Ray's Gun Shop in Louisville, said laws
regulating the sale of assault weapons such as the Soviet-designed
AK-47 are ``just about the same as it is in any state. It's the same
as buying a shotgun or any other type of rifle.''
   He said a customer wanting to purchase an AK-47 would have to
present a valid driver's license and fill out a federal form.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a measure that would
ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault-style weapons, five
already covered by the administration's import ban and four others
produced domestically.
   While providing up to 10 years additional prison time for those
convicted of crimes involving firearms, the law would go off the
books in three years under a ``sunset'' provision.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Wage Hike Opposed by Bush</HEAD>

   House Democrats are gearing up for another
battle with President Bush over the minimum wage, offering to accept
his $4.25 hourly floor but refusing Bush's call for a lower pay
scale for all new hires.
   The House Education and Labor Committee's labor standards
subcommittee on Thursday approved on a 7-4, party-line vote a plan
to raise the $3.35-an-hour wage floor by 45 cents this January and
by another 45 cents in January 1991.
   But the panel refused to expand provisions in a bill vetoed by
Bush in June that would allow employers to continue paying a $3.35
minimum only to people beginning their first job and only for the
first 60 days of their employment.
   Bush has said he would veto the bill again if it phases in the
increase to $4.25 in less than three years. He also insists that a
lower ``training wage'' be allowed for six months for any person
newly hired, regardless of their previous work experience.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in a letter to the panel
Wednesday to that the compromise offer put together by Chairman
Austin Murphy, D-Pa., with support from the AFL-CIO ``continues to
be unacceptable to the president, and would call for a veto.''
   Rep. Thomas E. Petri of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, said minimum wage advocates should accept the proposal
Bush offered in March ``and declare a victory.''
   Otherwise, said Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, there will only be
``continued deadlock.''
   Democrats, however, said the only concession they were willing to
make was reducing to $4.25 the $4.55 minimum in the bill that passed
Congress last spring and Bush vetoed.
   ``I'm not moving back one step further,'' said Rep. Carl Perkins,
D-Ky., noting the minimum wage has been frozen at $3.35 since 1981.
``I've seen too much given away for the sake of people who don't
care.''
   Perkins said Bush ``is not so much interested in the legislation
than he is trying to prove a point, and that saddens me.''
   On a 6-5 vote, with Murphy breaking away from his fellow
Democrats, the panel rejected an amendment by Bartlett to remove
overtime or minimum wage exemptions for some 30 different
classifications of workers.
   Among the exemptions _ which have worked their way into the law
over the past 50 years _ are fishermen, tobacco strippers, amusement
park workers, employees of newspapers with less than 4,000
circulation, radio and TV announcers in cities of less than 100,000,
laundry workers and domestic maids.
   While the idea intrigued many more Democrats, Rep. Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif., the full committee's chairman, called Bartlett's
proposal a ``killer'' amendment that would erode support for the
bill.
   The Education and Labor Committee is scheduled to take up the
legislation next Tuesday. Just before Congress recessed in August,
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee reapproved without
change the bill that Bush vetoed in June.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has said he
is willing to change it on the Senate floor to accommodate the
House's action or if a compromise can be struck with Bush.

   America's youngsters are suffering an
``ominous'' decline in cardiovascular health from poor eating
habits, inadequate physical training at school and their growing
preference for video games over the playground variety, according to
a decade-long study.
   An annual random sampling from the millions of boys and girls who
participated in the Chrysler Fund-Amateur Athletic Union's fitness
testing program shows a 10 percent decline in average scores for
distance runs _ the component measuring aerobic endurance, or heart
and lung strength.
   And, in the same 1980-89 period, there was also a major dropoff,
from 43 percent to 32 percent, in those who achieved at least
``satisfactory'' scores in the entire test, despite some improvement
in muscular strength.
   ``We've really got a problem here,'' said Wynn F. Updyke,
director of the Chrysler-sponsored AAU Physical Fitness Program,
which now enrolls 9.7 million youngsters aged 6 to 17.
   ``The cardiovascular trend is ominous, based on what we know
about the link between heart disease and inactivity and nutritional
bad habits,'' he said.
   At a news conference, Updyke, an associate dean at Indiana
University, cited a variety of causes for the poorer aerobic
showings, including less emphasis on physical training in the
schools. Only one state, Illinois, now requires physical education
for children in all grades, he noted.
   And ``technology, at best, has been a mixed blessing,'' he said,
because ``kids are saving their competitive instincts for Nintendo
and other computer games instead of kick-the-can and other physical
activity.''
   The program's printed report, based on a sample of 12,000
youngsters whose test scores were picked at random each year, also
applied the word ``ominous'' to the creeping weight gain observed
for most age groups over the decade. Children of all school ages, 6
to 17, were measured by the tests.
   There was no perceptible increase in height for the various age
groups, so the weight gains were attributed to poor dietary and
physical habits, it said. For example, girls aged 12 and 13 averaged
61.5 inches in height in both 1980 and 1989, but they were 9.2
pounds heavier, at 112, this year. Boys aged 14-17 actually were
more than an inch shorter, on average, this year _ at 5 feet 7{ _
but weighed nearly five pounds more, at 142.
   The program involves a battery of AAU tests dating to 1943,
though the report released Thursday was the first decade-long study
based on annual testing.
   For all age brackets, it consisted of an endurance run, pullups
(boys) or flexed arm hang (girls), a ``sit and reach'' test for
flexibility, regular situps and one of five optional events to
demonstrate motor skills _ long jump, sprint, shuttle run, modified
pushup, isometric pushup or isometric squat.
   The report said ``the best investment parents can make in the
physical fitness of their children is to insist on high quality
physical education programs in their schools.''
   Updyke rejected the notion that more time in the gym or on the
playground would cut into academic opportunities for children.
``Fitness makes you a greater accountant, a greater president of the
United States, a better anything,'' he said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Resettlement of Love Canal Threatens Symbol</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rally is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. EDT.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opponents of the planned resettlement of the
Love Canal neighborhood mostly cite health concerns, but they also
don't want to lose a national symbol of an environmental disaster,
an activist said.
   Eleven years after officials evacuated hundreds of families from
the Niagara Falls neighborhood when chemicals from a dump seeped
into homes, state health officials say people can move back into the
area after years of cleanup.
   Resettlement opponents, however, question whether the
neighborhood is safe. Hundreds of environmentalists and religious
activists plan to attend a rally in Albany tonight in hopes of
persuading Gov. Mario Cuomo to stop the planned resettlement.
   Lois Gibbs, the former Love Canal homemaker who became well-known
in the environmental movement after leading her former neighbors in
a fight for federal assistance, said she also doesn't want to lose
Love Canal's symbolic value.
   ``By making it habitable, it steals away the symbol from the
people,'' Gibbs said in an interview this week. ``Love Canal is a
symbol for problems across the country.''
   ``Anywhere I go in the country ... regardless of what people are
fighting, they refer to the damage created by that particular
facility as Love Canal,'' said Gibbs, who now works for the
Virginia-based Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. She is an
organizer for today's rally.
   Last fall, Dr. David Axelrod, the state health commissioner,
ruled that two-thirds of the Love Canal neighborhood was suitable
for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat the toxic
contamination from the dump site.
   Resettlement of the homes is scheduled for next year.
   Occidental Chemical Corp., owner of the former Hooker Chemical
and Plastic Co. which used Love Canal as a waste dump, acknowledges
that 20,000 tons of chemical wastes were dumped there in the 1940s
and 1950s.
   The dump was covered and the Niagara Falls School District bought
the land and built a school and playground there. Developers built
hundreds of homes nearby during the 1960s. Foul odors and oozing
chemicals were the first signs for residents that something was
wrong.
   The chemical contamination remains in a giant fenced mound at the
center of the neighborhood.
   Occidental declined to comment on today's rally.
   Today, about 70 homes in Love Canal are occupied by people who
chose not to leave when the neighborhood was declared a federal
emergency area in 1978. But the overriding image of the neighborhood
is one of block after block of bulldozed lawns and boarded-up tract
homes.
   The current residents hope that Cuomo won't stop the resettlement.
   ``We pray that this demonstration will not sway you or your
agencies' progress toward the remediation and resettlement of this
area,'' said a letter from a residents' group.
   Axelrod's conclusion was based on studies comparing levels of
toxics with those found in other areas of Niagara Falls.
   ``Based on what we know, people would not be exposed to any
higher risk there than they would be elsewhere in the greater
Niagara Falls community,'' said Peter Slocum, Axelrod's spokesman.
   A potential sticking point, however, is that scientists used a
``comparison standard'' for certain chemical levels in the
neighborhood ``because we don't have a better standard,'' Slocum
said.
   Gibbs and others fear that the levels used for comparison in Love
Canal will set a precedent.
   ``If they let people back in with those levels, then essentially
they are legalizing those levels,'' said Gibbs. ``That's a precedent
that we cannot allow.''

   Misgivings about U.S. policy toward Cambodia
have surfaced in Congress in anticipation of the promised withdrawal
of Vietnamese forces from the Southeast Asian country later this
month.
   Several Congressmen accused the Bush administration Thursday of
taking a weak stand at the recent international conference on
Cambodia against return of the Khmer Rouge, the communists accused
of causing more than a million Cambodian deaths during their 1975-78
``Killing Fields'' rule over Cambodia.
   ``Given the moral consequences of failure _ given the possibility
that the Khmer Rouge may return ... if there was ever an issue in
which consultation between the executive branch and congress is an
absolute necessity, this is the one,'' Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-NY,
told his House Asian-Pacific affairs subcommittee after a public
hearing on the issue.
   Spectators were then cleared from the room to enable a senior
State Department official to clarify in closed session the U.S.
strategy for blocking the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   The official, Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs, during the public debate blasted as
``grossly unfair and inaccurate, implications that somehow we are
trying to whitewash what happened during the 1970s'' in Cambodia.
   Solomon said he would have to dig into the records of the failed
Cambodian conference last month in Paris to provide concrete
evidence of the stand the United States took there against past
Khmer Route genocide. He said tactics for future dealings with the
Khmer Rouge could be explained only in closed session.
   The administration favors ``no role for the Khmer Rouge in a
future Cambodian government,'' but continues to support Cambodian
Prince Sihanouk and his desire to remain allied with the Khmer Rouge
in a four-party transition government, Solomon testified.
   In Paris, the United States agreed with Sihanouk, China and
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that the
Khmer Rouge could be better controlled if they were inside the new
regime, and that excluding them would be ``a sure formula'' for
civil war once the Vietnamese leave.
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., accused the administration of
publicly condemning the Khmer Rouge but remaining silent and taking
no action at working sessions.
   He charged that the Paris conference failed ``in large measure
because the Khmer Rouge and its international backers sought to
expunge from all official records any acknowledgment of their acts
of genocide,'' and the United States acquiesced.
   The U.S. position meant that ``we are clinging to the outmoded
policies and paranoia of the Vietnam War, but the war is over and
the world has changed. We are not able by sheer force and strong
will to create a Cambodian government that is absolutely to our
liking,'' Atkins said. ``If stopping the Khmer Rouge ``means taking
a fresh, more reasoned assessment of the successes of the
(Vietnam-installed) Hun Sen government, then so be it.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said the United States ``does not have
the luxury'' of avoiding such moral issues as Khmer Rouge
``genocide.'' He said Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot should be tried by
an international court for war crimes.
   Solomon said the Paris negotiations are in suspension and could
be resumed if progress appears likely after six months of
lower-level talks. He blamed failure to achieve a comprehensive
settlement at Paris on Vietnam and Hun Sen, head of the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia. They refused to
compromise on Sihanouk's four-party formula and sought to retain the
infrastructure of the Hun Sen government, giving it unfair advantage
in promised elections, he said.
   Sihanouk ``is not infallible ... he is capable of monumental
misjudgment,'' Solarz said. He recalled that the prince's alliance
with the Khmer Rouge in 1970 helped transform them from regional
guerrillas into a force that later overthrew a U.S.-backed
government.

   The gloomy and suspicious view Henry Kissinger
had toward Moscow lives on in the Bush administration 12 years after
he stepped down as secretary of state and as the Cold War recedes.
   Hundreds of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles are being junked,
Poland and Hungary are veering away from Marxist orthodoxy without
any apparent interference from the Kremlin, and next week the two
superpowers may announce a landmark agreement to open their chemical
weapons plants to each other.
   But before you break out the champagne and burn your blueprints
for an air raid shelter, consider what Lawrence Eagleburger, the
deputy secretary of state, had to say the other night at Georgetown
University.
   If he is right, the West had better keep its guard up. If he is
wrong, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev could be getting a more
cautious reception from the Bush administration than he deserves.
   Eagleburger, a foreign service officer who was close to
Kissinger, has had more than 30 years of experience to sharpen his
own perception of the Soviet Union and the NATO alliance, which was
created on the assumption Moscow menaced the West.
   His speech suggests that good news can be bad news. Even as
Gorbachev stakes out arms control agreements with the United States
and grafts some touches of capitalism to his creaking economy,
Eagleburger finds cause for being anxious about the West's future.
   He reminded his audience that the Soviet leader is no
anti-communist. ``He intends to make the Soviet Union as strong as
he possibly can,'' Eagleburger said.
   As Eagleburger left Gunston Hall, he found himself face-to-face
with Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to Washington. They smiled
and exchanged pleasantries. But the substance of Eagleburger's
speech was mostly hard-line.
   He found practical economic reasons for the cuts Gorbachev is
making in Soviet weapons and for slowing ``overseas adventurism.''
   And, Eagleburger warned, ``herein lies a danger to Western
interests _ that with the perception growing among the Western
public that the Soviet threat has diminished, there will be a
tendency among the member states of the NATO alliance to compete in
expanding their relationships with the East.''
   That, the senior U.S. official concluded, would be a mistake and
the Europeans should know better.
   ``After all,'' Eagleburger said, ``the Europeans are condemned by
geography to live in the shadow of Soviet military power whether or
not the Soviet Union in the long run changes as much as all of us
hope.''
   Kissinger, in his day, pursued as his primary foreign policy goal
countering and hopefully shrinking Soviet influence in Europe, the
Middle East and other regions where the two sides had not declared a
halt to their dangerous rivalry.
   The advent of Gorbachev in 1985 ushered in a period of economic
and political reform. Soviet troops left Afghanistan, barriers to
emigration were lowered and a ban on intermediate-range nuclear
missiles was reached with a card-carrying anti-communist, Ronald
Reagan.
   But Eagleburger says until those changes take root it would be
wise ``to avoid bankrolling merely cosmetic Soviet reforms or reach
arms control agreements which undermine NATO's ability to deter
aggression.''
   It is not clear how pervasive this view is within the Bush
administration. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will meet next week in
Jackson Hole, Wyo., to make preparations for a superpower summit.
   Eagleburger is by no means suggesting summits are a bad idea. But
he says the United States and the allies should go slow in making
deals with Moscow.
   ``We are hearing it said we need to take measures to ensure the
success of Gorbachev's reforms,'' the deputy secretary of state
said. ``This, however, is not the task of American foreign policy,
nor should it be that of our Western partners. Our task, after all,
is to devise policies which will serve our interests, whether
Gorbachev succeeds or fails.''

<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 7th graf to change `Friday' to `today'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Defense Department says the firing of a
California defense contractor will delay deployment of new Amraam
air-to-air missiles and force the Navy to take parts from old
missiles until a new supplier begins production.
   The Pentagon said Thursday it dropped Micronics International of
Brea, Calif., because of years of problems with an arming and safety
device on air-to-air missiles.
   The Pentagon withdrew its inspectors from the Micronics plant
near Los Angeles and the government no longer will accept delivery
of the safety and arming device, said Lt. Robert Fallon, a spokesman
for the Navy.
   ``There's no evidence that the safety and arming device has
caused any detrimental missile performance,'' the Navy said in a
statement. ``The Navy has a full inventory of missiles for its
operational forces to compensate for an expected stop in deliveries
of the safety and arming device.''
   The devices will be produced by Raymond Engineering in
Massachusetts, starting in 1991.
   The missile itself is built by the Hughes Aircraft unit of
General Motors Corp.
   The troubled device will cause problems with the Amraam, Sparrow
and Sidewinder missiles, The New York Times reported in today's
editions. The Amraam will not be installed aboard Navy F-15 and Air
Force F-18 fighters until new parts are secured from another source,
but production problems for the Sparrow and Sidewinder are expected
to be relatively minor.
   The arming device, roughly comparable to the safety on a gun, is
built into the missile's fuze to prevent premature firing of the
missile. It also prevents explosions in accidents, such as dropping
a warhead on a carrier deck, but allows the warhead to explode when
it hits a target after being fired.
   Limited production of the Phoenix missile began eight years ago,
but as late as three years ago the Navy disclosed it was not
deploying the weapon because of several problems, including the
arming device. In a ``tear-down'' inspection of the missile in
mid-1986, the Navy found 2,694 defects.
   Last year, the Los Angeles Times reported the Defense Department
was conducting a criminal investigation of Micronics, which was
suspected of using a production process that does not yield the
quality required by specifications for the arming device.
   The radar-guided Phoenix was designed for the F-14 fighter and is
supposed to be able to hit targets 100 miles away.

Manila, the Navy said today.
   The USS Beaufort, a salvage and rescue ship, arrived Thursday
with the Vietnamese after picking them up Monday about 150 miles
south of the Vietnamese coast, said a statement by the U.S. Navy's
7th Fleet.
   Navy officials said the 12 men, five women and 15 children were
in generally good condition and were turned over to Philippine
authorities.
   They were taken aboard the USS Beaufort because their 40-foot
vessel was unseaworthy and lacked navigation equipment and food, the
Navy said. It did not say what was wrong with the boat.
   A court-martial at Subic Bay in February convicted a captain of
dereliction of duty for failing to help Vietnamese in the South
China Sea who said they later resorted to cannibalism before being
rescued by Filipino fishermen.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Disputes Book's Claim He Broke His Word</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist says a new
book on Robert H. Bork's failed Supreme Court nomination incorrectly
says Rehnquist broke a promise to keep Justice Lewis F. Powell's
impending retirement a secret.
   Author Ethan Bronner, in his book, ``Battle for Justice,'' says
Powell told Rehnquist on June 25, 1987, that he would announce his
retirement the following day and asked for ``a solemn promise'' to
keep it a secret overnight.
   ``The chief justice expressed his sincere regret, agreed to keep
it to himself, and called (White House Chief of Staff Howard H.)
Baker with the news,'' the book said. It said Baker immediately told
President Reagan.
   ``That statement is in error,'' an angry Rehnquist said Thursday.
``I notified Howard Baker of the retirement shortly before we went
on the bench on the morning of Friday, June 26, 1987.''
   Bronner, however, stuck by his story and said his tape-recorded
interview with Baker supports his account of Rehnquist's action.
   Privately, Rehnquist has told people at the court that he is
offended by an account that portrays him as a man who cannot be
trusted to keep his word.

<NOTE>FDA Poised To Approve Wider Distribution Of AIDS Drug</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food and Drug Administration sources say they
expect a plan for wider distribution of a promising experimental
AIDS drug known as DDI to be approved shortly.
   Bristol-Myers Co., which is licensed to manufacture the drug, has
said it will distribute DDI, or dideoxyinosine, at no cost to AIDS
patients when the next round of clinical trials begins later this
month.
   Thus far, the drug has been available only to about 90 patients
in phase one clinical trials, the initial safety studies.
   The company has asked the FDA to approve distribution of the drug
to patients who do not qualify for the upcoming round of research
trials, which will compare DDI to AZT, the only approved anti-AIDS
drug. Patients who cannot tolerate AZT would be ineligible for these
trials. Scientists say DDI is less toxic and better tolerated by
patients than is AZT.
   FDA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday
no decision has been made on precisely who would be eligible to
receive the drug, though one source said it would include certain
patients outside clinical trials.
   Researchers say that like AZT, DDI appears to reduce replication
of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS and controls
the disease by enabling the body to recover some ability to fight
infection.

<NOTE>Number of Elected Hispanics Jumps But Proportion Remains Low</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Despite ``impressive'' gains at every level,
Hispanics still account for less than 1 percent of all elected
officials, according to a Latino advocacy group.
   The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials says 3,783 Hispanic elected officials hold office in 37
states, an increase of 12.6 percent from 1988.
   Texas leads the country, with 1,693 elected Hispanic officials
who account for 44.75 percent of the total, followed by New Mexico,
with 647 Hispanic elected officials who account for 17.1 percent of
the total, NALEO said in a study released Thursday.
   Despite their gains, elected Hispanic officials still account for
less than 1 percent of all elected officials nationwide, although
they make up 8 percent of the population, NALEO said.
   NALEO's 1989 roster found there are 10 Hispanic members of
Congress _ four from Texas, three from California, and one each from
New York, Florida and New Mexico.
   NALEO also said there are 128 state legislators, 1,340 school
board members, 1,178 municipal officials, 246 mayors, and one
governor _ Bob Martinez of Florida.

   Salvagers expect to stay offshore until
winter recovering gold worth as much as $1 billion from a steamship
that sank 132 years ago, an expedition spokesman said.
   Workers recently have begun raising gold bars and coins aboard
the SS Central America, a paddle-wheel steamer that was traveling
from Panama to New York on Sept. 12, 1857, when it sank during a
hurricane.
   The wreck, about 200 miles off the coast in 8,000 feet of water,
claimed 425 lives; 153 people survived.
   The golden booty includes fortunes made during the California
Gold Rush, said historian Judy Conrad of the Columbus America
Discovery Group, which located the wreck three years ago. The group
has 106 investors, mostly from Ohio.
   Barry Schatz, a project director for the expedition, called it
the largest American treasure trove ever.
   ``It sure beats working for a living,'' he quipped via
ship-to-shore telephone Thursday from aboard the recovery ship
Arctic Discoverer, which has been at the salvage site since July.
``What was really fun was putting together the project. It's kind of
scary to think beyond that.''
   The Central America was carrying a regular monthly shipment of
gold from the San Francisco Mint to New York banks via the Isthmus
of Panama.
   The estimated three tons of gold would be valued at up to $450
million in today's prices.
   In addition, riches belonging to passengers returning East after
making their fortunes in California appear to have been aboard the
ship, Schatz said.
   ``That billion-dollar estimate is probably the most frequently
heard figure on the treasure's value,'' said shipwreck expert E. Lee
Spence of Sullivan's Island.
   Historians originally believed the ship sank off North Carolina,
but research, based largely on newspaper accounts, led the Columbus
America group south.
   So far, about 500 pounds of gold has been recovered from the
site, Schatz said. The gold is being brought to the surface by an
underwater recovery vehicle equipped with video cameras and a
high-precision robotic arm.
   Gold bars, one weighing 62 pounds, rare `double eagle'' coins
valued at up to $20,000 each, and gold coins made by private
California mints and valued at up to $15,000 have been recovered,
said Pamela Adkins, a spokeswoman for the expedition.
   The expedition, which sailed out of Wilmington, N.C., in July
will stay at the site until winter.
   Schatz said the organizers believe they can recover all the gold
from the site but said it will be later this month before they have
a better idea as to how long that might take.
   Although the undisclosed location is a long way off the coast,
the wreckage is not completely undisturbed. The salvagers have found
both beer cans and garbage bags at the site, Schatz said.

   Anthony Figurski jumped out of bed and into
action when he awoke at midnight to find the house next door in
flames.
   ``I saw the fire and I just ran out of the house,'' Figurski
recalled. ``I reacted fast.''
   Wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt, Figurski jumped a fence and
climbed through Lelia B. Terry's bedroom window. He found the
77-year-old woman crouched against a door and carried her through
thick smoke to safety.
   Figurski, 30, of Sun City, Calif., was one of 16 Americans and
Canadians honored by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission Thursday for
risking their lives in an attempt to save others.
   The heroes, who receive a $2,500 cash award and a medal, bring to
79 the number honored this year and 7,367 recognized since
industrialist Andrew Carnegie established the commission in 1904.
   Figurski said he didn't think about the danger when he climbed
through Mrs. Terry's window and crawled across her bedroom on Oct.
6, 1988.
   ``I just knew she was in the house and somebody had to help
her,'' he said. ``There was nobody else around.''
   Mrs. Terry recovered following hospitalization. She died recently
of an unrelated illness. Figurski was treated for smoke inhalation.
   Also recognized Thursday were:

   Federal mine safety officials were meeting
with executives of the company that owns the Williams Station Mine
when an explosion and fire there killed 10 miners, an official said.
   The Mine Safety and Health Administration had been investigating
safety procedures at the mine for two or three weeks prior to the
blast, said Kathy Snyder, of the MSHA's nearby Madisonville office.
   It was not known if the investigation had any bearing on
Wednesday's methane gas explosion, about 1,000 feet underground in
the Pyro Mining Co.'s mine at nearby Wheatcroft.
   It was the nation's worst mine disaster in five years.
   One miner said he and co-workers had feared a methane gas
explosion for some time. The miner spoke on condition his name not
be used.
   ``It could have been worse,'' he said. ``I expected it to be
worse. It's the company's fault. It's the men's fault. It's
everybody's involvement.''
   ``We all had the same thought on our minds,'' he said. ``Somebody
is going to drop the ball. We're just thankful _ it's horrible, it's
awful _ that it was just 10 men.
   ``We all thought that when it wiped out, it was going to be all
of William Station,'' said the miner.
   Ed Calman, a spokesman for Pyro, said the company would have no
comment until an investigation expected to take several weeks is
completed.
   ``We want to find out what happened so we can take steps to make
sure it doesn't happen again,'' said Frank O'Gorman, an MSHA
spokesman in Arlington, Va.
   Autopsies on nine of 10 miners killed in the explosion indicated
they ``lived minutes at the maximum, probably more like seconds,''
before succumbing to superheated gases and carbon monoxide that were
products of the blast, the state medical examiner said Thursday.
   Nine miners died at the scene of smoke inhalation and the 10th
miner died a short time later at a hospital of carbon monoxide
inhalation, Dr. George Nichols said at a news conference.
   Nichols said there was no evidence of any disabling injuries to
anyone else at the mine, which employs 367 workers on three shifts.
   ``That indicates to me that the explosion caused a vast amount of
carbon monoxide to be formed but not a huge concussive type of
explosion,'' he said.
   The mine entrance remained closed and under guard Thursday.
   The accident claimed the highest death toll since 27 miners died
in a Utah coal mine on Dec. 19, 1984, O'Gorman said.

   A special session of the Azerbiajan Supreme Soviet
today discussed the ethnic conflict engulfing the ethnic Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass reported.
   The extraordinary session also was to examine draft legislation
on the Transcaucasian republic's sovereignty, citizenship and
economic independence, the official news agency said.
   ``The situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh has never been so
tense and explosive as today,'' Arkady Volskiy, head of a special
committee ordered by the Kremlin to administer the affairs of the
autonomous region, said in a television interview Thursday night.
   Tass said that for the first time, representatives of the
People's Front of Azerbaijan and other organizations were allowed to
attend the special session.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous territory with a predominantly
ethnic Armenian population and situated within Azerbaijan, is the
center of a bitter dispute between mainly Christian Armenia and
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan.
   About 100 people have died in the ethnic strife over the past 18
months and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.
   The People's Front is demanding that Azerbaijan reassert control
over Nagorno-Karabakh and that direct rule by Moscow be halted.
   Volskiy said Moscow was forced to assume control of the region
because of the bloodshed. ``The state cannot stay aside if blood is
spilled,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the newspaper Pravda reported that a strike by
Azerbaijani railroad workers to press demands for Azerbaijani
control of Nagorno-Karabakh cut vital fuel and other supplies to
neighboring Armenia.
   The situation was particularly threatening in northern Armenia,
where workers are trying to reconstruct cities devastated by the
Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people, Pravda said.

   A former nursing home aide charged
with suffocating five patients said she was tempted to ``smash
babies'' at a Texas hospital where she later worked, her alleged
co-conspirator testified.
   Catherine Wood, the prosecution's key witness, continued her
testimony Thursday in Kent County Circuit Court in the trial of her
former lover, Gwendolyn Graham. The trial resumes Monday.
   Graham, 25, is charged with five counts of first-degree murder
and one count of conspiracy to murder in the 1987 deaths of female
patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker, a suburb of Grand
Rapids.
   Wood, who has admitted helping Graham kill the patients, said she
and Graham sometimes talked by telephone after Graham moved to her
native Tyler, Texas, in July 1987 and began working at Mother
Frances Hospital as a nurse's aide.
   ``She told me she liked walking past the nursery and she wanted
to take one of (the babies) and smash it against the window,'' Wood
testified. ``I had to stop her somehow.''
   Her statements were made out of the presence of the jury after
the defense attorney objected.
   Bobbie Burks, a spokeswoman at Mother Frances, said by telephone
that there were no unusual occurrences or unexplained injuries at
the hospital while Graham was employed there between July 1987 and
October 1988. Graham didn't have access to the nursery and was fired
when the hospital found out she was being investigated in the Alpine
Manor deaths, Burks said.
   Wood, 27, has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder
and one count of conspiracy to murder and agreed to testify against
Graham. Two counts of first-degree murder were dropped.
   Wood testified she felt bad about the murders while they were
occurring but went along with Graham, sometimes acting as a lookout
while Graham smothered the patients with rolled-up washcloths.
   The two split in July 1987, after living together for nearly a
year, and Graham moved to Tyler with another nurse's aide.
   Defense attorney James Piazza said Wood made up the slayings
because she was hurt and angry that Graham had left her for another
woman.
   Dawn Male, a former nurse's aide at Alpine who said she had
sexual relationships with both Wood and Graham, testified Thursday
that Graham admitted suffocating a patient with a pillow while Wood
kept watch.
   When the five patients died between Jan. 18 and April 7, 1987,
their deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed.
Police began investigating after Wood's ex-husband told them she had
confessed to him.
   Kent County Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle testified Thursday he
performed autopsies on two patients whose bodies were exhumed in
November. He said he changed the cause of death on their death
certificates from heart disease to asphyxia due to suffocation,
primarily because of police reports.
   Cohle said he could find no physical evidence of suffocation, nor
could he find a physiological reason for their sudden deaths.
   The alleged victims were Belle Burkhard, 74, Marguerite Chambers,
60, Myrtle Luce, 95, Mae Mason, 79, and Edith Cook, 97.
   If convicted, Graham faces a mandatory life sentence. Wood could
receive parole in 10 years on the lesser charges.

   Israel fired a ballistic missile with an 800-mile
range that landed in the Mediterranean north of Libya, the official
news agency Tass reported.
   Officials in Jerusalem neither confirmed nor denied the report
Thursday.
   ``We know nothing about this thing,'' an official of the Israeli
Army Command said.
   Tass said Defense Ministry data showed the rocket blasted off
from the Jerusalem area and fell into the sea about 250 miles north
of Benghazi, Libya.
   It gave no further details but said Israel previously launched a
ballistic missile in January 1988.
   In Athens, officials from Greece's National Defense Ministry
refused comment on reports the missile landed in the sea west of
Crete.
   A ballistic missile is a long-range rocket guided by preset
mechanisms in the first part of its flight, but which becomes a
free-falling object as it approaches its target.
   The United States and Soviet Union have designed ballistic
missiles to carry nuclear warheads.
   Israel, which launched its first satellite last Sept. 19, has
consistently refused to comment on whether it is developing nuclear
weapons or missiles.
   In July 1987, Radio Moscow's Hebrew-language service accused
Israel of developing a nuclear-capable missile, reportedly called
the Jericho-II.
   The Geneva-based International Defense Review reported then that
Israel successfully fired a missile into the Mediterranean and that
it flew 520 miles. The missile's projected range was said to be as
much as 920 miles.
   Two years before the Soviet radio report, the British magazine
New Statesman reported that Israel had deployed nuclear-armed
Jericho-II missiles in its southern Negev desert.

   Miss Illinois, winner of a Miss
America swimsuit preliminary, said she trained for the event on
foods ``fattening, sweet and full of junk.''
   The 21-year-old Jeri Lynn Zimmermann of Chicago laughed off any
suggestion that she had dieted for the pageant, saying that dinner
Thursday included ``french fries and Boston clam chowder.''
   Miss Zimmermann, who has light brown hair and blue eyes, stands
5-feet-8 and weighs 115 pounds, wore a teal blue ``supersuit'' made
of a heavy material that enhances prominent features.
   A senior at Northwestern University majoring in theater, Miss
Zimmermann said she stays in shape by swimming, skiing, jogging,
playing volleyball and training with weights.
   Miss South Carolina, Kimilee Karyn Bryant of Greenville, S.C.,
sang a classical vocal titled ``Je Suis Titania'' to take the talent
portion.
   Miss Bryant received a music performance degree in 1988 from
Converse College and is now in her second year of graduate studies
in vocal performance at the Manhattan School of Music.
   The brunette with blue-green eyes wore a red chiffon
Victorian-period gown with a bustled back and trimmed with chunk
jewels and crystals. She carried a wand and wore a tiara to complete
the ``fairy godmother'' look.
   Thursday's competition was the last of three nights of swimsuit,
talent and evening gown rounds. The preliminary evening gown winners
are kept secret to heighten the suspense for the finals of the Miss
America Pageant on Saturday.
   The contestants participate tonight in the Miss America Parade on
the resort's Boardwalk.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will become the top 10
finalists. Those 10 will start with a clean slate Saturday night,
competing to succeed Miss America 1989, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   The judging has been revised this year to diminish the importance
of the contestants' figures. Talent counts for 40 percent, the
interview for 30 percent, and the evening gown and swimsuit
divisions count for 15 percent each.
   Miss Missouri Debbye Turner wore a canary yellow swimsuit to win
Tuesday's preliminary contest, while Miss Ohio Kristin Huffman won
the talent division with a classical vocal piece titled ``Csardas.''
   At Wednesday night's preliminary, Miss Louisiana Stacy King won
the swimsuit contest in a white swimsuit with spaghetti straps at
the shoulders. Miss Oklahoma Tamara Denise Toshiko Marler won the
talent division with a romantic rendition of ``Since I Fell For
You.''
   The 63rd annual Miss America Pageant will air on NBC-TV at 10
p.m. EDT Saturday. Gary Collins and Miss America 1971 Phyllis George
Brown will be hosts.

   Mother Teresa had a restful sleep but
heavy doses of antibiotics failed to bring down a recurring fever
that could complicate her heart problems, a hospital official said
today.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace
Prize for her charity work, suffered a serious setback Thursday just
as doctors thought she was progressing well after a heart attack
last week.
   But a statement issued today by Woodlands Nursing Home, the
hospital where she is being treated, indicated Mother Teresa's
condition improved slightly.
   ``The mother is still running a temperature and the cause of the
infection is being investigated. There was no chest pain last night.
She has taken normal food this morning and now resting peacefully,''
the statement said.
   A senior physician, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mother Teresa's condition could have worsened Thursday because too
many doctors want to treat her and too many people want to see her.
   ``Everyone is so concerned with giving their attendance at the
hospital. They aren't really concerned how much each visit sets her
back,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited her. The
prime minister's security staff was present and a television crew
was permitted to film the 10-minute chat.
   ``What can the hospital management do if the prime minister, the
chief minister (of West Bengal state), the health minister and other
dignitaries keep coming to visit?'' said the doctor.
   He said the case had become so high profile, with so many doctors
attending Mother Teresa, that coordination of treatment had become a
problem.
   Doctors said she had sharp chest pains early Thursday and then
again in the afternoon.
   ``Mother Teresa has had a setback,'' Dr. K.K. Sinha, a
cardiologist and one of her five doctors, said Thursday night.
``There is a heaviness in the chest. This is very serious.''
   Sinha described the problem as a ``free infarction,'' which
appeared to mean a form of heart attack. An infarction refers to an
area of dying or dead tissue resulting from the obstruction of blood
vessels. A myocardial infarction, which is death of a section of
heart muscle, is a heart attack.
   ``Very aggressive treatment is needed,'' he said. ``All
medication has been given but she is allergic to some medicine.''
   Dozens of people of all faiths waited outside the hospital, some
kneeling at the gate to offer prayers. Bouquets of flowers sent from
well-wishers around the world were delivered to the home.
   Mother Teresa suffered a heart attack Sept. 8, three days after
she was admitted to the intensive care unit with an irregular
heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever.
   Doctors said her condition progressively improved after they
attached a temporary pacemaker and changed her medication. They had
hoped to remove the pacemaker by the end of the week, but her
condition deteriorated early Thursday.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable life as a
convent teacher to live and work among the destitute and dying in
Calcutta's squalid slums.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned run-down hostel donated by the city. The order, which was
formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has
3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

   Valentina Nicholaevna Sanina Schlee, designer of
clothes for Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn and other theater greats
and socialites from the 1920s through the '50s, has died of
Parkinson's disease. She was 90.
   Valentina, known by her first name, died Thursday at her
Manhattan home.
   Known for such maxims as ``Mink is for football,'' and ``Ermine
is for bathrobes,'' Valentina also dressed Mary Martin, Gloria
Swanson, Gertrude Lawrence, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and
Norma Shearer.
   The designer was a master publicist, wearing her own clothes with
a style that led other women to covet them.
   ``She made many wonderful clothes, but nobody looked as well in
them as she did,'' said Bill Blass, who made some dresses for
Valentina in 1970.
   Born in Kiev, Valentina was studying drama in Kharkov when the
Revolution broke out. She met her husband, George Schlee, in the
Sevastopol railroad station as she was trying to leave the country
with her family's jewels. He protected her as they fled.
   After briefly living in Athens, Rome and Paris, they came to the
United States in 1923 and became prominent in New York cafe society.
   With her husband's support, Valentina opened a shop stocked with
13 of her own dresses on Madison Avenue in 1928. In 1933 she
established her reputation as a theater costume designer. She closed
her business in the late 1950s.
   Schlee, a financier, was his wife's business partner and an
adviser to Garbo. He died in 1974.
   Valentina is survived by a nephew and two grand nieces.

<HEAD>Showers, Dense Fog in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain that fell over parts of the Northeast was accompanied
early today by dense fog, while scattered showers and thunderstorms
dampened an area from the central Gulf coast to the mid-Atlantic
states.
   Fog also blanketed sections of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. Cloudy
skies lingered from the lower Ohio Valley and the middle Mississippi
Valley to the western Gulf coast, but clear skies prevailed across
much of the rest of the nation.
   The upper Great Lakes region, upper Mississippi Valley and
northern Rockies were chilly early today, with temperatures in the
30s and 40s.
   Hurricane Hugo today moved slowly toward the Caribbean, packing
115 mph winds late Thursday, and hurricane forecasters warned
islanders to prepare for heavy winds and rain, which should begin
within the next 48 hours.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the East Coast across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the
middle Mississippi Valley, with the most rainfall from New England
across the Appalachians to the Ohio Valley; and widely scattered
thunderstorms over California.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s from northern New England across the
Great Lakes region to Missouri, and over portions of the Pacific
Coast; into the 90s over Florida and interior valleys of California;
between 100 and 105 degrees in the desert Southwest; and in the 70s
and 80s over much of the rest of the country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 84 degrees at Phoenix and
Yuma, Ariz.

   Daily News Editor Gil Spencer has resigned and
will be succeeded by Managing Editor James Willse, the newspaper
announced.
   ``Gil Spencer and Jim Willse have worked as a team to expand and
invigorate the Daily News,'' Publisher James Hoge said in a
statement Thursday. ``We are indebted to Gil for his vital
leadership and pleased that Jim will take the good work forward.''
   Spencer, 64, a 1974 Pulitzer Prize winner for editorial writing,
resigned effective immediately and plans to write and possibly to
teach.
   He came to the News five years ago from the Philadelphia Daily
News, where he also was editor.
   ``I'll miss this newspaper terribly,'' Spencer said. ``And I'll
miss the people I worked with, sane and insane. I'll miss them and I
owe them.''
   Spencer, a Philadelphia native, has been in the newspaper
business for 42 years.
   He started as an office assistant on the Philadelphia Inquirer.
He worked on several suburban newspapers, at the Philadelphia
Bulletin and The Trentonian before joining the Philadelphia Daily
News in 1975.
   Willse, 45, joined the Daily News in 1984 as vice president and
managing editor. He came from the San Francisco Examiner, where he
also served as managing editor.
   He previously worked for The Associated Press, as the news editor
in San Francisco and as a national editor in New York.
   Willse, a native of New York, is the son of a New York City

<HEAD>After Ethiopian Talks, Next Stop for Carter: Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, fresh from
sponsoring talks to end a rebellion in Ethiopia, is off to Nicaragua
to prepare for elections that could lead to a definitive end to that
country's war.
   Carter, whose activities in Panama and Africa this year have
given him a more visible role in world affairs than at any time
since he left the White House in 1981, will use the visit to prepare
for his role as an observer of Nicaragua's Feb. 25 presidential
elections.
   Peace talks that began Sept. 7 between the Ethiopian government
and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front at The Carter Center may
conclude today or adjourn until Tuesday, when Carter returns from
Nicaragua, said center spokeswoman Carrie Harmon.
   Acting as a private citizen, though with the blessing of
Washington, Carter has used his public policy facility and think
tank as a force to boost talks to end various regional conflicts.
   In Nicaragua, as in Panama, Carter will be representing the
Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government, a group of current
and former democratically elected chiefs of state.
   Carter was an observer at the May elections in Panama.
Afterwards, his accusations of fraud against de-facto military
leader Gen. Manuel Noriega received widespread attention.
   Over the past two weeks, Carter has served as host and observer
for preliminary discussions aimed at setting an agenda for talks to
end the 28-year-old war between Ethiopia and the Eritrean rebels in
the Horn of Africa.
   ``I think I can say without contradiction from Washington that
they do indeed support my trip to Nicaragua,'' Carter told reporters
in a briefing during the Ethiopian talks. ``But I will emphasize
again, this is not a duty designated to me by the Bush
administration.''
   Harmon said Carter's visit this weekend will include meetings
with members of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Board, government
officials, opposition leaders and representatives of church and
civic groups.
   President Daniel Ortega is expected to run for re-election in
election against Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the director of the
opposition newspaper La Prensa and candidate of the 14-party
opposition coalition.
   Carter said his continued involvement in world matters is being
conducted by a concerned citizen, not by a man interested in
resurrecting a political career.
   ``You know, I've got a lot of things I could be doing,'' Carter
told reporters last week, using the Ethiopia-Eritrea talks as an
example. ``And I don't have any personal thing to gain from spending
days or weeks or whatever trying to bring peace to the people of
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
   ``But I look upon this as one of the most terrible conflicts in
the world, and the fact that both sides are at least going to have
good-faith negotiations has already been proven to me ... and I
think warrants my investment of time,'' Carter said.

<TEXT>
   Military officials are
trying to pinpoint the malfunction that forced the destruction of an
MX missile making the system's first test as an operational weapon
system.
   The MX missile was destroyed three minutes into flight Thursday,
the third failure in a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles since
March.
   ``A team of Air Force and Department of Defense contractor
engineers is analyzing data from the flight to analyze the cause of
the anomaly,'' said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ernest Dawson. ``After they
have complete their tests, the Air Force will determine if any
system modifications are necessary to correct or improve the
Peacekeeper weapon system.''
   The $75 million MX was destroyed by a signal sent by Western Test
Range safety officers after telemetry indicated a problem aboard the
four-stage intercontinental ballistic missile.
   The launch was under control of a 44-person task force from F.E.
Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming and overseen by Lt. Col. Robert Cook,
commander of the 90th Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron.
   Fifty MX missiles are deployed at Warren, located near Cheyenne.
   Three MX missiles were scheduled to undergo similar tests next
year. It was not immediately known how or if Thursday's missile
failure might affect that schedule.
   It was the MX system's first operational test under the Strategic
Air Command. Nine dummy re-entry vehicle warheads were to be
delivered to various targets 4,700 miles to the southwest in the
Kwajalein Missile Range. The MX is capable of carrying 10 warheads.
   Eighteen previous tests of the MX, or so-called Peacekeeper
missile, were termed developmental. Thursday's was the first that
had to be destroyed.
   In March, the Navy's newest and most powerful weapon, a $23.7
million Trident 2 missile, was destroyed seconds after an undersea
launch from a submarine off the Florida coast. The missile spun
wildly before destruction.
   The first launch of the Air Force's Midgetman missile in May
ended in failure when it began tumbling 70 seconds into flight.

   Residents rushed back to basement bomb
shelters today when Syrian and Christian gunners shelled the city
hours after Arab League mediators concluded talks aimed at ending
the fighting.
   Police said five people were killed and seven wounded in the
exchanges, which occurred residential districts in the city's Moslem
and Christian sectors as well as the wooded mountains southeast of
the capital.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to 900 killed and 2,559
wounded since March 8, when the current round of violence broke out
pitting Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian troops against Syrian
and allied forces.
   The duel started shortly after the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria ended two days of talks in the Saudi Red
Sea port of Jiddah late Thursday without issuing a cease-fire call.
   The three ministers, in a brief statement, said only that they
conducted a ``necessary evaluation'' of the situation in Lebanon and
considered the possibility of new moves.
   The statement said King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of
Morocco and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid will release an
official statement Saturday about the outcome of the committee's
efforts.
   The Syrian-Christian duel forced the few citizens remaining in
Beirut to rush to basements and underground shelters to escape the
barrage, shattering hopes that a relative lull in the fighting would
continue.
   The exchanges had sharply diminished Thursday and Wednesday while
the Arab League members met. Local newspapers had predicted a
cease-fire in the confrontation between Aoun's 20,000 soldiers and
the 40,000 Syrian troops.
   ``We were under the impression that this (shelling) was over, at
least for the time being,'' said Rashid Makkouk, a Sunni Moslem
resident of west Beirut's Bourj Abu Haidar district.
   After hearing the talks produced no agreement, Makkouk said at
the entrance to his shell-scarred apartment building, ``I was
wondering whether we should return to the shelter when the explosion
of the first shell echoed. We rushed down.''
   The shelling began in March over a blockade by Aoun of illegal
ports run by Syria's militia allies south of Beirut. Aoun sought to
reimpose government control on the ports.
   Syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling and besieging the
310-square-mile Christian enclave, Aoun's power base northeast of
Beirut.

   A genetically engineered vaccine that protects
monkeys against an AIDS-like virus could help in the search for a
way to shield humans from AIDS, says a developer of the vaccine.
   The findings ``offer hope that similar methodologies might lead
to an effective vaccine against AIDS in humans,'' Shiu-Lok Hu,
leader of the team that tested the vaccine, said Thursday.
   But he cautioned that the monkey virus differs from the humans
AIDS virus and that there were no immediate implications for AIDS
patients.
   The virus, simian acquired immunodeficiency virus type D, or
SAIDS D, is an often-fatal, AIDS-like disease in monkeys, Hu said.
   The research team including scientists of the University of
Washington, the National Cancer Institute and Oncogen, a Seattle
biotechnology company, announced their findings at a news conference
at the university's Health Sciences Center. The results of their
year-long study will be reported in this month's Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
   Four vaccinated macaque monkeys exposed to the SAIDS D virus have
remained healthy and free of the virus, while three of four
unvaccinated monkeys in the study developed signs of infection
within two weeks after exposure to the virus.
   ``We believe this is the first live, recombinant vaccine that
protects primates against a retrovirus that causes AIDS-like
diseases,'' said William Morton, supervisory veterinarian at the
University of Washington's Regional Primate Research Center and an
author of the paper.
   The fourth unvaccinated animal did not become infected,
consistent with reports showing that for undetermined reasons some
monkeys are resistant to infection, the scientists said.
   The genetically constructed vaccine, called ``v-senv5,'' combines
part of the protein coat of the SAIDS D virus with the vaccinia
virus, which has been used successfully to eradicate smallpox.
   The four vaccinated monkeys received two immunizations 16 weeks
apart. Twelve weeks after the second immunizations, all eight
animals in the study, including the four non-vaccinated monkeys,
were exposed to the SAIDS D virus.
   The four vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the specific
proteins used in the vaccine, proving that the monkey's immune
response was triggered by the vaccine and not by exposure to the
SAIDS D virus itself, the researchers said.
   Last month, Harvard University researchers working with monkeys
reported they had protected monkeys from a similar simian AIDS
virus. In that study, the monkeys were given a killed-virus vaccine
rather than a live, recombinant vaccine, said Hu, director of
vaccine research at Oncogen.
   Hu said the live virus vaccine ``elicits an immune response more
closely akin to that obtained from a natural infection.''
   Hu stressed that both approaches were important and could be used
in efforts to develop a vaccine against AIDS.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy was arrested and
accused of a series of sexual assualts on his playmates who range in
age from 4 to 10, police said.
   The youth was taken into custody Aug. 21 after an interview with
Sgt. Phil Zaragossa, who said the boy first denied allegations of
attacks on two boys and two girls at his Santa Clara apartment
complex, authorities said.
   ``Then, he makes a few slips and leads me to believe he does know
what's going on,'' the officer said. ``Finally, he admitted to
sodomy. He starts to cry and asks if he's going to jail.''
   The child was emotionless while describing the assaults that
allegedly occurred in parking stalls and in a laundry room starting
in May, and said he learned about sodomy from pornographic
magazines, police said.
   The boy was taken to Santa Clara Juvenile Center after his
arrest, and later released to a female friend of his mother's on the
condition that he see a counselor daily and not associate with his
alleged victims, police said.
   If the youngster is convicted of sexually attacking his friends,
he could spend up to eight years in court custody for each criminal
count. He could be placed in a group home or treatment facility, or
released to his mother with a requirement that he receive more
counseling.
   No court date was set.
   ``I don't know if it's that kids don't know that it's wrong or
that it's the type of environment they're in,'' said Deputy District
Attorney Cynthia Sevely, who will prosecute the case.
   Zaragossa said he wasn't particularly shocked by the allegations.
   ``There are a lot more incidents like these being committed,'' he
said. ``Everybody wants to close their eyes and turn their head if
they hear about it.''
   Of the 27 juveniles with hearings pending in Santa Clara County
for sex-related crimes, this youth is by far the youngest, officials
said.

   Pakistan will rejoin the British
Commonwealth next month after a 17-year absence and will attend next
month's annual meeting here, Commonwealth Secretary-General Sir
Shridath Ramphal said today.
   Ramphal said in a statement that at Pakistan's request he carried
out consultations over the past few months with member states of the
London-based Commonwealth, which includes Britain and its former
colonies.
   ``The Commonwealth had responded with unanimity to the wish of
the democratically elected government of Pakistan to rejoin the
Commonwealth,'' the statement quoted him as saying, referring to the
election of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December that ended 11
years of military rule.
   It was Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
who in 1972 pulled the country out of the Commonwealth when members
Britain, Canada and Australia recognized the breakaway state of
Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan. Pakistan hinted it wanted to
rejoin the Commonwealth in the early 1980s, Commonwealth sources
say. But the question was shelved because India, which sided with
Bangladesh in its fight for independence, did not express support.
   However, India indicated after Ms. Bhutto's election as prime
minister that it would have no objection.
   Beginning Oct. 1, Pakistan will be the 49th member of the group,
said Ramphal, who is from Guyana.
   ``There could hardly be a more auspicious prelude to the Kuala
Lumpur meeting later in October,'' he added.
   Ms. Bhutto is expected to attend the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting to be held in the Malaysian capital Oct. 18-24,
the Foreign Ministry statement said.

   Cleanup workers and state officials say
there's still plenty of oil fouling the shores of Prince William
Sound, but Exxon insists the beaches are nearly free of oil as a
summer-long effort ends.
   Exxon officials pronounced the 1,100 miles of oil-tainted
shoreline ``environmentally stable'' Thursday and proclaimed their
25-week cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill a job well done.
   Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence Rawl said in Juneau that the
affected shores of the sound and Gulf of Alaska farther south ``are
certainly what most people would call clean.''
   But Dennis Kelso, the state's environmental commissioner, was not
pleased with what he saw when he toured shorelines on two islands
south of Valdez on Thursday.
   ``This beach is not environmentally stable,'' he said as he poked
a stick into thickly oiled rocks on Knight Island. ``If we had
wildlife here, they'd be pretty heavily oiled.''
   Exxon officials said they expect to declare the summer cleanup
complete today, 25 weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez cracked open
on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. The
company has said a Sept. 15 deadline to wrap up the work was set
because the weather gets rough and days get so short this time of
year in Alaska.
   But state officials are pressuring Exxon to commit to a greater
research effort over the winter to determine the best way to resume
the cleanup next spring.
   ``The point isn't that Exxon has done a terrible job,'' Kelso
said. ``There's just more to be done. We don't need to wait until
spring to get the preparations going.''
   ``I think they're looking to get out of it and I think they're
trying to put the best face on it that they possibly can,'' Kelso
said this morning on the NBC ``Today'' program. ``In terms of
honesty with the American people, I think they get a failing grade.''
   The company has said that about 300 cleanup workers would remain
in Alaska to monitor the spill and respond to major problems. At the
height of the effort, about 10,000 people were working on the
cleanup.
   Otto Harrison, general manager of Exxon's Valdez operations, said
that while oil remained in some areas, it wasn't enough to harm
wildlife.
   ``What you've seen is a coastline almost free of oil,'' Harrison
said. ``You're seeing the steady recovery of Prince William Sound.''
   State officials agreed Exxon's efforts had resulted in some
cleaner shorelines, but disputed the company's rosy portrayal of an
environmental rebound.
   On his tour of the Knight Island shoreline, Kelso noted there
were few signs of wildlife on what once was a shore rich with the
sounds of life.
   Kelso said a chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks
showed signs of breaking down the oil in some areas.
   In other spots, however, it appeared the cleanup was rushed to
meet Exxon's self-imposed deadline, Kelso said.
   On Green Island, Kelso used a pocket knife to scrape sun-baked
oil off blackened rocks.
   ``It looks and feels like tar _ the way an asphalt driveway
feels,'' he said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper scheduled a news conference in Valdez today to
discuss the state's cleanup plans for the winter.
   Cleanup workers returned to Valdez by the hundreds Thursday on
their way home. Many echoed the sentiments of Roger Consiel, who was
on the first crew of 48 workers dispatched to the oiled beaches
after the March 24 grounding of the oil tanker.
   ``I think we did some good,'' he said. ``But the oil's going to
be there for a while, that's for sure.
   ``I think Exxon should come back next year. There's a lot left to
be done.''
   Consiel, 39, was an unemployed cannery worker when an Exxon
contractor hired him for cleanup duty. He returns home to his family
with about $30,000 in spill wages in his savings account.
   ``Not bad for 5{ months' work,'' he said with a smile. ``I'm
pretty happy about it. It would be nice to come back next year,
too.''
   Some fishermen who suffered from a restricted salmon season and a
poor catch say the sound will never be the same.
   ``It's time that everyone realizes that no amount of money in the
world is going to restore Prince William Sound to a pristine
condition,'' said Riki Ott of Cordova District Fishermen United.

   Anheuser-Busch must pay $1 million in fines
for illegally discharging phosphorus-contaminated water into the
Seneca River, officials said.
   The beer maker also admitted its employees reported false
sampling data to the state Department of Environmental Conservation
and hid from DEC inspectors hoses that illegally bypassed critical
portions of the waste water treatment system.
   In an agreement disclosed Thursday, the St. Louis-based brewer
agreed to pay a $925,000 civil fine for unlawful discharges into the
Seneca River from its plant in Baldwinsville, N.Y., said New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   On Wednesday night, the company pleaded guilty in Lysander Town
Court to three misdemeanor violations of the state's water pollution
control regulations and was fined $75,000.
   The company also agreed to publish full-page advertisements in
four waste water treatment trade publications advising other
corporations to comply with state environmental standards. In
addition, the company will undergo an independent audit of its
treatment plant operations.
   Walter A. Suhre Jr., vice president and general counsel for
Anheuser-Busch, said three employees were responsible for the
pollution violations and acted without the consent or knowledge of
the company. Two were fired and one was allowed to resign, he said.
   ``We are a highly regulated industry and we do not accept any
excuse not to adhere to the law,'' said Suhre.
   Criminal charges could be brought against individuals involved in
the pollution and cover-up, Abrams said, but he declined to identify
those under investigation.
   The pollution had no permanent environmental impact, but may have
contributed to an overall lessening of water quality in the river,
said state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling.
Excessive amounts of phosphorus can result in weed and algae growth
that can hinder the development of fish and other aquatic life.
   Suhre said no completely untreated waste was discharged directly
into the river.
   The DEC investigation stemmed from a tip from a fired employee.
   The state officials charged that Anheuser-Busch treatment plant
employees began submitting false monitoring reports on discharges
into the Seneca River in 1982.

<HEAD>Nujoma Registers to Vote; Police Identify Irish Assassination Suspect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South-West
Africa People's Organization, was mobbed by supporters today when he
registered to vote in the territory's pre-independence elections.
   Police, meanwhile, confirmed the identity of an Irishman arrested
in connection with the assassination Tuesday night of Anton
Lubowski, the only ranking white member of the nationalist movement
that fought a 23-year war against South African rule of Namibia.
   Police Inspector Kierie du Rand confirmed newspaper reports that
Dean Acheson, 50, was the man police arrested Wednesday after
Lubowski was gunned down outside the gate of his home. Acheson is to
appear in court Monday, but du Rand said police are still
investigating a motive.
   ``It appeared very professional,'' he said. ``They or he (the
killer or killers) waited in the bush. Lubowski was in the process
of opening the gate and he was shot three times in the back. It
looked like one bullet was fired from the top after he was on the
ground.''
   Today was the final day of registration for the November
elections. More than 677,000 people have registered in the vast
territory of 1.3 million.
   Nujoma, who returned Thursday to Namibia after almost 30 years in
exile, registered to vote at a post office in Katutura, the main
black neighborhood on the edge of Windhoek, the capital.
   Nujoma said his decision to participate in the elections
indicated his organization was generally pleased with the
independence process, which is being implemented by South Africa
under United Nations supervision.
   ``I'm very happy with the efforts being made by the U.N. in
assisting the Namibian people, who have been so many years oppressed
in attempting to achieve their freedom,'' said Nujoma, whose
movement is favored in the polls.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed to grant
the territory independence under a regional peace accord signed in
December that also calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers
from Marxist-ruled Angola.
   No date has been set for Namibian independence, but it is
expected to be early next year.
   In brief comments to reporters at the polling station, Nujoma
said SWAPO no longer holds any prisoners at camps in Angola,
although about 200 former detainees released in July say the
organization has either killed or has in custody hundreds of
Namibians.
   A United Nations delegation is in Angola investigating the
charges but has not reported on its findings. The U.N. delegation
``will see for themselves,'' Nujoma said. ``I leave it up to them.''
   SWAPO has acknowledged torturing its detainees, saying they were
suspected of spying for the South African-led security forces. Among
those allegedly detained was Nujoma's wife, Kowambo. SWAPO and Mrs.
Nujoma, who registered with her husband today, have declined to
comment.
   The Star newspaper in Johannesburg and the pro-SWAPO Namibian
newspaper in Windhoek reported that Acheson entered South Africa
from Ireland six weeks ago. The Star said he comes from Belfast but
that his passport was obtained in Dublin.
   Lubowski, a prominent human rights lawyer, was the first white to
publicly declare his support for leftist-leaning SWAPO in 1984. He
was often ridiculed in newspaper articles and cartoons in right-wing
newspapers.

<HEAD>Coalition Partners Fail to Agree on Egyptian Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's top leaders clashed today over Egypt's
plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks, and officials in the two
major parties said the disagreement is threatening the coalition
government.
   The leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party and the right-wing
Likud bloc reportedly disagreed on the 10-point Egyptian peace plan
and on President Hosni Mubarak's efforts to sponsor a Palestinian
delegation for talks with Israel.
   Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny presented Mubarak's peace
plan to Israeli leaders today, said a spokesman for Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader. Israel had been saying it
cannot comment on a proposal it has not been officially presented
with.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops shot and killed two Palestinian
youths, including a 12-year-old, in clashes with stone-throwers in
the city of Nablus, Arab hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman said soldiers did not fire in the area where
Tarkek Said Tuffah, 12, was killed. He said a patrol commander shot
and killed a second youth when troops were attacked by youths
throwing iron bars and cement blocks.
   Arab reports said Tuffah was shot by an army sniper. The reports
said the second youth, Ata Yunis, 18, was killed in a clash with
troops that occurred d during Tuffah's funeral.
   The two deaths raise to 570 the Palestinian death toll in the
21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation. Forty Israelis
have also died in the violence, and 114 Arabs have been killed by
fellow Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   Today's meeting between leading ministers of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and Labor ended in sharp disagreement,
Israel radio said.
   Peres leaves Saturday for the United States, where he is
scheduled to meet President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   He said in an interview published today in the Jerusalem Post
that the U.S. role in promoting Egypt's proposal will be crucial to
its success.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of the Likud bloc is expected to
visit the United States next week and plans to meet with Baker.
   Likud opposes a major point in Mubarak's plan, acceptance of the
U.S-backed formula of trading occupied land for peace.
   Along with the peace plan, Mubarak has proposed that Israel meet
with a 12-member Palestinian delegation that includes two Arabs
deported from the occupied territories.
   The proposal is intended to satisfy Israel's demand to meet only
Palestinians from the territories and the PLO's insistence that
Palestinians living abroad be included in any talks.
   But Likud legislator Eliahu Ben-Elissar said Egypt's proposal was
simply a way to disguise a meeting with PLO representatives.
   ``We have closed the door to the PLO, so the Egyptians have
decided to push them in through the window,'' he said on Israel
radio.
   A Labor official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
the party's meeting Thursday agreed to talks with a Palestinian
delegation. The official said Labor would consider leaving the
Cabinet if there is no progress in peace talks.
   The current coalition government was formed in lengthy
negotiations that followed November 1988 elections.

<HEAD>Catholic Newspaper Calls for Frank's Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic newspaper in Rep. Barney Frank's
congressional district wants him to resign, but the Massachusetts
Democrat said he won't because that would leave accusations about
him unanswered.
   Frank has been embroiled in controversy since acknowledging he
paid a male prostitute for sex and then hired him as a valet.
   The prostitute, Stephen Gobie, said Frank knew he used the
congressman's apartment in a prostitution ring. Frank denied it, and
said he fired Gobie when he found out about it.
   The call for Frank to step down came in an editorial in The
Anchor, the 29,000-circulation newspaper of the Roman Catholic
Diocese of Fall River.
   ``If he were a policeman, a school teacher or fireman, he would
be out of a job,'' the Rev. John F. Moore, editor of The Anchor,
wrote in an editorial dated Sept. 8. ``His rather tacky double
standard should not be condoned or excused.''
   But Frank said Thursday, ``A resignation would short-circuit the
(House) ethics committee, and I think the committee is an
appropriate forum.''

<HEAD>Officers Accused Of Leaving Black Youths In White Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are investigating an incident
in which two white police officers picked up two black youths at a
bus stop, slapped them and then left them in a mostly white area,
where they were attacked.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas announced the probe Thursday as a
Police Department official said an internal investigation had
confirmed the allegation.
   ``The case ... is a sustained case,'' David Fogel, head of the
department's Office of Professional Standards, said Thursday. ``In
other words, the allegations are true.''
   The two police officers, a man and a women who haven't been
identified, face disciplinary action as well as possible criminal
action, Fogel said.
   The probe into the incident by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation was launched at the request of Chicago Mayor Richard
M. Daley, Valukas said.
   The City Council on Wednesday voted unanimously to address the
issue of police brutality later this month after hearing reports of
the incident concerning two black teen-agers, in addition to a
weekend fatal shooting of a black man by police.
   Police say that Leonard Banister, 22, was shot on Sunday when he
tried to grab the gun of a black officer who was frisking him. Some
of Banister's friends and relatives say the shooting was unprovoked.
   In the earlier incident, the aunt of one of the youths said two
officers stopped and questioned her nephew and his friend, both 14,
on Aug. 15, as they headed home from a baseball game.
   The officers picked up the boys, slapped them and then dropped
them off in the mostly white neighborhood of Canaryville, where they
were attacked by several whites, she said.
   One of the youths was hospitalized after the attack and the other
fled and escaped serious injury, officials said.
   Five juveniles and two adults were arrested and charged with
aggravated battery and ethnic intimidation in connection with the
attack.

   East Germany's hard-line
leadership today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of its
citizens to the West, but for the first time said the exodus of
skilled workers will hurt the economy.
   Also today, the Communist government canceled a planned visit by
a delegation from the left-leaning West German opposition party, the
Social Democrats.
   The number of refugees reaching West Germany neared 14,000 today,
and Budapest vowed to keep its borders open for East Germans heading
West.
   Several times in the past few days, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has urged the East German leadership to make political and
economic improvements to curb the number of refugees. The Social
Democrats have also called for reforms.
   But Guenter Mittag, the Central Committee member in charge of the
East German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary today in
the Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland.
   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:
they want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' Mittag
wrote. ``Thanks a lot for that. It just won't be that way!''
   Mittag also accused West Germany of causing the exodus with
``promises, enticements and also with psychological pressure.'' He
called on those left behind to do everything possible to strengthen
the nation of 16.6 million people.
   Neues Deutschland expressed its ``thanks and joy'' for Thursday's
announcement that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit
East Berlin for the nation's 40th anniversary celebrations on Oct. 7.
   East German leader Erich Honecker has vigorously rejected calls
for the kind of reforms Gorbachev advocates for the Soviet Bloc.
   Soviet Politburo member Yegor Ligachev said in Berlin that Moscow
is East Germany's ``loyal friend'' and accused West German
politicians and news media of mounting a ``tendentious campaign''
against East Germany.
   Most of the current wave of East German refugees are young people
who have turned their back on the political repression and economic
difficulties in their home country. Many are skilled workers leaving
behind a huge hole in their nation's work force.
   Harry Tisch, a Central Committee member who heads the state-run
labor union in East Germany, acknowledged that the government would
have to find solutions to ``bridge this gap.''
   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit to
Stuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that young
skilled workers from the German Democratic Republic are resettling
in the Federal Republic of Germany.''
   According to statistics released Thursday by the West German
government, East Germany is suffering its biggest talent drain from
the nation's work force since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.
   The ministry report said 55 percent of the refugees who have come
to West Germany since August are between 18 and 30 years of age. It
said 86 percent had successfully completed high levels of job
training.
   The figures, compiled from information provided by the newcomers
during registration after arrival, indicate that 33 percent had been
employed in heavy industry and 25 percent in the service sector,
where shortages already had been reported. According to the report,
most had occupied middle-level positions.
   The East German leadership has been hampered by Honecker's
protracted recovery from gallbladder surgery last month, leading one
Communist Party official to call the country a ``ship without a
captain.'' But Tisch told the news conference today that Honecker
was ``on the way to recovery.''
   In East Berlin, Parliament President Horst Sindermann announced
that the Communist government had canceled the opposition Social
Democrats' visit that had been scheduled for next week.
   Sindermann accused the party, which routinely strives for better
ties to East Germany, of planning a ``confrontation'' with the
Communist government.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats had
already bitterly criticized plans for the trip, saying the Social
Democrats should avoid the appearance of showing support for the
Communist government's rigid stance.

   Hungary decided to let East Germans flee
to the West because Budapest is more committed to Western-style
reforms than to an appearance of East bloc unity, a deputy foreign
minister said.
   Laszlo Kovacs said Hungary will not sacrifice ``measures held to
be important by us in the light of a possible disagreement by one of
our allies.'' His comments were published today by the state-run MTI
news agency and the newspaper Magyar Hirlap.
   East Germany has lashed out at Hungary for opening its border to
thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West. The border has been
open since Sunday, and about 14,000 East Germans have emigrated
since then.
   About 500 more East Germans arrived in West Germany today after
passing through Austria overnight, authorities said.
   East Germany today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of
its citizens to the West. But it also acknowledged for the first
time that the exodus of skilled workers will hurt the economy.
   Guenter Mittag, the East German official in charge of the
economy, said in the state newspaper Neues Deutschland that West
German calls for reform in East Germany ``contain only one point:
they want the type of reform that does away with Socialism.''
   ``Thanks a lot for that. It just won't be that way!'' Mittag
wrote.
   Harry Tisch, a Central Committee member who heads the state-run
labor union, said on a visit to Stuttgart that the government would
have to find solutions to the problem of losing many young, skilled
workers.
   Magyar Hirlap also reported today that dozens of Romanians and
Czechoslovaks are caught each night trying to slip across Hungary's
border with Austria. Austrian border police in the state of
Burgenland said an equal number make it across each night.
   The border police said 40 Romanians and five Czechoslovaks
arrived before dawn today.
   The new escape route has prompted East Germans in Poland and
Czechoslovakia to seek refuge in West German embassies in hopes they
also will be able to go West.
   West German Foreign Ministry officials said today that 60 East
Germans are at the embassy in Warsaw and about 190 in Prague.
   A West German border police spokesman, Klaus Papenfuss, said 273
of the new arrivals today registered with camps set up near Passau
and the rest continued by train to other refugee centers set up in
the central part of the country.
   Papenfuss said in a statement that seven more busloads of East
Germans were expected to arrive today.
   The East Germans are automatically granted citizenship in West
Germany and have been given assistance finding housing and jobs.
   Kovacs said Hugary's decision to let the refugees go ``is in
accordance with international norms and regulations on human rights,
thereby proving the consistency of Hungarian politics, the
commitment of the country's leadership in accomplishing the reform
process.''
   Asked if Hungary felt a ``triangle'' of East-bloc allies was
forming against the reformist state, Kovacs replied: ``It is true
that Hungary's relations with these countries have become tense.''
He referred to ties with Czechoslovakia and Romania, as well as East
Germany.
   Hungary and Poland have led the Soviet bloc in carrying out
social and political reforms, but East Germany, Romania and
Czechoslovakia have resisted.
   Hungary has alienated Czechoslovakia by denouncing the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion of that country and by pulling out of a
controversial Danube dam project. Romania is angry with Hungary over
Budapest's decision to give refuge to 20,000 Romanians of Hungarian
descent who have fled illegally.
   Kovacs said the strains with the three countries ``are unusual
and call for concern,'' but he did not elaborate.
   West Germany's ARD television network said there were rumors
Hungary would close the border soon, but Hungarian government
spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said he knew of no such plans.
   Bajnok quoted Foreign Minister Gyula Horn as saying Thursday that
``no decision has been made'' on stopping the flow of East Germans.
   Ferenc Somogyi, Hungarian secretary of state for foreign affairs,
said in an interview published today, ``We will leave the border
open as long as we judge it necessary.
   ``I assure you that all East Germans in Hungary will have the
opportunity to leave the country,'' the Paris newspaper Le Figaro
quoted him as saying in Budapest. The article did not give the date
of his comments but did refer to events Wednesday.
   East Germany has accused Hungary of breaking a 1969 agreement
prohibiting unauthorized departures to the West of residents of the
Warsaw Pact countries, and it filed a formal protest Tuesday.
   A Soviet Politburo member said Thursday that Moscow is East
Germany's ``loyal friend'' and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans
to visit the troubled communist state next month, East Germany's
official news agency reported.

scandals at his department, and the panel's chairman said he would
seek a subpoena to compel his testimony.
   ``While he may run, he may not hide,'' chairman Tom Lantos said
of Pierce, who on Thursday evening abruptly canceled plans to
testify on grounds he had not had time to prepare because he had
only recently hired an attorney.
   Lantos, D-Calif., began today's hearing by attacking that
argument and Pierce's tenure at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development during the Reagan administration. ``I can understand not
being able to find affordable housing in Washington, but not an
attorney,'' he said.
   Lantos said he would ask his House Government Operations housing
and employment subcommittee to vote next Wednesday on a subpoena
that would require Pierce to testify at several future hearings.
   The ranking Republican on the subcommittee also attacked Pierce's
decision. ``Not only is `Silent Sam' silent, apparently today he's
also invisible,'' said Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio.
   In a statement Thursday night, Pierce said he was willing to
testify at an appropriate time and accused thwe subcommittee of
unfairly denying his request for an extension.
   ``I will not voluntarily appear,'' the former Housing and Urban
Development secretary said. ``I have fully and completely cooperated
with the subcommittee right up until today, but its refusal to allow
me an additional two weeks preparation time, when numerous other
witnesses have been granted even longer postponements, simply is
unfair.''
   The panel is investigating allegations that prominent Republicans
and former HUD officials won favored treatment from the agency
during Pierce's eight years as secretary and that poor management
left HUD unable to account for hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Opening the hearing today, Lantos said: ``Mr. Pierce has chosen _
in a unilateral and arbitrary fashion _ to break a firm agreement I
made with him and his attorney to appear voluntarily at this
hearing.''
   He then referred to a letter from Pierce's HUD file in which
former Interior Secretary James Watt referred to Pierce as ``a man
of your word.''
   ``Regrettably that statement appears to apply only to mod rehab
units,'' Lantos said, referring to Watt's work as a consultant for
developers who sought federal contracts for work under HUD's
Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   Subcommittee member Barney Frank, D-Mass., referred to a House
ethics investigation he faces because of a relationship with a male
prostitute in criticizing Pierce for refusing to appear today.
   Frank, who requested the ethics review and has made several
public statements since word of the relationship surfaced last
month, said that when the conduct of public officials is questioned,
``the public is entitled to the promptest possible resolution of
those issues before the appropriate public body.''
   Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, said in an interview, ``Mr.
Pierce wants to tell his entire story. However, he needs to be
adequately prepared to do so.''
   Pierce's announcement was the latest twist in an investigation
that already has seen two former top Pierce aides at HUD assert
their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refuse
to testify before the subcommittee.
   Pierce appeared voluntarily in May and said he took no direct
role in HUD funding decisions. But his sworn testimony was
challenged by a former HUD official who said Pierce personally
ordered her to fund a $15 million Durham, N.C., project that was
opposed by several agency experts.
   The project was supported by Charles Markham, then the city's
mayor and a former law partner of Pierce's. The developer also hired
as a consultant Lou Kitchin, who was southeastern political director
of the Reagan and Bush presidential campaigns.
   Pierce also has been criticized for lifting restrictions on a HUD
lender whose portfolio now includes more than $538 million in
defaults. Pierce made the decision after being lobbied by former HUD
Secretary Carla Hills, now the Bush administration's trade
representative. The company, DRG Funding Corp., is the target of an
FBI investigation.
   Those and other accounts of Pierce's actions at HUD had left the
subcommittee eager to question him. Several members have stopped
just short of accusing Pierce of committing perjury in May when he
said he was not a ``hands on'' manager.
   In his statement, Pierce, himself an attorney, said he required
legal counsel because it had become apparent to him that the
subcommittee had dropped its ``non-adversarial manner.''
   Pierce said he was unable to retain competent counsel until last
week and had far too little time to review documents.
   ``One would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demand
that the subcommittee grant to any citizen it called before it
sufficient time to consult counsel and prepare testimony,'' Pierce
said, stressing that he is willing to appear voluntarily at a later
date.
   But Lantos, obviously angered by Pierce's eleventh-hour
announcement, said, ``All further appearances by Sam Pierce will
take place on a compelled basis under subpoena.''

<HEAD>Eagleburger Says US Doing All It Can To Admit Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs graf 4, Many members, with two new grafs to include
Hatch quote.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior administration official, seeking to
deflect criticism of its handling of Soviet refugees, said today the
United States was doing all it can to admit as many as possible but
its capabilities are limited.
   ``We are trying to manage the surge in Soviet emigration in the
most humane and orderly way possible,'' said Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Testifying before the Senate subcommittee on immigration,
Eagleburger said that while the United States applauds the recent
liberalization of Soviet emigration, ``we must be honest in
appraising our national ability to respond to unprecedented,
unpredictable and previously unmanaged flows of people.''
   Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah was sharply critical of
the administration's position. ``No budget deficit, however large,
should ever induce the United States to abandon or compromise in any
way its fundamental values'' of granting haven to ``oppressed
peoples,'' he said.
   Many members of Congress have criticized the strategy for dealing
with Soviet refugees, saying the United States is limiting their
entry instead of opening its arms to the unprecedented wave of
emigres.
   ``Just when the Soviet faucets start opening, the U.S. government
finds itself totally incapable of dealing with the results it has
been pressing so many years to achieve,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y. ``We look like laughingstocks to the Soviets and like fools
to the emigres.''
   In an effort to deflect some of the criticism, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh on Thursday ordered the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to reconsider the applications of 4,000
Soviets whose bid for refugee status were denied by INS examiners in
Rome.
   The INS will consider whether the Soviets, who are mostly Jews,
would be subjected to persecution if they were forced to return to
their homeland, the Justice Department said.
   This standard will be used in evaluating the applications of some
16,000 Soviets in Rome who are also seeking U.S. refugee status,
said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I am aware of and sensitive to the great chorus of concern
which has been expressed for these persons,'' Thornburgh said.
   The Bush administration said this week it plans to limit the
number of Soviet refugees admitted to this country to 50,000 in the
coming fiscal year. As many as 150,000 are expected to apply in
fiscal 1990.
   Princeton Lyman, Director of Refugee Programs at the State
Department, told a joint hearing of two House panels that once the
administration handles the backlog of applicants from this fiscal
year _ estimated at more than 50,000 _ there will not be any slots
left for new applicants in fiscal 1990.
   ``The administration should just hang up a sign in Moscow telling
people not to bother applying in 1990,'' said Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif. ``Why establish elaborate processing procedures when no one
will be admitted anyway?''
   Jewel Lafontant, the administration's coordinator for refugee
affairs, told panel members that, ``we share your frustration. We
don't have all the answers, but we're working darned hard to find
them.''
   Two pending bills would require the administration to
automatically grant refugee status to all Soviet emigres on the
grounds that they face persecution as a group.
   All Soviets were granted refugee status until summer 1988, when
former attorney general Edwin Meese ordered that each applicant be
required to prove persecution on an individual basis.
   This change resulted in 20 to 50 percent of applicants being
turned down, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   Berman released an internal State Department report that said
widespread anti-Semitism in the lower ranks of Soviet government and
among the general populace has increased greatly under glasnost.
   State-sponsored anti-Semitism, official policy for hundreds of
years, has abated, although many cases are still reported, the
report said.
   The Jewish community expressed its concern with the new
administration strategy at separate White House and State Department
meetings. At the State Department, leaders of five American Jewish
groups gave the administration the names of 400 Jewish families who
have been denied exit permits.
   The issue will be discussed later this month in Wyoming when
Secretary of State James A. Baker III meets with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Also on the Wyoming agenda is a U.S. request to increase its
embassy staff in Moscow to deal with the number of Soviet applicants
seeking entry into the United States.
   The administration's new proposal would provide full federal
sponsorship for 40,000 Soviet refugees while private organizations
would finance the resettlement for the remaining 10,000.
   It also would allow as many as 30,000 Soviets to come here under
a special parole category if they can find the money for their
travel and resettlement.
   To save money, the State Department announced it will close
processing centers for Soviet emigres in Italy and Austria, and
handle all processing in Moscow with a new facility in Washington to
help with the caseload.

<HEAD>China Toughens Security, Starts Nationwide ID Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces throughout China today began
making spot checks of citizens' identification cards in another move
by the government to regain a degree of control over the population.
   Also today, the official press said in front-page editorials that
the sacking of a provincial governor accused of corruption shows the
Communist Party will spare no high official found abusing his powers.
   A measure similar to the ID card checks was instituted Sept. 1 in
Beijing, which is under martial law, in an effort to round up
alleged counterrevolutionaries still at large three months after the
army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   No mention was made of the ``counterrevolutionaries'' when
authorities announced today that nationwide checks would begin.
   Instead, the Public Security Ministry said, ``The checking is
aimed at providing convenience for citizens in their political,
economic and other activities, guaranteeing their legal rights and
strengthening the administration and protection of the social
order.''
   Other measures are reported to have been implemented to clear
Beijing of non-residents before the capital celebrates the 40th
anniversary of Communist China on Oct. 1. Authorities appear
concerned that students and others who joined the popular movement
this spring might stage some kind of protest on National Day.
   Chinese say notices have gone up in some work units ordering
those without papers authorizing them to live permanently in Beijing
to leave by today. Only those with written permission from
authorities above the provincial level to do business in the capital
are allowed to remain.
   Hong Kong newspapers have reported restrictions on travel to
Beijing, but government offices in a number of large Chinese cities
denied any knowledge of such regulations.
   The Beijing Foreign Affairs office, which handles questions from
foreign reporters, also said they were not aware of any travel
restrictions.
   But Beijing Railroad Station is comparatively empty. China's
busiest railroad station usually is teeming with people, with
virtually every bit of open space taken up by travelers who have
camped out while waiting, sometimes for several days, to buy tickets.
   Chinese say strict security before Oct. 1 is normal, but many
also say it has never been this strict.
   The ID checks have scared away some of Beijing's transient
population of about 700,000 _ most of them peasants from the
countryside working at construction sites, selling vegetables,
working as maids and doing other manual labor that city residents
disdain.
   The new measures are a turnaround from a gradual loosening of
restrictions on movement in the past 10 years. In the past, a person
needed approval from several different government offices to leave
his village.
   In recent years, however, traveling became much easier, and often
the only restriction was cost. The domestic tourism industry boomed,
as Chinese with money set about seeing China's famous sites.
   Hainan Governor Liang Xiang's dismissal, announced Wednesday,
``completely expresses our party and government's determination and
courage to punish corruption,'' the Worker's Daily said.
   Liang, governor since August of China's newest and most open
province, was accused of aiding his wife and sons in real estate and
auto speculation, illegally letting one of his sons settle in Hong
Kong, and using public funds to buy clothes and hold banquets.
   He is the highest ranking government official to fall since the
beginning of a campaign against corruption sparked in part by the
crushed student demonstrations of last spring, which made a major
issue of public corruption.
   The 71-year-old Liang was closely associated with the reformist
policies of Zhao Ziyang, who was purged from power and accused of
supporting student dissent, but Hainan Communist Party chief Xu
Shijie was quoted as saying Liang's fall was not a political matter
connected to Zhao.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban refugee accused of commandeering a jetliner
3{ months ago was found innocent by reason of insanity today and
ordered to undergo additional psychiatric tests.
   Pedro Rene Comas Banos was scheduled to begin trial Monday on
federal air piracy charges for attempting to divert a Miami-bound
American Airlines flight to Cuba.
   U.S. District Judge James W. Kehoe based his ruling on reports
from two psychiatrists and a neurosurgeon who concluded Comas was
``insane at the time of his acts.''
   After his court appearance, Comas, 38, was returned to the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami, where he
has been held since arrest by the FBI shortly after the May 27
incident ended.
   Kehoe ordered additional mental tests for Comas. A Nov. 6 hearing
was scheduled to receive reports and testimony on whether Comas
should be freed or sent to a mental institution.
   Comas was in mental facilities in Cuba before emigrating during
the Mariel boatlift of the early 1980s, said assistant federal
public defender Lori Barrist, who represented Comas.
   Three of Comas' sisters, who live in Miami, also indicated their
brother had history of mental illness, said Ms. Barrist.
   The United States has long accused Cuban leader Fidel Castro of
using the Mariel boatlift as an excuse to send prisoners and mental
patients to the United States along with the thousands of
law-abiding Cubans seeking to escape Castro's rule.
   Comas boarded an American flight in Los Angeles and changed to a
Miami-bound plane in Dallas on the ninth anniversary of his flight
from Cuba.
   As the aircraft neared Miami, he fired a shot from a pistol and
threatened to blow up the jet with plastic explosives unless the
flight was diverted to Cuba, said Assitant U.S. Attorney Marc
Jimenez.
   Authorities later discovered Comas brandished a starter's pistol
used in athletic events. The pistol was not discovered by detection
devices in Los Angeles or Dallas.
   Jimenez said the airline captain diverted the flight on a course
to Havana but returned to Miami after deciding the plane did not
have enough fuel.

<TEXT>
   Security forces have arrested 279
suspects in the latest crackdown on anti-government Sinhalese
radicals in central and southern Sri Lanka, a government communique
said today.
   At least two radicals were killed during an army operation
Thursday in Matale district's Udwelgala village, 65 miles northeast
of Colombo, the communique said.
   It said 168 suspects were arrested in Colombo district and the
remaining in several operations since Thursday in the Sinhalese
heartland.
   The statement said 26 ``wanted subversives'' surrendered in
central Sri Lanka during that period.
   Subversives is the official term for members of the People's
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to
overthrow the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The government crackdown was launched after President Ranasinghe
Premadasa inaugurated an interparty peace conference Wednesday to
try to end six years of ethnic strife in Sri Lanka that has cost
16,000 lives.
   Although invited, the front did not attend the meeting. The next
session will be held Monday. The front has also rejected the
government's earlier peace offers.
   The government says at least 5,000 people have been killed in the
2-year-old Sinhalese movement. The remaining died in a Tamil
insurrection that began in 1983 for an independent nation in the
northeast.
   Former President Junius R. Jayewardene tried to end the Tamil
secession with an India-mediated peace accord in 1987, but it led to
a Sinhalese backlash that was spearheaded by the front.
   The front's campaign of assassinations and strikes intensified
this year after Premadasa took office in January.
   The radicals oppose the deployment of Indian peacekeeping
soldiers in the northeast, invited to supervise the accord, and also
say the peace plan gave too many concessions to the Tamil minority.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
claim they are discriminated in jobs and education. Sinhalese make
up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the
military.

<TEXT>
   Dolores Ibarruri, the Spanish Communist
leader who became a legend during the Civil War, was seriously ill
in a Madrid hospital today, one day after being admitted for
treatment of pneumonia, doctors said.
   Mrs. Ibarruri, 93, checked into Ramon y Cajal hospital on
Thursday after complaining of serious breathing problems.
   Doctors today said her condition had improved slightly overnight
but remained serious because of her advanced age and chronic blood
circulation problems.
   Mrs. Ibarruri, better known by her pen-name ``La Pasionaria,''
was one of the Spanish Communist Party's founders in 1920 and is
currently the party's honorary president.
   During the 1931-39 Second Republic, she was elected to Parliament
and became renowned during the 1936-39 Civil War for her fiery radio
broadcasts exhorting Republican forces to defeat Gen. Francisco
Franco's insurgent army rebels.
   During the 1937 rebel siege of Madrid, her defiant phrase _ ``no
pasaran'' or ``they shall not pass'' _ became the battle cry of
loyalist Republican forces.
   Mrs. Ibarruri entered politics as a labor organizer and strike
leader and wrote newspaper articles signed ``La Pasionaria,'' which
is the Spanish transalation for passion flower but can also mean
``The Passionate One.'' She chose the name because her first article
appeared in 1916 in a Socialist newspaper during Holy Week, or
Semana de la Pasion in Spanish.
   After the war, she spent 38 years in exile in the Soviet Union
and received that country's highest civilian award, the Order of
Lenin.
   She returned to live in the Spanish capital at the age of 82 as
Spain made a peaceful transition to democracy after Franco's death
in 1975.
   In 1977, in Spain's first democratic elections since the war, the
white-haired grandmother won back her deputy's seat in the lower
house of Parliament, though she later gave it up because of
worsening health.

<HEAD>Former Unisys Executive Receives 32-Month Sentence in Pentagon Procurement
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Unisys Corp. executive who
admitted creating a slush fund to bribe officials and make illegal
campaign contributions received a 32-month sentence today for his
role in the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   Charles F. Gardner, 58, was also fined $40,000 for what the
prosecutor called improper conduct that was ``a qualitative,
quantitative leap from what has been before this court'' in a string
of other defense procurement criminal cases.
   James G. Neal, a former consultant to Unisys who admitted helping
Gardner bribe a Navy official for sensitive bid information on a
government contract, received a 27-month sentence and was fined
$30,000.
   Gardner, who admitted bribing former Pentagon official Melvyn
Paisley by purchasing Paisley's ski resort condominium for an
inflated price, was described by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph
Aronica as ``a major figure in this investigation.''
   But Aronica, citing Gardner's cooperation with the continuing
investigation since his March 10 guilty plea, joined the defense in
urging U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton to show some degree of
leniency.
   Defense attorney Gary Naftalis said Gardner's cooperation had
already led to six guilty pleas and ``will lead to more and more
convictions'' of ``individuals and corporations.''
   Gardner apparently is providing information to prosecutors about
the role of his former superiors at Sperry Corp., which became
Unisys Corp. following a takeover by Burroughs Corp.
   Unisys says it is also cooperating with the probe, nicknamed
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   According to court papers in another case, Gardner obtained
approval from a superior to bribe a former Navy engineer, Garland L.
Tomlin Jr., who is awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea for taking
$400,000 from the company and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc., for bid
information.
   Hilton said Gardner was ``more culpable than the defendants that
have been previously before me to be sentenced.'' But the judge said
he ``recognized the extent of the cooperation'' that Gardner had
given prosecutors.
   Because of that cooperation, Hilton agreed to depart from
sentencing guidelines, which called for a prison term ranging
between 46 and 57 months.
   Many of the previous defendants sentenced by Hilton in the case
had received sentences of about 24 to 25 months.
   Aronica said Gardner created a slush fund to finance ``a broad
spectrum of criminal activity.''
   ``It was the American taxpayer that ended up footing the bill for
these activities'' because Gardner billed the Pentagon to replenish
the slush fund by filing phony invoices.
   Gardner's concern about preserving government contracts for
Unisys by paying bribes and making illegal campaign contributions
``can in no way excuse or lessen the severity of what he directed
and orchestrated.'' Aronica said.
   Aronica described Neal as ``the banker for Mr. Gardner and Mr.
Gardner's operation.'' But Neal ``knew what was going on'' with the
money that he placed in various accounts for the slush fund, Aronica
said.
   ``His involvement was as serious or more serious than those
previously sentenced by this court,'' Aronica told Hilton.
   According to court papers, Gardner arranged in 1986 to have Neal
purchase Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho, at a price that
was $49,000 above what he sold it for a year later.
   Paisley, former assistant Navy secretary for research,
engineering and systems, has not been charged in the case.
   Neal, who also pleaded guilty March 10, admitted transferring
$400,000 to the Bahamas account of a company Tomlin set up in order
to influence decisions on the Navy contract.

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire on rioting Hindus and
Moslems in a western Indian town, and at least 13 people were killed
and more than 50 injured, news reports said today.
   In northern Punjab state, meanwhile, police today blamed Sikh
extremists for an attack that killed 12 people in renewed violence
Thursday night, including eight members of one family.
   The clashes in the western town of Kota, 250 miles southwest of
New Delhi, came late Thursday during celebrations to mark the end of
a popular Hindu festival, Press Trust of India said.
   Moslems hurled stones at marchers carrying idols of a Hindu god,
leading to clashes in which ``arms were freely used,'' the reports
said.
   United News of India said police first tried to repulse the
rioters with batons, but the crowds hurled rocks at policemen,
forcing them to open fire.
   The news agencies did not say if the deaths resulted from police
firing or the clashes.
   More than 25 shops were burned and a shop selling arms was
looted, PTI said. It is not known if stolen weapons were used in the
fighting. A curfew was imposed and troops patrolled the streets
today, the reports said.
   In Punjab, six militants armed with automatic assault rifles
raided the farmhouse in the village of Rasoolpur, killing eight
family members, said Surjit Singh, a senior district police official.
   Elsewhere Thursday night, Sikh militants were reported to have
killed four other people.
   The militants, believed to belong to the radical Khalistan
Commando Force, escaped, police said.
   The Khalistan Commando Force is one of about a dozen militant
groups operating in the troubled northwestern state, where more than
1,280 people have been killed this year.
   Since 1982, Sikh militants have been demanding a separate state,
claiming discrimination by the Hindu majority.
   Sikhism was founded as an branch from Hinduism and Islam in the
16th century. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's
population. Hindus make up more than 80 percent of India's 880
million people.

   Four bombs exploded at banks in Bogota
today as Colombia prepared to extradite two cocaine traffickers to
the United States to face drug charges, police said. No one was
reported injured in the blasts.
   In the cocaine center of Medellin, the 4th Army Brigade said it
arrested 28 leftist guerrillas and ``bandits'' it accused of working
for drug traffickers.
   The brigade, in a statement made public today, said the suspects
belonged to the National Liberation Army, one of six guerrilla
groups operating in Colombia and that ``together with
narco-traffickers they had carried out terrorist acts'' in the
Medellin area in recent weeks.
   The traffickers have used the attacks to try to persuade the
government not to extradite drug lords to the United States to stand
trial. Medellin, a city 150 miles northwest of Bogota that is the
headquarters for Colombia's biggest cocaine cartel, had been the
focus of the attacks.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosions in Bogota, which
damaged all four banks were damaged, said a Bogota police spokesman
on condition of anonymity. But suspicion fell on drug traffickers in
the area.
   The government announced Thursday that it had arrested two
members of the Medellin cartel wanted in the United States and said
they were being held in a maximum security prison pending
extradition.
   It also decreed a state of emergency in the cities of Puerto
Boyaca and Pacha in midwestern Colombia just east of Medellin.
   The region is considered a stronghold for drug-linked death
squads and processing labs, and the decree allows President Virgilio
Barco to put army troops on alert and send military advisers to
``help'' the mayors of the two cities.
   Last week, Barco used special emergency powers to replace the
mayors of those cities with military officers, but he suspended the
order after widespread criticism that it was unconstitutional.
   The government identified the men to be extradited to the United
States as Bernardo Pelaez Roldan and Guillermo Bueno Delgado.
   The two were paraded before reporters at the National Security
Department, Colombia's version of the FBI, on Thursday. Pelaez,
bearded and wearing a leather jacket, cursed at the journalists and
threatened photographers with a cane. He had a cut on his head.
   A communique from the department said Pelaez, arrested Wednesday
outside the capital of Bogota, was wanted in Detroit for
``conspiracy and distribution of cocaine.'' The Justice Department
in Washington said he was convicted of drug-trafficking charges in
Detroit five years ago and faces 15 years in prison.
   The Justice Department said Bueno Delgado was wanted on drug
trafficking charges in Tallahassee, Fla., and San Francisco and was
accused of ``introducing 5,740 kilos (12,628 pounds) of cocaine and
money laundering.''
   The two are not among the so-called ``Dirty Dozen'' list prepared
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of the most wanted
Colombian drug barons.
   But the Justice Department also has another list, not made
public, of 82 lesser Colombian drug figures. It was unknown whether
Pelaez and Bueno Delgado were on that list.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marques, who heads Colombia's anti-drug war and
the Security Department, described Pelaez as ``much bigger'' than
Eduardo Martinez Romero, the alleged financier for the Medellin
cartel who was extradited to Atlanta Sept. 6.
   He has been the only person extradited so far under under a
special decree by Barco to bypass the courts and eliminate the
possibility of bribes and intimidation by drug lords.
   Colombia launched the drug crackdown after the Aug. 18
assassination of leading presidential candidate and anti-drug
crusader Sen. Luis Carlos Galvan on Aug. 18.
   The army has said it will continue the crackdown ``to the last
sacrifice.'' But despite a $250,000 reward for top drug barons Pablo
Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the two and other cartel
leaders remain at large.
   On Thursday, Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo held a
news conference to deny rumors that American troops were helping
Colombia in its drug war.
   Botero said 17 U.S. ``technicians'' were training Colombians to
use military equipment, including weapons, planes and helicopters,
which the Bush administration sent as part of a $65 million aid
package.
   Newspapers published an open letter by former presidents
Belisario Betancourt and Misael Pastana Borrero asking Barco for
``clarification'' of reports involving U.S. troops.
   Barco rejected an offer by the Bush administration to send troops
to help the anti-drug effort. However, the Pentagon has said up to
200 military advisers could be sent to Colombia to help in training
and maintenance of the donated military equipment.
   This has sparked fears and nationalistic fervor.
   Sen. Ernesto Lucena accused the Barco administration Thursday of
letting in equipment ``more fitting for an invasion of Panama than
helping root out a Colombian drug mafia.''

<HEAD>Indictment Alleges Former Senate Aide Involved In Bribery Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. senator's aide allegedly used
Senate stationery to write to U.S. agencies in an attempt to acquire
10 savings and loans and some businesses in Grenada, according to a
federal grand jury.
   Charged in an indictment unsealed Thursday were Glen N. Mauldin,
who was an aide to former U.S. Sen. Jacob ``Chic'' Hecht of Nevada;
Darrell A. Tomblin, a businessman now living in Houston; and Vincent
P. Lachelli, a Washington, D.C., lobbyist.
   The indictment alleges Mauldin was to receive a 10 percent
interest in the acquired savings and loans and a financial interest
in several Grenada business ventures for his role in the scheme.
   ``The indictments announced today arise against a backdrop of the
failing savings and loan institutions and industry in Texas,'' Helen
Eversberg, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, said
Thursday.
   ``The scheme emanated from San Antonio and ultimately wove its
way to the halls of Congress in Washington, D.C.,'' she said.
   The 22-count indictment charges each of the three with conspiring
to deprive the U.S. government of the honest services of Mauldin and
to corrupt the functions of the U.S. Senate and the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board.
   The three defendants were arrested and appeared in bond hearings
Thursday afternoon, Ms. Eversberg said.
   The indictment states that Mauldin, Tomblin and Lachelli embarked
on a scheme beginning in 1987 aimed at acquiring 10 savings and
loans across the United States.
   Mauldin used Senate stationery to write letters to federal
agencies in an attempt to assist with the thrift acquisition and
business ventures in Grenada, the indictment alleges.
   The Grenada business plans included an oil refinery, a commercial
fishing venture and spices grown in that country, the indictment
claims.
   Lachelli did not return a telephone call Thursday. Mauldin did
not answer his phone in Washington.
   David Botsford, an attorney for Tomblin, said he would comment
after he had received a copy of the indictment.
   Ms. Eversberg would not comment on whether prosecutors believe
Hecht knew of the alleged bribery that supposedly involved his
office. ``He was not charged in this indictment and he cooperated
with the FBI as soon as they approached him,'' she said.
   Formerly a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee,
Hecht served one term in the Senate before losing in the 1988
general election to Democrat Dick Bryan. Hecht now is ambassador to
the Bahamas.
   The San Antonio U.S. Attorney's Office began investigating the
case with the help of informant Leo Arnold Ladouceur, who had been
indicted with his wife on bank fraud charges in 1988.
   Ladouceur and two others pleaded guilty to charges Wednesday
relating to the bilking of millions of dollars from Suburban Savings
Association in San Antonio.
   A plea-bargain agreement indicated Ladouceur would not be
prosecuted for any dealings with Mauldin, Tomblin, Lachelli and
others.

<HEAD>UAL Board Approves Buyout by Pilot-Management Group</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS 9 grafsd to UPDATE with Davis offering to match pilot-management
bid if it falls through; today's early stock trading. Picks up 8th graf

   Billionaire investor Marvin Davis today said he
would match a $6.75 billion buyout offer by pilots and managers of
United Airlines that has been approved by parent UAL Corp., should
the pilot-management bid fall through.
   Although he said that any bidder competing with the pilots and
managers is at a ``clear competitive disadvantage,'' Davis said he
was ready to pay $300 a share _ without requiring any labor
concessions _ if the employee-management bid was not completed.
   UAL opened up $2.75 a share at $283.25 today on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   On Thursday, UAL Corp.'s directors approved a $300-a-share, or
$6.75 billion, offer from the management-pilot group, which could
result in the nation's largest employee-owned company.
   The plan, which includes a not-strike guarantee by the pilots and
other cost-cutting labor concessions, was the latest twist in a
6-week takeover battle.
   Davis, the California investor who started the battle and
previously bid $6.19 billion, or $275 a share for UAL, said his
offer today stands ``if the coalition proposal is not consummated on
a timely basis.''
   ``We believe that this course of action may provide us with a
higher probability of success in acquiring UAL than attempting to
bid against the coalition that has been arrayed against us,'' Davis
said in a statement.
   The pilot-management agreement was announced late Thursday after
the employee group made a final presentation to a special committee
of the UAL board and revealed the financing for its bid.
   British Airways PLC would hold a a minority stake in UAL under
the agreement.
   Frederick Dubinsky, a spokesman for United's unit of the Air Line
Pilots Association, said he believes the plan will go forward.
   ``We bring something to the table that no one else can bring,''
Dubinsky said in a telephone interview early today from New York.
   The pilot-management group's proposal includes a seven-year
no-strike guarantee by the pilots and cuts in wages and benefits,
terms that any outsider would have difficulty matching.
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Chicago-based UAL would
merge with Airline Acquisition Corp., the group formed by pilots and
management. Employees would own 75 percent of the company, UAL
management would hold 10 percent and British Airways PLC would own
15 percent.
   ``The merger agreement we have just signed is designed to secure
the future of United Airlines and its 68,000 employees, to serve the
public with quality air transportation and to provide the best value
to UAL's shareholders,'' said UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf.
   The deal still would need the approval of shareholders and the
Department of Transportation, which is not expected to raise major
objections although in the past it has been concerned about foreign
carriers buying into U.S. airlines.
   With inclusion of financing costs, the deal would total $7.2
billion. Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank have committed $3
billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an
additional $4.2 billion, officials said.
   The buyout attempt is led by Wolf and the 6,300 United pilots
represented by ALPA. The group had hoped to win support from
United's other unions.
   The Association of Flight Attendants, representing about 12,700
United workers, met with management Tuesday and ``has begun
negotiations toward possible participation'' in the employee buyout
effort, said spokeswoman Carol Holmes.
   But the International Association of Machinists, representing
25,000 of United's 70,000 employees, has refused to back the
proposal, saying it would leave UAL heavily in debt and could
threaten the job security of union members.
   In the past two years more than 300 companies have been purchased
by their employees. Avis Inc., with 11,000 employees, is the
nation's largest company owned by its employees.

<HEAD>Lottery Awards $3 Million to Janitor Who Lost Winning 1985 Ticket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A janitor who lost his winning ticket for a $3
million lottery says he's not mad that it took him four years to
claim the prize.
   ``The lottery was doing their job,'' said newly-made millionaire
Julius Russell Jr. The school janitor from the South Side picked up
a certificate of his winnings from lottery officials Thursday. ``Why
should I feel resentment?''
   Russell, 60, matched all six winning Lotto numbers in a November
1985 drawing, but accidently threw away his ticket.
   He proved in court last month that he consistently played the
same two sets of numbers in the weekly Lotto game, and the lottery
confirmed that one of two winning tickets for the $6 million jackpot
was purchased at the grocery where Russell routinely plays the game.
   The Illinois State Lottery had argued that lottery rules require
possession of a ticket to win, and officials appealed the court
ruling.
   But Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday the agency was
withdrawing its appeal after a check of lottery records showed
prizes have been awarded previously to claimants who could not
produce a winning ticket. None of the prizes was for more than
$5,000.
   ``We thought Mr. Russell should not have to suffer,'' she said.
   Ms. Sharp presented Russell with a mock check, and said he would
receive three installments of about $450,000 within eight weeks. The
remainder will be paid in 17 annual installments, she said.
   ``I feel great. I have five beautiful daughters and that's where
it's going,'' Russell said. ``I haven't thought about myself as of
yet.''
   Circuit Judge Robert Sklowdowski ruled Aug. 10 that the lottery
must pay Russell the prize despite his inability to produce the
winning ticket.
   ``I have decided that paying this particular claimant is the
fairest way to resolve this case,'' Ms. Sharp said. ``We think he
deserves the $3 million.''
   Ms. Sharp said lottery officials would never again pay a claim
without a ticket, and would seek legislation to toughen the ``no
ticket, no win'' rule.
   Russell said he plans to keep his job.
   The Illinois State Lottery has $14 million in unclaimed prizes,
Ms. Sharp said, and ``a lot'' of people make claims without tickets.
   Ms. Sharp said only one other state, Ohio, had awarded a grand
prize without a ticket.

<HEAD>House Panel Says FAA Officials Altered Documents in Controller Dispute</HEAD>

   Federal aviation officials doctored attendance
records of air traffic controllers who were fired in Chicago during
the 1981 strike, a House panel said today in recommending a probe
for possible criminal misconduct.
   Officials produced altered documents when Chicago controllers
appealed their firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and
then ``attempted to conceal those activities'' during testimony to
the board and a House subcommittee investigating the case, lawmakers
concluded.
   The report by the Public Works subcommittee on investigations and
oversight recommends the Justice Department review the testimony of
Federal Aviation Administration officials for possible misconduct.
   ``Our goal was to determine if a federal agency had trampled on
the rights of individuals and we are able to conclude that a gross
injustice did indeed take place,'' said Rep. James L. Oberstar,
D-Minn., chairman of the subcommittee during the investigation.
   Oberstar suggested today that the improprieties were rooted in
poor labor-management relations. ``There was an atmosphere of mutual
bitterness, animosity, that bordered on hatred. ... They wanted to
crush these people,'' he said.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said today he could not immediately
comment on the report.
   The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the more
than 400 firings in Chicago, which were among 11,500 ordered
nationwide by then-President Ronald Reagan after members of the
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization went on strike.
   Rather, the subcommittee report said it was concerned with the
actions of FAA officials while they were defending the firings in
front of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which considers appeals
from dismissed federal employees.
   The first two months of the strike were ``traumatic and confusing
times'' at the Chicago center, where 80 percent of the controllers
had joined the walkout, the subcommittee report said.
   Supervisors were forced to handle other jobs, ``and this
situation severely affected the condition of the center's attendance
records,'' the report said.
   On Aug. 13, 1981, a month before Chicago controllers started
receiving final termination notices, Robert L. Miller, evaluations
officer at the center, began to process personnel files _ in a
special area dubbed the ``war room'' _ in anticipation of controller
appeals to the federal merit board, the subcommittee said.
   To justify the firings, FAA officials decided to present
attendance records showing the controllers failed to report to work
during the strike. The officials told the merit board the attendance
records were the same ones used by George Gunter, chief of the
Chicago center, when he dismissed the controllers.
   But the subcommittee said that claim was false.
   ``These documents, in many cases, either did not exist at the
time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors,'' the
subcommittee said. ``The fact that the records at the Chicago center
were seriously flawed was known by both center management and key
FAA officials in the regional office.
   ``A plan was instituted whereby records were created where none
existed and amended where there were errors,'' the subcommittee said.
   Between Sept. 14 and Oct. 1, the records were sent to the FAA's
Great Lakes regional office, where the files were reviewed by the
agency's labor specialists before sending them to the merit board.
   But officials at the regional office found many errors, and as a
result ``war room'' employees produced a second set of attendance
records which were sent to the merit board, the report said. FAA
officials assured the merit board that the records were the ones
used by Gunter _ ``a certification that we now know to be false,''
the subcommittee said.
   The subcommittee said it was not able to determine who ordered
the second set of records. But Miller's wife, who worked in the
``war room'' and who was not identified in the report, was the first
person to admit to the panel that a second set had been produced,
the subcommittee said.
   At a Sept. 14, 1987, hearing, Miller acknowledged to the
subcommittee that there was a second shipment of records, but said
he could not remember who ordered it, the report said.
   The FAA's regional manager for labor relations, Richard Shewfelt,
acknowledged to the panel the first set of attendance records was
faulty but said he did not know who was responsible for creating the
extra set.
   However, the subcommittee said, ``It is very likely that Shewfelt
(and other regional officials) knew of the problems of consistency
and accuracy in the records that led to the second shipment.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today launched two monkeys into
orbit to enable scientists to study the effects of zero gravity and
space radiation on living beings, Tass reported.
   On Thursday, the Soviet Union used a single rocket to put six
Cosmos satellites into orbit. The series, numbered 2038 through
2043, were hurled into space by a Tsiklon booster rocket, Tass said
today.
   The monkeys' space capsule home, which will be in orbit for the
next two weeks, was launched by a Soyuz booster rocket, the official
news agency said.
   Tass said the experiment is part of a program organized by
scientists from the United States, Canada, France, Hungary, East
Germany, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and the European Space
Agency.
   ``After the flight's program is fulfilled, the biological
specimens and scientific equipment will be returned to Earth for
further studies,'' Tass said.
   In October 1987, the Soviet Union carried out space experiments
with two monkeys who quickly captured the public imagination with
their antics aboard the spacecraft, beamed back to Earth by
television cameras.
   One of the monkeys, named Yerosha, broke free and appeared to
viewers with a free left front paw and without his nametag on his
helmet. The mission was almost aborted when scientists learned he
had blocked his food tube.
   Tass said of Thursday's launch: ``Apart from scientific
instrumentation, the satellites have radio systems for precise
measuring of orbital elements and radio systems to transmit data to
Earth on the operation of instruments and scientific equipment.''
   Two Soviet cosmonauts, meanwhile, were busy assembling and
reactivating research equipment aboard the Mir space station, which
had been mothballed for four months before they arrived on Sept. 5,
the news agency said.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov on
Wednesday used the propulsion unit of their spaceship to change the
orbit of the Mir orbiter, Tass said.
   It said they also had replaced components of the life-support
systems and completed preparations for an experiment to produce
high-quality semiconductor materials in the gravity-free environment.
   ``The cosmonauts are feeling fine,'' Tass said, adding that they
would take the weekend off to relax.
   The 20-ton spacecraft was designed to be permanently manned, and
two cosmonauts last year set a record by staying in space for a year.
   But Mir was unexpectedly unmanned in April because two add-on
modules were not ready. The space agency also was under pressure
from legislators and citizens who felt its funds could be better
spent at home.
   The four-month vacancy was only the second time that Mir was
unmanned since it was launched in February 1986.

<HEAD>15,000 March in Johannesburg Against Police Action</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE numbers of protesters, ADD details.

<TEXT>
   About 15,000 protesters,
jogging, chanting and waving banners, marched today through the
heart of Johannesburg to a police headquarters where many activists
have been detained and interrogated.
   Another anti-government protest, involving nearly 2,000 people,
took place at the central square in Pretoria, the capital. Some
demonstrators climbed onto a statue of Paul Kruger, a political
patriarch of the Afrikaners who control the government.
   Both protests were among the largest ever staged in the two
cities, and dramatized the impact of President-elect F.W. de Klerk's
declaration this week that his white-led government would not block
peaceful protests.
   On Wednesday, a day after de Klerk's statement, more than 20,000
people marched in Cape Town against police brutality, the largest
such demonstration ever authorized by the government.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, a Methodist leader, said at a news
conference after the Johannesburg march that the series of peaceful
protests marked a ``turning point in the history of our land.''
   In Johannesburg, marchers included black youths, dark-suited
white professionals, nuns and prominent activists, among them Winnie
Mandela, wife of jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela. Many
youths carried posters demanding his release and chanted ``ANC!
ANC!'' _ the initials of Mandela's outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   About 10,000 marchers began the protest, but the crowd swelled to
about 15,000 as spectators joined the passing parade.
   Traffic officers cordoned off side streets leading into the
parade route but did not interfere as scores of black and white
church leaders headed the procession down thoroughfares that
normally would have been clogged with lunch-hour traffic.
   In Pretoria and Johannesburg, the only police action reported was
against white hecklers. Pretoria police led away two men shouting
abuse at protesters, and Johannesburg officers warned a white man
who threw eggs at the parade.
   The Johannesburg protesters included a white man, Phillip Botha,
who said he was a police reservist and carried a sign reading:
``Police Against Police Abuse.''
   The march ended a block from John Vorster Square, the main police
station. Policemen looked out from virtually every window of the
12-story building.
   Six clergymen went to the entrance, and one of them _ the Rev.
Frank Chikane _ was allowed inside to present a memorandum
protesting police violence. The document also demanded an end to
discriminatory and restrictive laws so negotiations could begin on
ending apartheid.
   Chikane, secretary-general of the South African Council of
Churches, emerged to tell waiting protesters: ``We have proved our
point.''
   The crowd prayed and then dispersed.
   Anglican Bishop Duncan Buchanan, one of the speakers at a church
service before the march, told protesters packed into St. Mary's
Cathedral: ``We are sick of violence, and we refuse to be pushed
around by a minority of a minority who support a godless and vile
ideology.''
   The organizers had refused to ask official permission for the
march, but state radio said Johannesburg's chief magistrate had
given approval, and a Pretoria magistrate had given permission for a
demonstration in the central Church Square.
   Chikane and other organizers repeatedly appealed to participants
to remain disciplined and non-violent, even if police took action
against them. At one point, he appealed to the crowd not to harass
some suspected plainclothes security officers.
   In Pretoria, hundreds of people gathered to support a picket by
lawyers against the Cape Town violence, where anti-apartheid
activists say at least 23 people died on election day. Police have
confirmed 15 deaths.
   More than 50 policemen stood around the park, and about a dozen
police trucks and armored vehicles were parked nearby.
   The lawyers also had refused to seek permission for their
protest, saying it was ``part of the inalienable democratic right of
... the community at-large to associate and express protest against
any inhuman conduct.''
   The lawyers in Pretoria and march organizers in Johannesburg
cited a march in Cape Town on Wednesday by 20,000 people as
justification for their actions. Police stayed away from the Cape
Town march, and there was no violence, although thousands of people
thronged the streets for about four hours in the largest legal
anti-government protest held in South Africa.
   The Cape Town march organizers had refused to seek permission,
but Mayor Gordon Oliver asked for it after acting President F.W. de
Klerk said he would not oppose the protest if it was peaceful and
legal.
   The pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, The Citizen, said
today, ``The `victory' in Cape Town is bound to encourage the
radicals to put on even more pressure, raising the specter of
renewed unrest.''
   The anti-apartheid New Nation, a black newspapr in Johannesburg,
said: ``The march (in Cape Town) showed that the state is in
retreat. ... Each backward step must mark the advance of our
people.''
   The Johannesburg newspaper Business Day said of the marches:
``There will be another, and another, each of them raising the
stakes until confrontation ensues. Violence, it is safe to say, is
almost inevitable, and the television cameras are waiting.''

   The White House announcement Thursday said the wheat could be
used to provide ``emergency food assistance to developing
countries'' that run short of domestic supplies.
   Under the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980, a stockpile of
4 million tons _ about 147 million bushels _ was created for use to
supply emergency food relief abroad.
   The first time the stockpile was tapped was last October when
President Reagan authorized release of 1.5 million tons when it
became apparent there would not be enough wheat in the marketplace
to fill the needs of developing countries.
   With the authorization to use an additional 2 million tons, the
special reserve is virtually depleted. That was one reason Yeutter
gave earlier this week when he announced a liberalization of the
government's 1990 wheat program _ to help rebuild U.S. stockpiles,
including the special reserve.

   A bipartisan group of senators, including the
majority leader, unveiled legislation today rivaling President
Bush's proposal for improving air quality in smog-choked cities.
   The bill would, like the Bush measure, tighten automobile
emissions requirements but does not include two key elements of the
president's proposal: a forced switch from today's gasoline to
clean-burning motor fuels in severely polluted cities; and
permission for automakers to average emissions by engine category to
comply with anti-pollution requirements.
   Instead, the rival measure would require each car to meet the
emissions standards, as under current law, and would allow
automakers to choose whether to build cars for alternative fuels or
reduce pollution in other ways.
   The legislation, like the Bush measure, sets new deadlines
ranging from 5 to 20 years for cities to clean up their smog
problems. But the placement of cities in the various categories
would be different.
   ``I expect this bill will cut auto emissioins by 50 percent by
the year 2000,'' said chief sponsor Max Baucus, D-Mont., adding that
the Bush plan ``won't get us across the finish line'' in improving
air quality.
   The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., the
ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, and was
strongly endorsed by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
   In setting new ozone deadlines _ 101 geographical areas failed to
meet the now-expired cleanup timetables _ the new legislation would
only give Los Angeles 20 years to clean up its ozone problem. The
Bush legislation would allow three others areas, New York City,
Houston and Gary, Ind., to take 20 years.
   The Baucus legislation would give those three cities 15 years,
but like the Bush measure, would force those with the longest
extensions to institute the most severe anti-pollution measures.
   The Bush measure is before the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee, which will consider amendments next week.
   Chafee is not only co-sponsoring the Baucus bill but also is the
chief Senate sponsor of the Bush legislation.
   Chafee's agreement to back the Baucus ozone provisions places him
at odds with parts of the Bush plan, which had backing from only
three Democratic senators when it was introduced last month.
   Asked why he's backing two bills with conflicting provisions,
Chafee said he agrees with the Baucus approach for ozone reduction.
The senator said he agreed to sponsor the administration bill _ even
though he doesn't back some of its provisions _ because it was the
``first effort an administration has made in eight years'' to tackle
the nation's air quality problem.
   Former President Reagan did not propose a comprehensive clean air
revision during his two terms in office.
   It marks the second time in two days that a chief sponsor of the
Bush clean air bill has signaled disagreement with a major portion
of the legislation.
   On Thursday the chief Democratic sponsor in the House, Rep. John
D. Dingell, D-Mich., expressed strong reservations with Bush's
proposed cap on future emissions of sulfur dioxide, the chief
ingredient of acid rain. The limit would make it difficult for
utilities, the main source of acid rain, to grow and take on new
customers, Dingell argued.
   Baucus said his legislation would tighten tailpipe standards for
autos, with the goal of cutting car pollution in half by the year
2000.
   But it would not force use of clean-burning motor vehicle fuels
in severely polluted cities.
   The Bush administration calls its clean fuels program the ``most
innovative and far-reaching component'' of its ozone-cutting
proposals. The administration would force a portion of the car fleet
in the most seriously polluted cities to operate on clean burning
fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, propane
or reformulated gasoline.
   The president wants a sale schedule for such vehicles, beginning
with 500,000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year, and going
up to one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004.
   The Baucus proposal would give automakers discretion in deciding
how to reduce car pollution, and hand them the option of using clean
fuels or other methods.
   ``I don't think it's wise to mandate change in the marketplace so
that certain users have to use certain kinds of cars,'' Baucus said.

   Former President Reagan left the hospital
for his home in Los Angeles today, tipping his hat to well-wishers
and revealing a shaved spot on his head where Mayo Clinic physicians
performed skull surgery a week ago.
   Reagan, 78, and his wife, Nancy, boarded a privately owned DC-9
jet, which took off shortly after 10 a.m.
   About 100 people, many of them travelers at the Rochester
airport, gathered as the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band
played while Reagan said good-bye to Mayo Clinic officials and to
retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs.
   Beahrs, a friend of Mrs. Reagan's late father, who also was a
physician, said Reagan was returning home in good health.
   ``I'm just very happy for him and for her,'' he said. ``Any
operation is a serious one, but this was fairly simple and he came
through it very well.''
   Scott Patterson, pilot of the DC-9, said the weather from
Rochester in southeastern Minnesota to Los Angeles looked clear for
the 3{-hour flight. He said the plane belonged to a friend of the
Reagans', whose name he would not disclose.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said Thursday that the Reagans
would go directly to their home in Los Angeles after the flight.
   Weinberg also said Thursday that doctors were ``completely
satisfied'' with Reagan's recovery. The former president had been
recuperating at St. Marys Hospital since doctors on Sept. 8 drained
fluid that had built up on his brain after he was thrown from a
horse on July 4.
   On Thursday, Reagan met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who
was in the state to give a speech, and Soviet parliament member
Boris Yeltsin.
   ``It seemed as if he feels pretty good,'' Yeltsin said after the
20-minute meeting. ``We've never had a personal meeting before.''
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin was in Minneapolis for a private dinner
Wednesday with business leaders. He said he squeezed the Reagan
visit into his week-long tour of the United States ``simply as a
sign of respect for him and an opportunity to wish him a rapid
recovery.''
   Yeltsin brought Reagan a bouquet of red roses and, according to
Weinberg, told him: ``You gave the start to the very perceptible
warming of relations between the two countries. Your contribution to
this was enormous. You were very wise, courageous and tactful in the
way you went about it. I am very grateful to you for this.''
   Dumped as Communist Party chief in Moscow in 1987 after
criticizing some of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies,
Yeltsin was overwhelmingly elected to parliament this year, running
as an outsider. He has been urging Gorbachev to quicken the pace of
reform in the Soviet Union.
   Yeltsin said he hadn't requested Reagan's help in his push for
Soviet economic change. ``I thought that would have been a little
tactless, since he's in the hospital,'' he said.

   Five astronauts who will dispatch a
nuclear-powered probe to Jupiter in October concluded a practice
countdown aboard space shuttle Atlantis today, finishing up a bit
late because of minor computer problems.
   The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress
rehearsal for launch day to its finish, even though stormy weather
near the Kennedy Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff.
   The countdown ended at 11:10 a.m., about 10 minutes later than
planned. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said launch crews needed extra
time to fix two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's
systems.
   Despite the problems, she said, ``Everything proceeded very
smoothly in this dress rehearsal. It was a good test run for
everyone on the launch team and also for the astronauts.''
   The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of
the count. It was the last time they will be inside the space
shuttle until launch day.
   Commander Don Williams told reporters Thursday he and his
crewmates looked forward to the exercise ``because it's a real treat
to get on board the ship ... the ship is pretty special to us.''
   The other crew members are pilot Mike McCully and mission
specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen Baker.
   The countdown test, which began Thursday, covers the final 24
hours of an actual countdown and provides training for both the
astronauts and the launch team.
   Atlantis' liftoff is scheduled for Oct. 12, but NASA will not set
a firm date until the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness
review on Oct. 3.
   During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are
to release the Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year voyage
to explore Jupiter. The craft is to orbit the planet and fire a
probe into its atmosphere.
   Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the
launch, either through court action or with their bodies, because
Galileo is powered by two nuclear generators fueled by plutonium-238
dioxide.
   If the activists cannot get a federal court injunction, ``we are
going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad
to halt the launch,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the opposition groups.
   A recent space agency safety analysis concluded ``the probability
of an accident resulting in a release of plutonium ranges from
1-in-2,500 to 1-in-2 million and any release from these low
probability events would be very small.''
   Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power for 22
earlier U.S. spacecraft, including six manned Apollo moon flights
and the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which recently sent back pictures of
the planet Neptune.
   The five astronauts flying the mission say they are confident the
nuclear generators are safe.
   ``I wish everybody had the insight I had and the access to the
reports that I've read, because I think if they did they would not
have any of the fears they are talking about,'' Baker told reporters
Thursday.
   Asked about the possibility of the protesters physically stopping
the launch, Lucid said, ``The Kennedy Space Center has real good
security folks here, and they're working very hard to protect the
vehicle and protect the premises, and I expect that's the way it
will be. So I don't expect any delays because of that.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of rifle-toting police
surrounded a courthouse where two Colombians faced cocaine charges
after authorities in this city north of Maine arrested four heavily
armed Venezuelans.
   Officials said they did not know if the Venezuelans had planned
to interfere with Thursday's judicial proceedings in Fredericton,
the provincial capital 125 miles southeast of Edmunston.
   Sgt. Mark Flemming of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said he
ordered the heavy security because ``we are assessing the situation
regarding the situation in Colombia,'' where officials have launched
a crackdown on drug traffickers.
   ``An ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure,'' he said.
   The Mounted Police and Edmundston authorities arrested the
Venezuelans Wednesday and seized weapons from two cars and a van
near downtown Edmundston, a pulp- and paper-producing town nearly
300 miles northeast of Augusta on the tip of Maine.
   Police led the men into a provincial court where they were
charged with a variety of weapons offenses.
   ``Innocent, innocent,'' one of the handcuffed men told reporters.
``No speak English,'' another said.
   The men were identified as Tito Sanchez, Euovio Manzano, Osvaldo
Gonzales and Wilmer Ramon Zanabria. Court documents did not state
their ages or hometowns.
   Only two of the men had lawyers. All were remanded in custody
until Tuesday when they will reappear for bail hearings. Further
charges may yet be filed against them.
   Authorities said the weapons found in their vehicles included an
Uzi submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles and more than
3,000 rounds of ammunition. Also seized were six automatic pistols,
a .22-caliber pistol, tear gas, a deactivated Japanese grenade,
burglary equipment and an electric zap gun used to knock people out.
   In a related incident, a fifth man with Venezuelan identification
was arrested at a car rental agency Thursday. Police said they
seized two handguns at the scene.
   Bill d'Amours of the Canandian Immigration Department said the
Venezuelans' passports were sent to the Mounted Police forensic lab
in Ottawa to check if the documents are valid.
   He said it was not known how the men entered Canada.
   Two of their vehicles had New York licenses, including one stolen
plate, police said. The vehicle carrying most of the weapons had
been rented in Fredericton.
   The four were carrrying maps marking a destination in New
Brunswick that police would not identify.
   The Colombian suspects, Jose Ali Galindo-Escobar and Fernando
Augusto Mendoza-Jarmillio, both 36, Thursday were ordered held for
trial next month.
   The two were charged with importing drugs in April after police
made Canada's largest cocaine seizure when they found about 1,100
pounds of the drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift
airstrip outside Fredericton.
   The Mounted Police say Colombian drug cartels have been routing
more drugs through the Canadian Maritime provinces because the
United States has tightened up its borders in an effort to block
drug traffickers.
   ``As somebody put it to me today, it feels like the long arm of
incivility in Colombia is reaching into New Brunswick,'' said
provincial Premier Frank McKenna. ``I think everyone in New
Brunswick feels a great sense of unease.''

   Nervous workers met with counselors today
as they returned to the printing plant where seven people were
killed by a former co-worker who swore he'd get even after being
dismissed for mental disability.
   ``I'm thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for another
job. My nerves are shot,'' said pressman Steve Pate. ``If I go back
in there, I'll be waiting for someone else to do the same thing and
I can't handle that.''
   Joseph T. Wesbecker, armed with several semiautomatic weapons,
went from floor to floor shooting people at the Standard Gravure
Corp. on Thursday morning, killing seven and wounding 13 before
taking his own life. One co-worker said Wesbecker had been ``looking
for bosses.''
   Workers began gathering at the plant this morning, and officials
said 15 counselors were on hand to help them discuss and work
through their grief.
   ``I'm looking forward to that. I need that,'' said pressman
Mickey Kelly, who was only a few feet from Wesbecker at one point
during the shooting.
   Forklift operator Bernard Williams said he would take a week's
vacation.
   ``I'm not ready to come back because of everything that's
happened. Things like this could happen again,'' Williams said. ``I
just don't feel like I can go in there and work.
   ``There are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this.
It's a shame that management treats people like dogs. They should
treat employees like human beings instead of just a number.''
   Pate agreed. ``It's push, push, push. They want us to do more
work. They want you to work all the overtime you can. If you don't,
they send you home. It's more than people can handle anymore.''
   Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman, was placed on permanent
disability leave last year because of mental illness, police said.
   ``He carried a big grudge because of that,'' said George Oswine,
a former co-worker. ``He said before he left he would get even. I
remember that.''
   Oswine said Wesbecker had begun collecting guns since his leave.
   Another former co-worker, pressman Joe White, said Wesbecker's
talk centered on guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine. White, whose
brother Lloyd was killed in the rampage, said Wesbecker thought of
himself as a soldier.
   ``This guy's been talking about this for a year,'' White said.
   ``I guess nobody believed him,'' said Dan Frazier, president of
the union local.
   Frazier said Wesbecker had become more upset recently because he
thought his disability benefits were about to be cut off.
   Relatives told police that Wesbecker was a manic depressive who
had attempted suicide three times. Wesbecker also had voluntarily
spent time in mental institutions, said Lt. Jeff Moody, commander of
the police homicide division.
   Wesbecker entered the building at 8:30 a.m. EDT and took the
elevator to the third floor.
   ``He just came off the elevator shooting,'' said Kathy Wilkins,
an assistant buyer. ``The elevator doors opened and he started
firing.''
   Two receptionists apparently were the first to be hit. Both were
wounded; one later died.
   Police found four other victims on the third floor, where the
executive offices and bindery are located. Wesbecker went from there
down to the basement, where five victims were found, then up to the
ground floor, where six victims and the gunman were discovered.
   Wesbecker was face down in a pool of blood on the floor of a
pressroom.
   Two other wounded people had been removed by medics before police
arrived, and another victim was on the street outside.
   Former co-worker John Tingle said he greeted Wesbecker as he saw
him coming around a corner in the basement carrying an AK-47 assault
rifle.
   He quoted Wesbecker as saying, ``I told them I'd be back. Get
away from me.''
   Tingle obliged and Wesbecker proceeded up the stairs to the first
floor.
   ``He didn't fire at me, I guess because he liked me,'' Tingle
said. But ``the guys he had shot in the pressroom were friends too.''
   Police Maj. Ed Mercer said police had not determined how many
workers were in the building, but it was ``a bunch. They were
stampeding over us as we were trying to get in.''
   Sgt. Frank Portman, one of the first officers on the scene, said
he felt helpless.
   ``Every place we went we were stepping over people and blood,''
Portman said. ``People were wailing, wanting help. And with a
shooting victim, there's not much you can do.''
   Three of the wounded were in critical condition this morning,
including a 45-year-old man whose condition was described as ``very
critical,'' said officials at Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville, where more than 100 doctors were called in to help treat
them. Five other people were in serious condition.
   Wesbecker's weapons included the AK-47, two MAC-11 semiautomatic
machine pistols, a .38-caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic pistol and a
bayonet, said Police Chief Richard Dotson. He carried a duffel bag
full of ammunition.
   Wesbecker reportedly had made threats against the company, which
prints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but
Standard Gravure President Michael Shea said he did not know of any
threats.
   ``I'm at a loss to speculate on anything,'' Shea said. ``What's
going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the
people who are involved.''
   A woman who answered the telephone at a house where Wesbecker's
mother was staying said the family did not want to comment.
   ``We're just in shock like everybody else. We had to find out
over the television. No one called us,'' said the woman, who did not
identify herself. ``I guess he was just a sick person. That's all.''
   Wesbecker was divorced twice in the past 11 years. He and his
first wife had two sons, James, 22, and Joseph, 26.
   ``I'm just tore up inside,'' Joseph Wesbacker said Thursday as he
left his mother's home in Louisville.
   Wesbecker and his second wife, Brenda, were also divorced, but
they had been living together since 1987, Moody said.
   Police said Brenda Wesbecker didn't want Wesbecker to keep any
weapons around their home and didn't know that he had any. Police
described her as ``shocked'' by the shootings.

   A small cargo plane crashed in a suburban
yard today just after takeoff from Ontario International Airport,
killing the pilot and damaging the house but causing no other deaths
or injuries, police said.
   ``Witnesses reported that a propeller and pieces of an engine
fell off shortly after takeoff,'' said Jim Vandever, a police
detective who was at the scene.
   The Piper 31 Navajo, leased by United Parcel Service, was on a
scheduled flight to Santa Barbara, Vandever said.
   He said the pilot, who was not immediately identified, was
pronounced dead at the scene.
   The twin-engine plane crashed in a middle-class residential
neighborhood northwest of the runway about 6:50 a.m., scarring a
home.
   ``There were broken windows and fire damage to the front of the
house, but it's still standing and it looks like you could still
inhabit it,'' Vandever said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was to investigate at
the accident site, in San Bernardino County about 40 miles east of
Los Angeles.

   A hurricane watch was posted in the eastern
Caribbean today as Hurricane Hugo churned westward with winds of 125
mph and some stregthening predicted, forecasters said.
   The hurricane watch was posted from St. Lucia to the British
Virgin Islands, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the
islands of Barbados and St. Vincent, according to the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``The fringe effects of the storm are already being felt,'' said
forecaster Gil Clark. ``The seas are already getting rough off the
islands because of swells emanating off the storm.''
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was located near 14.4 north latitude
and 54.1 west longitude, or about 500 miles east southeast of
Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. The storm was moving west at 15
mph, down from a peak of 20 mph Wednesday night.
   ``The only way it's going to miss those islands is it's going to
have to swerve northward,'' Clark said.
   He added that forecasters saw no indications Hugo would turn that
way. ``We've been lucky this year. We've had two or three storms
head toward the islands and then turn north. Maybe we'll get lucky
again but it doesn't look like it in ths case.''
   Three of this season's Atlantic hurricanes _ Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle _ turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean, forecaster Hal Gerrish said.
   Last year, killer Hurricane Gilbert held the westward course,
pounding Jamaica and Mexico.
   Hugo developed quickly into a major storm. Its highest sustained
winds rose by more than 35 mph Thursday alone and were estimated at
120 mph this morning, inching up to 125 mph at noon.
   ``It really was amazing how fast the eye formed and it almost
doubled its winds,'' Clark said. Conditions favored the hurricane's
strengthening today; forecasters expected no change in its motion.
   Hugo's winds classify it as a 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, a
sort of Richter scale for storms. Gilbert, the strongest hurricane
on record, was a 5 _ the scale's highest rank.
   A reconnaissance plane was to be dispatched to investigate the
storm, Clark said.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane
season. Tropical storms have sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach
hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.

   A man banned from a bowling tournament
because his hair was too long has been awarded $3,000 in damages by
the St. Paul Human Rights Commission.
   The commission voted unanimously Wednesday night to uphold Joe
Big Bear's discrimination complaint against the Amateur Bowler's
Tour, a national organization that conducts local bowling
tournaments.
   Big Bear, 35, of St. Paul, wanted to bowl in a tournament at St.

   The Human Rights Commission ordered the organization to pay him
$1,000 in compensatory damages and $2,000 in punitive damages. The
organization also was ordered to pay $1,300 in attorney's fees and
costs of the investigation. In addition, it must change its rules
and remove the discriminatory language.
   Scott Miller, local director of the Amateur Bowler's Tour, had no
comment Thursday. His attorney, Don Horton, had argued at the July

grooming.
   The organization has 30 days to appeal.

   An attorney said he was startled to learn
about the indictment of a client on drug charges. The client died in
May.
   Mark Klugheit said he read Thursday in The Philadelphia Inquirer
of the indictment of pharmacist Sheldon M. Markind for allegedly
trafficking in prescription drugs.
   Klugheit said that the Drug Enforcement Administration had
investigated Markind for three years. When Markind died of a heart
attack May 18, Klugheit said, he notified the federal authorities
but prosecutors never returned his calls.
   ``I had assumed there was no further interest in the matter,''
Klugheit said Thursday. He said he called the U.S. Attorney's Office
to tell them the man they planned to prosecute was dead.
   J. Alvin Stout, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case,
said that Klugheit's calls earlier this year had not been relayed to
him.
   ``And we never received anything written about the death,'' Stout
said.
   Stout said that even though Klugheit told him by telephone of his
client's death, he would need to see a death certificate to formally
drop charges.

   Hundreds of workers outside an
office building thought it was part of the fire drill when people
began gasping for breath, but the smoke turned out to be real and
killed one man, newspapers reported Friday.
   The incident occurred Thursday in Ipoh, 120 miles north of Kuala
Lumpur.
   After five years, the Fire Department thought it was time to have
a fire drill at the city's eight-story state secretariat building
and informed the staff of its plans. To make it realistic, smoke was
released into some rooms.
   The 1,000 government workers began fleeing as part of the drill,
but 89 were overcome by smoke, and one of them, a 44-year-old man
identified as Mohamad Isa Mohamad Tahir, died as he clung to a ledge
on the second floor.
   The New Straits Times Daily, The Star and other newspapers
reported that the other 88 people were rescued and that 23 of them
were hospitalized.
   Mohamed Salleh Khatib Ali said he was in the bathroom on the
second floor when he heard two explosions.
   ``I rushed out and was choked by smoke. I climbed out of a window
and stood on the ledge. Then I heard shouts from below that someone
was about to fall.
   ``I looked up and saw Isa a short distance away on the same
ledge. I ran over and grabbed him. I could see that he had turned
pale and was gasping for air. After about five minutes, I couldn't
feel his heartbeat,'' he told the newspapers.
   Kamli A. Rani, the Fire Department officer in charge of the
drill, said two generators were used to emit smoke and that the
smoke was not poisonous. He said the staff was told there would be a
drill Thursday but was not told what time it would be.
   Police said they would investigate the incident.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker continued to
receive huge bonuses while the troubled TV ministry was laying off
hundreds of workers, witnesses testified today in his federal fraud
and conspiracy trial.
   ``I had to go to social services and apply for welfare and food
stamps,'' said Joanie Ames, a former PTL payroll clerk who was laid
off in November 1985 along with 285 other PTL employees.
   Less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a
$500,000 bonus for Bakker. He had also received other bonuses during
the year.
   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer of Oakland, Calif., who joined the board
in November 1985, testified that the largest bonus she remembered
approving was $150,000 plus taxes.
   But when asked by prosecutor Deborah Smith if she would have
approved a $500,000 bonus for Bakker, Ms. Spencer said: ``If
everybody else agreed with it, I would have.''
   She said she trusted Bakker to keep board members informed of the
ministry's financial condition. ``I just trusted him, period,'' she
said.
   Prosecutors contend Bakker diverted $3.7 million in PTL funds to
fund his lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 counts against
him, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more
than $5 million.
   On Thursday, Bakker's right-hand man at PTL testified that the
evangelist gave his TV viewers phony fund-raising figures and knew
that $265,000 in church funds went to Jessica Hahn as hush money.
   Richard Dortch, PTL's former executive vice president, told
jurors the ministry kept two sets of fund-raising figures _ a secret
one with the actual numbers and a phony one with lower numbers that
Bakker read to TV viewers.
   ``No one understands this plan really but me,'' Dortch recalled
Bakker telling him.
   Later, Dortch testified that Bakker personally approved paying
Hahn to keep her quiet about their 1980 sexual encounter in a
Florida hotel room. Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 as the
encounter was about to be made public.
   Dortch, 57, was indicted with Bakker, and last month pleaded
guilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy in a plea bargain in
exchange for his testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced to eight
years in prison and fined $200,000.
   Dortch, who joined PTL in December 1983, said by 1987 almost all
PTL revenues came from sale of ``lifetime partnerships,'' supposedly
good for lodging each year for life at Heritage USA, PTL's Christian
theme park near Fort Mill, S.C. He said the money was desperately
needed to cover operating costs, including a biweekly payroll of
nearly $1 million.
   Bakker considered the partnerships an unlimited ``gold mine,''
according to Dortch.
   He said Bakker told him: ``This was the easiest money we could
raise, and there would be no limit to what amount could be raised in
the days to come.''
   The trial has included testimony from former partners who said
they sent Bakker $1,000 for lodging but were turned away when they
tried to claim their rooms.
   Bakker was willing to oversell the partnerships because he was
convinced he could manipulate the comings and goings of partnership
owners ``by getting partners here when we wanted them to come and by
keeping them away ... when we don't want them to come,'' Dortch
testified.
   Dortch, released a week ago from a hospital where he was treated
for an undisclosed ailment, also testified he told Bakker about
calls from Ms. Hahn threatening a lawsuit over their sexual
encounter.
   Dortch said Bakker told him: ```I have not raped anyone or
assaulted anyone, but there is a problem. ... Do what you have to do
to get it solved.'''
   Dortch said he paid Ms. Hahn $2,000 from his own pocket and later
borrowed $10,000 from another PTL employee for Ms. Hahn in 1984.
   Dortch arranged a February 1985 meeting in Los Angeles with Ms.
Hahn's lawyer and handed over $265,000. The money came from Roe
Messner, a PTL contractor, who later billed the ministry for work
never completed on PTL's Passion Play amphitheater.
   After the Los Angeles meeting, Dortch said he saw Bakker at
Heritage USA's Main Street shopping arcade and told him about the
payoff. He testified Bakker said, ``I don't want to know and I don't
want to hear about it.''

   The bodies of 18 men were found near
the central city of Kandy on Friday, and residents said the victims
appeared to be Sinhalese radicals killed by pro-government groups.
   The government denied knowing the identities of the victims or
their killers but said two radicals were killed and 279 people
arrested in the continuing crackdown on militant members of the
Sinhalese majority.
   At least 18 partially burned bodies were found in three places
near Kandy, said residents speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In telephone interviews, they said they believed the victims were
Sinhalese radicals killed by pro-government vigilante groups.
Military officials in Colombo confirmed the bodies were found but
did not say who the dead were or who killed them.
   Opposition politicians and human rights organizations allege the
government has set up death squads to counter the campaign of
assassinations by the People's Liberation Front, an ultranationalist
guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government.
   The government denies the charge.
   Security forces arrested 279 suspects since Thursday in the
latest crackdown on the Sinhalese front in the south and center of
the island nation, a government statement said. The regions are
dominated by Sinhalese and are areas where the radical groups draw
most support.
   At least two radicals were killed during an army operation
Thursday in Matale district's Udwelgala village, 65 miles northeast
of Colombo, the communique said.
   It said at least 28 government buildings were burned by the
radicals during the last four days.
   It said 26 ``wanted subversives,'' the government term for
radicals, surrendered in central Sri Lanka during that period.
   The crackdown was launched after a conference of political
parties Wednesday aimed at ending Sri Lanka's ethnic strife.
   Although invited, the Sinhalese front did not attend the meeting.
The front has also rejected the government's earlier peace offers.
   The government says at least 5,000 people have been killed in the
2-year-old Sinhalese radical movement.
   Thousands of others have died in a war by the Tamil minority for
an independent Tamil nation.
   Former President Junius R. Jayewardene tried to end the Tamil war
with an accord in 1987, but it sparked the backlash by Sinhalese who
claimed it granted too many concessions to the Tamils.
   The radicals also oppose the deployment of Indian peacekeeping
soldiers in the northeast, invited to supervise the accord.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
claim they are discriminated against in jobs and education.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.

   Rockwell International Corp. may begin to shut down
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant as early as today unless
federal agencies decide how it should handle the operation's wastes,
the company said.
   Rockwell, which operates the plant for the Department of Energy,
said Thursday it needs to know what its liability is for the
radioactive and hazardous wastes that are being stockpiled at the
plant where plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs are produced.
   ``I know we've expressed that concern to DOE, and have asked that
they reach some kind of resolution, by (today) if possible,'' said
Rockwell spokesman Dennis Hurtt.
   He said the company has various contingency plans if no
resolution is reached, including the beginning of a shutdown
procedure.
   ``That would always be an option, I suppose,'' he said. ``It's
something we'll have to wait and see.''
   Rockwell and Energy Department officials said there were no
further developments this morning. Officials with the Energy
Department and Environmental Protection Agency were working on the
matter in Washington.
   ``We're waiting at this point for an answer,'' said DOE spokesman
Tom Walton, acting public information officer at Rocky Flats.
   Rockwell addressed its concerns to the DOE, which owns the
facility, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Colorado
Health Department and the U.S. Justice Department.
   The company said it is concerned improper handling of wastes can
lead to criminal charges against Rockwell employees and managers. A
mix of radioactive and hazardous wastes has built up for which there
is no federally approved disposal site available.
   ``We've got to have someone make some decisions,'' Hurtt said.
``The regulations have been changing and keep changing _ in recent
years very rapidly.''
   This is not the first time the liability issue has come up, or
that a possible closure has been threatened. But the earlier threat
in July came from within the Energy Department, which feared its
officials could face criminal charges over environmental violations
at the site 16 miles northeast of Denver.
   The acting DOE area manager at the time, Edward S. Goldberg,
threatened to close down the plant unless some immunity was granted
for those violations. As a result, the EPA and DOE agreed to come up
with a resolution to the situation by today _ the same deadline set
by Rockwell.
   An FBI affidavit unsealed in June alleged that workers at the
nuclear weapons plant dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead
to water supplies for four Denver suburbs and illegally burned
hazardous wastes at the site.
   Those allegations are being reviewed before a special grand jury.
   Rockwell has said its own investigation produced no evidence of
wrongdoing.

   A gunman demanding morphine hijacked a
taxi Friday and took two hostages on an eight-hour ride through
Copenhagen before he was arrested, police and news reports said. No
one was injured.
   The 34-year-old hijacker, wielding a sawed-off shotgun,
commandeered the cab, took the driver hostage and later forced a
27-year-old woman into the taxi, news reports said.
   The man contacted police on radio, demanding morphine and a
syringe, and said he planned to kill himself with an overdose.
Newspaper reports said he was distraught over family problems.
   Police followed the taxi at a discreet distance as it drove
through the city streets for eight hours.
   The ordeal ended when police promised to let the man go free and
he released the hostages. He was later arrested in a Copenhagen
apartment, they said.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Sweeney Todd'' is Stephen Sondheim's most
relentless and uncompromising musical, a brilliant but chilling tale
of revenge.
   That chill permeated the original 1979 production _ from demonic
performances by Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury to Harold Prince's
Brechtian direction to the mammoth, black iron-foundry sets of
Eugene and Franne Lee.
   Now, in an intimate revival which opened Thursday at Broadway's
Circle in the Square, director Susan Schulman has sought to
humanize, if not soften, the story and its leading characters. The
change makes for a remarkable reworking of what is still the most
unnerving musical ever to reach Broadway.
   This is a much more personal ``Sweeney Todd'' than the original,
which seemed, at times, to be more an indictment of the Industrial
Revolution for what it had done to British society than the story of
real people.
   Sorrow and even a little pity for Todd and his cohorts creep into
the bloodthirsty goings-on at the Circle in the Square. That's
something the brutal but effective original production didn't allow.
   Hugh Wheeler's underrated book, taken from an adaptation by
British playwright Edward Bond, seems better than it was 10 years
ago. A model of compression, it tells of Todd, a barber who returns
to London after an unjust exile and imprisonment in Australia. He
finds his wife gone and his daughter the ward of the lascivious
Judge Turpin.
   Todd plots revenge with the help of Mrs. Lovett, a dotty maker of
meat pies. The barber slits the throats of his customers, and their
corpses provide fresh ingredients for Mrs. Lovett's delicacies.
   Much of what Schulman has accomplished has been dictated by the
in-the-round playing area. The show began life last spring at the
York Theater Company, a tiny off-off-Broadway troupe which uses an
East Side school gymnasium for its productions. On Broadway, the
director and set designer James Morgan surround the audience with
scenery. A panorama of London tenements of the late 19th century
covers the theater's walls. So do clotheslines of drying laundry.
   At one end of the stage sprawls Mrs. Lovett's pie shop and at the
other the home of Judge Turpin. In between, the cobblestone streets
of London become the arena for much of the crowd action. A fog
machine works overtime to create the right smoky atmosphere.
   Bob Gunton's portrayal of the title character echoes the Len
Cariou original. His voice may not be as strong as Cariou's, but his
acting has more range.
   There are more changes in the character of Mrs. Lovett, seen here
as a woman willing to do anything for love rather than the grotesque
comic figure so wonderfully portrayed by Lansbury. Beth Fowler is a
softer, giddier Mrs. Lovett than her predecessor. She's also a
better singer and gives a sweeter emphasis to such comic songs as
``By the Sea'' and ``The Worst Pies in London.''
   Sondheim's monumental score is a study in contrasts. Haunting
melodies such as ``Not While I'm Around,'' ``Johanna'' and ``Pretty
Woman'' clash with much harsher numbers such as ``The Ballad of
Sweeney Todd,'' ``Epiphany'' and ``City on Fire.''
   The supporting cast must grapple with some of the most difficult
songs in the show. There are expert portraits and some notable
singing by David Barron as the evil judge and Michael McCarty as the
porcine Beadle.
   Also turning in fine work are Jim Walton as Anthony, the young
sailor in love with Todd's daughter Johanna, and Eddie Korbich as
Tobias, Mrs. Lovett's young assistant in the pie shop. Korbich
delivers a touching version of ``Not While I'm Around,'' the lullaby
Tobias sings to Mrs. Lovett. But Bill Nabel misses the comedy of
Pirelli, Todd's ill-fated Italian competitor, and Gretchen Kingsley
as Johanna sings harshly.
   ``Sweeney Todd'' originally succeeded as a large-scale
combination of Grand Guignol and melodrama. It was a horror story
that didn't allow the audience to get close to the characters. By
reducing the scale, Schulman does _ and makes the show more
effective and more unsettling. Her villains are much more vulnerable
and everyday ``normal.''
   At the end of the musical, when the actors turn and point their
fingers at the audience, Schulman makes the point that there may be
a little bit of ``Sweeney Todd'' lurking in all of us.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``By forcing us to face Mr.
Sondheim's music and the feelings it contains so intensely, Ms.
Schulman doesn't obliterate the Prince production; she creates an
alternative. Such is the depth of Mr. Sondheim's achievement that
`Sweeney Todd' can support radically different interpretations.''
   Linda Winer, New York Newsday: ``The show ... is a fast, raging,
beautifully bittersweet and deliciously junky Grand Guignol.''
   Don Nelsen, Daily News: ```Todd' is too long at 2 hours and 55
minutes, but its music and performances are worth it.''

<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea has rejected a
South Korean proposal to create a single Korean commonwealth as an
interim measure to unify the rival Korean states, officials said
Friday.
   The Rodong Shinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling
Workers' Party, rejected the new South Korean plan as perpetuating
the division of the peninsula, said officials at South Korea's
National Unification Board.
   ``This (proposal) is only aimed at legalizing the existence of
two states on the peninsula and making them live separately
forever,'' the officials quoted the newspaper as saying.
   South Koran President Roh Tae-woo on Monday announced the
proposal, which calls for a single commonwealth as an interim
measure in merging the nations.
   To create a commonwealth, both Koreas should adopt a single
constitution, under which a free election should be held to form a
unified Korean state, Roh said.
   While rejecting Roh's proposal, the North Korean newspaper
repeated the North's long-standing formula to unify the peninsula
under a confederation that would keep the two sides' conflicting
political and economic systems intact, the officials said.
   The paper also demanded that the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty be withdrawn before
creation of a single Korean state, officials said.

<HEAD>Early AIDS Detection, Treatment Could Cost Billions: Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early detection and treatment of those infected
with the AIDS virus may help avert one of the most serious epidemics
of our time, but the cost of doing so may push the U.S. health
system into chaos, medical researchers said today.
   The cost of finding and treating those who carry the virus but
are not yet ill could reach $5 billion or more a year,with urban
areas the hardest hit, researchers reported in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   ``While the economic challenge of early intervention is
substantial for hard-hit regions, it can be managed if the federal
government takes on greater financial responsibility,'' said the
researchers from New York's Montefiore Medical Center and the
universities of North Carolina and California.
   Recent advances in the treatment of those infected with the virus
but who do not yet have full-fledged cases of AIDS make a compelling
case for expanding early treatment, said the researchers, led by
Montefiore's Peter Arno.
   Because of new antiviral therapies that slow the disease and
drugs that can prevent a common form of pneumonia associated with
the disease, early detection may slow the fatal disease's progress,
the researchers said.
   They suggested that policymakers devise a strategy that expands
the capabilities of hospital-affiliated out-patient clinics to
accommodate better patient monitoring and increased counseling.
   The authors estimate that the annual cost for a patient with no
symptoms would be about $854 until drug intervention is needed. Once
drugs and increased medical care are needed, a midrange estimate
would be about $9,600 annually, they said.
   If treatment were available to half of those infected with the
HIV virus today, the cost would be more than $4.8 billion, assuming
more than 1 million people currently carry the virus but are not yet
diagnosed with AIDS.
   The article also suggested overpricing by drug companies accounts
for a large portion of early treatment costs. Drug therapy will
account for approximately 80 percent of the cost of early
intervention, they said.
   One company's ability to market a drug without price restraints
has led to a quadrupling of its parent company's stock, it said.
   ``Although drug companies have a legitimate need to recoup their
(research) investments ... the public expects reasonable prices for
life-saving drugs,'' they wrote.

Roman Catholic Church to end their nation's 10-year-old civil war,
officials said.
   A text of the agreement calls for talks every month, probably in
Costa Rica, to work out details of a cease-fire, of legalizing the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas as a political
party, and of integrating the fighters back into civilian life.
   Roman Catholic Church leaders will act as mediators during the
talks, which will also be monitored by international observers,
unless both sides agree that a specific meeting should be private,
sources close to the negotiations said.
   Both of these points were concessions made by President Alfredo
Cristiani's U.S.-supported rightist government.
   ``We worked until one o'clock this morning. Everything went very
well. The text will be released today,'' said Jose Abelardo Torre, a
businessman and one of the five members of the Salvadoran government
delegation.
   Torre said both sides were holding a brief meeting this morning
to exchange more views and finalize details before issuing the joint
statement.
   Government delegates had been strongly opposed to the rebel
demand that church leaders and international observers be present at
the talks, arguing the dispute was a Salvadoran affair.
   The government also wanted the talks to be held every two months,
instead of monthly, as the rebels demanded.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a guerrilla leader and member of the
leftist delegation, confirmed that both sides agreed the talks will
be held monthly.
   Asked if it meant the rebel demands had prevailed, she replied:
``I believe so, because they were the correct ones.''
   Torre and Martinez gave separate interviews to The Associated
Press.
   The Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of El Salvador, Gregorio Rosa
Chavez, described the mood at the discussions as ``stupendous.''
   Speaking at a news conference Thursday night, he said the main
issues of the 10-point document were the cease-fire and bringing the
rebels into Salvadoran politicial life.
   Rosa Chavez said the first meeting probably would be held next
month.
   ``It's clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement
that they should be attempting to reach not just a cease-fire but an
end to hostilities,'' Rosa Chavez said.
   ``I'm very content. I believe this is a very important day for
all Salvadorans,'' he said. ``You can't solve 10 years of war in 10
days, but putting ourselves on the path to peace is an important
achievement.''
   The current round of talks began Wednesday and were the first in
two years between the guerrilla group and the government. The talks
also were the first for the government of President Cristiani, who
took office June 1.
   Fighting continued Thursday in El Salvador, despite a unilateral
truce declared by the guerrillas.
   Army spokesmen in San Salvador said four rebels were killed and
that two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded. He also said a
helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched.
   Clandestine rebel radio in El Salvador said the army had provoked
clashes by moving into guerrilla-held territory in the north and
east.
   The civil war has claimed 70,000 lives.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a
petition by Ferdinand Marcos to return home and agreed with
President Corazon Aquino that the former president's return would
threaten the nation.
   The judges voted 8-7 against Marcos' return, supporting the
government position that it would ``wipe away the gains achieved
during the past few years and lead to total economic collapse.''
   ``We cannot argue with that determination,'' the court wrote in a
30-page opinion.
   Marcos had appealed Mrs. Aquino's decision not allow him, his
wife Imelda and other family members to return to the Philippines.
Marcos has lived in exile in Hawaii since 1986 following a popular
uprising that brought Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Mrs. Aquino accuses Marcos of stealing billions of dollars during
his 20-year rule.
   In October, the United States indicted the Marcoses on criminal
racketeering charges for allegedly stealing more than $100 million
from the Philippine treasury and using it to buy art and real estate
in New York.
   Marcos, 72, has been hospitalized since January because of
deteriorating health.

<HEAD>Blackmun: Supreme Court Has Votes to Overturn Roe vs. Wade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STORM LAKE, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has the votes to
reverse a 1973 case that legalized abortions, according to Justice
Harry Blackmun, who wrote the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.
   ``The votes are there to overturn it,'' Blackmun told students at
Buena Vista College in response to a question Thursday night. ``What
will happen, I don't know. It may be overruled.''
   In the 1973 case, the court said government could not interfere
in the rights of a woman to an abortion during the first three
months of pregnancy. It said states could regulate abortions during
the second trimester only to protect a woman's health, and may take
steps to protect the life of the fetus in the third trimester of
pregnancy.
   In a Missouri case decided by the court July 3, the court gave
states broader powers to regulate abortions, but Blackmun said he
was ``surprised'' the high court did not overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   Three other abortion-related cases are due to be decided by the
court in the coming term, which begins next month.
   Blackmun dissented from the Missouri decision and denounced it
from the bench, saying the court had silently invited further
challenges that would lead to overturning his 1973 ruling.
   He told students at the northwestern Iowa school he didn't want
to comment further because of the three additional cases on abortion
pending before the court.
   ``I don't know what will happen, but it (Roe vs. Wade) may be
overturned,'' he said.
   Blackmun, appointed to the court by President Nixon in 1970, did
not discuss abortion during his wide-ranging talk on constitutional
freedoms. His remarks on the topic came in response to a question.

   Rocket and artillery duels flared across
Beirut on Friday after a two-day lull, killing seven people and
raising doubts that Arab League efforts to end the bloodshed would
succeed.
   Beirut's shrunken population returned to underground shelters
overnight as the Syrian-Christian battles picked up. After a brief
morning break, the exchanges flared again in the afternoon, sending
scores of artillery rounds and rockets crashing into Christian east
Beirut and the Moslem sector in the west.
   Police said seven people were killed and 21 wounded, bringing the
overall toll to 902 killed and 2,613 wounded since the fighting
began March 8.
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria ended
a two-day meeting in Saudi Arabia on Thursday and said they would
present to Arab leaders plans for ending the violence. Details of
the plans were expected to be released in a communique Saturday.
   The meetings were the first held by the mediation committee since
July 31, when the panel appointed accused Syria of blocking peace
efforts by refusing to withdraw its soldiers from Lebanon. The
committee was appointed by the Arab League in May to find a solution
to the crisis.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon. They were deployed in 1976
under an Arab League mandate to quell the country's civil war but
have joined with Moslem militias to fight the mainly Christian
troops of Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive out the
Syrians. The latest confrontation began in March after Aoun
blockaded militia-run ports. The Syrians responded by shelling the
310-square-mile Christian heartland north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners, alternating between 130mm mortars and
multi-barraled rocket launchers, hammered east Beirut and the
surrounding Christian hinterland Friday.
   Aoun's gunners blasted west Beirut and hills to the southeast
with U.S.-made 155mm howitzers and mortars of various caliber.
   Radio stations interrupted programming to list the districts
targeted by the random barrages and urged residents to take
precautions.
   Only 10 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people remain in the
city. The others have fled to safer areas of Lebanon or left the
country altogether.
   Residents appeared skeptical the Arab committee would succeed in
ending their agony.
   ``I don't think the committee will be able to solve our
problem,'' said Ahmed Hasbini, a bank employee, in Moslem west
Beirut.
   ``But I cannot stop hoping that someone, somehow will come up
with a solution, at least a truce that would put an end to the
present round of criminal madness.''
   Rashid Makkouk, a Sunni Moslem salesman, said of the new
shelling: ``We were under the impression that this is over, at least
for the time being.''
   ``We thought of taking a break from living in the underground
shelter. We started our evening in the apartment.
   ``We were watching television which interrupted programming to
report that the Arab committee has concluded its meeting, but no
cease-fire accord was reached.
   ``I was thinking whether we should return to the shelter when the
explosion of the first shell echoed. We rushed down,'' he said.
   ``Now they say a cease-fire will be announced Saturday. I can't
believe it anymore. I think we'll spend the winter as well in the
shelter.''

   Law enforcement officials ended a strategy
session for combatting drugs Friday with a pledge to work together
to defeat major traffickers and criminal syndicates like Colombia's
Medellin cartel.
   The delegates also sent a letter to Colombian President Virgilio
Barco pledging support for his ``courageous fight'' against the
syndicates.
   ``These criminal groups not only challenge the rule of law and
jeopardize the judicial structures of Colombian society, but they
challenge the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean regions and
the whole international community as well,'' the message said.
   ``In this context, we recognize that your struggle is our
struggle. The success of Colombia ... is of vital importance to us
all,'' the law enforcement officials said.
   Delegates from more than 100 countries attended the
U.N.-sponsored meeting.
   Interpol chief Raymond E. Kendall said drug offenses are taking
up 40 percent of the time and resources of the 147-nation police
network.
   Kendall pointed to a new telecommunications systems linking 28
Caribbean states in an information network as the kind of joint
project that can enhance surveillance and interception of drug
dealers. The network goes into operation next month.
   Delegates to the five-day conference called for harsher sentences
for convicted drug traffickers, including the death penalty, and
some argued for more severe treatment of drug users as well.
   Charles Saphos, chief of the narcotics and dangerous drugs
section of the U.S. Justice Department, called for measures to
``pierce all forms of bank secrecy'' so that governments can seize
illegal drug profits hidden in foreign banks.
   Colombia was to be represented at the meeting by a delegation led
by Miguel A. Gomez Padilla, director-general of the national police
force, but conference sources said the Colombian officials failed to
show up.
   They said the Colombians could have been detained because of
continued drug-related violence in their country.

<HEAD>Fey Confident He Can Save Denver Symphony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock impresario Barry Fey has never been to a
symphony concert and says he prefers the Beatles over Bach but he's
still confident he can save the Denver Symphony Orchestra.
   ``Hey, you don't have to know it to sell it,'' said Fey on
Thursday.
   Rescuing the financially beleaguered Denver Symphony Orchestra
should be ``a walk through the park'' compared to dealing with the
super-egos and super-salaries of such acts as the Rolling Stones and
Bruce Springsteen, he said.
   ``These guys are treated bigger than God,'' he said of the greats
he has brought to Denver since launching his career in 1967 by
presenting The Doors.
   Fey said he would leave it to the members of the provisionally
renamed Colorado Symphony Orchestra to choose conductors and music
for a proposed 26-week season starting about Nov. 1, he said.
   ``If I had my druthers, I'd have the Beatles, the Stones, the Who
and Led Zeppelin done by the symphony,'' said Fey.
   ``I'm not a dictator. I'm a messenger. I don't tell them what
they should like. I ask what they want and I get it. ... If it
sells, it's good.''
   Fey spoke enthusiastically about Grofe's ``Grand Canyon Suite,''
and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, while acknowledging that at
the age of 50 he has yet to attend a formal symphony concert.
   Patrons can wear whatever they wish at his symphony concerts,
said Fey, clad in a Chicago Cubs sweatshirt, white shorts, and
tennis shoes without socks. ``It's not what you wear, it's what you
hear.''
   Fey filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986 with debts of nearly
$5 million, then bounced back with a new partner and a streamlined
Fey Concert Co.
   Now he plans to spend $8,000 a week to promote the symphony.
   He expresses confidence that he can pull of the gamble. ``I only
need 600 people per concert to cover my expenses,'' he said.
   Part of his low-overhead plan to save the orchesatra would pay
each musician about $22,000 a year _ twice the figure offered by the
Denver Symphony Association.
   The musicians voted earlier this week to hire Fey after they were
offered another proposal that would give them a much lower salary.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor came to court
today in a Rolls-Royce and a furious mood, calling the policeman who
arrested her during a traffic stop and everyone else involved in the
case a ``liar.''
   ``I like men of achievement, not a man with a gun. ... I should
have scratched his eyes out,'' Miss Gabor _ who is under court order
not to talk about the case _ told reporters outside the courtroom
where she is on trial on charges of slapping Officer Paul Kramer.
   ``I think that cop is not too bright. I think he must be very
spoiled because he's very sexy. He's gorgeous. He's sexy, but I
don't like that man,'' said the former beauty queen.
   Miss Gabor is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police
officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired
license, and having an open container of alcohol in her car and an
expired car registration. A conviction carries a maximum two years
in jail and $4,000 fine.
   Kramer pulled her over on June 14 for having expired registration
licenses on her $215,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. As he
checked for violations, Miss Gabor allegedly drove off, was stopped
again and slapped Kramer's face.
   The outburst came before a second day of testimony. Questioned by
Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox and defense attorney William
Graysen, Kramer had testified Thursday that Miss Gabor cursed, spit
on him and slapped him.
   Miss Gabor's diatribe began at the curb outside the courthouse,
where she alighted from the Rolls in a trouser outfit of black
pants, black-and-white polka dot top with a red silk corsage on the
left shoulder.
   ``This man is the biggest liar and the Police Department is the
biggest liar in the world,'' Miss Gabor charged, ignoring pleas from
her attorney reminding her about the gag order in the case.
   ``The officer's a liar and the district attorney's a liar. Every
word of it is a lie. I was there,'' she said.
   ``He's a vulgar policeman and he's a liar,'' the actress said.
   Graysen said prior to Miss Gabor's arrival that she was ``a
strong woman'' and ``she's holding up well.''
   Thursday's testimony featured a recreation of the traffic stop
that ended in a minor altercation and Miss Gabor's arrest.
   ``Officer, you promise not to strike my client?'' the defense
attorney asked in jest at one point.
   Recounting the incident, Kramer said Miss Gabor screamed at him,
``Do you know who I am?''
   ``She closed the door and she spun around and slapped me on the
side of the face. I was very surprised,'' Kramer testified.
   Kramer, under cross-examination, was asked to stand alongside
Miss Gabor, as he wore his helmet and sunglasses.
   ``I'm afraid of him,'' said the 5-foot-3 actress as she stood
next to the 6-foot-4 officer within inches of the jury box on
Thursday. Smiling, she demonstrated a strike to Kramer's left cheek,
showing it was a considerable reach.
   ``I didn't realize he was so tall. He is very gorgeous,'' Miss
Gabor said during a break in testimony.
   Jurors also heard a recorded police radio transmission of Miss
Gabor's traffic stop and Kramer's inquiry for a computer check on a
date of birth for the actress. The answer came back as June 6, 1923.
   An enlarged copy of Miss Gabor's drivers license was displayed to
jurors and it showed the birthdate had been altered. Asked why he
didn't issue a misdemeanor citation for an altered license, Kramer
said, ``It was an amateur job of alteration.''
   Fox said witnesses will prove the officer's actions were
professional throughout the 15-minute episode.
   When she arrived in court Thursday, Miss Gabor deflected
questions about her age, which ranges from 62 to 70, depending on
the source.
   ``The only good thing that comes out of this is my face cream
sells like hot cakes,'' the former Miss Hungary and cosmetics
entrepreneur concluded.
   Graysen said in his statement that Kramer overreacted and Miss
Gabor acted in self-defense.
   Witnesses will show there is a pattern of excessive force by
Kramer and a coverup of that behavior by the Police Department, he
said.
   ``He's a bad cop,'' Graysen said.

   A federal judge on Friday refused to
sentence the captain and owner of an oil tanker that spilled nearly
300,000 gallons of heating oil off Newport until he knows more about
their records and willingness to pay damages.
   U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres demanded specifics about the
extent to which Ballard Shipping Co. and its insurers were prepared
to pay for cleaning up the spill from the tanker World Prodigy,
which ran aground June 23.
   The Coast Guard estimates the cleanup at $3 million.
   Torres scheduled a new hearing in two weeks.
   Ballard, a Liberian company operating from Greece, and Capt.
Iakovos Georgudis pleaded guilty Aug. 16 to one count apiece of
violating the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement called for
fines of $10,000 against Georgudis and $500,000 that Ballard would
pay to the state for environmental research and acquisition of
coastal property.
   The delay in sentencing also canceled plans for Georgudis, 43, of
Athens, Greece, to plead guilty and be fined the maximum of $20,000
on state charges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a
harbor pilot aboard, said Thomas Connell, a spokesman for Attorney
General James E. O'Neil.
   Torres said he had not received information he had requested
about the previous environmental record of Georgudis, Ballard and
its owners.
   Bradford Gorham, Ballard's attorney, said the shipper's insurers
promised to cover $3.2 million in federal environmental damage, $1
million in state cleanup costs and $3.5 million in unspecified other
costs, such as those incurred by businesses hurt by the spill.
   ``The judge now wants to know more about the people behind
Ballard,'' Gorham said. ``I'm not sure until I talk to my clients
what that information can be.''
   John A. MacFadyen, the captain's lawyer, said it was up to
Ballard to provide the information and he declined to comment
further.
   According to testimony at a Coast Guard hearing, Georgudis and a
helmsman were on the tanker's bridge when it ran aground at Brenton
Reef, about a mile south of Newport, and ripped two large gashes in
its hull.
   The heating oil that spilled into Rhode Island Sound forced
beaches to close and killed young fish and lobsters. Most beaches
reopened within a week as the oil evaporated or was cleaned up.
   Georgudis told Gov. Edward D. DiPrete he erred by not waiting for
a harbor pilot before proceeding into the treacherous waters near
the mouth of Narragansett Bay.

<TEXT>
   The State Bar of Georgia has agreed not to push
for disbarment of former Rep. Pat Swindall, and he has accepted
temporary suspension of his law license during appeal of federal
perjury convictions.
   C. David Butler, an attorney who is serving as special master in
the bar association's disbarment case against Swindall, said Friday
that lawyers for the two sides agreed to the deal Thursday.
   Butler said he will submit the agreement to the state Supreme
Court, which must approve it, as soon as the paperwork is complete.
   ``After the (Swindall's) appeal has run its course, I will
conduct a hearing to see what should be done,'' Butler said.
   Swindall, a Republican, was convicted by a U.S. District Court
jury in June of nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury in a
money-laundering case. Swindall had been called to testify to the
grand jury about his negotiations for a home loan from an undercover
agent posing as a money launderer.
   Swindall, maintaining his innocence, has appealed the conviction
to the 11th U.S. Circuit.
   Butler said it was his understanding that Swindall is not
practicing law.
   Swindall, then a virtual political unknown, defeated Rep. Elliot
Levitas in 1984 to represent suburban Atlanta's 4th District. He was
re-elected in 1986 but lost his seat to Democrat Ben Jones last year
amid his legal troubles.

   President Bush today lamented the ``horrible''
loss of life when a man with an assault rifle went on a rampage in a
Louisville, Ky., printing plant but said he still opposes
legislation to ban such weapons.
   ``If you have somebody who is deranged, and I don't want to
prejudice this poor soul, but if he was deranged, I'm afraid you're
going to have incidents like this,'' Bush said.
   In a luncheon interview with out-of-town reporters, the president
was asked what he would say to the families of the victims of
Thursday's rampage by a man who used a AK-47 assault rifle and other
weapons to shoot 20 of his former co-workers, killing seven of them
and himself.
   ``I would tell them, I feel horrible about the loss of life ... I
would tell them we must do everything we can to enforce laws that
are already on the books,'' Bush replied.
   The president has banned the import of foreign-made assault
rifles into the United States, including the Chinese-made AK-47.
However, possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and Bush
has taken no steps toward proposing curbs on U.S. manufacture of
such weapons.
   Bush answered a wide range of questions with a group of reporters
after a luncheon in the State Dining Room.
   On his anti-drug plan, he said he was ready to bargain with the
Democratic-led Congress to come up with a compromise for paying for
the program.
   And while the president said he still prefers his
administration's formula for funding his $7.9 billion program,
``we're flexible.''
   Bush also acknowledged that overlapping responsibilities and
missions of various law and drug enforcement agencies were sometimes
getting in the way of effective enforcement.
   He said that his drug policy director, William J. Bennett, is
working on better coordination ``to try to cope with the
bureaucratic competition that exists. I can't tell you we've got it
whipped; I can tell you we've made progress.''
   The president reiterated his decision not to press for a tax
increase to help pay for his war on drugs. ``A tax increase would be
counterproductive,'' he said.
   On next week's education summit with governors in
Charlottesville, Va., Bush said, ``we're going to have some
roll-up-your-sleeves meetings.''
   He said that, overall, U.S. educational performance was
disappointing, measured against achievement of students in other
industrialized nations. ``We're getting less in terms of our
investment,'' he said.
   On the subject of guns, the president, a longtime opponent of
gun-control legislation, noted that many local government do have
measures banning automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
   Bush said Thursday's shootings in Louisville reminded him, as a
Texan, of a 1966 incident in which a sniper who occupied a tower on
the campus of the University of Texas in Austin shot 44 people,
killing 16.
   ``It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But I
have seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is going
to guard against it ...,'' he said.
   ``So, my view is: do everything you can in terms of education, do
everything you can in terms of enforcing your laws that are on the
books.''
   Bush recalled that years ago, he went to register his own hunting
guns to comply with a District of Columbia law requiring
registration of all firearms.
   He said he asked the clerk if ``criminals'' had complied with the
law and was told, in return, that no, just ``a bunch of suckers like
you ....''
   Bush also said he was strongly opposed to the legalization of
drugs and that it would never be given consideration at the federal
level as long as he was president.
   Returning to the issue of new taxes for fighting crime and drugs,
the president said that, while he wouldn't advocate new federal
taxes for building new prisons, he could understand if state and
local governments raised taxes.
   ``Yes, the states and localities are having to step up themselves
and do stuff .... That's up to them. I'm not going to criticize a
governor or a municipality that has to do something on the revenue
side,'' he said.
   ``I'm going to try to hold the line as president of the United
States on federal taxes.''
   In the only question on international affairs, Bush was asked if
the United States should consider diverting U.S. funds from the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help finance the war on drugs.
   He said that the United States could not afford to back off its
military ommitment to NATO, saying it needs to prudently deal with
the threat from the Soviet Union. ``I think I'm doing what's in the
national interest of the United States,'' he added.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Urges Voluntary Code Against `Shock Radio'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission chairman
urged the nation's broadcasters Friday to tune out ``shock radio,''
programs that use sexually and racially oriented humor to attract
audiences.
   ``We are not simply recorders, transmitters and antennas,''
Alfred Sikes told those attending the National Association of
Broadcasters radio convention. ``We are what we broadcast.''
   Sikes, a former owner of several radio stations, said the
association should revive its programming code, dropped in the early
1980s as the result of a federal anti-trust lawsuit against
provisions regarding commercials.
   Such standards should be drawn up by the industry, without
government pressure, said Sikes, who took over the FCC chair in
August.
   The FCC on Aug. 24 said it was taking enforcement action against
three stations _ WLUP-AM in Chicago, KSJO-FM in San Jose, Calif.,
and WFBQ-FM in Indianapolis _ ``which may have broadcast indecent
programs in violation of the law.''
   The stations were given 30 days to respond to FCC inquiries,
which the agency said were based on a review of public complaints.
According to FCC transcripts, the material involved sexually
oriented humor broadcast during daytime hours.
   ``I know that people say the commissioners were simply responding
to congressional pressures,'' Sikes said. ``But, in that regard, let
me say this: You really ought to first read the program material
which we cited, and also note that it was being broadcast at a time
when children almost certainly were listening.''
   NAB President Edward Fritts said the organization could not
consider a new code unless Congress approves pending legislation
granting the broadcast industry an anti-trust exemption for
programming content codes.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Drops to Lowest Level in Nearly Five Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $7.58
billion in July, its lowest level in nearly five years, the
government said Friday, but some analysts fear the improvement will
be temporary if the dollar continues to rise against other
currencies.
   The Commerce Department said the July deficit dropped 5.3 percent
from a revised June imbalance of $8.01 billion. The July gap was the
slimmest since a $6.79 billion imbalance in December 1984.
   Analysts pointed to the export category in the report,
particularly capital goods, as the main reason for the deficit
improvement. While exports dropped 1.8 percent, they still totaled a
strong $30.74 billion, the fifth straight month that exports have
remained above $30 billion.
   Capital goods exports rose $300 million while capital goods
imports fell $530 million.
   ``That is exactly the type of thing we need to see,'' said Howard
Lewis, vice president for international economics at the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``We don't have a prayer of solving
our trade problems if we don't have a big turnaround in our capital
goods balance.''
   Overall, imports fell 2.5 percent to $38.32 billion, their lowest
level since February, due in part to an unexpectedly small rise in
oil imports. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and
exports.
   Many economists had been looking for a deficit of $8.5 billion to
$9 billion because of increasing oil imports and the rising value of
the dollar, which cuts into exports by making them more expensive
overseas.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co., said the export
volume reflects booming economies overseas but cautioned that ``the
going will get tougher as we move to the end of the year and into
the next.''
   The reason is, he said, is that ``by late in the year, the higher
dollar will be denting exports'' and ``the booming economies
overseas will probably slow down.''
   But Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
consulting firm, questioned the impact of the higher dollar.
   ``It used to be that when the dollar rose, domestic manufacturers
threw in the towel, saying they couldn't compete at those prices,''
he said. ``Now a lot of our clients are deciding to stick it out.
They realize their profit margins will be temporarily slashed, but
they're determined to retain their foothold in the foreign market
and ride this thing out.''
   Oil imports rose 2.9 percent to $4.32 billion in July. The amount
rose to 8.14 million barrels a day from 7.93 million in June, but
the price per barrel fell to $17.12 from $17.67 in June.
   Analysts say oil imports will continue to rise as U.S.
consumption increases and domestic production falls, becoming a
major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months.
   The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported
imported oil in July accounted for more than half of monthly U.S.
petroleum needs, the first time that has occurred in 12 years.
   The decrease in the July deficit represented the first
back-to-back declines since mid-1988, when the imbalances dropped in
March, April and May.
   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby said the deficit has
dropped 10.3 percent in the first seven months of the year,
including a 15.1 percent increase in exports and an 8.4 percent
increase in imports compared to the same period of 1988.
   For the first seven months of 1989, the trade deficit was running
at an annual rate of $105.8 billion, down 10.7 percent from last
year's total deficit of $118.5 billion.
   The largest deficit in July continued to be with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.04 billion, up from a June deficit of $3.94 billion.
Next was Taiwan, which totaled $1.26 billion in June, while the
deficit with China was $510 million.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Flexible on Funding War on Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs, editing throughout to shorten.</HEAD>

   President Bush said today he's ready to deal
with Democrats on how to pay for the war on drugs, declaring ``we're
flexible in terms of the funding method.''
   However, the president repeated his objections to any proposal
that includes either a tax increase or deep military spending cuts.
   ``We can't afford to sacrifice our military preparedness,'' Bush
said in a question-and-answer session with a group of out-of-town
reporters he invited to a White House lunch.
   The administration has previously voiced opposition to a proposal
by Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that it
claims would make unacceptably sharp cuts in defense spending.
   Bush indicated he still prefers his own formula for raising the
$717 million in additional spending above the $7.1 billion he had
previously proposed for anti-drug spending in the fiscal year that
begins on Oct. 1.
   However, as negotiations were set to begin with congressional
Democrats on a compromise, Bush said: ``We're flexible in terms of
the funding method, but I strongly believe that we must retain the
integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than six
months to develop.''
   Bush also repeated his opposition to new taxes to pay for the war
on crime and drugs, although he acknowledged that states and some
local governments might need to raise taxes to help pay for new
prisons.
   ``That's up to them. I'm not going to criticize a governor or a
municipality that has to do something on the revenue side,'' Bush
said.
   Earlier today, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called Bush's
drug plan inadequate.
   ``I submit that we cannot expect Mr. Bush and (drug policy chief
William) Bennett to come up with a plan to deal with drugs in our
community,'' Jackson told a House panel. ``The drug war does not
begin at the White House. It begins at our house.''
   Bennett conceded the administration will not likely get the
budget offsets in the categories Bush suggested to fund the drug war.
   ``That doesn't seem to be the game in town right now,'' Bennett
told the reporters at the White House.
   He said it was likely what ``we're going to talk about is some
kind of across-the-board reductions. Rather than taking money out of
this box and putting it in this box, you may see some small fraction
of a percentage reduction'' throughout the budget.
   Jackson and Bennett shook hands warmly before addressing the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, but in his
remarks Jackson was critical of both Bush and Bennett.
   ``In April, Mr. Bennett announced that he would take
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the
nation's capital,'' Jackson said in comments marked by repeated
applause from spectators as well as a few shouts of approval. ``Five
months later, we still have the emergency but no action.''
   ``President Bush announced a drug plan for Bogota, Colombia.
Where is his plan for the District of Columbia and cities across the
nation?'' said Jackson, who has been mentioned as possible mayoral
candidate in the capital.
   He said more money than the $7.9 billion envisioned by Bush was
needed to do the job as well as input from community leaders who
have first-hand experience with fighting the drug problem.
   Meantime, Senate negotiations on financing the war on drugs got
under way, with Democrats demanding a boost in funding and
Republicans saying more money was less important than quick action
on the plan.
   In the House, many lawmakers appeared cool to a proposal from
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to gain an additional $2.2 billion for
the $7.9 billion drug war through a half-percent cut in federal
programs across the board.
   Elsewhere Thursday, Bennett got into a sharply worded exchange
with Democrats on the House Government Operations Committee while
lobbying for the administration plan.
   The task force includes nine Democrats and nine Republicans, and
Dole said Bennett and Bush administration budget director Richard
Darman would be in on the talks.
   ``This thing could take a couple of weeks,'' Dole said. He said
Republicans might freeze Senate action on a dozen money bills only
two weeks from the start of fiscal 1990 unless the negotiations
produced results.
   Majority Democrats control the Senate, but the GOP could use the
rules to block the money bills.
   Byrd's proposed across-the-board cut remains attached to a money
bill for transportation programs that is awaiting final action in
the Senate. Republicans oppose the measure, which would delete $1.8
billion from the Defense Department's budget.

   A former Unisys Corp. executive described
as a major figure in a defense procurement scandal was sentenced to
32 months in prison Friday for bribing Pentagon officials for inside
information on contract bids.
   Charles F. Gardner, 59, who admitted bribing former Pentagon
official Melvyn Paisley by buying a resort condominium at an
inflated price, was fined $40,000 after also pleading guilty to
charges that he set up a slush fund to pay bribes and make illegal
campaign contributions.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said Gardner used
slush-fund money for a ``broad spectrum of criminal activity'' that
included paying bribes to public officials and making illegal
campaign contributions to congressmen, as well as for his personal
use.
   ``It was the American taxpayer that ended up footing the bill for
these activities'' because Gardner billed the Pentagon with phony
invoices to replenish the money, Aronica said.
   James G. Neal, 65, a former Unisys consultant described by
Aronica as ``the banker for Mr. Gardner and Mr. Gardner's
operation'' was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined $30,000
by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton.
   Both were charged as part of the investigation dubbed ``Operation
Ill Wind.''
   Aronica, who called Gardner ``a major figure'' in the
investigation, urged Hilton to consider the cooperation that both
Gardner and Neal had given investigators since their guilty pleas in
March.
   Gardner could have received a maximum sentence of 23 years in
prison and fines of $750,000. Neal, who owes the Internal Revenue
Service $104,000 in back taxes, could have been sentenced to 15
years in prison and fined $750,000.
   Defense lawyer Gary Naftalis said information provided by Gardner
has already resulted in six guilty pleas and ``will lead to more and
more convictions'' of ``individuals and corporations.''
   Gardner is apparently providing information about his former
superiors at Sperry Corp., which became Unisys Corp. after a
takeover by Burroughs Corp. Unisys Corp. says it is cooperating.
   According to court papers, Gardner arranged in 1986 to have Neal
buy Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho, for $49,000 more
than it was sold for a year later.
   Paisley, former assistant Navy secretary for research,
engineering and systems, has not been charged.
   Gardner admitted arranging illegal campaign contributions to Rep.
Roy Dyson, D-Md., and the late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla. Both had
denied knowing the contributions were illegal.
   According to court papers in another case, Gardner, a vice
president and general manager of the company's surveillance and fire
control systems in Great Neck, N.Y., obtained permission from an
unidentified superior to bribe a former Navy engineer for
information about an electronics contract.
   That official, Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 59, is awaiting sentence
after pleading guilty to taking $400,000 in bribes from Sperry Corp.
and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc.

<HEAD>Bipartisan Group Introduces Clean-Air Bill to Rival Bush's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's smog-reduction plan got some
competition Friday as a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a
rival bill to cut auto pollution and set new deadlines for cities to
clean their air.
   The rival measure, strongly backed by Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, significantly alters he Bush approach to
automobile pollution but takes a similar approach to setting
clean-up timetables for smog-choked cities.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the bill's chief sponsor, said the Bush
plan ``won't get us across the finish line'' in improving air
quality, and predicted the rival proposal would ``cut auto emissions
by 50 percent by the year 2000.''
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., the chief sponsor of the Bush
legislation in the Senate, also is co-sponsoring the Baucus
anti-smog measure.
   In all, eight Democrats and five Republicans are sponsoring the
rival measure.
   Asked why he's backing two bills with conflicting provisions,
Chafee said he agrees with the Baucus approach. But he sponsored the
Bush legislation, Chafee said, because he agrees with many of its
provisions, and wanted to support the ``first effort an
administration has made in eight years'' to tackle the nation's air
quality problem.
   Former President Reagan did not propose a comprehensive revision
to the 1977 clean-air law during his eight years in office.
   The proposal introduced Friday covers only urban smog proposals,
but any clean-air legislation will also include provisions on
airborne toxic chemicals and acid rain. The Bush proposal, which
covers all three areas, is now under consideration by the House
Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee.
   Smog is air pollution generated by motor vehicles, industry, and
other sources in urban areas. A major component is ozone, which at
ground level is produced by the combination of hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides _ both given off by tailpipes _ in the presence of
sunlight and heat.
   Since 90 percent of the ozone breathed into the lungs is never
exhaled, with ozone molecules reacting with sensitive lung tissue to
cause a number of health consequences. These include chest pains,
shortness of breath, coughing, nausea, throat irritatiion and
increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.
   The automobile section of the Baucus bill would, like the Bush
measure, would tighten current tailpipe anti-pollution requirements
but would not include two key elements of the president's proposal _
a forced switch from today's gasoline to clean-burning motor fuels
in severely polluted cities and permission for automakers to average
emissions by engine category to comply with anti-pollution
requirements.
   Instead, the Senate measure would require each model to meet the
emissions standards, as under current law, and would allow
automakers to choose whether to build cars using alternative fuels
or reduce pollution in other ways.
   The legislation, like the Bush measure, would set deadlines
ranging from five years to 20 years for cities to clean up their
smog problems. But the placement of cities in the various categories
would be different.
   The Bush bill would give Los Angeles, New York, Houston and
Chicago-Gary, Ind., 20 years to sharply reduce ozone levels in
return for adopting severe anti-pollution measures. The Baucus
legislation would place only Los Angeles in the 20-year category and
would give the other three areas 15 years.
   In all, 101 geographical areas have failed to meet the
now-expired ozone cleanup timetables under current law.
   Baucus, explaining the lack of an alternative fuels requirement
in his bill, said, ``I don't think it's wise to mandate change in
the marketplace so that certain users have to use certain kinds of
cars.''
   He also called the requirement a ``heavy-handed intrusion into
the marketplace.''
   The Bush administration, on the other hand, calls its clean fuels
requirement ``the most innovative and far-reaching component'' of
its ozone-cutting proposals.
   The president would force a portion of the car fleet in the most
seriously polluted cities to operate on clean-burning fuels such as
methanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, propane or reformulated
gasoline.
   The president wants a schedule for such vehicles, beginning with
500,000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year, and going up to
one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004.
   ``I'm not sure how you get people to buy that number of cars,''
Chafee said.

   Katie Bethel scooped up Larry the caiman
in her arms, gave him a kiss and took him home, thus ending his
three-month stint behind bars.
   ``C'mon, Larry, let's blow this hole. Let's go home,'' Bethel
said Thursday as she paid $121 to gain freedom for her grinning
3{-foot reptile from the Tri-City Animal Shelter.
   The reportedly warm-hearted caiman was nose-cuffed and taken to
the shelter July 12 after he was found strolling along Tulane Street.
   When Bethel initially tried to retrieve him, she learned he could
be sprung only if she got exotic animal permits from the state and
Union City.
   She did that this week, and Larry is a free man, or cai-man.
   But left behind at least one new friend.
   ``He's great,'' said shelter supervisor Nancy Talamantez. ``He's
superfriendly, almost too friendly. He's a spoiled brat.''
   Although caimans have a reputation for being meaner than their
relatives, the alligators and crocodiles, Talamantez said Larry is
the exception.
   Bethel promised Larry a homecoming feast of pork chops, ground
beef, apple sauce and ``whatever anybody else is eating.''

   Candace and David Kirkman lived in North
Carolina and dreamed of a home in the West. They've got that now and
more.
   The Kirkmans bought Horse Creek, the whole town.
   Horse Creek, which the Kirkmans learned of in an advertisement,
consists of a general store and bar, post office, a house, horse
barn and a repair garage on 17 acres of land.
   ``I love it,'' said Mrs. Kirkman. ``I love it.''
   The two, who are from Randleman, N.C., bought the town from Tony
Schepp, who operated all the businesses in the area, referred to as
``Schepp's Corner'' for almost 40 years with his wife, Marian.
   Schepp was bartender and mechanic and helped in the store; his
wife was postmistress, store keeper and homemaker.
   Schepp's Corner served as a gathering spot for people in the area
until the nearby Great Western Limestone Mine closed in 1978,
curtailing business severely.
   And since the death of Mrs. Schepp several years ago, the
settlement has been little more than a post office, with the general
store, bar and repair shop closed.
   But the Kirkmans have plans for their move in October.
   Candace Kirkman has discussed keeping a coffee pot going through
the day in the post office and serving rolls and cookies to people
who pick up their mail, as well as serving meals several times a
week.
   ``We want to make it a little general store, too,'' she said.

   Rock star Sting suffered the slings and arrows
of outraged theater critics Friday for his stage debut in ``The
Threepenny Opera,'' but he was a smash hit with the Soviet
ambassador and Yulia Sukhanova, the Soviet Union's first beauty
queen.
   With President and Mrs. Bush watching from box seats above the
National Theater stage Thursday night, Sting made the best of a
daunting, three-hour performance as Mack the Knife in the
pre-Broadway premiere of Bertolt Brecht's biting musical satire.
   The critics, however, agreed that Sting's best wasn't good enough.
   ``Slow and turgid stuff,'' complained The Washington Post's David
Richards, who said Sting's ``acting has little resonance and his
singing voice is surprisingly thin.''
   ``If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung,'' said Hap
Erstein of The Washington Times, who said this ``Threepenny Opera''
proved ``to not be worth 2 cents'' despite a stellar cast directed
by Tony Award winner John Dexter and music conducted by Julius Rudel.
   Many in the black-tie, opening night audience agreed that Sting _
who is accustomed to mega-decibel amplifiers at his huge stadium
rock concerts _ desperately needs a body mike for Kurt Weill's bawdy
songs in the intimate confines of a legitimate theater like the
National.
   Sting himself, nearly crushed in the melee of fans at a
post-performance party at the Old Ebbitt Grill, was pleased that
Bush came backstage at the second intermission to greet the cast.
   ``He said he enjoyed the show, and so did Barbara,'' Sting
reported.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin joined Bush backstage, and the
curtain for the final act was delayed when the two men stepped aside
for an animated conversation alone.
   ``We didn't know if we were going to have a peace treaty ending
the Cold War or a third act,'' said one cast member later.
   Dubinin, clearly enjoying the show, said Brecht's plays are
popular in the Soviet Union and that ``The Threepenny Opera'' often
is performed there in Russian.
   ``It's the truth about life,'' he said, smilingly acknowledging
that Brecht was an outspoken Marxist who rewrote the 18th century
English satire, ``The Beggar's Opera,'' to espouse his political
theories about religion, sex and morality in capitalist society.
   Dubinin said Thursday night's performance, in a fresh English
translation by Michael Feingold, ``brought an American spirit to the
spirit of Brecht's epoch'' that is ``a good combination of the two.''
   The ambassador's companion for the evening was Miss Sukhanova, a
17-year-old model and budding actress who recently was graduated
from a Moscow high school for the arts. She was elected ``Miss
U.S.S.R.'' in June during a beauty pageant in which Soviet
television viewers called in their votes by telephone.
   Miss Sukhanova said she became a Sting fan when saw a television
broadcast of the former lead singer and songwriter for the defunct
rock group Police performing last year at a Moscow stadium concert.
   ``I'm not really in love with him, but I like him very much,''
she said through an interpreter at a post-performance party at the
Old Ebbitt Grill also attended by members of Congress, Lynda Johnson
Robb, actress Kelly McGillis and other celebrities.
   Miss Sukhanova managed to slip past other admirers crowding
around Sting's table, including Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and his
16-year-old daughter Karenna, to shake hands with her singing idol.
   She said she blushed ``just a little'' when Sting gave her a
compliment. ``She's too shy to say,'' the interpreter said, ``but he
told her she was very beautiful.''
   Feingold said there have been three movies and no fewer than six
translations or adaptations of ``Threepenny Opera'' for the stage,
but this is the most faithful recreation of the original, uncut
version of the Brecht-Weill musical play of 1928.
   The show will open at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in New York on
Nov. 5 after a four-week run at the National.
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' conceded producer Jerry
Hellman, who also is making his theatrical debut after a string of
movie hits.

<HEAD>Thousands March as Peaceful Protests Take Place `Without a Hitch'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 15,000 people of all
races marched through the heart of Johannesburg on Friday, and
thousands more rallied in the capital in rare, government-approved
demonstrations against police violence.
   The marches were among the largest ever in the two cities and
illustrated the impact of President-elect F.W. de Klerk's
declaration this week that his white-led government will not block
peaceful protests.
   The only police action reported was against white hecklers.
   Police watched from nearly every window of their 12-story
headquarters building in Johannesburg, the nation's largest city, as
protesters singing and carrying banners stopped nearby.
   Six clergymen went to the door of the building to present a
petition against the use of police to stop peaceful protests.
   Only one clergyman, the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of
the South African Council of Churches, was allowed inside the
building where he says he has twice been tortured during
interrogation.
   ``The little space they have opened to give us the chance to show
how peaceful we are has been used quite effectively,'' Chikane said
later.
   In the capital of Pretoria, about 2,000 people gathered in the
central Church Square, where police never had allowed protests to
take place. Black youths chanting ``Viva!'' trotted around the
square's lawn while about 60 police watched.
   Several demonstrators carrying banners reading ``Stop Police
Brutality'' and ``Victory is Certain'' even climbed on a statue of
Paul Kruger, one of the political patriarchs of the Afrikaners who
now control the government.
   A right-wing, pro-apartheid party leader, Jaap Marais, called the
climbing on the statue a desecration.
   Until this week, virtually all protest marches had been
prohibited. But de Klerk said Tuesday he would allow peaceful
protests, and the next day more than 20,000 people streamed through
Cape Town to protest police brutality.
   It was the largest such demonstration to be authorized by the
government. Magistrates also granted approval for the protests
Friday.
   In carrying out his policy to allow peaceful protest, de Klerk
faces opposition not only from right-wing parties but from the
security establishment that enjoyed wide powers under his
predecessor, P.W. Botha.
   De Klerk's conservative opponents in Parliament on Thursday
denounced his move, saying it undercut security officials.
   The independent South African Press Association said of Friday's
protests, ``A potentially explosive mass demonstration by mainly
blacks in one of Afrikaner Nationalism's citadels had gone off
without a hitch.''
   Smaller demonstrations also were held in the cities of Port
Elizabeth and Grahamstown.
   ``One swallow doesn't make a summer, neither do two or three
freedom marches make a liberated country,'' Methodist Bishop Peter
Storey told a news conference after the Johannesburg march.
   He said the government should see the wisdom of negotiating with
``people who can mount an enormous march like that in a very tense
situation in a polarized society.''
   The petition the clergymen presented to police demanded an end to
discriminatory and restrictive laws so that negotiations can begin
on ending apartheid, which denies the nation's black majority a
voice in national affairs.
   The Johannesburg marchers included black youths, white
professionals, nuns and prominent activists, including Winnie
Mandela, wife of jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela.
   Many youths carried posters demanding Mandela's release and
chanted ``ANC! ANC!'' the initials of Mandela's outlawed African
National Congress movement.
   About 10,000 marchers began the protest, but the crowd swelled as
spectators joined the passing parade. Chikane said he was
particularly pleased that white office workers stepped off the
sidewalks to join hands with blacks.
   He said the police officer who accepted the marchers' petition
``was a bit tense.''
   ``Obviously they are frightened by this new reality. ... I
believe some of the policemen were shocked. They have been told not
to allow this and they don't understand when they are told not to
take action,'' he said.
   When Chikane emerged from the station, he and Storey climbed a
ladder to speak to the crowd from a concrete ledge and told the
marchers to disperse, telling them, ``We have proved our point.''
   The crowd joined Storey in a prayer, sang ``God Bless Africa,''
the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement, and dispersed.
   Several thousand youths jogged and chanted ANC slogans on their
way to bus and train stations to return home.
   Traffic officers cordoned off side streets as the 10-block-long
procession marched more than a mile from St. Mary's Anglican
Cathedral down streets that normally would have been clogged with
traffic.
   Pretoria police led away two men shouting abuse at the protesters
and Johannesburg officers warned a white man who threw eggs at the
parade.
   De Klerk was elected to a five-year term Thursday by the
Electoral College, which is dominated by his National Party. He had
been acting president since Aug. 15, a day after he and other
Cabinet members pressured Botha to resign.

<HEAD>League of Cities President Asks for Big Hike in Drug-Fighting Budget</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National League of Cities President Terry
Goddard said Friday the federal drug-fighting budget for 1990 should
be increased by $5 billion to $6 billion over the administration's
proposed $7.9 billion, and that taxes should be raised to pay for it.
   New resources are needed, said the mayor of Phoenix, Ariz., and
``I haven't figured out another way to get new resources.''
   Commenting on President Bush's oft-stated opposition to new taxes
_ ``Read my lips: no new taxes'' _ Goddard said, ``Some of us are
illiterate.''
   The Democratic mayor said the strategy will call on state and
local governments to spend $10 billion to $12 billion for drug
testing and prisons next year alone. ``We believe that an equivalent
resource from the federal government has got to be committed,'' he
said.
   ``We've just gone through a bailout of the savings and loans,
where really no questions were asked and the money simply
appeared,'' he said.
   ``We are at the same level of urgency, or significantly greater
level of urgency, because people are dying,'' he said. ``I'm not
sure anybody died in the savings and loans. In fact, I'm pretty sure
they didn't.''
   Goddard, who was meeting with Bush Friday afternoon, said paying
for the strategy by taking funds away from immigration, juvenile
justice and housing programs is a ``shell game.''
   He likened such a rearrangement of resources to ``asking Dwight
Eisenhower to finance the Normandy invasion by selling his landing
craft. Those programs are important to establishing a climate in our
cities which will keep drugs at bay.''
   Goddard called for a ``significant amount'' to be allocated
directly to cities so they wouldn't run into a ``logjam'' of state
bureaucracies, but he declined to say how much money the cities
should get.
   He said he is asking municipal leaders to lobby Capitol Hill,
where some members of Congress already are balking at a proposal by
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to increase the $7.9 billion by $2.2
billion.

<TEXT>
   House tax-writers' narrow approval of a capital
gains tax cut sought by President Bush sets the stage for the first
major leadership test of new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley Jr. and
his top Democratic deputies.
   Over vehement objections from Foley and other party leaders, six
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee joined 13
Republicans in a 19-17 vote Thursday to cut the tax.
   Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., called his panel's
action ``a financial disaster'' and ``ultimate expression of `feel
good' economics'' that could unravel the rate-equalizing,
loophole-closing tax reforms of 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We are pleased by
the vote and we will be working hard to sustain it on the floor.''
   The plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of
33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. The tax rate then
would rise to 28 percent but would be ``indexed'' to tax only
increases exceeding the annual inflation rate.
   The net effect to taxpayers is similar to Bush's campaign
proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent without
indexing.
   The Ways and Means budget bill also lowers the premiums for
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and finances a massive
increase in child-care subsidies for low-income families. The 1990
fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   The six Democrats, led by Reps. Ed Jenkins of Georgia and J.J.
Pickle of Texas, resisted weeks of entreaties from Foley and House
Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri that the proposal is
little more than a giveaway to the rich.
   ``The notion that wealthy Americans need another tax break at the
expense of working people is ludicrous,'' Gephardt said. ``Who's
going to pay? ... The answer is the ordinary, middle-income working
American, that's who.''
   Because the wealthy own most capital assets _ such as stocks,
bonds and real estate _ they would benefit the most from the tax
break. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that 80 percent of
the $4 billion to $5 billion in benefits will go to taxpayers with
incomes above $100,000 a year.
   Supporters contend a capital gains tax cut would help the economy
by encouraging investment.
   Cutting the capital gains rate would bring in more tax money for
the next three years, by provding incentives to sell such assets,
according to government estimates. However, after that the reduction
would cost the Treasury $2.8 billion to $5 billion a year, according
to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   Rostenkowski expressed bitter frustration that one-fourth of his
committee's Democrats sided with the 13 Republicans to give them a
majority on more than a half-dozen votes aimed at whittling down the
capital gains amendment cosponsored by Jenkins and Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas.
   ``If the evident divisions within the committee are any
indication, the House is in for a painful fight,'' said Rostenkowski.
   Democrats voting with Jenkins and Pickle for the tax cut were
Reps. Mike Andrews of Texas, Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, Andrew
Jacobs of Indiana and Ronnie Flippo of Alabama.
   Republicans predicted they would pick up as many as 70 of the
House's 255 Democrats when the legislation moves to the House floor
late this month.
   Other Democrats said it will take a carefully orchestrated
campaign for a positive counterproposal to stop the momentum for
giving Bush what he wants.
   ``There has to be a response from our party's perspective other
than just being against,'' said Rep. Brian J. Donnelly, D-Mass.
``This will be Foley's first real major decision.''
   Gephardt said the Democrats were looking at a variety of
alternatives, including raising the tax rate on high incomes and a
plan advanced by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to partially restore
tax deductions on contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The changes in the Medicare catastrophic health insurance plan
and new child benefits were informally approved earlier.
   Over five years, lower-income families would receive an
additional $14 billion in tax credits and $2 billion in
state-administered grants aimed at improving child care for working
parents.
   The major part of the increase would come from liberalizing the
earned-income credit, which benefits lower-income working families
with children. The credit would be worth more to larger families; it
could range up to $1,790 a year for those with three or more
children. A new credit of up to $430 a year would help families with
children under the age of 6.
   In response to complaints from many retirees, the surtax
financing catastrophic health insurance would be cut in half for the
wealthiest 40 percent of retiree,s but the flat monthly premium paid
by all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries would rise.
   The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage
but only if they opt out of Medicare Part B, which pays physicians'
fees.

   Counterintelligence officials said
Friday they are worried Communist East Germany may have slipped
spies among refugees coming from Hungary, and they promised to help
any spies who turn themselves in.
   West Germany has been a playground for spies since the advent of
the Cold War, with agents from several East bloc countries snooping
around for NATO military secrets and sensitive high-tech know-how.
   Some of the hundreds of spies caught in the past were East
Germans who came over to West Germany either as escapees or as legal
emigres.
   Peter Frisch, vice president of West Germany's main
counterintelligence agency, the Constitutional Protection Office,
said there may have been agents or would-be agents among the recent
flood of East German refugees to the West.
   ``This is a possibility we must reckon with. It's something we
must be alert to,'' said Frisch.
   He appealed to any East German refugees who have ``obligated
themselves'' to East German intelligence to telephone the
Constitutional Protection Office in Cologne. ``We can help them,''
he said.
   Frisch said that even if a refugee had committed himself to spy
for East Germany, he would not be prosecuted if he had not yet begun
his work.
   Intelligence officials say dramatically reduced East-West
tensions have not reduced East bloc espionage. Sixty suspected spies
were nabbed in West Germany last year, compared with 34 the year
before.
   A 69-year-old man was arrested last month for allegedly acting as
an East German informer more than 30 years.
   Some of the world's most famous spy scandals have erupted in West
Germany, such as the 1974 exposure of Guenter Guillaume, a close
adviser to then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, as an East German agent.
The disclosure shocked the nation and resulted in Brandt's
resignation.
   There also have been instances of so-called ``Romeo spies''
coming to West Germany from the East and building a seemingly
innocent life with a respectable job, but at some point romancing
government secretaries, exchanging love and companionship for
secrets.
   West German intelligence officials say they have no indications
there are spies among the estimated 14,000 East Germans who arrived
in the past week but that the possibility cannot be excluded.
   Hans-Gert Lange, spokesman for the Constitutional Protection
Office, said that sometimes East Germans who ask to leave for the
West are first coerced into making deals with East German
intelligence.
   ``Permission to leave would be dependent on making an agreement.
If they climb to important positions (in the West) where they might
be useful, the agreement could be activated,'' he said.

   Cab Calloway is performing again after a serious
illness, lighting up the stage of Manhattan's Beacon Theater. But he
longs for another stage, where he made his name more than 50 years
ago _ Harlem's Cotton Club.
   ``I miss it,'' the 82-year-old entertainer said recently.
``Singers, dancers, comedians, we had them all. Oh God, were they
good!''
   Not that the performers who share the bill with Calloway are
chopped liver. His daughter Chris will perform (``She's a block off
the old chip''), along with two dancers, the Williams Brothers.
   ``They have the knack, the desire to entertain. They do it for
the public. That's my style. My public is the important thing to me.
They could have fit into the Cotton Club,'' Calloway says.
   The man who made ``Minnie the Moocher'' famous fell ill at the
end of last year while touring in Japan. While recuperating, he
toured jazz festivals in Europe.
   ``You know, `Sesame Street'' still does a piece of mine on TV,''
he says. ``When I hear it, it makes me feel like I'm living all over
again. I live for music.''

<HEAD>Industrial Production Rose 0.3 Percent In August</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production recorded its biggest gain
in four months in August, the government said Friday in a report
that drew mixed reaction to the 0.3 percent gain.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the August production rate
followed revised increases of 0.1 percent in July and 0.2 percent in
June after remaining flat in May.
   The Fed originally had reported production rose 0.2 percent in
July, but fell 0.1 percent in both May and June. Production was up
0.7 percent in April.
   ``That's not only stronger than expected, but the revisions were
substantial. The economy never really slowed down,'' said Michael K.
Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm.
   However, William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the gain was only 2.8 percent over August
of last year after rising 5.7 percent in 1988.
   ``Growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish throughout
1989, falling farther behind the growth in the services sector,'' he
said.
   The Fed credited almost all the August growth to a rebound in
production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining following a
strike.
   ``Excluding motor vehicles, output of both consumer goods and
business equipment was sluggish during the summer,'' it said.
   At the same time, the central bank reported that the operating
rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities remained
unchanged at 83.8 percent of capacity in August. The operating rate
measures not only output, but also changes in productivity levels.
   Factory use had declined 0.1 percentage point in June, the
central bank said. The rate had hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent
in December 1988 and last January. Last month's operating rate also
was unchanged from August 1988.
   ``Unchanged capacity utilization in August signals the likelihood
that inflationary pressures have declined substantially in the last
several months,'' MacReynolds said.
   The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading
to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of
inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve has been walking a fine line of keeping
interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without
slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable
and non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent last month after remaining
flat in July and increasing 0.3 percent in June. Output was up 2.3
percent at mines and oil wells but fell 1 percent at utilities.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in August stood at
142.4 percent of its 1977 base, up from 142 percent in July.
   At the same time, the operating rate rose 0.1 percentage point to
84 percent at manufacturing plants. The rate had peaked at 84.7
percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years _ rose 0.2 percentage point
to 82.6 percent. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods
fell from 86.4 percent in July to 86.1 percent in August.

   A senior East German official said
Friday the exodus of East Germans to the West is hurting his
country's economy.
   Opposition leaders formed a new organization to challenge the
hard-line Communist government.
   East Germany accused Bonn of enticing the refugees and compared
it to the ``Home to the Reich'' slogan used during the Nazi
expansionism in the 1930s.
   Despite appeals for reforms to slow the refugee flow, East
Germany has hardened its stance.
   That included the cancellation Friday of a planned visit by West
Germany's left-leaning Social Democrats, who traditionally have
pleaded for better relations with East Berlin. President Horst
Sindermann accused the Social Democrats of planning a
``confrontation'' next week with the Communist government.
   Most of the East Germans who have left since Hungary opened its
border to the West at midnight Sunday are young, well-educated
people.
   East German Central Committee member Harry Tisch said the
goverment will have to find ways to bridge the gap resulting from
their loss.
   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit to
Stuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilled
workers, whether young or old, from the German Democratic Republic
are resettling in the Federal Republic of Germany.''
   Tisch, who heads the 9.5-million member state labor union,
claimed there were no official plans to restrict East Germans'
travels to Hungary. However, sources in East Berlin have said that
it has become more difficult to get permission to travel to East
Germany's Warsaw Pact ally.
   Also Friday, 12 well known opposition leaders, including
physicist Hans-Juergen Fischbeck, announced the formation of the
``Citizens Initiative for Democracy Now.''
   The group signed a petition demanding ``widespread reforms
nationwide.''
   The Central Committee member in charge of the East German economy
rejected all such calls, including those coming from the West German
government and the Social Democrats.
   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:
they want the type of reform that does away with socialism,'' the
official, Guenter Mittag, wrote in the Communist Party daily
newspaper Neues Deutschland. ``It just won't be that way!''
   He called on those left behind to do everything possible to
strengthen the nation.
   Mittag also bitterly attacked West Germany.
   ``With promises, enticements and also with psychological
pressure, they have organized a movement along the well known model
of `Home to the Reich,''' Mittag wrote. ``Have they forgotten what
that led to?''
   ``Home to the Reich'' was used as a slogan for the Nazis' aims to
unite all Germans living in Central Europe and Eastern Europe into
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.

<TEXT>
   The Senate, deliberating less than an hour,
approved a $7.7 billion military construction bill Friday that
eliminates President Bush's request for work on bases in South Korea
and the Philippines.
   ``The best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure
a more equitable burden sharing from our allies,'' Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommitte on
military construction, said prior to the chamber's overwhelming
approval of the bill.
   The vote was 93-1 with Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the lone
dissenter.
   Overall, the bill, covering the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
provides $1.3 billion less than this year's level for military
construction and about $300 million less than Bush had requested.
The Senate blueprint also differs from the House version, which
totals $8.7 billion, including $500 million for base closings that
the Senate has put in the separate defense appropriations bill.
   Members of the Senate and the House will meet later this month to
fashion a compromise.
   Prior to the vote, Sasser told his colleagues that uncertainity
regarding the level of U.S. forces overseas led to major cuts in the
legislation.
   ``This bill provides for no new military construction on the
Korean Peninsula. Due to disputes and discussions, it's unwise to
move forward with any new construction,'' Sasser said.
   The legislation cuts $85.5 million from the $86.3 million Bush
requested for South Korea. The House earmarked $74.2 million for
construction there.
   Several members of Congress have called for reductions in the
43,000 U.S. personnel stationed in South Korea.
   Sens. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., on
Thursday proposed a reduction of 3,000 troops during committee
consideration of the defense spending bill, but later withdrew their
amendment. The lawmakers indicated they would introduce the measure
when the full Senate took up the bill.
   The United States spends $2.6 billion a year to maintain its
troops in South Korea.
   Sasser said the decision to cut all $40.8 million the president
requested for the Philippines was based on upcoming negotiations on
a new treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement.
   The U.S.-Philippines pact under which the United States leases
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base will expire in September
1991.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether
she favors keeping the U.S. bases, but a Philippine Senate
resolution introduced last month seeks to close the bases.
   Mrs. Aquino is expected to discuss the issue when she visits
Washington in November.
   While cutting money for overseas projects, the subcommittee added
$250 million to the bill for the National Guard and reserves in the
United States. Bush had requested $452.6 million.
   The subcommittee also cut $50 million from the president's
request of $101.5 million for housing the B-2 stealth bomber at the
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The reduction mirrors the
action taken in the authorization bill and reflects the delay in the
program.
   Sasser, in recommending approval of the legislation, said the
bill ``continues the priorities adopted over the last several years
and provides adequately for our most pressing military construction
needs.''

   Diane Keaton says the hard-bitten realities of
New York life brought her down to earth as she coped with fame after
her Oscar-winning triumph in ``Annie Hall.''
   ``I think it helped that I was living in New York, where no
matter who you are, you have to watch that you don't step in dog
poop,'' Keaton says in the October issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.
   Keaton, who considers herself a New Yorker who happens to spend a
lot of time in Los Angeles, volunteers two evenings a week at the
Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged whenever she is in New York.
   ``I like it. I just sit there and talk,'' she said. ``The down
side is, I'll ask for a particular person, and the room is cleaned

the night. Literally.''
   Keaton said she was very close to her Grandmother Hall, her
father's mother who died at 94.
   ``I really felt her dilemma, because she had her wits about her
right to the end. And it infuriated me to see that woman being
patronized when I'd take her to the bank or to the store or even to
the doctor.''

   For $293, aspiring scribes can now
receive 20 lessons in the fine points of writing seduction scenes
fit for Margaret Thatcher to read from the queen of romance novels
herself, Barbara Cartland.
   The 88-year-old best-selling author dispensed a few pointers as
she introduced The Barbara Cartland Romantic Writing correspondence
course on Thursday.
   Do not, she told The Times of London, take Joan Collins for a
model.
   ``Did you read Joan Collins' book? She wrote filth instead of a
nice book that could be read by presidents and prime ministers
around the world, like mine. I only read 30 pages of it ... and
couldn't take any more.
   ``I do believe that once you know something nasty you can't erase
it. That's why when I had my children ... I wouldn't read any racy
novels -- because Blossom Forbes-Robertson, who `came out' with me
in 1919, was born with an empty eye socket after her mother acted
the role of a one-eyed woman during pregnancy. So I just tried to
think beautiful thoughts.''

   Former state Sen. Julian Bond and his estranged
wife, Alice, have agreed to a divorce settlement.
   Bond's lawyer, Edward T.M. Garland, called the agreement, reached
Thursday in a pre-trial conference, ``an amicable settlement ...
that is totally satisfactory to both sides.''
   The Bonds and their lawyers would not disclose details of the
settlement which must be submitted to the judge for approval.
   The couple married in 1961 and parted in September 1986.
   The Bonds' marital problems made headlines in March of 1987, when
Mrs. Bond filed an assault complaint against a woman she described
to police as her husband's girlfriend and drug supplier. She said
Bond was a regular cocaine user, but Bond denied that he ever used
cocaine.
   Bond, 49, who now lives in Washington, is a host of a television
talk show and a frequent lecturer. He last ran for public office in
1987 when he was defeated by John Lewis for the 5th Congressional
District seat.

   Big brother Michael Jackson wasn't present,
but plenty of other celebrities and family members showed up for a
celebration introducing singer Janet Jackson's new ``telemusical''
video.
   Such luminaries as Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Sugar Ray Leonard,
Donny Osmond, and Cicely Tyson gathered along with Jackson brothers
Marlon and Jackie, sister Rebe and mother Katherine at the Vertigo

   Miss Jackson said she tried to convey a message of social change
in the video.
   ``I know a song can't change the world, but if the music can
inspire so many people and make them join hands and begin to deal
with a lot the social problems we have then hopefully we can make
some progress,'' Miss Jackson said.

<HEAD>Administration Retreats On Plan To Aid Ortega's Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, retreating under
congressional pressure, abandoned on Friday its idea of helping to
finance the presidential election campaign of Nicaraguan opposition
leader Violetta Chamorro through a U.S.-financed private
organization.
   While the National Endowment for Democracy should play an active
role in ensuring a free and fair election, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said, the United States will not ask the
group to go beyond election activities permitted by its charter.
   Chamorro is campaigning to defeat Daniel Ortega, the Nicaraguan
president, in a national election next February. All U.S. efforts,
including past weapons shipments to anti-government rebels known as
Contras, have failed to unseat the Sandinista leader.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sounded out members of
Congress earlier this week on providing around $2 million in U.S.
funds to Chamorro, the publisher of the leading opposition
newspaper, La Prensa, through the endowment. Baker encountered stiff
opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike.
   Boucher said the group's charter permits it ``to support election
activities in a general sense. We don't intend to ask it to do
anything that's beyond its charter.''
   The group, which gets its money from Congress, engaged in such
activities as voter registration and education, poll watching and
policing of vote counting in the Philippines, Panama, Poland and
Chile. ``The National Endowment for Democracy has gone a long way
towards supporting the democratic process,'' Boucher said. ``We're
confident that it can do so in Nicaragua.''
   He said there were other options for assisting Chamorro, the
widow of La Prensa's assassinated publisher, Pedro Joanquin
Chamorro, including private aid, but no final decision had been
taken.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa may have
developed an infection that poses a new danger to her health
following a heart attack last week, her cardiologist said Friday.
   Another doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said too many
visitors and doctors may be hampering Mother Teresa's chances for
recovery.
   Dr. Vincenzo Bilotta, a heart specialist from Rome and a longtime
friend of Mother Teresa, said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun is
fighting a persistent fever and chest pains.
   ``With the high temperature, her condition is still serious,''
said Bilotta, who treated Mother Teresa for a similar ailment in
1985.
   ``Her heart is very weak. The infection is now posing a new
danger to her,'' he added, without saying where the infection may
have developed.
   Dr. George Lombardi, an infectious disease specialist from
Cornell University in New York, said doctors are trying to find the
cause of the infection.
   Lombardi and Bilotta flew to Calcutta earlier in the week to help
treat Mother Teresa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979
for her devotion to the destitute and dying.
   A statement from Woodlands Nursing Home, where she was admitted
last week, said ``Mother is still running a temperature. She has had
a mild episode of chest pain which rapidly responded to treatment.''
   Mother Teresa developed chest pains and high fever Thursday just
as doctors thought she was recovering well from a heart attack
suffered Sept. 8.
   A senior physician said Friday she may have suffered a setback
because too many doctors want to treat her and too many people want
to visit her.
   ``What can the hospital management do if the prime minister, the
chief minister, the health minister and other dignitaries keep
coming to visit?'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier this week, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Mother
Teresa in the intensive care unit along with his security staff and
a television crew to film the 10-minute chat.
   Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia and gave up a comfortable
life as a convent teacher to live and work in Calcutta's squalid
slums. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned hostel.

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi will visit
the United States next month to meet with U.S. officials, possibly
including President Bush, official and private sources said Friday.
   Savimbi, who heads the Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has been invited by the Senate Task Force on Angola and will
arrive here Oct. 2, said a source close to his organization.
   ``A meeting with Bush is under consideration, but it's quite
possible,'' said an administration official who asked not to be
named.
   The official said Savimbi would brief the administration about
the precarious peace talks between his organization and the Marxist
government of Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   He is also expected to discuss the terms of the truce accord and
to ask for U.S. support in achieving closer U.N. monitoring of the
pullout of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   UNITA and the government agreed on a truce to end their 14-year
war at a meeting in Gbadolite, Zaire last June, but the cease-fire
collapsed soon after and hundreds have died in the ensuing clashes.
   The agreement has also been endangered by questions about
Savimbi's fate. Angola contends Savimbi agreed to go into temporary
exile and integrate his troops into the Angolan military. But
Savimbi denied this and accused the Angolans of lying about the
closed-door meeting in Gbadolite, Zaire.
   The State Department has been seeking to bring the sides back to
the negotiating table and a meeting has been scheduled for Monday in
Kinshasa. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen was in Zaire
this week to help arrange the meeting.
   The United States has promised Savimbi that it will maintain its
military and financial support of UNITA until a final peace
agreement is reached which allows free elections.
   The Soviet Union, which backs the government in Luanda, has also
pledged its support until peace is achieved.
   The Angolan peace talks are a result of the U.S. and
Soviet-sponsored agreement signed last December for the pullout of
some 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola. The pullout has been conducted
according to plan and is expected to be completed on schedule in
1991.
   Savimbi, who once studied in the United States, last visited here
in 1988 and met with former President Reagan.

<HEAD>Bill Envisions Large-Scale Effort to Make Fish Safe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel began considering a bill Friday
that would require health inspection of fish and shellfish, the
first effort to establish a comprehensive program to regulate the
fishing industry.
   ``Currently, many consumers are wary about the safety of fish,''
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who introduced the bill. ``They
have heard many stories about contamination from toxic industrial
and agricultural chemicals, medical waste products and red tides.''
   The ``Fish and Fish Products Safety Act of 1989'' would require
setting safety standards for contaminants for fish and establishing
a rigorous and comprehensive inspection system.
   Officials say it is more difficult to regulate fishing than the
meat or poultry industry because there are 300 edible species of
fish in vast waters.
   Contaminants for fish and shellfish include the botulism toxin,
salmonella bacteria and the hepatitis-A virus, as well as PCBs and
other industrial contaminants.
   Dr. Frank Young, head of the Food and Drug Administration,
testified before Waxman's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health and the environment that fish consumption increased to 15.4
pounds person in 1987 largely because the food is low in fat.
   Young said the FDA inspects only a quarter of the fish-processing
plants each year. He said data from the federal Centers for Disease
Control ``indicate that seafood does not cause illness in alarming
amounts or diversity.''
   However, Ellen Haas of Public Voice, a non-profit group that
deals with food safety issues, disagreed.
   She offered a CDC study that indicated that the risk of a food
poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater from
seafood than from beef, and 16 times greater than for either chicken
or pork.
   Dr. Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the food safety and
inspection service at the Agriculture Department, said that
``building on the existing meat and poultry inspection program
structure would provide a faster start up and extensive cost-savings
for a fish and seafood inspection program.''
   Legislation has been introduced in the past to give the
Agriculture Department authority over seafood inspections, just as
it is in charge of meat and poultry inspections. The Waxman bill
would make the FDA the lead agency.
   Waxman said in his opening statement Friday that ``the most
contentious issue has become one of turf _ where authority over the
new fish inspection program should be vested.''

<HEAD>Egyptian Plan Presented to Israel's Divided Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's four top leaders quarreled heatedly
Friday over an Egyptian plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
that threatens to divide the Jewish state's coalition government.
   A Labor Party official who requested anonymity said the
left-leaning party sees ``no need to stay in the government'' if
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc does not agree
to the talks.
   The two parties are divided over the Egyptian plan's insistence
on a U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied territory for peace.
   In the occupied territories Friday, Arab reports said Israeli
soldiers shot and killed two Palestinian youths, including a
12-year-old. The army said soldiers did not open fire in the area
where the child was killed.
   A spokesman for Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor Party
leader, said Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny on Friday
formally presented Israeli leaders with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's proposal.
   Peres, Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party
and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud discussed the plan.
   Israel radio reported they disagreed sharply about the proposals,
which the Labor Party supports.
   A major controversy is Mubarak's offer to sponsor peace talks
between Israel and a 12-member Palestinian delegation, including two
Arabs deported from the occupied territories. This is intended to
satisfy both Israel's demand to talk only to Palestinians from the
territories and the PLO's insistence that Palestinians living abroad
be included.
   ``Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians ... I would not
be quick to reject this possibility,'' Peres said in an interview
with the English-language Jerusalem Post.
   Israeli newspapers identified possible negotiators as deportees
Mohammed Milhem, a former West Bank mayor, and Akram Haniyeh,
formerly a newspaper editor in east Jerusalem, both senior PLO
officials.
   The Likud bloc is balking about negotiating with the PLO, which
Israel brands a terrorist organization.
   ``We have closed the door to the PLO, so the Egyptians have
decided to push the PLO through the window,'' Likud legislator
Eliyahu Ben Elissar told Israel radio.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav, also of Likud, told the daily
Yediot Ahronot that anyone who accepts the plan ``wants to break up
the national unity government.''
   Shamir wants to resolve the deadlock before visits to the United
States next week by Arens and Peres.
   Peres, who leaves Saturday and is scheduled to meet President
Bush, said in an interview published in Friday's Jerusalem Post that
the U.S. role in promoting Egypt's proposal is crucial.
   Palestinian sources in Tunisia said Friday the PLO central
council will consider the Egyptian plan in mid-October.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian reporters said Tarek
Said Tuffah, 12, was killed by an army sniper during a
stone-throwing riot. An army spokesman said troops did not fire in
the area.
   The spokesman said a patrol commander shot and killed a second
Palestinian when troops were attacked by youths throwing iron bars
and cement blocks. Arab reporters said Ata Yunis, 18, was killed in
a clash with troops during Tuffah's funeral.
   Six other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded by the army.
   In the Gaza Strip, masked Arab assailants hacked and seriously
wounded a 35-year-old woman accused of collaborating with Israel,
Arab reports said.
   Friday's deaths raised the toll to 570 Palestinians killed in the
21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Forty Israelis have died, and 114 suspected
collaborators have been killed by fellow Palestinians.

   Welsh soccer fans rampaged through a

taverns before police arrested 14 of them, authorities said.
   Prosecutor George Koliokostas charged the 14 fans of the Swansea
City soccer club with causing damage to property and said they would
remain in custody until their trial Saturday before a three-member
magistrates' court.
   The Welsh club lost 3-2 to Panathinaikos of Athens in a European

   The Welsh fans were arrested after going on a drunken rampage
that authorities said caused $13,000 in damages to three taverns at
the seaside suburb of Glyphada, 15 miles from Athens.
   They also damaged six parked cars and were involved in
streetfights with Greek soccer fans before a squad of riot police
arrested them.

<HEAD>Bush Vows Flexibility in Funding Drug War as Jackson Blasts Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush promised Friday to be flexible
amid Democratic demands for a boost in drug war spending, while the
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said the plan fails to ``match the breadth of
this social crisis.''
   Bush told reporters after a luncheon in the State Dining Room
that he still prefers the $7.9 billion drug war he unveiled on
national television last week but added, ``we're flexible.''
   Jackson, testifying on Capitol Hill, told lawmakers that the
``Bush plan does not wage war on material and spiritual poverty,
which are the preconditions for the drug crisis.''
   He said the plan underestimates the arsenals of drug dealers,
lacks sufficient funds and needs input from national and community
leaders with extensive experience in fighting the drug problem.
   Their remarks cae as Senate negotiators of both parties met for
two hours and broke reporting progress in the quest for a financing
compromise.
   ``It was a good step,'' Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told a news conference following the
meeting.
   ``At this point, I would say that everything is very much on the
table,'' Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said.
   But a Byrd plan to generate an additional $2.2 billion for the
drug war with a half-percent, across-the-board cut in federal
programs, opposed by the administration, remained part of a
transportation bill awaiting final action.
   The administration is opposed to the cut, which would slice $1.8
billion out of the Defense Department's budget.
   Hatfield said Republicans would present an alternative financing
plan when the 18-member negotiating task force returns to the
bargaining table Monday.
   Repeated applause and a few shouts of approval from spectators
marked Jackson's testimony before the House select committee on
narcotics.
   ``We need a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the
problem,'' the former Democratic presidential hopeful said.
   Jackson shook hands warmly with national drug policy director
William J. Bennett, who preceded him as a witness at the hearing,
but his remarks were sharply critical of both Bennett and Bush.
   ``In April, Mr. Bennett announced that he would take
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the
nation's capital,'' he said. ``Five months later, we still have the
emergency but no action.''
   ``President Bush announced a drug plan for Bogota, Colombia.
Where is his plan for the District of Columbia and cities around the
nation?'' said Jackson, who is believed to be weighing a race for
mayor of Washington.
   Jackson suggested that the president should convene a meeting at
Camp David to draft a new policy on drugs and include national and
community leaders with experience in fighting the problem, including
himself.
   He also said the nation's capital could become a model for
fighting the drug scourge. Asked what his own role in that project
would be, he said, ``A volunteer.''

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party daily Pravda published a letter
Friday from a Politburo member once thought to be a challenger to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in which he denied celebrating his daughter's
wedding in a former czarist palace with the czar's tableware.
   The letter from Grigory V. Romanov, former Leningrad Communist
Party chief, was his first publication in the official press since
he was retired from the Politburo on July 1, 1985, less than four
months after Gorbachev became party chief.
   Rumors of corruption followed the 66-year-old Romanov to Moscow
when he became a member of the Communist Party's ruling body in
1976, but he was considered Gorbachev's leading challenger when the
current Soviet leader assumed power.
   According to one widespread rumor, Romanov held his daughter's
wedding in one of the former czarist capital's palaces while he was
Leningrad party chief and took the czar's tableware from the
Hermitage museum for the wedding dinner.
   Some priceless tableware was smashed during a wild wedding party,
says one variant of the rumor.
   Romanov said in a three-paragraph letter published on Pravda's
third page that a parliamentary commission had investigated the
allegations.
   The wedding dinner actually was for only 12 people and was held
in a small country house, Romanov said.
   ``There was no czarist tableware from the Hermitage,'' he wrote.
   ``On this account, Pravda has all documents, including the
conclusion of a commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian
republic, which specially investigated these questions,'' the letter
said.

Taiwanese director Hou Xiaoxian.
   The film covers the saga of a father and his four children to

the mainland.
   ``Like most Chinese films, the film is a huge family melodrama,''
the 42-year-old director said in a recent newspaper interview.
   The film was considered one of the favorites for the festival's

   For the second straight year, the international jury divided the
prizes for best performances between two actors and two actresses.
   Italians Marcello Mastroianni and Massimo Troisi, who appeared in
Ettore Scola's ``What Time Is It?'' shared the award for best actor.
   Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Geraldine James of Britain shared the
best actress prize for their roles in Peter Hall's ``She's Been

   Twenty-three films from 21 countries entered the competition for
prizes. It was the festival's 46th year.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British spy novelist John Le Carre's latest
best-selling novel, ``The Russia House,'' will be published in the
country where it's set under an agreement signed Friday in Moscow,
the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   In another example of the more open atmosphere fostered by
glasnost, Le Carre's book will be issued in 100,000 Russian-language
copies next year by agreement between the Mohrbooks literary agency
of Switzerland and International Relations publishers of the Soviet
Union, Tass said.
   Ironically, the contract was concluded during Moscow's
International Book Fair, an event that plays a key role in ``The
Russia House.'' In Le Carre's book, a Soviet scientist's important
notebooks are passed to a publisher at the book fair, unleashing a
host of complications.
   Tass quoted Le Carre's European literary agent, Sabine Ibach, and
International Relations director Boris Likhachev as saying ``The
Russia House'' is a work that can do a lot toward ending mistrust
between East and West.
   ``This is a book written by a thinking man with a sober and
critical view of the times, who battles Cold War stereotypes,''
Likhachev was quoted as saying.
   Tass said an abridged version of the book will also appear in the
Russian-language magazine Foreign Literature. The possibility of
publishing it in some of the other languages spoken in the Soviet
Union is also under study, it said.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Crew Ends Rehearsal, Plans Vice Presidential Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The crew of space shuttle Atlantis
concluded a two-day countdown rehearsal Friday and traveled to
Washington for a meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The practice session, intended to mimic the 24 hours leading to
an actual launch, went smoothly despite two computer glitches that
delayed the end of the countdown, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.
   Soon after wrapping up the rehearsal, the five astronauts boarded
their T-38 jets for a flight to Washington. White House officials
said Quayle planned to meet commander Don Williams and his crewmates
Saturday at breakfast. Williams comes from Quayle's home state of
Indiana.
   ``Mr. Quayle expressed a desire to say hello to the crew sometime
before we fly,'' Williams told reporters Thursday. ``I invited him
to be a launch guest, but we'll be pretty busy and won't be able to
visit with him on launch morning.''
   The rehearsal ended at 11:10 a.m. EDT, about 10 minutes later
than planned, because launch crews needed extra time to investigate
two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's systems.
   The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress
rehearsal to its finish, even though stormy weather near the Kennedy
Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff.
   Atlantis' liftoff is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 12. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration will not set a firm
date until a two-day flight readiness review is completed Oct. 3.
   The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of
the countdown during the dry run. In addition to Williams, the crew
members are pilot Mike McCully and mission specialists Ellen Baker,
Franklin Chang Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are
to dispatch the nuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft on the start of a
six-year voyage to explore Jupiter and its moons.
   Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the
launch, either by court action or by trespassing at the launch site,
because the probe is powered by two generators fueled by
plutonium-238. They are afraid an accident during launch would
sprinkle hazardous radioactive fallout on communities surrounding
the Kennedy Space Center.
   Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power on 22
previous U.S. space flights, including the six manned Apollo moon
missions and the Voyager 2 probe, which recently sent back pictures
of the planet Neptune.
   The five astronauts on the mission say they are confident the
nuclear generators are safe.

<HEAD>Democratic Leaders Fighting Party Split on Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders on Friday began a
struggle to recoup from their loss to President Bush on his capital
gains tax cut, portraying their position as a fight for the working
class.
   But conservative Democrats said their leaders were choosing the
wrong issue _ and Republicans eagerly tried to exploit the rift in
the majority party's ranks.
   In a 19-17 vote on Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee
approved a capital gains tax cut after six Democrats defected and
went against their party to side with the president.
   Democratic leaders on Friday made clear that they would take the
fight to the full House, and that they hoped the public would be on
their side after deciding who would win and who would lose if the
tax cut is approved.
   They said they hadn't settled on what kind of alternative to
offer, but among the possibilities was including a restoration of
Individual Retirement Account tax breaks as first proposed by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The issue has emerged as the thorniest in a massive budget bill
that also includes the sensitive issues of child care and revision
of the tax for Medicare catastrophic illness coverage.
   Strategists involved in the situation were pondering the
possibility that the whole bill might collapse if forces opposed to
various provisions combined to bring it down.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,
said the cut was ``at the wrong time giving relief to the wrong
people. It's obviously a benefit that will be largely enjoyed by the
150-to-200-thousand-plus crowd.''
   Reminded that Michael Dukakis tried unsuccessfully to make a
campaign issue out of Bush's support of a capital gains cut, Hoyer
still said, ``My gut tells me the average American agrees with our
position.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who ran for the
Democratic presidential nomination last year based on populist
themes, was leading the rhetorical attack for the Democratic leaders.
   ``George Bush wants to give a tax cut to the wealthy, and send
the bill to average working Americans,'' he said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., facing the toughest test
yet of his three-month-old tenure, put his deputies to work crafting
an alternative to offer on the House floor when debate begins later
this month.
   But Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., who co-sponsored the version of the
capital gains cut approved by the committee, said it wasn't just
Republicans who thought the proposal was a good one for all
taxpayers, one that would spur investment and improve the economy.
   His own party's leaders, he said, were making a ``terrible
mistake'' by portraying capital gains as a partisan issue. ``If
enough Democrats will continue to support it and get out front, we
can save the party from itself,'' he said.
   Republicans saw the Democratic division as a return to the
politics early in President Reagan's first term, when Republicans
could team up with ``Boll Weevil'' Southern Democrats to push
through parts of the president's program.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip, spoke Friday
of ``the common sense coalition of Democrats and Republicans.''
   He and Hoyer both said there would be a tough fight on the House
floor.
   The capital gains plan approved Thursday would cut the current
maximum rate of 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 27 months.
Thereafter, the rate would rise to 28 percent but any gains would be
taxed only on the amount exceeding the annual inflation rate.
   Bush, in his campaign, promised to fight for a 15 percent rate,
but the net effect on taxpayers of the House proposal is similar to
that because of the indexing for inflation. The White House
immediately announced the president would fight for the
committee-approved plan.
   The fight is likely to be a muddy one, because the capital gains
provision is part of a huge budget bill that includes some of this
year's toughest issues _ with more battles almost certain on each
one.
   The bill would provide lower-income families additional tax
credits and state-administered grants to help working parents find
child care. Liberals and conservatives want to move the final
version in opposite directions.
   In response to a rash of complaints, the bill would halve the
surtax financing catastrophic health insurance for the wealthiest 40
percent of retirees, but the flat monthly premium paid by all but
the poorest Medicare beneficiaries would rise.
   The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage
but only if they opt out of Medicare Part B, which pays physicians'
fees.
   But many in Congress want to repeal the law altogether, and the
showdown on that issue could come on this bill.
   Other issues include new restrictions on ``dial-a-porn''
telephone services, on the Fairness Doctrine to require broadcasters
to give time to opposing views, on expansion of the Medicaid health
program for the poor, and a variety of new tax provisions affecting
businesses.

<HEAD>Book Says Dukakis Retreated Into `Two-Month Shell' After Videotape
Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Friday he hasn't read
a book about his 1988 presidential run that says he retreated into
``a two-month shell'' after a flap that rocked his campaign in
September 1987.
   The incident that forced the resignation of campaign manager John
Sasso, a close friend and adviser to Dukakis, was described in ``All
by Myself,'' a book written by Boston Globe reporters Christine M.
Black and Thomas Oliphant.
   ``He missed Sasso personally and politically, and worried about
him,'' they wrote of the Democratic candidate, and said he became
``flat as a pancake out on the hustings.''
   ``Dukakis' glum mood was also reflected in an almost petulant
unwillingness to try new material in his speeches,'' according to
the account.
   ``I haven't read it. I think it's clear we did a good job winning
the nomination and not as good a job winning the final. There's no
sense crying over spilt milk,'' Dukakis said in a brief interview
during an international trade conference at the Statehouse.
   He said he is concentrating on his responsibilities as governor,
and not rehashing the campaign.
   ``I spent most of yesterday preparing for the education summit,''
Dukakis said, referring to the meeting later this month of the
nation's governors and President Bush, the Republican who defeated
him.
   The book quoted Susan Estrich, who replaced Sasso as campaign
manager, as saying Dukakis would ``return from the road convinced
that no one liked him.'' Estrich was described as ``bothered by his
mopey moods,'' while campaign chairman Paul Brountas said the
candidate entered ``a two-month shell.''
   Sasso was forced to resign in September 1987 after it was
disclosed that he had secretly distributed a videotape showing that
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Dukakis rival for the
Democratic nomination, was appropriating as his own campaign
speeches made by British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   Sasso acted without the knowledge of Dukakis, who publicly denied
his campaign had any role in providing the videotape.
   The account also described how Dukakis repeatedly rejected
appeals from campaign aides to go on the attack against Bush. The
book outlined an advertising effort that at one point produced 1,200
unused scripts for commercials.
   Although he once had a double-digit lead over Bush in the polls,
Dukakis found himself trailing after the Republican National
Convention in August 1988.
   It wasn't until the closing days of the campaign that Dukakis
went on the attack, using the populist theme, ``I'm on your side.''
He closed the gap somewhat but on election day, Bush carried 40
states.

   About $32 milllion of cocaine hidden
in containers of asphalt was seized and eight people arrested when
Dutch authorities intercepted a drug shipment from South America,
law enforcement officials said Friday.
   Among those arrested were three Colombians and a Belgian, but
Dutch officials declined to further identify the suspects.
   The arrests Thursday night capped six months of detective work,
and coincided with the delivery of the drugs, which were concealed
in 21 barrels of asphalt at an abandoned dairy plant near this
southern city, according to police spokesman Carel Bouwman.
   It was not immediately where the cocaine originated, but Bouwman
said it crossed the Atlantic aboard a Venezuelan container ship that
arrived earlier this month in Antwerp, a Belgian port 30 miles from
Tilburg.
   The drug bust was one of the biggest in the Netherlands this year.
   In April, 310 pounds of cocaine was seized at Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport, while earlier this year West German authorities
confiscated 1,430 pounds of the drug in Munich, Bouwman said.

   A jury of teen-agers let two boys walk on
charges of stealing a bicycle but convicted two others of automobile
theft in a courtroom experiment to let young scofflaws be judged by
their peers.
   Circuit Judge Maynard Swanson Jr. had the final say Thursday and
partially disagreed with the verdicts of the six-member jury from
Zephyrhills High School. It was the first of semimonthly sessions
endorsed by judges, educators and Pasco County officials.
   The jury, volunteers from a class on the law, deliberated about
20 minutes before finding a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy
innocent of stealing the bicycle, but Swanson overruled the panel.
He explained to the jurors there was enough proof to support a
guilty verdict. The judge withheld a finding of guilt, placed the
pair on probation and ordered them to pay restitution.
   The jury contended that the prosecutor, a real one, never tied
the boys to the theft and that others were involved but avoided
getting hauled into court.
   ``If they got off with it the others should have, too,'' said
juror Sarah Chancery, a senior.
   In the other case, the jury found two boys guilty of auto theft
but innocent of a burglary charge. This time, the judge agreed.
   ``I thought you were very astute,'' Swanson told the jury.
   The boys, whose ages were not available, will be punished later
this month by the judge.
   Teacher Cynthia Brendle said the experiment is a lively way for
students to learn about the law and also should serve as a deterrent
to youngsters who face criminal charges.

   The huge store of information in the Library of
Congress could be made available to libraries and scholars across
the country through an improved computer network, the nation's chief
librarian said Friday.
   ``The Library of Congress and the national library community want
to help develop a national research and education network,'' James
H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, told a Senate subcommittee.
   ``The major information resources for this nation reside in the
Library of Congress and other research libraries across the country.
These collections have been assembled in many cases with federal,
state and local revenues.
   ``Our citizens have a right to expect that these irreplaceable
intellectual resources be made ever more widely available through a
national information network,'' he said.
   Billington testified in favor of a bill sponsored by Sen. Al
Gore, D-Tenn., which calls for the establishment of national
computer-based research network. Gore chairs the Senate Commerce
science subcommittee, which held Friday's hearing.
   ``Books would be stored digitally on magnetic tape, compact discs
or on computers,'' Gore said. ``Using a computer, library patrons
could access information from the books in the library's collection.
   ``Thousands of books could be on-line, available at the touch of
a button,'' Gore said, adding that the technology already exists.
   The Library of Congress, with 88 million items, is the largest
collection of recorded and printed information ever assembled in a
single place, Billington said.
   One of the questions that needs to be resolved before the
nationwide network is built is how to ensure copyright protection,
the Association of American Publishers told the panel.
   ``Use of public domain materials only could create an expectation
in the user community that any information in the system could be
used freely without regard to copyright,'' the group said in a
statement.

   The judge in the trial of D.L. ``Danny''
Faulkner and six others declared a mistrial Friday after jurors said
they were hopelessly deadlocked in the largest savings and loan
fraud case.
   After deliberating for more than 16 days on the 88-count
indictment, jurors told U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings they could
not come to an agreement.
   ``I know we're disappointed a verdict has not been reached in
this case,'' Cummings told jurors. ``But I'm not disappointed in
your performance.''
   He told jurors that a gag order remained in effect. It was not
immediately clear how the jury was split.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart said the case would be retried.
   Faulkner showed no emotion as the mistrial was announced, but 10
minutes later he fought back tears as he talked to reporters in the
courthouse lobby.
   ``I think it's been really hard on us,'' Faulkner said. ``I want
to be remembered for the nice things I've done, not this.''
   Co-defendant and former Garland Mayor James L. Toler put his arm
around his wife as he walked out of the courtroom and said, ``Let's
go to the showers. Get ready to fight again.''
   Faulkner and Toler are accused of heading a conspiracy to steal
$135 million from Empire Savings and Loan Association of Mesquite
and four other S&amp;Ls in Texas and Arkansas in 1982 and 1983.
   The other defendants, former Empire chairman Spencer H. Blain
Jr.; former S&amp;L employee Paul Arlin Jensen; former real-estate
salesman Kenneth Cansler and land appraisers Arthur Formann and Paul
Douglas Tannehill, also were accused of conspiracy.
   There was little reaction from the defendants or the prosecutors
when the judge announced the mistrial. Defendants and their
attorneys shook hands, and Hart and two other prosecutors left the
courtroom immediately.
   Several jurors were frowning as they entered the courtroom for
Cummings' announcement. The cordial atmosphere that was evident
during the six months of testimony had dissolved.
   Hart asked Cummings to poll the jurors, but the request was
denied.
   Mike Fawer, Towler's attorney, called the mistrial ``an
absolutely crushing defeat for the government.''
   ``The government took its best shot, and they have not been able
to win a case under the best possible circumstances,'' Fawer said.
``And I think they should leave these people in peace and let them
get on with their lives.''
   The indictment charged the seven with defrauding the savings and
loans through fanciful real-estate appraisals and sham land
transactions along Interstate 30 in Garland, east of Dallas.
   Prosecutors said the defendants gave themselves private jets,
expensive watches and even a $4 million mansion with the money they
borrowed ostensibly to buy land and condominiums.
   All the defendants except Formann and Tannehill were charged with
a count of racketeering, which allows the government to confiscate
illegal profits. The government had accused the defendants of
receiving $135 million from the alleged scheme.
   After hearing six months of testimony in which 120 witnesses
testified and more than 3,000 documents were introduced, the jury
began deliberations Aug. 23.
   The defense called no witnesses, but attorneys contended in two
days of final arguments the defendants were victims both of Texas'
economic collapse in the mid-1980s and of the government's key
witness, real-estate salesman Clifford Sinclair.
   The defendants contend that Sinclair, who pleaded guilty to
federal fraud charges, is entirely responsible for planning the
looting of the savings and loans and he is falsely implicating them
to get his 13-year sentence reduced.
   When Empire was closed by regulators in 1984, it was the largest
collapse of a thrift in U.S. history. Prosecutors said the
defendants were partly to blame. The $279 million Empire collapse
heralded the failures of other thrifts soon after, when oil and
real-estate prices plummeted.
   Unlike some of the smaller trials involving thrifts, there were
no charges of using depositors' money to buy influence or sex.
Instead, testimony consisted of a mind-numbing array of numbers
recounted by witnesses describing dozens of real-estate transactions
in excruciating detail.

   Business inventories climbed 0.6 percent in
July, the biggest gain in three months, while total business sales
fell by 0.9 percent, the government reported Friday.
   While the combination of falling sales and rising inventories
would normally spark recession fears, analysts for the most part
dismissed Friday's report.
   ``The rise in business inventories is potentially a problem, but
when it is taken in context with other data, it is not very
worrisome,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Supporting this view, the Federal Reserve reported Friday that
industrial production posted a 0.3 percent increase in August, the
best showing in four months, reflecting a rebound in production at
auto plants.
   Economists said this increase in industrial output, along with a
rise in retail sales in August, was an encouraging sign that
factories would not be scaling back production plans for fear that
output was getting ahead of demand.
   Many analysts believe that outside of the auto industry,
inventories have been kept at fairly lean levels and they are
predicting that overall production will post moderate gains for the
rest of the year.
   For July, the 0.6 percent rise in inventories, the largest since
a 0.9 percent May increase, pushed the total stockpile of unsold
goods to a seasonally adjusted $785.5 billion.
   It was led by a 1.1 percent rise in inventories held by
manufacturers. Inventories at the retail level rose 0.3 percent
while wholesale inventories were unchanged.
   The 0.9 percent plunge in total sales matched a similar decline
in February and was the largest sales setback since a 3 percent drop
in January 1987. The July decrease left total sales at a seasonally
adjusted level of $511.09 billion
   Sales at the manufacturing level fell by 1.8 percent while sales
by wholesalers were off 0.8 percent.
   Retail sales were the only area of strength, rising by 0.5
percent in July. In an indication of further improvement, the
government said Thursday that retail sales in August were up 0.7
percent, reflecting a surge in auto sales.
   The combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed
the ratio of inventories to sales to 1.54 in July, meaning that it
would take 1.54 months to exhaust inventories at the July sales pace.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari says
he will help a U.S. coalition of Hispanic leaders form a binational
commission to address problems facing residents on both sides of the
border.
   Intent on solidifying ties with Mexico, the organization IMPACTO
2000 met with Salinas for 45 minutes Thursday night to outline their
plan. It was Salinas' first trip to Baja California since he took
office Dec. 1.
   The proposal would create cooperatives to deal with cross-border
issues including commerce, education, immigration, culture and
health care.
   Saying positive changes already are occurring in several of those
areas in Mexico, the president told 300 delegates of the group that
he welcomed the plan and would direct various Mexican agencies to
begin preparing the framework to deal with some of the issues.
   ``We will continue to work. We have a good relationship with the
U.S. government and the Congress and an especially harmonious
relationship with the Mexican-American community,'' Salinas said.
``We will continue that relationship with the future generations of
Mexican-Americans.''
   The coalition, which wants to spur progress on these problems by
the year 2000, includes representatives from churches, immigration
centers, Hispanic elected officials and Hispanic professional and
student groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens
and the GI Forum.
   The proposal submitted to Salinas seeks to create a binational
commission that would include Mexican agencies and leaders from
those business, education, church, student and labor sectors. It
excludes the U.S. government.

Institute for Social Justice, said the U.S. government was left out
because it has underestimated America's relationship with Mexico for
too long.
   However, IMPACTO realizes that the growing Hispanic population in
the United States is an issue that has to be addressed, Navarro said.
   About 20 million Hispanics live in the United States today, 62
percent of them born there, Navarro said. He said projections
indicate half of California's residents by 2030 will be Hispanic.
   Members of the 4-year-old coalition met with Salinas last year
and the president promised to listen to their proposal after he was
elected.

<HEAD>Robert Penn Warren: A Sense of Adventure</HEAD>

   Richard Herzfelder, now the AP's News Editor for
Mexico and Central America, has known Robert Penn Warren since 1972,
when he studied under him at Yale University.

   The cancer that would kill him was already at
work. He couldn't lift weights or walk young men and women into
breathlessness any more.
   But Robert Penn Warren refused to be a sick man; he didn't want
to talk about that. He was the first poet laureate of the United
States and he had a speech to write.
   I drove him and his wife, Eleanor, from his summer home in
Stratton, Vt., to a hospital in Boston. Even about that there was a
sense of adventure. Would we get lost? Stuck in a snowbank? There
could be no such thing as disaster.
   He told me his daughter Rosanna had been born at home during a
snowstorm, no doctors could get to the house. That was an adventure
too. But perhaps only in retrospect.
   We discussed poetry, the news, war and rock music. You couldn't
be depressed around him. It seemed silly.
   Mr. Warren _ I never called him anything else, though his
nickname was `Red,' for the red hair of his youth _ was generous
enough to let me think of him as a friend.
   I took the last class he taught at Yale, a writing course given
in the fall of 1972. He was 67 then, the author of ``All The King's
Men.'' What more could he do, I thought. That was a book from the
1940s.
   At first it was awful. He was an old-fashioned teacher. He didn't
like fools, and didn't seem to believe in give-and-take in the
classroom. Sometimes he looked like a crocodile.
   Then he read Rudyard Kipling's story ``The Man Who Would Be
King'' to the class. It was amazing that his high-pitched Kentucky
accent _ he never lost it despite years in California, England, New
England _ could recreate the dry mountains of northern Pakistan.
   He invited the class to his house for dinner, introduced us to
leading literary lights _ ``This is John Cheever. John Hersey. Ralph
Ellison.''
   I was drinking bourbon because I didn't want to seem like a wimp.
Nervous, I emptied my glass quickly. ``You look like you need a
DRINK,'' he said, refilling my glass.
   After about six of those I went downstairs and took a nap on the
dining room floor. That's where I was when the first guests walked
in for supper.
   He liked that. He came from a generation that thought it romantic
to drink to oblivion daily. Though he cut down in later years, I
stayed up with him a couple of times. What I couldn't do was get up
the next morning, lift weights and take a two-mile walk. Then it was
time to work.
   Work. People who telephoned him in the morning got an awful
shock. He'd answer, but you were interrupting work. He didn't much
like telephones anyway. He once wrote a poem called ``Little Black
Heart of the Telephone.''
   At the time I didn't understand why that might be important. I
didn't understand how easy it was to lose time, how hard it is to
concentrate and get more than three things done in a day. How hard
it was for a man to keep producing after winning two Pulitzer Prizes.
   He ``retired'' from Yale, then he won his third Pulitzer. He
didn't particularly need it. What he needed was the work.
   Mr. Warren taught me a lot of things, few of them in class. He
taught by example, by his energy, by his love of truth and beauty,
by his sense of adventure.
   He and his wife taught me and many others that it's possible for
two competitive people to love each other and have a happy marriage.
Mrs. Warren writes under the name Eleanor Clark. Their tennis court
is a memorial to the National Book Award _ it was built with her
prize money. None of those prizes stopped them from wearing funny
hats on New Year's Eve.
   There is a final memory, my favorite. He told me later he'd
thought I was his stupidest student because I never talked in class.
Finally he called me in for a private conference.
   Somehow I mentioned that I had just read Alfred Tennyson's poem
``Ulysses'' for the first time. The last line has become a cliche,
but I thought it was stunning when read as the climax to a great
poem.
   He almost leaped out of his chair and yelped, ``It's a
MAGNIFICENT poem.''
   I started reciting the first lines planning to make some learned
comment, or rather some comment that would make me seem learned.
   Instead, he simply joined me. Together we recited the whole poem.
I could not believe I was remembering it all, but it seemed easy.
   The poem describes Ulysses' years after the Trojan wars and his
10-year homeward Odyssey, old but still determined to push on to new
adventure in spite of all risk, trouble or weakness.
   I didn't realize how much that might have meant to Mr. Warren
until just now. This is how it ends:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Though much is taken, much abides; and though
   We are not now that strength which in old days
   Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
   One equal temper of heroic hearts,
   Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
   To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

<TEXT>
   The ``Night Stalker'' jury's deliberations
were interrupted Friday by a juror's illness, but the panel planned
to resume for a 20th day Monday.
   The jury, which had to restart deliberations after one panelist's
death, began its talks anew on Aug. 16.
   Eleven of the 12 jurors started discussing the case July 26.
Their first 13 days of deliberations were ordered scrapped when a
juror died and an alternate was substituted.
   On Aug. 14, the initial deliberations were interrupted by word
that juror Phyllis Singletary was found beaten and shot at her home.
Her live-in boyfriend later committed suicide and left a note saying
he had killed her in a domestic dispute.
   The shaken jury was given a day to recover, then started
deliberations in the year-old trial over again. Defense attorneys
asked the judge to question them about their emotional reactions to
the murder, but Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan refused.
   Defense lawyers said jurors might be prejudiced by the fact that
Ms. Singletary's murder was similar to some of the crimes with which
Richard Ramirez is charged.
   Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is accused of
a series of gruesome murders and assaults that terrified Los Angeles
in the summer of 1985.
   The prosecution claims Ramirez is the devil-worshiping ``Night
Stalker'' who left symbols of demon worship at some murder scenes
and gouged out one victim's eyes.
   Ramirez' defense team argued during his trial that witnesses were
too traumatized to make positive identifications of their assailant.
They claimed that Ramirez was a victim of mistaken identity.

<HEAD>U.S. Concerned North Korea Developing Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department registered on Friday its
continuing concern that North Korea may be developing nuclear
weapons, but said it was unaware of any development that would
heighten the concern.
   Earlier, the South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted a department
official as saying the U.S. government was ``gravely concerned'' and
was keeping a close watch on possible efforts to develop nuclear
weapons.
   The news agency quoted Spencer Richardson, the head of the
department's Korea section, as saying the Soviet Union would be as
concerned if North Korea produced such weapons.
   While denying it has nuclear weapons, North Korea has repeatedly
charged that U.S. forces based in South Korea were equipped with
nuclear arms and were preparing for a nuclear war on the divided
Korean peninsula. U.S. officials have rejected the North Korean
claims.
   The United States garrisons about 43,000 troops in South Korea
under a defense pact. The Soviet Union is the communist North's main
arms supplier.
   Asked about the Yonhap report, Richard Boucher, the State
Department spokesman, said: ``I don't have anything new to express
our concern.''
   He added: ``I think we've talked very often in our past about the
need for North Korea to put its nuclear programs under international
safeguards. They reached some sort of agreement way back in 1985
with the International Atomic Energy Agency that they would do that.
But so far, the actual safeguards provisions have not been completed
and we really think they should do that at a very early date.''
   Asked if there was some new reason for special concern, the U.S.
official replied he did not have any new information about the
program ``or something that would lead me to think that our concerns
are heightened. But we do have a longstanding concern.''

<HEAD>Battle Launched to Against Livestock Pests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An all-out war against screwworms has been
launched in Puerto Rico to help prevent the livestock pests from
migrating to the United States, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said about 20 screwworm larvae were
found Sept. 5 near San Juan on a horse that had been shipped from
Venezuela.
   Beginning Friday, he said, about 800,000 sexually sterilized
screwworm flies will be released twice a week for six weeks in a
five-mile radius around the airport and the quarantine station.
   The technique floods the suspected area with sterile male flies.
If a female mates with one, her eggs will not hatch, thus ending the
life cycle. Normally, the eggs are laid in open sores or wounds of
warm-blooded animals, hatching out into worms that feed on the
living flesh.
   Glosser said the adult screwworm fly is about twice the size of a
house fly, with orange eyes and a bluish-green body with three dark
stripes along the back. Screwworm larvae are creamy white and grow
to about half an inch in length after five to seven days of feeding.
   Screwworms were eradicated in Puerto Rico in 1975. The United
States was declared free of the pests in 1966, although small
infestations have occurred since then, mostly along the U.S.-Mexico
border.

   A Solidarity journalist was named Friday as
spokesman for Poland's new government, which is the first to be led
by non-Communists in the East bloc.
   Malgorzata Niezabitowska writes for Tygodnik Solidarnosc, the
same weekly where Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki still holds the
post of editor in chief. He named her to her new post.
   The last permanent government spokesman was Jerzy Urban, who
conducted Western-style news conferences unique in the East bloc.
   His defense of the former Communist government's policies,
including efforts to suppress Solidarity, led to cold exchanges with
journalists and made him a well-known figure in Poland and abroad.
   Ms. Niezabitowska, who studied law and journalism at Warsaw
University, worked for the labor movement's weekly when Mazowiecki
founded it during the union's first legal phase in 1980-81. She
rejoined it after the movement was re-legalized this spring.
   During the 1980s, she also wrote for several Roman Catholic and
foreign publications.
   Her writing on Poland's once vibrant Jewish community has been
published in the United States, where she was a Neiman Fellow at
Harvard University in 1986-1987.
   There is only one woman in the prime minister's cabinet, Culture
Minister Izabela Cywinska.
   The 24-member body is controlled by Solidarity, which has 12
seats. The Communists hold four seats, and two smaller parties the
rest.
   It is the first East bloc government led by non-Communists since
the Communists consolidated control over Eastern Europe after World
War II.

<TEXT>
   A toddler missing from his home
overnight was found more than 17 hours later Friday clinging to a
root in a creek.
   Jesse Vitu, who will be 2 on Monday, doesn't know many words, but
when rescuer Jeff Jones found him, the boy reached out and said one
word: ``Home.''
   He was taken to a hospital where salve was put on scratches. He
was given liquids and sent home in good shape.
   Jesse wandered down a logging road behid his home about 4 p.m.
Thursday, and Jones spotted him about 9:30 a.m. Friday standing
knee-deep in Sugar Creek about a mile from home.
   Jones said that Jesse apparently had fallen into the creek, and
the current washed him downstream until he grabbed the root sticking
out from a bank.
   ``When I seen him I ran for him like I would my own,'' Jones
said. ``He was standing on the bottom. There was swift water around
him and all I could see was his head.
   ``The only time he started crying was when he got in the truck
coming back.''
   Bobby Brown, another rescue squad member in the truck, said that
when Jesse ``saw home he was a happy fellow.''
   Jesse's mother, Diane Vitu, said he ``disappeared in not even a
minute.''
   She said that when her other children arrived home from school
they went into the yard to play and that Jesse went along. She said
she followed within a minute and the toddler was gone.
   Sixty to 75 people, including members of law enforcement agencies
and two rescue squads, residents of the trailer park where the
family lives and employees of Russell Corp., where Jesse's parents
work, took part in the search.
   ``I couldn't believe all the people,'' said his father, John
Vitu. ``They just wouldn't quit.''
   When Jesse disappeared he was wearing a T-shirt, shorts, training
pants and a bib. When found, the training pants and shorts had been
pulled off him by the current.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Azerbaijan's parliament met in emergency
session early Saturday to discuss the ethnic conflict engulfing the
Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, official reports said.
   The Tass news agency said the southern republic's Supreme Soviet
would also examine a draft law proclaiming Azerbaijan's sovereignty
and citizenship and transition to the principles of economic
independence and self-management.
   The measures under study in the mostly Moslem republic are in
line with demands increasingly voiced by many Soviet ethnic groups
for greater control over their own affairs.
   The meeting convened Friday, but the lawmakers had debated for
more than 14 hours as the session extended into early Saturday.
   Communist Party officials will meet Tuesday in Moscow to consider
proposed changes in the country's nationalities policy and try to
find a way to calm ethnic quarrels that have often erupted in
violence.
   In another sign of the greater democratization under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, it was the first time representatives of the
People's Front of Azerbaijan and other informal organizations were
allowed to attend the republic's parliament, Tass said.
   It was meeting in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku on the Caspian
Sea coast.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous territory within Azerbaijan with
a predominantly Armenian population, is the center of a dispute
between Armenia and Azerbaijan. About 100 people have died in ethnic
strife the past 18 months, and hundreds of thousands have fled their
homes.
   The People's Front is demanding Azerbaijan's parliament reassert
control over Nagorno-Karabakh and that the direct rule over the
region by Moscow instituted in February be halted.
   ``The situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh has never been so
tense and explosive as today,'' Arkady Volsky, head of the special
committee created by the Kremlin to administer the district, said in
televised remarks Thursday night.
   Volsky said Moscow was forced to assume control of the region
because of the bloodshed. ``The state cannot stand aside if blood is
spilled,'' he said.
   The duty editor who answered the telephone at Azerinform, the
republic's official news agency, said the session was continuing
early Saturday. ``They're still debating and haven't taken any
votes,'' said the editor, who declined to give his name.
   On Thursday, the newspaper Pravda reported that a strike by
Azerbaijani railroad workers to press demands for Azerbaijani
control of Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in the cutting of fuel and
other supplies into neighboring Armenia.
   The strike was called off Monday, but it resulted in severe
shortages of fuel and other supplies. Armenia gets 87 percent of its
freight from Azerbaijan.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the situation was particularly
threatening in northern Armenia, where workers are trying to
reconstruct cities devastated by the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed
25,000 people.

   A House committee's vote to reinstate
preferential capital gains tax rates will help ``mom-and-pop type''
farmers, not just rich people, a national farm leader said Friday.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said there are family farmers all over the country who have owned
land for many years and now want to sell out and retire.
   But because of inflation, land values have increased so much that
many cannot afford to retire after paying high capital gains taxes
on the sales.
   ``We're talking about mom-and-pop type of agriculture here,''
Kleckner said in a statement. ``We're not talking about wealthy
farmers.''
   Kleckner added that ``it's kind of a populist idea that capital
gains are only for wealthy people. It's going to be extremely
helpful for all of agriculture, and most of agriculture is not in
the extremely wealthy class.''
   The House Ways and Means Committee voted 19-17 on Thursday to cut
the tax.

<HEAD>Inouye Calls For Indians To Settle $50 Million Dispute Themselves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs said Friday he wants the Seminole Indians of Oklahoma
and Florida to settle a $50 million dispute themselves instead of
asking Congress to handle it.
   ``In most cases, decisions made in Washington for Indians are the
worst solutions,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. ``Decisions
should be made in Indian country.''
   His comments came during a hearing on legislation that would
divide money awarded the tribe in 1976 for Florida lands taken when
most of the tribe was relocated by the government to Oklahoma in the
1823 ``Trail of Tears.''
   The award _ $16 million _ has been held by the Treasury
Department for 23 years because the members of the tribe, many of
whom still live in Florida, have not agreed on how it should be
divided.
   It has accumulated substantial interest, and it is estimated to
reach $50 million by the end of this year.
   Legislation sponsored by Oklahoma Sens. David Boren, a Democrat,
and Don Nickles, Republican, would give 75 percent of the money to
the Oklahoma Seminoles and 25 percent to the Florida Seminoles, the
Miccosukee Tribe of Florida and the unaffiliated Seminole Indians of
Florida.
   Nickles said the split is fair because it's based on population
figures that counted 2,146 Seminoles in Oklahoma and 700 in Florida.
   He also said the Oklahoma tribe is poorer than the Florida one.
   ``Not only did hundreds of Seminoles die during the forced march
from Florida to Indian Territory, but lands initially given to the
tribe as a reservation were later taken from them as Oklahoma became
a state,'' said Nickles.
   ``Today the Seminole Nation (in Oklahoma) has a total of only 380
acres of tribally owned land,'' he said.
   On the other hand, he said, the Florida tribe ``is flourishing
economically with a reservation land base of approximately 80,000
acres.''
   James Billie, tribal council chairman for the Seminoles in
Florida who want a 50-50 split, told the committee he thought the
two sides could come to some agreement if they had 30 more days.
   ``While we in Florida have a sharp disagreement with our Oklahoma
brethren over the division of the claims commission's award, we have
not lost sight of the fact that we are all one people,'' Billie said.
   ``As a result of recent informal preliminary discussions we have
had with some of our Oklahoma brethren, we believe that it still may
be possible in a relatively short time ... to have agreement reached
by the two groups.''
   ``I would prefer negotiations,'' said Inouye. He said sovereign
nations, as Indian tribes are viewed, should be able to negotiate.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian predicted lives
will be saved by legislation he signed Friday to lower California's
blood-alcohol standard for drunken drivers.
   ``We are seeing a reduction in the number of traffic fatalities
caused by drunken drivers,'' he told reporters and law enforcement
officers gathered in his office for the bill signing.
   ``On the other hand, we still have a far greater number of such
fatalities than we should have in California. This will make it
possible for law enforcement to obtain greater numbers of
convictions,'' the Republican governor said.
   Deukmejian said 2,239 people died last year as a result of
drunken drivers on California highways.
   The law, effective Jan. 1, lowers the blood-alcohol level at
which a person is presumed too drunk to drive from 0.10 percent to
0.08 percent. Current law allows for prosecution when a driver's
blood-alcohol level is below 0.10 percent if there is other evidence
the driver was too intoxicated to drive safely. Convictions are
rare, however.
   The new law still allows for prosecutions at levels below 0.08
percent if other evidence warrants it. The American Medical
Association supports a 0.05 percent level.
   A variety of factors, including weight, affect the amount of
alcohol a person can consume before getting drunk. The average
person can consume about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts
of other alcoholic beverages in an hour before reaching the 0.08
percent level.
   Drunken drivers should beware of the lowered standard, Deukmejian
said.
   ``This is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do
drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up
being convicted of drunken driving ...,'' he said.

   A senior State Department official called on
the Arab governments Friday night to abandon their campaign of
trying to expel Israel from the United Nations.
   John H. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the Near
East, said that ``change in tactics'' could contribute to efforts to
arrange negotiations between the Arabs and Israel.
   ``Every year around this time the question comes up for a vote,''
Kelly said in a speech prepared for a conference on the Middle East
at the Wye Plantation in Maryland.
   ``It is time for the Arab nations to follow the example of the
PLO and acknowledge Israel's existence as a state. Israel is
entitled to membership in the United Nations under the principle of
universality,'' Kelly said.
   The U.S. official referred to the step taken last year by
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who also
publicly renounced terrorism. That action met U.S. conditions for
the dialogue opened by the United States with the PLO last December.
   ``It is time for the Arab governments to stop the anachronistic
practice of voting against Israeli credentials,'' Kelly said.
   The Arabs have consistently failed to oust Israel from the United
Nations but the move provides an annual opportunity to condemn the
Jewish state before a large audience. Arab delegates also habitually
walk out when Israel's representative speaks to the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Kelly denied U.S. peace efforts were at a dead end.
   ``There is potential for movement,'' he said, adding that a
timetable for face-to-face negotiations should be set by
Palestinians and Israel _ not the Bush administration.

<HEAD>House Panel Asks Justice Department to Probe FAA Officials</HEAD>

   A House panel charged Friday that FAA officials
lied under oath about payroll records prepared during the 1981
controllers' strike and in some instances doctored time sheets to
cheat the controllers.
   The committee asked the Justice Department to investigate.
   Faced with shoddy documents to justify the firings before the
Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Aviation Administration
officials in Chicago for three months created attendance records to
bolster their cases, lawmakers concluded.
   The report by the Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on
investigations and oversight capped a three-year probe that included
private hearings and documents subpoenaed from the Chicago Air Route
Traffic Control Center at Aurora, Ill.
   The panel said it was willing to send its evidence to the Justice
Department and sent a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
urging an investigation into possible criminal misconduct.
   John Leyden, a spokesman for the FAA in Washington, declined
comment except to say, ``The FAA has receieved the report and will
review it.''
   The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the 450
firings in Chicago, which were among 11,500 nationwide ordered Aug.
5, 1981, by then-President Reagan, two days after members of the
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization struck.
   Rather, the subcommittee said it was concerned with the actions
of FAA officials while they were defending the firings in front of
the board that considers appeals from dismissed federal employees.
   For example, the FAA officials corrected some attendance records
to bring them up to date, but altered others, in some instances
recording a controller who was on leave at the time of the strike as
being absent without leave, to cheat the controllers, the
subcommittee said.
   The panel's report said the strike produced ``traumatic and
confusing times'' at the Chicago center. Supervisors had to handle
other jobs, ``and this situation severely affected the condition of
the center's attendance records,'' the report said.
   On Aug. 13, 1981, 10 days after the strike began and a month
before the controllers were told formally they had been fired,
Robert L. Miller, evaluations officer at the center, began to
process personnel files in anticipation that appeals would be filed
with the appeals board, the subcommittee said.
   To justify the firings, FAA officials decided to present
attendance records showing that the controllers had failed to report
to work during the strike.
   Between Sept. 14 and Oct. 1, these records were sent to the FAA's
Great Lakes regional office in Des Plaines, Ill., but officials
there found so many clerical errors that employees in Aurora had to
produce a second set of attendance records, the subcommittee said.
   FAA officials subsequently assured the merit board that the
records were the ones that had been used by George Gunter, the chief
of the Chicago center and the official who ordered the firings.
   The subcommittee concluded, however, that the assurance was ``a
certification that we now know to be false.''
   ``These documents, in many cases, either did not exist at the
time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors,'' the
subcommittee said. ``A plan was instituted whereby records were
created where none existed and amended where there were errors.''
   The subcommittee said it was not able to determine who had
ordered the second set of records.
   The subcommittee's report also concluded that Richard Shewfelt,
the FAA's regional manager for labor relations at the time, ``knew
of the problems of consistency and accuracy in the records that led
to the second shipment.''
   Shewfelt, who still works for the FAA's Chicago office, did not
return phone messages requesting comment. Miller is retired and
could not be found for comment.
   Gunter, now supervisor of training at the Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Fremont, Calif., said he had not seen the report
and declined to comment.

   The Justice Department said Friday that it had
joined a whistleblower's lawsuit charging that Fairchild Industries
Inc. defrauded the Pentagon by selling the Air Force faulty jet
fighter equipment.
   The department said it had taken over the lawsuit filed by Neil
Aliksanian, who was a program manager for Fairchild until leaving
the company in 1987.
   The government's complaint amending the original allegations made
by Aliksanian was unsealed Thursday by a federal judge in Los
Angeles.
   Stuart E. Schiffer, acting head of the Justice Department's civil
division, said in a statement that the government is claiming more
than $1 million in civil penalties for filing false claims.
   The government contends that Fairchild Control System Co., a
division of the Chantilly, Va.-based defense company, sold the Air
Force defective fuel-tank equipment for jet fighters.
   Aliksanian's original lawsuit was filed under the False Claims
Act, a Civil War-era law that allows private citizens to sue on
behalf of the government. His complaint was kept under court seal
until last month.
   The government's amended complaint was filed under seal in June.

   The first major American exhibition of
contemporary East German art is most surprising for what it does not
include _ ``no grand pictures of tractors and happy peasants,''
according to a Harvard curator.
   Instead, the dozen artists whose work was chosen to represent the
German Democratic Republic dispel stereotypes of flat socialist art
with often harrowing portraits of the horrors of war and political
oppression.
   The nearly 70 paintings and drawings by artists, ages 35 to the
mid-80s, were selected by Harvard curator Peter Nisbet, art critic
Dore Ashton of the Cooper Union in New York and modern German art
historian and Professor Peter Selz.
   ``We hope the whole show undermines expectations,'' said Nisbet,
who accompanied the others on travels to East Germany to meet
artists and their work. ``This is an example of how many of these
artists do not show false optimism or a sense that there is an easy
road to an ideal state. They are aware of the fraigility of peace,
of nightmares, of anxiety.''
   The artists whose paintings are shown are not among the legions
of refugees departing the country across the Hungarian border to
Austria, he said.
   ``These are people who have decided to stay and fight and
introduce into East Germany's official culture as much of human life
as they can,'' said Nisbet, who led a tour of the exhibit Friday,
which opens Sept. 16 and runs through Nov. 5. ``One has to
acknowledge the honorable role they play. The people who are leaving
decided to give up the struggle.''
   The paintings range from Max Uhlig's expressionist, almost
abstract portraits and landscapes to Theodor Rosenhauer's still
lifes and other, more light-hearted and ironic works.
   The exhibit, half of which is in the Fogg Museum at Harvard
University and the other half at the Sackler Museum across the
street, opens with a twist.
   The first work on view is a four-panel painting that depicts four
Soviet soldiers against a vivid red background.
   ``It's the perfect introductory painting,'' said Nisbet. ``It
looks propaganda-like.''
   But on closer inspection, the soldiers in Thomas Ziegler's
``Soviet Soldier 1987'' are clearly from different ethnic groups.
One art critic, said Nisbet, suggested the paintings are a
meditation on ``individual versus the group'' and hint at the
transience of military occupation and the hope for eventual peace.
   The paintings and drawings that follow ``Soviet Soldier'' smash
stereotypes of ``socialist realism'' painting.
   Bernhard Heisig's haunting ``Volunteer Soldier'' is among the
most powerful in the exhibit. It depicts the horrified face of a
soldier, surrounded by a dark, swirling montage of images that
Nisbet termed a ``collage of horrible memories.''
   Many of the artists' works invoke feelings of helplessness and
anxiety. Nisbet suggested that the artists have struggled with the
stunted political and cultural history of East Germany. While they
draw on the rich history of German art, they cannot escape the
constraints and sense of collective identity confusion in an Eastern
bloc country.
   Walter Libuda's ``Ceiling Runner'' is Kafkaesque in its portrayal
of a man hanging upside down with his feet on the ceiling.
   But not all the paintings are as dark.
   One of Sighard Gille's works, ``Party in Leipzig,'' shows a group
of artists engaged in a bit of decadence at a cafe. The painting was
considered controversial in East Germany but was eventually allowed
to be shown there and abroad, said Selz, who teaches at the
University of California at Berkeley.
   ``It shows there's much more freedom of artistic expression,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Thousands March for Peace in El Salvador</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Salvador Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 10,000 people marched
through this capital city Friday in support of talks intended to end
a decade-old civil war. President Alfredo Cristiani promised
flexibility in the peace effort.
   The march coincided with Central America's Independence Day and
participants chanted slogans calling for ``True independence,
without Yankee intervention!''
   Many of the left-leaning groups that participated consider El
Salvador dependent on the United States and subordinate to it.
   Washington has provided more than $3.5 billion in military and
economic aid to El Salvador this decade, making this couuntry Latin
America's biggest single recipient of American assistance.
   The aid has been aimed at preventing a victory by the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, popularly known by its
Spanish initials _ FMLN.
   El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras on
Friday celebrated together the 168th anniversary of independence
from Spain in 1821.
   Government and rebel representatives agreed on Friday to open
peace talks next month after two days of discussions in Mexico City,
the first such discussions in two years.
   Cristiani called the Mexico City agreements ``important accords''
on how to proceed toward ending a war that has claimed more than
70,000 lives. But he warned: ``While welcoming the dialogue process,
we don't want to create false expectations. ... We want to reiterate
that our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within our
constitutional framework ... We know the road ahead is difficult and
complex.''
   He addressed a small rally of supporters and government officials
in a downtown park.
   For the first time since the war started in 1979, authorities
staged an Independence Day military parade though the capital. About
3,000 troops from the three military branches and the three
militarized police forces marched to music by military bands.
   Crowds lined the parade route, which followed a route different
from that of the peace march. But the peace marchers appeared to
attract more people, who waved white flags and blue-and-white
national banners and chanted slogans hailing the upcoming dialogue.
   The march was sponsored by the National Debate for Peace, an
umbrella organization comprising about 70 church, union, student and
humanitarian organizations.

<HEAD>Israel Parties Say Disagreement Over Egyptian Plan Threatens Coalition</HEAD>

   Officials in Israel's two largest parties said
Friday that disagreements over Egypt's plan to arrange
Israeli-Palestinian talks threatened the coalition government.
   Israel's top leaders on Friday reportedly clashed for the second
time this week over the 10-point plan and on President Hosni
Mubarak's efforts to sponsor a Palestinian delegation for talks with
Israel.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir emerged optimistic after
Friday's session, telling Israel radio:
   ``There are some chances for moving our peace process, not only
by these 10 points ... There are other developments that encourage
us. I don't think we are facing a deadlock. There is a movement and
we are discussing further developments with our American friends,
Egyptian friends, and I hope that we will get results.''
   Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny presented the plan to the
Israeli officials, said an aide to Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.
Israel had been saying it cannot comment on a proposal it has not
been officially presented with.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops shot and killed two Palestinian
youths in clashes with stone-throwers in Nablus, Arab hospital
officials said. The army confirmed both deaths but said soldiers did
not open fire where 12-year-old Tarkek Said Tuffah was killed. Arab
reports said Tuffah was shot by an army sniper.
   The two deaths raise to 570 the Palestinian death toll in the
21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation. Forty Israelis
have also died in the violence, and 114 Arabs have been killed by
fellow Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   A meeting of Labor's Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
with Likud's Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens ended in sharp
disagreement, Israel radio reported.
   Egypt's plan stipulates acceptance of the U.S-supported formula
of trading territory for peace and participation of the 140,000
residents of annexed east Jerusalem in the Palestinian elections
offered by Israel.
   Both ideas are opposed by Likud but supported by Labor.
   Mubarak also proposed that the 12-member Palestinian delegation
include two Arabs deported from the occupied territories.
   The proposal is intended to satisfy Israel's demand to talk only
to Palestinians from the territories and the PLO's insistence that
Palestinians living abroad be included in any talks.
   ``Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians. ... I would not
be quick to reject this possibility,'' Peres said in an interview
with the English-language Jerusalem Post.
   A Labor official speaking on condition of anonymity said Labor
ministers agreed in a meeting Thursday night to negotiate with such
a delegation. He said the party saw ``no need to stay in the
government'' if there was no progress in peace talks.
   Labor apparently agrees to negotiate with deportees as a way of
bypassing direct negotiations with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, but Likud officials see no difference.
   Israel officially refuses to negotiate with the PLO, calling it a
terrorist organization bent on Israel's destruction.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav, of the right-wing Likud, told
the daily Yediot Ahronot that anyone seeking ``to accept the 10
points wants to break up the national unity government,'' which was
formed in lengthy negotiations following November 1988 elections.
   Shamir wants to resolve the deadlock prior to Arens' and Peres'
visits to the United States next week. Peres is scheduled to meet
with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III during
his 10-day stay, and Arens plans to see Baker.

   Fans of mambo king Damaso Perez Prado on
Friday mourned the death of the musician who, in the words of author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ``launched a coup d'etat against all known
rhythms.''
   Perez Prado, born in Matanzas, Cuba, died Thursday at his home in
a Mexico City suburb after a long illness. The 72-year-old musician
suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in July.
   He was remembered Friday for popularizing the Caribbean music
known as mambo in the 1940s and 1950s with his musical performances
and film appearances.
   Musicologists consider him a founder of the mambo and its
syncopated beat. The mambo dance, which features lots of hip motion,
is similar to the cha-cha.
   But fans know him simply as the ``king of mambo'' and ``seal
face,'' a name he earned for the trademark barking sound he made
during his songs.
   In his front-page essay in the Mexico City daily La Jornada,
Garcia Marquez, a Colombian winner of the Nobel literature prize,
said, ``Maestro Perez Prado leaped out of anonymity overnight.''
   He said Perez Prado had ``discovered how to string together all
the sounds of urban life with a saxophone.''
   A homage to Perez Prado has been running at the Teatro Blanquita
in Mexico City for the last week, starring people he worked with.
Among them have been singer Maria Victoria and dancer Yolanda
Montes, known as ``Tongolele.''
   ``This homage is for him, in the most sorrowful moment, but he
should feel happy because the whole world loved him. We will keep
listening and dancing to his music,'' Tongolele said after his death
was announced Thursday night.
   Perez Prado studied classical music as a youth. However, he moved
to Mexico after World War II and achieved world fame with the
mambo's sexy sound.
   By 1947, he was already well-known in Mexico, where he joined an
orchestra called the ``Beach Casino.''
   He eventually acted in dozens of movies. The Italian film
director Federico Fellini helped make him famous in Europe when he
included the mambo ``Patricia'' in the celebrated film, ``La Dolce
Vita.''
   Perez Prado recorded hundreds of records, including such songs as
``How Fine Is the Mambo,'' ``Mambo No. 8,'' ``Lupita,'' ``Pink
Cherry,'' ``The Black Horse,'' ``The Popoff Girl'' and ``Maria
Christina.''
   After World War II, the mambo craze swept New York, Chicago, and
other American cities.
   However, when the fever finally cooled, Perez Prado tried to
change his style. His ardent fans, though, pressured him to keep
churning out the same kind of music that made his famous.

   Showers and thunderstorms reached across the Midwest and parts of
the South on Friday, and forecasters predicted the first rain in
months for Los Angeles on Saturday.
   Showers were reported in West Virginia, Kentucky, southern
Indiana and Illionois, eastern and southern Kentucky, western North
Carolina and from southeast Louisiana across the Florida panhandle.
   Nashville had .67 inches of rain during a six-hour period ending
at 2 p.m. EDT.
   A rain advisory was posted Saturday over the central San Joaquin
Valley in California. Forecasters said there was a good chance for
light rain Saturday over Los Angeles _ which would be its first rain
since May.
   Northern Nevada also had a good chance for rain during the
weekend, with snow possible in the eastern Sierra Nevada by Monday.
   The nation's low temperature Friday was 21 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 101 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz.
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern New England and much of New York state, across Georgia and
northern Florida, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys; scattered rain
from the lower two-thirds of the California coast into Nevada;
warmer weather over the mid-Mississippi Valley and central Plains
but cooler over much of the Pacific states.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s from New
England across Maryland, from the Great Lakes through the Tennessee
Valley over the middle Mississippi Valley, southern Rockies, Pacific
Northwest, along the California coast; near 90 degrees over the
Florida peninsula; in the 90s in the desert Southwest; and in the
80s over the remainder of the nation.

   Larry Brauer is severely retarded and a captive of
physical problems that require 24-hour attention. His parents can't
care for him and now the state says it has no money to look after
him once he turns 22 next month.
   So Larry Brauer was set to go to court on Monday in a bid to save
his life.
   ``His life is in jeopardy. There's no question about it because
(state officials) haven't fulfilled what they have committed
themselves to,'' Larry's father, Dr. Mark Brauer, said Friday.
   ``I don't know why this is happening to my son, who has done
nothing to anybody, whose life is hard to imagine,'' said Brauer, a
hematologist at Boston City Hospital. ``I'm not asking for charity.
... I'm a pretty resourceful guy. I'm usually able to solve my own
problems. But I've really hit the wall here.''
   Mark and Helle Brauer, a physical therapist, have joined nine
other couples in suing Gov. Michael Dukakis for impounding the money
that would continue care for their retarded and disabled sons and
daughters.
   The young people receive care at the private Crystal Springs
School in Assonet, at an annual cost of about $80,000 a person. But
funding for such care ends when they all turn 22 this year.
   The lawsuit contends that by impounding the money already
approved by legislators, Dukakis violated the constitutional
separation of powers, and that retarded citizens such as Larry
Brauer have a constitutional right to treatment and safety.
   Every year about 450 mentally retarded Massachusetts residents
turn 22, the age at which they leave the protection and training of
the state education system. The most severely retarded and disabled,
about 70 this year, usually get placed in a home in a residential
community with 24-hour supervision and medical care.
   But this year there is no money to pay for such care.
   The deep budget cuts Dukakis made in July eliminated $3.3 million
needed to give those 70 people the care they need to survive, said
Maureen Sullivan, spokeswoman for the state Department of Mental
Retardation.
   ``Going home to their families is going to be a real disaster,''
Ms. Sullivan said. ``It's a lousy situation.''
   The state is trying to help, Ms. Sullivan said. Parents are being
advised about support services. Some could go to state schools for
the retarded, reversing a move to empty institutions once decried as
warehouses. Pediatric nursing homes that might consider taking
adults are also being contacted, she said.
   ``The choice we have to make is (for) someone who is literally
homeless,'' she said.
   Larry Brauer has been at Crystal Springs since he was 11. He
functions at the level of a 16-month old, is paralyzed on the left
side and suffers from grand mal seizures so intense that they can
stop his breathing and require him to wear a helmet to avoid injury.
   He needs help going to the bathroom, dressing and eating. If his
parents took him home, one would have to quit work and they could
expect to spend some nights just listening to make sure he was still
breathing.
   ``Historically, even going back to the 19th century, this state
has always provided for these types of clients,'' said Roderick
MacLeish, the attorney for the Brauers and the other parents.
   ``The parents can't safely handle these kids. And the schools
can't continue to care for these kids free of charge. We face the
very real prospect of people who are seriously mentally retarded,
living in shelters for the homeless. The state has never abandoned
people like this,'' MacLeish said.
   The matter is far from over.
   Since the lawsuit was filed, some families have been told their
children could receive state benefits until new, federally funded
cottages are built to accommodate them at Crystal Springs, Mark
Brauer said.

<HEAD>British, Irish Say Forces' Integrity `Critically Important'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish and British officials agreed at a
7{-hour meeting Friday that integrity was ``critically important''
among Northern Ireland security forces, tainted by charges of murder
and collusion with terrorists.
   Foreign Minister Gerry Collins, in his first meeting with
Britain's new Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Brooke, stressed
Ireland's unhappiness with reports that confidential police
documents fell into the hands of Protestant gunmen.
   The officials met specifically to discuss questions about the
reliability of the security forces., the first time since the
signing of the Anglo-Irish accord in 1985 that security was the only
topic on the agenda.
   The pact gave the Irish Republic a say in the affairs of the
Protestant-dominated British province and set up a structure for
such meetings as Friday's.
   Brooke said later, ``The Irish put to us their concerns and it
was decided all the points raised should be looked at again. In any
discussions there are bound to be differences, but ... I think we
made considerable progress.''
   Collins called it ``a serious meeting.''
   ``The important thing is to establish confidence in the security
forces as a whole among the nationalist community in Northern
Ireland,'' he said.
   The two sides agreed to meet again shortly, a joint statement
said.
   It said both sides ``emphasized their belief that confidence in
the evenhandedness and integrity of the security forces was
critically important.''
   Also on the agenda were the role of the British army's locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment and the use of plastic bullets.
   Irish authorities have said that intelligence developed by the
Garda Siochana, Ireland's police force, may not be safe in the hands
of the security forces in Northern Ireland.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police force in Northern
Ireland, disclosed Thursday that a list and photographs of 12
suspected members of the Irish Republican Army were stolen from a
Belfast police station.
   Confidential information earlier disappeared from the Ballykinlar
army base in County Down.
   An English detective was assigned to investigate the two cases.
   On Monday, two members of the Ulster Defense Regiment were
charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic man.
   Men who had identified themselves as members of the outlawed
Ulster Freedom Fighters had shown a TV reporter documents,
apparently stolen or leaked from security forces, which identified
the murder victim as a suspected IRA member.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many U.S. police forces have resorted to
painful holds, and sometimes brutality, when arresting non-violent
demonstrators, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was told Friday.
   Most of the complaints related to police actions at ``Operation
Rescue'' demonstrations by pro-life activists at abortion clinics.
But others suggested a resurgence in some cities of police brutality
against blacks.
   The commission staff cited recurring cases of alleged police
misconduct in recent demonstrations in 17 cities, including Atlanta,
Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and Pittsburgh.
   Virtually none of the complaints asserted wrongful arrest.
Rather, they revolved around whether police had used unnecessary
force in removing non-violent protesters, some of whom invited
arrest as a symbolic gesture.
   The purported victims were not publicly identified.
   The ``pain-compliance'' controversy involves a variety of holds
that many officers reserve for someone actively resisting arrest.
   The holds include ``locks'' and ``twists'' of elbows, wrists, or
fingers; the twisting of ears or squeezing of mastoid pressure
points (behind the ears); or the insertion of fingers into someone's
nostrils to pull him off the ground.
   The commission viewed videotapes showing such techniques being
used against demonstrators who had gone limp as police tried to move
them to vans or buses after their arrest.
   In the severest case, Los Angeles police used nunchukus, an
oriental martial-arts weapon _ sort of a hinged billy club _ against
Operation Rescue demonstrators. One man's arm was broken; the snap
of his bone could be heard on the tape.
   ``A fundamental issue is whether pain-compliance techniques,
particularly the use of nunchukus, can ever be justified in the
context of arresting non-resisting, passive demonstrators,'' said
Jeffrey P. O'Connell, the commission's assistant general counsel.
   Robert R. McCue, chief of the 125-officer West Hartford, Conn.,
police force, insisted some pain-compliance methods _ he called them
``come-along'' holds _ are appropriate when handling arrestees who
decline to move under their own power.
   McCue said his officers had used such holds when removing
Operation Rescue demonstrators from an abortion clinic April 1, when
61 people were arrested, and June 17, when 261 were charged.
   A demonstrator who goes limp is effectively resisting arrest,
McCue said.
   ``We explain to the arrestee that we intend to use a come-along
hold that will cause pressure and probable pain if there is
resistance,'' he said. ``If he still refuses, a come-along hold is
used, using only as much pressure as required to accomplish the
task.''
   McCue also offered no apology in response to complaints that his
officers had removed their name tags, making it difficult for the
demonstrators to bring a misconduct charge against them.
   ``It is the policy of our department that all officers who will
be required to physically move arrestees will remove their badges,
name tags, and any other items ... to lessen the possibility of
these items causing injury to those arrested,'' he said. ``It's just
common sense to remove anything with a sharp edge.''
   Melvin C. High, assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan
Police, said his officers are instructed never to use
pain-compliance holds against non-violent demonstrators and always
to wear name tags.
   The commission, headed by William B. Allen, also viewed
videotapes of helmeted police charging groups of black college
students in Virginia Beach, Va., over the Labor Day weekend after
some instances of looting by the holiday crowd.
   It also heard from Don Jackson, a former police sergeant who,
while engaged in a ``sting'' operation against alleged racism within
the Long Beach, Calif., police department, was filmed by an NBC crew
as two local officers pushed his head through a plate glass window.
   ``These incidents are frequent,'' said Jackson, who is black.
``The evidence of police misconduct is overwhelming; the response to
it limited.''
   Lawrence Sherman, a University of Maryland criminology professor
and president of the Crime Control Institute, suggested police
misconduct may be on the rise as a consequence of political
pressures to hire more officers to handle the wave of drug crimes.
   ``Almost all these cases involve young officers, under the age of
25,'' he said.
   The commission, which has no authority to discipline departments
or officers, is chartered to review the performance of other federal
agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws and to
recommend new laws to Congress.

<HEAD>Sammy Davis Jr. Kicks Cigarettes, Diagnosed With Throat Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. said he recently
kicked his 49-year cigarette habit and is optimistic about the
outcome of radiation therapy for throat cancer.
   ``The prognosis is wonderful. It's just radiation, not cutting,
so the voice box won't come out. Thank God it's localized in one
area,'' Davis said Thursday night from Lake Tahoe.
   The cancer is the latest in a series of health problems for the
63-year-old singer, dancer and actor. Davis lost his left eye in a
1954 car accident and underwent reconstructive hip surgery in 1985.
   Davis said he has been a heavy smoker since he was 14. He gave up
cigarettes 10 days ago.
   ``I'm going cold turkey,'' Davis said. When the urge strikes, ``I
put something else in my mouth. Candy, Life Savers, anything.''
   A throat abnormality was detected recently during Davis' annual
medical examination and was diagnosed as cancer by Dr. Joseph
Sugerman, Davis spokesman Arnold Lipsman said Thursday in a
statement. Lipsman's office said Friday that no further details on
Davis' condition will be released.
   Sugerman expects Davis to recover completely from the cancer,
Lipsman said.
   Davis has been on tour for more than a year with Frank Sinatra
and Liza Minnelli. He is expected to complete an engagement Sunday
at Harrah's Tahoe hotel and casino, but he will not appear with
Sinatra and Miss Minnelli at concerts scheduled for October in
Toronto, the Washington, D.C., area and Charlotte, N.C.
   ``Liza and Frank will continue the tour, except for one
concert,'' said Susan Reynolds, a Los Angeles publicist for the
``Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy'' tour. An Oct. 3 benefit concert in Boston
was canceled.
   Sinatra and Miss Minnelli were unavailable for comment, Ms.
Reynolds said. But she added ``their hearts are with Sammy. They
speak frequently together by telephone.''
   Davis was born to vaudevillians Elvera and Sammy Davis in 1925.
He appeared on stage as a youngster and braved bigotry for decades
as he toured the country. Davis' hit songs include ``I've Gotta Be
Me'' in 1969 and ``The Candy Man'' in 1972.

<HEAD>Afghan Troops Welcome Trucks with Garlands, Slaughtered Sheep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>

   Children clapped, the governor was
showered with cloth garlands and a sheep was slaughtered in the
middle of the road Friday as the military welcomed about 200
vehicles from a supply convoy that began rolling last month.
   The anti-Marxist rebels welcomed the convoy in their own way. Two
rockets slammed down about 250 feet from where the provincial
governor, Gen. Noor al-Haq Ulumi, was talking to reporters as trucks
and tanks rumbled past.
   No injuries were reported.
   Ulumi said almost 1,000 trucks had snaked their way across almost
780 miles of the barren south before arriving in this southeastern
provincial capital this week.
   In Pakistan, sources from the mujahedeen _ or Islamic holy
warriors, the Afghan rebels based in Pakistan _ and diplomatic
sources said the rebels knocked out 80 vehicles and slowed the
convoy's forward progress to a snail's pace. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Ulumi said the convoy lost three trucks in a collision and one
tank to a land mine. He said it had not suffered any mujahedeen
attacks after leaving Grishik, 60 miles west of Kandahar.
   Earlier, government officials said rebel forces attacked the
convoy at least three times and rebel rocket attacks forced it to
halt between Grishik and Kandahar.
   Initial government reports also said 1,300 vehicles were in the
convoy.
   The rockets Friday scattered the welcoming crowd that had been
throwing cloth flowers threaded onto metal rings.
   The throat of the lone sacrificial sheep was cut with a dull
knife in front of the lead vehicle, and tires left gory imprints on
the road.
   The trucks rumbling through the outskirts of Kandahar Friday were
the second batch to reach the city. Ulumi said with more expected
each day.
   He said the convoy was carrying ammunition and food and included
500 military trucks, 300 civilian trucks and a brigade of armored
vehicles. He would not say how many.
   There were no civilian trucks and no food in the carefully
orchestrated welcoming ceremony. The military trucks were flanked by
32 tanks.
   Most were stacked with ammunition boxes and caked with dirt. Some
were empty with spanking clean cabs. Ulumi said they were unloaded
earlier at a nearby garrison.
   Many trucks seemed new. Government officials have said the Soviet
Union recently delivered more than 1,000 trucks to Afghanistan.
   Ulumi said the ammunition should last troops in the area a year,
depending on the extent of fighting.
   ``If there is no war, the supplies will last 10 years, if there
is a war, one year,'' he said.
   It is the first such convoy since February, when Soviet troops
withdrew from Afghanistan nine years after intervening to prop up
the Marxist government. The U.S.-backed mujahedeen are still
fighting the Kabul government.
   The mujahedeen have not captured a major city despite repeated
attempts. The convoy was seen as a warning to the mujahedeen that
their acknowledged primacy in rural areas could be weakened.
   Officials in Kabul were always upbeat about the trucks' progress,
but repeated claims that the convoy was on the outskirts of Kandahar
were constantly revised.
   Ulumi would not say when the trucks had pulled out of Torghundi,
on the northern border with the Soviet Union. Government sources in
Kabul have said the departure date was Aug. 18. Kandahar lies 350
miles to the northwest of Torghundi.
   Ulumi claimed progress toward Kandahar was slow because the
trucks were used to supply a new set of border posts near Pakistan.
Speaking through an interpreter, he said the posts should make it
harder for the mujahedeen to use clansdestine routes through the
Registan Desert to get into Afghanistan.
   Supplies muust be brought into Afghanistan during the summer
because winter rain and snow make the roads impassable.
   Guerrillas have tried since October 1987 to capture Kandahar and
heavy fighting has left much of the city in ruins. Ulumi said two
weeks ago that 70 percent of the buildings in the city were
completely destroyed.
   Kandahar is 70 miles from Pakistan and about 270 miles south of
Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   It was Afghanistan's second largest city with about 300,000
people before the civil war began nearly 11 years ago. Govertment
officials said the population fell to about 25,000 when bombardment
was at its heaviest, but later talked of 200,000 now living in
Kandahar.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker got hundreds of
thousands of dollars in bonuses even while hundreds of workers were
being laid off from his television ministry before the Christmas
holidays, witnesses testified Friday.
   ``I called my children together and said, `I'm sorry to tell you
this, but we won't have Christmas until after because the check
won't be here,''' Joanie Ames, a former PTL payroll clerk and single
mother of two, testified in Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial.
   She was laid off in November 1985 with 285 other PTL employees,
saving the ministry $3.6 million, said Chris Easley, PTL's personnel
director for 1{ years.
   The prosecution has said that Bakker received a $200,000 bonus on
Nov. 12, 1985, and Tammy got a $100,000 bonus. Less than a year
later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a $500,000 bonus for
Bakker.
   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer of Oakland, Calif., who joined the board
of PTL in November 1985, testified that the largest bonus she
remembered approving was $150,000 plus taxes.
   But when asked by prosecutor Deborah Smith if she would have
approved a $500,000 bonus for Bakker, Ms. Spencer said: ``If
everybody else agreed with it, I would have.''
   She said she trusted Bakker to inform board members of the
ministry's financial condition. ``I just trusted him, period,'' she
said.
   She said she was never informed about the extent of an Internal
Revenue Service investigation and church secretary Jessica Hahn's
threat of a civil lawsuit over her sexual encounter with Bakker.
   She said she learned of the lawsuit threat in March 1987 when
Bakker resigned from the ministry over the scandal.
   Prosecutors accuse Bakker of diverting millions of dollars in PTL
money to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24 counts
against him, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and
fined more than $5 million.
   In later testimony Friday, a Los Angeles lawyer said PTL
officials were eager to reach a settlement with Ms. Hahn and wanted
to keep the matter quiet.
   Scott Furstman, who said he was contacted by Richard Dortch,
PTL's executive vice president, testified that Ms. Hahn's complaint
sought $12 million.
   Furstman said he saw many problems with the complaint, but ``Rev.
Dortch indicated he still had a strong desire to settle. Dortch was
very concerned that the matter did not become public.''
   A deal finally struck between Dortch and Ms. Hahn included a
$115,000 payment to Ms. Hahn, with $150,000 in a trust account for
her. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited in a
money market account.
   The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in
PTL's bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988.
   Former PTL board member Aimee Cortese testified that Bakker never
told the board about the $265,000 paid to Ms. Hahn in exchange for
her silence.
   Mrs. Cortese, a minister at the Crossroads Tabernacle Church in
New York City, recalled being asked by Dortch to assist him in
paying Ms. Hahn a total of $14,000 in 1984.
   Mrs. Cortese testified that Dortch called her into his office and
spelled out the details of Bakker's sexual liaison. She said she
later handed over $2,000 to Ms. Hahn on one occasion and $12,000 on
a later date.
   She recalled a comment Bakker made to her regarding Hahn. ``He
said she wasn't what she said she was as far as being a virgin,''
Mrs. Cortese said, recalling Bakker's words. ``He said she was a
woman of the world.''
   Mrs. Cortese said she never would have voted for the bonuses had
she known about PTL's financial condition. ``It didn't make sense,''
she said. ``How could you give away bonuses while you were floating
(checks)?''
   Former PTL controller Dana Caldwell testified that PTL had a poor
debt-to-asset ratio during Bakker's tenure, at one time at 1-to-3.
PTL was nearly $37 million in debt when Bakker resigned in March
1987, with assets of about $9 million.

   Mayor Marion Barry insisted to his cabinet on
Friday that he will never be indicted in the federal investigation
of convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis, according three top District
of Columbia officials.
   Barry opened and closed the monthly cabinet session by telling
his aides that they should go ahead with the work of the city
without worrying about whether his legal difficulties will worsen,
the officials said.
   ``It was a call to arms,'' said one official. ``He lashed out at
the media, said the white power structure is out to get him, and he
vowed not to be beaten down by these forces.''
   Barry has said he will seek a fourth, four-year term next year.
   Another top city official who attended the hour-long session said
Barry stressed that he would not be indicted in a probe of his ties
to convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis.
   Barry ``assured us that he was in no legal trouble, that this
would all blow over,'' the second official said. ``He also mentioned
several biblical passages, and said he was counting on God to see
him through this.''
   Two officials said the meeting was dominated by Barry's comments
on his legal difficulties, despite the fact that other issues like
drugs, crime and public education were discussed.
   ``The mayor set the tone,'' a third official said. ``He
concentrated on this in his opening remarks, and then he closed by
trying to let us know that everything was alright and that we should
go ahead with our jobs.''
   All of the officials asked not to be identified.
   ``Cabinet meetings are for the benefit of the mayor and his
aides,'' said Maudine Cooper, Barry's chief of staff. ``They are not
for the public, and it is disloyal and inappropriate for anyone to
talk about those meetings.''
   She refused to comment on Barry's remarks.
   Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said Friday the mayor ``wants to
go on record as saying he never said that. He never used the words
black and white in that context.'' Rackley said she was at the
meeting.
   Rackley said Barry had no comment on other events at the meeting.
   The cabinet meeting came just one day after a legal secretary
from the Virgin Islands, Dixie Lee Hedrington, testified before a
federal grand jury investigating Barry's ties to Lewis, a former
city employee who faces drug charges in the nation's capital and is
awaiting sentencing in the Virgin Islands.
   The Washington Post has reported Hedrington told authorities she
saw cocaine in Barry's Virgin Islands hotel room when the mayor
visited there in March 1988.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pledged Friday
that the nation ``hasn't and won't forget'' those military still
listed as missing and unaccounted for.
   ``This government will continue its effort to ensure that we
achieve the fullest possible accounting,'' Cheney said at a Pentagon
ceremony marking National POW-MIA day.
   ``We're here today, because of families that have suffered, and
continue to suffer, not knowing the fate of their loved ones,''
Cheney said, adding, ``Your government hasn't and won't forget.''
   Cheney added, ``that also includes Col. Richard Higgins,'' the
Marine Corp officer who was kidnapped and apparently killed by his
Shiite Moslem captors in Lebanon.
   Higgins was serving as part of a United Nations peacekeeping
force, and U.N. efforts to recover his body have not met with
success.
   Cheney noted that from World War I through Vietnam, more than
92,000 Americans were lost in combat and their bodies were not
recovered.

   Five men arrested with
Venezuelan papers and an arsenal of weapons have been linked to
Colombian suspects in a drug-trafficking case, authorities in this
Canadian province said Friday.
   A U.S. official said two of those arrested are known to be
Colombian.
   The arrests Wednesday launched a flurry of speculation that the
suspects came to this eastern province to interfere with a hearing
Thursday for two Colombians suspected of cocaine trafficking.
   Canadian Mounted police confirmed that connection Friday. Asked
if there was a link between the two cases, Inspector Al Hutchinson
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Fredericton said, ``That's
correct.''
   ``We've re-evaluated the situation between the two groups,'' he
said without elaborating.
   However, Hutchinson said the connection between the cases has
prompted police to move the men facing drug charges from Fredericton
city jail to a more secure prison within the province. He would not
say which prison.
   Canadian police said they had ruled out suggestions that the
suspects are hitmen sent by drug traffickers in Colombia to kill
officials from Canada or the United States.
   ``There's no threat to any U.S. or Canadian government
official,'' Hutchinson said in a brief statement.
   Canadian authorities also rejected speculation that the suspects
had intended to cross the border to mount an attack at President
Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me.
   In Washington late Friday, Secret Service spokeswoman Jane
Vezeris said, ``We are monitoring the situation there, but we do not
beleive it has anything to do with threats to individuals in this
country. We believe it is a Canadian matter.''
   The United States and Colombia are in the midst of a crackdown on
Colombian drug traffickers, who provide most of the cocaine sold in
the States. Canadian and American officials say Colombian drug
cartels have been routing more drugs through the Maritime provinces
because the United States has tightened its borders.
   On Friday, police led four of the suspects arrested Wednesday
into a heavily guarded provincial court in Edmundston, where they
were charged with a variety of weapons offenses. The fifth man
linked to the case was charged in Saint John.
   Local police said they are also seeking up to three others as
suspects in the case.
   ``Innocent, innocent. Je suis innocent,'' one of the four
handcuffed suspects told reporters outside the Edmundston courthouse
Friday. ``No speak English,'' said another.
   Authorities have identified the four as Tito Sanchez, Euovio
Manzano, Osvaldo Gonzales and Wilmer Ramon Zanabria. Court documents
did not state their ages or hometowns.
   All four were being kept in custody for bail hearings set for
Tuesday.
   The hearing for the two Colombians accused of drug-trafficking
was held Thursday in the provincial capital of Fredericton, 125
miles southeast of Edmundston.
   When Mounted Police and Edmundston authorities arrested the four,
a search of their vehicles uncovered an Uzi submachine gun, Soviet
and Israeli assault rifles and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Also
seized were six automatic pistols, a .22-caliber pistol, tear gas, a
deactivated Japanese grenade and an electric zap gun used to knock
people out.
   However, no drugs were found.
   Police said they also found five Venezuelan passports, and that a
fifth man was arrested in another provincial city Thursday.
   The man, identified as 33-year-old William Jose Rodriguez of
Caracas, was charged Friday in Saint John with possessing two
.22-caliber handguns. Authorities said he was expected to be charged
later with an immigration offense.
   Rodriguez was to remain in custody for a bail hearing Monday.
   Bill d'Amours of the Canandian Immigration Department said the
Venezuelan passports were sent to the Mounted Police forensic lab in
Ottawa to check their validity.
   In Washington, Frank Shults of the Drug Enforcement
Administration said Friday that two of the suspects are ``known to
be Colombians.''
   The agency sent several agents to Canada on Friday to discuss the
case with Canadian authorities, Shults said.
   Canadian authorities said it was not known how or when the
suspects entered Canada. However, Edmundston police said two of the
men arrested in their city had passports stamped in Montreal,
indicating they entered Canada there.
   Two of their vehicles had New York licenses, including one stolen
plate, police said. The vehicle carrying most of the weapons had
been rented in Fredericton, and police said Rodriguez was arrested
while trying to extend the rental agreement.
   The four men were also carrying maps of New Brunswick and
neighboring Maine. Police said several locations were highlighted on
the maps but refused to say what they were.
   The suspected cocaine traffickers, Jose Ali Galindo-Escobar and
Fernando Augusto Mendoza-Jaramillo, both 36, were arrested in April
after police made Canada's largest cocaine seizure.
   They found about 1,100 pounds of the drug inside the nose of an
airplane at a makeshift airstrip outside Fredericton.
   At Thursday's hearing, the two were ordered held for trial next
month on charges of importing cocaine. Authorities used dozens of
rifle-toting officers for heavy security at the hearing because of
worries prompted by the arrests.

   The Salvadoran government and leftist rebels
agreed Friday to meet monthly to try to negotiate an end to their
10-year-old civil war that has claimed 70,000 lives.
   Crowds marched through the streets of San Salvador cheering the
Mexico City agreements, and right-wing President Alfredo Cristiani
said he was encouraged.
   Leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
said their hope was for peace in 1990.
   The rebels and the government agreed to meet next in San Jose,
the Costa Rican capital, on Oct. 16-17 and at 30-day intervals
thereafter.
   They agreed that two representatives from the Roman Catholic
Church will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the
United Nations and the Organization of American States to send
observers.
   The Cristiani government initially opposed church mediation or
outside observers. It had also proposed meeting the Front _ known by
its Spanish initials FMLN _ every two months instead of at 30-day
intervals.
   The pact, reached after two days of intensive talks, also
stipulates that neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the
negotiations and that each delegation will have authority to reach
binding accords.
   ``The FMLN hopes there will be a Christmas and New Year in peace
in our country and that 1990 will be the year of the war's final
end,'' rebel leader Shafick Handal said at a joint news conference
after the accord was signed.
   ``The blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly
conflict on the continent, all this blood that has been spilled,
deserves this.''
   Cristiani called the agreement ``important'' but cautioned,
``while welcoming the dialogue process, we don't want to create
false expectations.''
   ``We want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and
flexibility within our constitutional framework ... We know the road
ahead is difficult and complex,'' he told an Independence Day rally
in the Salvadoran capital.
   The Mexico City accord was announced on Central American
Independence Day _ the 168th anniversary of the independence of El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Guatemala from Spain
in 1821.
   ``We will possibly confront obstacles. But we trust in God and in
the good will of the two sides, and we will overcome the
difficulties,'' Cristiani said.
   Handal and fellow guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos said the
FMLN proposed the talks because of pressure inside and outside their
country for peace.
   They also said they feared the rightist government would become a
``facist dictatorship'' unless checked by the kind of democracy
peace could bring.
   Most of the war's victims have been civilians. Human rights
groups and international organizations say many were killed by
right-wing death squads linked to the military and Cristiani's party
_ links the party denies.
   The Mexico City talks were the first in two years between
government and rebels; they were also the first meeting between the
rebels and Cristiani's administration.
   The rebels have already laid out their peace proposal. The
government is to present its proposal in October.
   The FMLN offered to transform itself from a rebel army into a
legal political party in exchange for sweeping social and political
reforms.
   The reforms would erode the power of the military and of
Cristiani's party, which now holds controls the National Assembly
and the Supreme Court.
   The rebels demand that the military be purged of human rights
violators and reduced in size; that the date of the 1991 legislative
and municipal elections be advanced; and that a new high court be
appointed.
   In return, the rebels say they will become a legitimate political
party and run candidates in elections _ something they have refused
to do.
   They dropped demands for power-sharing and for merging the rebel
and government armies and couched their plan in language far milder
than any previous proposal.
   The proposal asks the United States to end military aid to El
Salvador and channel the money instead into El Salvador's economic
development.
   To prevent a rebel victory, the United States has given about
$3.5 billion in military and economic aid to El Salvador this decade
_ making it Latin America's biggest single recipient of American
assistance.

   Former President Raul Alfonsin of
Argentina arrived Friday at the invitation of the leftist Sandinista
government to help supervise general elections set for February.
   Alfonsin will head an observers' commission along with former
U.S. President Carter, who is expected to arrive Saturday.
   ``I have come to defend democracy,'' Alfonsin told reporters when
asked about his mission.
   Nicaraguan general elections set for Feb. 25 promise to be
closely watched.
   The United Nations and the Organization of American States have
set up observer commissions to watch the elections under regional
accords to bring peace to Central America.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa, is the presidential candidate for the National
Opposition Union, a 14-party coalition.
   President Daniel Ortega most likely will seek re-election, but
the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front has said it won't
announce its official ticket until Sept. 25.
   U.S. Secret Service agents assigned to Carter arrived in Managua
this week and ``have been scouting the security situation,'' said a
high-level diplomatic source at the U.S. Embassy.

   A car struck a group of children on their way home
from school Friday, injuring nine people, five of them critically,
and leaving schoolbooks and notebook papers scattered in the street,
police said.
   Witnesses said the children were struck as they stood on the
median of a road. They said a car ran a stop sign, striking a
station wagon that slammed into the children.
   Five children were taken to Children's Hospital, where three were
listed in critical condition, including one who was reportedly
comatose. One child was listed in serious condition and one in fair
condition.
   ``I'm hoping I can get to sleep tonight. I've never seen anything
this bad,'' said Adell Jackson, 30, who was on her way to pick up
her son from a nearby school when she witnessed the accident in the
Dorchester section.
   The children were on a median strip when the car struck them, she
said.
   ``That's when the kids went up in the air,'' Ms. Jackson said.
   Two other children were taken to Boston City Hospital, where both
were listed in critical condition, hospital spokesman Louis Daddario
said.
   Officials said two adults, one bystander and one riding in a
vehicle, were also injured and taken to Brigham and Women's
Hospital. Hospital officials refused to release their condition.
Richard Serino, an emergency medical services deputy, said both were
in stable condition when they were taken to the hospital.
   The driver of the car that went through the stop sign was cited
for driving to endanger, driving without registration and failing to
stop, police spokesman Scott Gillis said.
   The children ranged in age from 7 to 11, said Kristi Kienholz, a
spokeswoman at Children's Hospital.
   Books notebook papers were scattered in the median strip shortly
after the accident. Police blocked off the area as neighbors
gathered. They said they have long believed the crossing is
dangerous.
   ``This is a bad intersection,'' Ms. Jackson said.

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp some time ago asked top agency officials for suggestions for
improvements, and two he got back called for the department to
change its name and stage a fire sale of foreclosed properties.
   The proposed new name: The Home Department.
   Several other officials in recent days have objected to selling
off homes at distress prices because of its possible depression of
local real estate markets. Others have indicated a name change is
improbable.
   The two suggestions came from C. Austin Fitts, assistant
secretary for housing, in response to Kemp's request `just about
anything that came to mind,'' in the words of one official.
   Ms. Fitts' suggestion called for HUD to reduce the price of its
houses 1 percent per day until they were sold. For example, a
$50,000 house would cost $49,500 the second day, $49,000 the third
day and so on.
   Kemp is expected to make decisions around the end of the month.

   It was only a bird call at evening, unidentified,

   Years pass, all places and faces fade, some people have died,
   And I stand in a far land, the evening still, and am at last sure

   A printing plant worker disabled by mental
illness was able to legally buy the AK-47 assault rifle he used to
kill seven former co-workers without revealing his mental problems,
authorities said Friday.
   Police said Joseph T. Wesbecker was armed with several
semiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition Thursday
morning as he went from floor to floor at the Standard Gravure Corp.
   Wesbecker killed seven people and injured 13 before killing
himself. Three of the injured were in critical condition Friday.
   Standard Gravure employees met with grief counselors when they
returned to the plant Friday morning and several hundred later
attended a Mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Assumption.
   President Bush on Friday lamented the loss of life in the
rampage, but said he still opposes legislation to ban possession of
such weapons.
   Bush in March banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles
into the United States, including the Chinese-made AK-47. Howeer,
possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and Bush has taken
no steps toward proposing curbs on U.S. manufacture of such weapons.
   Wesbecker bought the AK-47 on May 1 at Tilford's Gun Sales in
Louisville, said Police Chief Richard Dotson.
   Gun shop owner Jack Tilford said Wesbecker answered all eight
questions properly on a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms gun purchase form.
   ``He passed all the tests and obligations for purchasing
firearms,'' Tilford said Friday.
   One of the eight questions asked: ``Have you ever been
adjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to a
mental institution?''
   The form shows Wesbecker answered `no' to that question. Tilford
noted that gun shop owners have no way to check the validity of
answers to that question.
   Lt. Jeff Moody, police homicide commander, has said that
Wesbecker had spent time _ voluntarily _ in mental institutions,
including Our Lady of Peace in Louisville. Police would not reveal
when he had been hospitalized.
   Wesbecker, 47, was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until the
company placed him on permanent disability leave last Feb. 2 because
of mental illness, police said.
   Relatives told police that Wesbecker was a manic depressive who
had attempted suicide three times.
   Bill Curley, agent in charge of the Louisville ATF office, said
federal law prohibits firearms purchases only by people who have
been committed to a mental health facility under court order.
   Moody said four other guns were found during a search of
Wesbecker's home, as well as the Feb. 6 issue of Time magazine
turned open to a detailed article on similar shootings across the
United States in the past two years.
   Bush, during a interview with out-of-town reporters, was asked
about Thursday's rampage.
   ``It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But I
have seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is going
to guard against it ...,'' he said. ``If you have somebody who is
deranged, and I don't want to prejudice this poor soul, but if he
was deranged, I'm afraid you're going to have incidents like this.''
   Standard Gravure officials hired 15 counselors to help workers
when they returned to the plant Friday morning.
   ``All of these people can be classified as victims,'' said Mark
Ahearn, vice president of development for Seven Counties Services.
``We don't need people holding back their pain. Swallowing it won't
do them any good.''
   Standard Gravure President Michael Shea said almost 90 percent of
the company's 360 employees were counseled in offices that had been
cleaned up overnight. Bullet holes in walls and ceilings were the
only physical reminders of the tragedy.
   ``Until it strikes home like it has for us, you don't realize how
traumatic something like this can be,'' Shea said. ``I'm pleased to
say that, so far, the counseling has gone very well.''
   Pressman Tom Noonan said the workers were split up into groups,
with some receiving one-on-one counseling.
   ``You just vented your feelings,'' Noonan said.
   Outside the three-story building, some workers talked to
reporters.
   ``I'm thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for another
job. My nerves are shot,'' said pressman Steve Pate. ``If I go back
in there, I'll be waiting for someone else to do the same thing and
I can't handle that.''
   Forklift operator Bernard Williams said he was going to take a
week's vacation.
   ``I'm not ready to come back because of everything that's
happened. Things like this could happen again,'' Williams said. ``I
just don't feel like I can go in there and work.
   ``There are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this.
It's a shame that management treats people like dogs. They should
treat employees like human beings instead of just a number.''
   Shea refused to comment on complaints about working conditions
and specifics on improved security measures being implemented at the
plant. He said full production would resume Monday.
   He also would not disclose Wesbecker's weekly disability pay or
whether those payments were about to be stopped by the company, a
claim co-workers have made in trying to explain the reasons for
Wesbecker's rampage.
   Many of the workers joined several of the victims' families at an
hourlong Mass conducted by Archbishop Thomas Kelly. They hugged and
wiped away tears during the service, which was also attended by
Mayor Jerry Abramson and other local, state and federal officials.
   ``All of us gather in deep, profound sorrow. We come together to
pray for those who are suffering pain and grief,'' Kelly said during
the service attended by about 300 people.
   Three of the wounded were in critical condition Friday at Humana
Hospital-University of Louisville, including one man shot in the
chest and leg who was back in surgery Friday afternoon.
   The bloodshed started in the plant's executive offices on the
third floor, moved down to the basement, then up to the first floor.
   Wesbecker reportedly had made threats against the company, which
prints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but Shea
said he did not know of any threats.
   Wesbecker's weapons included the AK-47, two MAC-11 semiautomatic
machine pistols, a .38-caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic pistol and a
bayonet, said Dotson. Wesbecker carried a duffel bag full of
ammunition.
   The two MAC-11s were purchased in February, also at Tilford's.
   Wesbecker was divorced twice in the last 11 years. He and his
first wife had two sons, 22 and 26. Wesbecker and his second wife,
Brenda, were also divorced, but they had been living together since
1987, Moody said.

   Robert Penn Warren was remembered Friday as a son
of the South who became a citizen of the world, as a brilliant poet,
fiction writer, teacher and critic _ and as a nice man.
   ``He was reticent, ironic, reserved and perfectly charming, and I
loved and respected him quite apart from his work,'' said poet
Howard Nemerov, who owns a copy of the first edition of Warren's
first book.
   ``He had such vigor and such love of life. He was such wonderful
company _ he was the soul of hilarity,'' said novelist Eudora Welty,
whose first work was published in the Southern Review when Warren
was editor in the 1930s. ``He was a good friend to writers _
constantly generous and giving.''
   ``Red'' Warren died Friday at his summer home in Vermont after
battling cancer for three years. In a literary career that spanned
nearly 60 years, he wrote dozens of books and made hundreds of
friends.
   Many were colleagues. Cleanth Brooks developed the ``New
Criticism'' with Warren, concentrating on the text of literature,
not the authors' lives.
   ``He was one of our truly all-around men who made great
contributions in all fields. He was a great poet, fine teacher and
did something to revolutionize the modes of teaching literature,''
said Brooks.
   Others were students. Pete Axthelm, the writer and TV commentator
and a student of Warren's at Yale in the mid-60s, recalled sitting
in his office over morning coffee to discuss comic scenes by
novelist William Faulkner.
   ``I treasure the memory,'' he said. ``When people ask me what the
best thing about going to Yale was, I always say Robert Penn Warren.
   ``To listen to this man of the South talk about the great
southern writer was just an unbelievable privilege. I really did
love this man.''
   Others were officials of institutions with which he was
affiliated.
   James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress, said Warren's ``years
at the Library of Congress as consultant in poetry and more recently
as the nation's first poet laureate consultant in poetry, were
marked by extraordinary excellence of achievement. ... His legacy
promises to be with Americans for generations to come.''
   Warren was ``a wonderfully warm and generous man who is fondly
remembered by his former students and colleagues,'' said Joe B.
Wyatt, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, which Warren attended as
an undergraduate and where he joined two important literary
movements _ the Fugitives and the Agrarians.
   The Fugitives (named after a literary magazine) argued the
importance of a Southern literary identity; the Agrarians warned
against the dangers of industrialization, and it was in that
connection that Warren wrote an essay defending segregation. He came
to repudiate that stance.
   ``This was in 1930. He just felt that was then, this was now,''
said Walter Sullivan, a professor of English at Vanderbilt who had
known Warren since the late 1940s.
   ``I think he is going to be read 100 years from now. `All the
King's Men' is already a classic _ generations have read that
book,'' Sullivan said.
   His fellow writers marveled at his versatility and virtuosity.
   ``He's astounding,'' said poet Robert Bly. ``It's very seldom
that someone can write poetry and fiction and do it well. In
fiction, you take nine or ten generations and compress them; in
poetry, you take 30 seconds and expand it.''
   R.W.B. Lewis, the Yale professor who produced an anthology of
American literature with Warren and is writing a book about him,
called Warren ``the greatest person of letters in the country for
several decades.''
   ``He was extraordinarily gifted in so many different ways: As a
novelist, as a poet, as a literary critic of extraordinary
influence, as a cultural historian,'' said Lewis.
   But most were more interested in praising his character. He was,
all agreed, a great storyteller, an ardent father (his colleague
Allen Tate once complained that all Warren talked about in his
letters was his children), a voracious reader and hard worker, a man
of high standards.
   ``He wasn't one of these polite, gentle, post-World War II
encouragers of the young,'' said Bly, a younger poet. ``When he saw
something that was shoddy, he named it _ whether it was in himself
or in others.''
   He was born in Kentucky and educated in Tennessee and was known
as a Southern writer, though he lived much of his life elsewhere.
   ``His work was not confined to any place at all,'' said Miss
Welty.
   He was a Southerner ``in his manners and in his warmth and in his
accent,'' said Sullivan. But he once told me, `Well, you know, my
community is the world. My friends are all over the world, and my
friends are my community.' He was a cosmopolitan, but he had a lot
of the South in him.''

<TEXT>
   From Tarzan to Indiana Jones, racism in the
movies has created false notions and negative images of
African-Americans held by both white and black people, two veteran
black actors said Friday.
   ``The dominant culture puts out so much misinformation in a
relentless fashion that you are programmed against yourself,'' said
Bernie Casey, recalling that as a child he rooted for Tarzan to win
against the Africans.
   ``I did not want to be one of the Africans yet I am an African. I
would reject myself ... In the land of ooga-booga, I wanted no part
of it,'' Casey said.
   Casey, who has appeared in 25 movies and on television, took part
in a seminar with Madge Sinclair Madge Sinclair, late of
television's ``Trapper John.''
   In making their remarks during a seminar at the Congressional
Black Caucus weekend, the two also urged listeners to write in to
producers when they are pleased or displeased; refuse to see films
or rent videos that do not have black people in significant roles;
and form collectives to act on both ideas.
   ``I never see a Woody Allen film,'' Sinclair said about the
filmmaker who is acclaimed for filming slices of New York life yet
whose few black characters frequently are butlers and maids.
   ``I feel better when I don't subscribe to the images that deny my
very existence.''
   The two agreed that: loving black couples are rarely shown;
dashing black men are never the heros; black people are thought to
have lips that are too large thus few if any kissing scenes are ever
filmed.
   Also, Tarzan's successor, Indiana Jones, also was in films that
``speak to the evilness'' of the cultures of people of color and
those dark people's ``lack of ableness,'' Casey said.
   He added that ``what is born out of misinformation is
misperception and what is born of misperception is
misunderstanding.''
   That has lead to, among other things, black people rejecting
their culture by straigtening their hair to be more like white
people, Casey said.
   ``As long as you reject yourself, you will never feel of any
consequence,'' Casey said.
   And added Sinclair, the world only knows about black people what
is exported on film, leading to Japanese prime ministers being able
to make disparaging remarks about the intelligence of blacks and
Latinos.
   When she was growing up in Jamaica, Sinclair said, black people
in films were always worthless, shiftless bums or gangsters.
   Fortunately, she said, she and members of her family traveled to
the United States ``and so we knew better.''
   Recently Sinclair said she was insulted by some black producers
who were thinking of casting her.
   But one of them told her ``he thought I was too polished, too
cultured, could I `get down''' or act in a more stereotypical black
manner, Sinclair said.
   ``That floored me and made me want to leave the business,'' she
said to the overflow crowd in a Congressional hearing room on
Capitol Hill. ``That's what I expected from the other side.''
   But one of the worst incidents occurred when she went to a
producer with a project by and about black people.
   After presenting all of her arguments for something she thought
black people would flock to see, Sinclair said the producer told
her: ``It doesn't matter what we put out there. Anything we put out
there they'll go see.''
   Too true, the two actors said. Casey, using conservative figures,
said that if 20 million blacks saw two movies a month at $3 a
ticket, that would equal $120 million a month and more than $ 1
billion a year.
   ``So if you think you are inconsequential, stop it,'' Casey said.
   A visiting black actor from Great Britain was taken aback by the
discussion.
   ``You've kind of blown me away. We guys thought you were doing so
well,'' Brian Bovell said to much laughter during the question and
answer portion of the program.
   Afterward, he said black Britons were aware of Malcolm X, Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and also, as seen through the movies, that
life in America was good.
   ``It was presumed to be the same for blacks,'' Bovell said.
``This has been brilliant for me.''

<TEXT>
   As workers who labored to remove the scars
of the Exxon Valdez disaster left this port town on Friday, the
state announced its own $21 million cleanup plan for the winter.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said the winter program will include cleaning
shorelines, researching and developing cleanup technology that can
be used next spring, and protecting fish hatcheries and untainted,
environmentally sensitive areas.
   Exxon officials have pronounced 1,100 miles of oil-smeared
shoreline ``environmentally stable,'' saying their 25-week effort to
remove gross contamination from shorelines in Prince William Sound
was a job well done.
   Otto Harrison, general manager of Exxon's Valdez operations, said
that while oil remained in some areas, it was not enough to harm
wildlife.
   ``What you've seen is a coastline almost free of oil,'' Harrison
said at a Valdez news conference. ``You're seeing the steady
recovery of Prince William Sound.''
   Officials at VECO Inc., the primary contractor for Exxon in the
cleanup, defended their work at a news conference on Friday. Bert
Hartley, VECO's general manager, said the removal of oil from
beaches was ``Herculean accomplishment.''
   ``That does not mean you cannot find oil on the beaches. You can
find oil if you look for it,'' Hartley said.
   Cowper was conciliatory toward Exxon as he announced the state
cleanup.
   ``I think Exxon has made a good-faith efort to clean up the
beaches,'' the governor said. ``I'm not going to fault Exxon because
they made some mistakes. Frankly, some of the things the state has
done were mistakes.''
   The state should have known more about dealing with a spill, he
said. ``At least we should have known no one else knew how to do
it,'' Cowper said.
   The state work will be funded with an oil tax the Alaska
Legislature passed this year, and reimbursment will be sought from
Exxon, the governor said.
   State officials agreed some shorelines were cleaner because of
Exxon's efforts. But they disputed the company's rosey portrayal of
an environmental rebound from nearly 11 million gallons of spilled
crude.
   Dennis Kelso, the state's environmental commissioner, toured
shorelines on two islands south of Valdez on Thursday and said he
was not pleased with what he saw.
   ``This beach is not environmentally stable,'' he said as he poked
a stick into thickly oiled rocks on Knight Island.
   The Knight Island shoreline was one of the last treated by
cleanup crews. The air still was thick with the pungent smell of a
chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks.
   The fertilizer is supposed to stimulate microorganisms to break
down the oil faster than they would normally. Kelso, who had visited
the same beach two weeks ago, said the process has shown signs of
success.
   In other spots, however, it appeared the cleanup was rushed to
meet Exxon's self-imposed cleanup deadline, Kelso said.
   The commissioner said the state is asking Exxon to do more
research in the coming months to determine the chemicals' possible
side effects and whether the process does much more than remove
surface oil.
   Exxon officials said that while the summer cleanup is over, the
company will continue to monitor the spill and respond to major
problems. About 300 cleanup workers will remain in Alaska, down from
about 10,000 at the height of the effort.
   The spill on March 24th was the nation's worst _ 10.92 million
gallons of crude gushed out when the ship ran aground.

   Sinbad was a hard-drinking old salt,
a legendary sailor promoted for battling German U-boats and
court-martialed for being three-sheets-to-the-wind with his snout in
the gutter.
   Mongrel or not, Sinbad the K9 sailor was a lucky charm for
crewmates aboard the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Campbell, who faced
numerous World War II battles without a single loss of life.
   On Friday, sailors from almost a dozen states gathered around
their comrade's seaside grave to honor him with taps and a
headstone, placed atop the Coast Guard's ``most famous dog'' 38
years after his death.
   A nine-man color guard stood with flags dipped as a rifle squad
sounded a salute while King Reynolds, a Campbell veteran from
Tallahassee, Fla., raised the flag over Sinbad's grave.
   As taps filled the sea air, the men of the Campbell bowed their
heads and cried.
   ``He was as much a member of the crew as any one of us,'' said
George Fuerth, a veteran from Lakehurst who served with Sinbad. ``He
was there for all the battles and he was there for all the drinking.
He sailed the Seven Seas.''
   Sinbad's human companions got the idea of honoring the daring dog
at their first reunion in 1986. They mulled it over and finally
finished the memorial this year.
   Sinbad served aboard the Campbell for 77 dog years, from 1937
until he was retired in 1948 to a Coast Guard station along the New
Jersey shore. Sinbad died when he was 15 years old.
   Sinbad began his military career as a stowaway, smuggled aboard
by a Coast Guardsman. The ship's captain planned to dump Sinbad at
the first port, but became attached to the dog and allowed him to
stay.
   During his dog days, he had his own bunk and personnel file,
where his exploits were documented along with his promotions and
demotions.
   He would appear at roll call with life jacket in mouth, dropping
it to bark his reply when his name was yelled, his best friends
remembered. But what stands out most about Sinbad was that he lived
a dog's life like a true sailor.
   ``He was found in the Bronx one day, passed out in a gutter,''
said Nicholas Stepich, of New York, a former gun captain aboard the
Campbell. ``He was totally inebriated. A woman saw his Coast Guard
tag and called us and we sent a Jeep out to get him. Then we had to
send another Jeep to get the guy who was supposed to pick up Sinbad.
   ``We figured the two got into a drinking contest.''
   Well known in the taverns near the Navy yards in New York City's
Brooklyn borough, and Boston's old Scollay Square, Sinbad would hop
atop the bar stool and woof down a few whiskeys with beer chasers,
Stepich said.
   A 1943 Life magazine article condensed in Reader's Digest
documents the sailor's dog tales.
   Universal Pictures made a war-years documentary on the plucky
pooch, ``and when we showed it at our reunion, there wasn't a dry
eye in the place,'' Stepich said.
   Drinking like a St. Bernard, however, did not come without its
price to the barrel-chested mutt.
   Sinbad made Chief Dog, the highest rank the animal could attain
in the Coast Guard, and the crew partied till dawn. But a few
drunken binges had him busted back to Dog First-Class.
   Bill Liming, of Sacramento, Calif., told the crowd of about 100
people at the ceremonies about serving on the disciplinary board.
   ``He just stared at me,'' he said. ``I noted no remorse or
emotion from Sinbad. Sinbad was a whitehat. His jaunty stride was
that of a seasoned sailor.''
   When he retired, however, Sinbad went out top dog, mostly for his
bravery and for keeping the crew safe.
   ``The idea was that nothing would happen to anyone while Sinbad
was aboard,'' Stepich said. ``We had a few men wounded, but nobody
killed. Even today I begin to wonder how that could be.''
   Sinbad's closest brush came when the Campbell took on six German
U-boats. The Coast Guard ship rammed and sunk the last of the enemy
vessels, but bobbed powerless in the sea for three days afterward.
   About 100 men stayed aboard, with Sinbad, as the Campbell _ its
engine room flooded _ was towed perilously back to port.
   ``The main thoughts were that you were pretty much closer to God
than at any time in your life,'' Stepich said. ``God and Sinbad.''

<HEAD>Qintex Tops Murdoch With Successful $1.5 Billion Bid for MGM-UA</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with junk bond debt bringing total

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia's Qintex Group won a brief
but bitter bidding war for MGM-UA Communications Corp. on Friday
with a $1.5 billion buyout offer, topping media magnate Rupert
Murdoch by $100 million.
   Qintex, a television and real estate concern, also will assume
$400 million in junk bond debt, bringing its total acquisition costs
to $1.9 billion.
   Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82 percent of MGM-UA, already had sold
many of the assets of the old MGM and United Artists studios.
   The high price was attributed to MGM-UA's 4,000-picture library
of movies, including ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' which are alluring assets at a time of great worldwide
appetite for U.S. entertainment.
   ``We believe the global development of not just television but
movies is going to exceed inflation by a wide margin,'' said John
Lloyd, Qintex's chief financial officer.
   David Evans, Qintex president and chief executive, said another
big factor was Kerkorian's willingness to sell the famous MGM lion
logo, which he previously had jealously guarded.
   ``There are people who will claim we paid too much,'' he said.
``(But) it is arguably the second-most recognizable logo in the
world behind the Coca-Cola logo. I'd put the value of the logo in
some hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   Kerkorian had been seeking a buyer for all or part of the company
for 18 months. Nearly every big American company with entertainment
holdings, as well as Japan's Sony Corp., had expressed interest.
   Qintex announced a deal in April to buy MGM-UA's United Artists
studio and some other assets for $600 million. At the time, the Fox
Inc. unit of Murdoch's News Corp. was the final suitor to drop out
of the bidding.
   In a surprise move Wednesday, Murdoch bid $1.4 billion for all of
MGM-UA. But negotiations between MGM's board and Murdoch's News
Corp. and its Fox Inc. unit broke down late Thursday.
   By bettering Murdoch's deal for all of MGM-UA, Qintex Chairman
Christopher Skase turned the tables on his fellow Australian.
Murdoch, whose holdings include the Fox studio, had hosted a
cocktail party to introduce Skase to Hollywood's elite after the
Qintex deal was announced in April.
   When Murdoch re-entered the picture Wednesday, Skase was in the
process of buying for $8 million the palatial Los Angeles estate of
the late Edie Goetz, the daughter of the late Louis B. Mayer, one of
MGM's founders.
   A source close to Skase, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Skase had been angered by Murdoch's offer, although not surprised by
it.
   Neither Murdoch nor Skase was available for interviews Friday.
   Murdoch spokesman Howard Rubenstein said MGM-UA had asked Murdoch
to bid for the company. ``He thought he had a deal, but then the
transaction fell apart,'' he said, declining to comment further.
   Qintex owns an Australian television network and 43 percent of a
U.S. company that produces TV movies and specials, including the
``Lonesome Dove'' miniseries.
   Ted Turner owns worldwide television broadcast rights and
domestic pay-TV rights to the 3,000-picture MGM library, which
includes pre-1950s Warners Bros. releases. But Qintex will get
domestic and foreign home video rights to that library, as well as
non-U.S. pay-TV rights.
   The 1,000-movie United Artists library includes the ``Rocky,''
``Pink Panther'' and James Bond pictures.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Urges Compromise at Meeting with Baltic Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail Gorbachev urged compromise upon
the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia at a Moscow meeting on
economic reform plans and ethnic tensions in the Baltics, Tass said
Friday.
   Nationalist movements have sprung up in those three Baltic
republics and other regions.
   The official news agency said Gorbachev told Communist leaders of
the three republics on Wednesday that ``what is needed is
consolidation, reciprocity, a search for sensible compromises.''
   The Baltics have been pushing Gorbachev's economic reforms and
won approval from the national Parliament to carry out plans for
economic autonomy beginning Jan. 1.
   Gorbachev wants economic restructuring, but maintains the
Communist Party should play the leading role in those reforms.
   Tass said Gorbachev told the Baltic leaders that the ``main
current difficulty is that the long-term goals ... come against
striking problems, which reflect the current needs of people.''
   It said he told them they had to ``move actively,'' but not
forget the three fundamentals ``from which we have no right to
deviate.''
   He listed these as: solving all problems ``only in the framework
of the federation;'' unity of the party _ ``the main guarantor of
perestroika and the process of national revival,'' and ``equality of
the citizens of all nationalities.''
   Soviet officials say Gorbachev took part in writing a statement
from the Communist Party Central Committee in late August warning
Baltic residents that separatism would not be in their interests.
   On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic residents joined hands to
protest the 50th anniversary of a Nazi-Soviet agreement in which
Josef Stalin incorporated the previously independent Baltic states
into the Soviet Union.
   Harry Tiido, an editor of the official Estonian radio, said in a
telephone interview from Tallinn that the republic's Communist Party
chief, Vaino Vyalyas, President Arnold Ruutel and Premier Indrek
Toome attended the meeting.
   Tiido quoted Estonian leaders as saying Gorbachev expressed a
willingness to ``put pressure through the Politburo on ministries in
Moscow'' that might try to slow down economic reform.
   He said that Vyalyas dodged questions on ethnic tensions in
interviews after the meeting.
   Last month, non-Estonians went on strike to protest a law
imposing residency requirements for voting and running for local
office in the republic.
   Tass said in its account that Gorbachev told the leaders on
Wednesday that perestroika _ his term for economic and social
restructuring _ ``can succeed only if the party ranks are united.''
   ``It would be a grave historic mistake to weaken such a powerful
political organism, as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.''
   Also on Friday, the Communist Party daily Pravda accused members
of the Ukraine's new Narodni Rukh political movement of seeking to
undermine Kremlin authority and take power itself in the republic.
   The Narodni Rukh ended a three-day founding congress last Sunday.

<HEAD>Bill Against Assault Weapons Planned; NRA Says No Chance of Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prompted by a shooting spree that left
eight dead and 13 wounded at a printing plant, a state lawmaker said
Friday he would sponsor a bill in the General Assembly to outlaw
assault weapons.
   ``We owe it to the families and the other victims to try at least
to make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon,'' said
freshman Rep. Mike Ward, a Democrat.
   Ward said he would file a bill for the legislative session that
begins in January, despite a key House leader's assessment that the
measure's chance of passing would be slim.
   The National Rifle Association, which helped defeat gun control
legislation in the General Assembly in 1984, was unconcerned about
the bill, a spokesman for the firearms lobby said.
   The issue was revived after Thursday's rampage at Standard
Gravure Corp. by a heavily armed employee with a history of mental
illness. Joseph T. Wesbecker killed seven people with a Chinese-made
semiautomatic AK-47 assault rifle, then killed himself with a
German-made 9mm pistol.
   The small arsenal he carted into the plant in a gym bag included
two MAC-11 machine pistols, a .38-caliber revolver and hundreds of
rounds of ammunition.
   A person bent on such mayhem would not be stopped by an anti-gun
bill, said William E. Smith, the League of Kentucky Sportsmen's
representative to the NRA.
   ``You just can't legislate against a nut,'' said Smith.
   Rep. Greg Stumbo, a ``card-carrying NRA member'' who as House
majority floor leader helps control the flow of legislation, said
Ward would have an uphill fight for his bill.
   House leaders usually allow any bill to go to the floor for a
vote if _ and it's a big if _ it makes it out of committee, said
Stumbo, a Democrat. ``I don't think the chances of that measure
would be very good,'' Stumbo said.
   Louisville and Lexington once had ordinances requiring a waiting
period for handgun buyers, but that changed in the 1984 General
Assembly with a bill backed by the NRA.
   The bill, which sailed through both the House and Senate,
prohibited local governments from enacting gun-control measures of
any type.
   But now, ``with this proliferation of high-powered assault
weapons, attitudes of the general public are changing. We just have
to see that these weapons are different,'' Ward said.
   ``I think the NRA will discredit itself by opposing a ban on
assault rifles because assault rifles are not in any way a sporting
weapon. There would be nothing left of a squirrel to eat after it
had been shot with an AK-47,'' Ward said.
   Smith said the NRA was ``extremely sorry about the terrible thing
that happened,'' but that ``nothing has changed'' about the
organization's opposition to gun legislation.
   The tragedy was not due simply to Wesbecker's possession of
automatic or semiautomatic weapons, he said. ``The man could have
walked into that place ... with a pump shotgun and done a lot more
damage than he did with this so-called assault rifle,'' Smith said.
   Louisville Police Chief Richard Dotson called for a national ban
on assault weapons, saying, ``What do you need these for, except for
killing people?''
   And Archbishop Thomas Kelly alluded to gun-control laws at a Mass
for the shooting victims.
   ``We are a democratic society,'' Kelly said. ``We've got to be
able to find ways to keep this from happening again.''
   But it will not be prevented with legislation like Ward's, Smith
said.
   ``I don't think it will ever happen in our state,'' he said.

   A series of bombings in three of
Colombia's major drug-trafficking centers Friday damaged banks and
injured seven people, including two policemen, authorities said.
   The army meanwhile said it arrested 28 suspected leftist
guerrillas and accused them of carrying out terrorist acts with drug
traffickers around the cocaine hub of Medellin.
   In the southwestern city of Cali, a bomb blew out windows and
caused extensive damage Friday night to an insurance building, which
also housed a savings and loan bank. Two other blasts damaged a
state bank and another bank.
   Cali Police Col. Roso Julio Franco, in an interview with national
Radio Caracol, said the three bombs went off within a few minutes of
each other in the city of 1 million people. He said five people were
seriously injured.
   ``The wave of terrorism has escalated, but we now have things
under control,'' he said.
   The region is home to one of four Colombia's major drug cartels,
which have been blamed for a series of nationwide bombing attacks in
recent weeks.
   In Medellin, 150 miles northwest of Bogota, police said a bomb
went off Friday night at a highway to the capital as a police car
drove by. Two policemen were injured, they said.
   A two-week curfew was suspended Thursday in Medellin. Mayor Juan
Gomez said the curfew was lifted because the city of 2 million had
returned to ``absolute normalcy.''
   Earlier Friday, four bombs exploded at banks in Bogota.
   Banks have been major targets of bombings since the government
launched a crackdown on the drug trade a month ago.
   No one claimed responsibility for any of Friday's attacks.
   Also Friday, the Defense Ministry ordered the country's
200,000-member army and the national police on alert and reinforced
security at many buildings in anticipation of violence on the eve of
the ``Day of Love and Friendship.'' Colombians exchange gifts on
Saturday's holiday.
   In eastern Canada, Colombians Jose Ali Galindo-Escobar and
Fernando Augusto Mendoza-Jaramillo were ordered held for trial next
month on charges of importing 1,100 pounds of cocaine. They were
arrested and the drugs seized in April.
   Their hearing in the New Brunswick town of Fredericton was held
Thursday under tight security following the arrests Wednesday in
Canada of five armed men.
   Inspector Al Hutchinson of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in
Fredericton said Friday the two Canadian cases are linked, but he
gave no details.
   U.S. officials said two of arrested men are Colombian, although
all held Venezuelan passports.
   The arrests in Colombia were announced in a communique from the
4th Army Brigade in Medellin, the site of almost daily bombings,
shootings and arson attacks since the government and its cocaine
cartels declared war on each other last month.
   The United States has been helping Colombia in the crackdown, and
Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo, Colombia's defense minister, said Friday
that Argentina would be sending ``various airplanes.''
   However, he gave no details, and there was no immediate
confirmation from Argentine officials.
   The army said the 28 arrested belonged to the National Liberation
Army, which is one of six leftist guerrilla groups operating in this
South American country.
   The communique did not say when the 28 were arrested or what
specific ``terrorist acts'' they were accused of committing.
   ``We have succeeded in capturing an entire gang of bandits from
the so-called National Liberation Army that together with
narco-traffickers have been carrying out terrorist acts (around
Medellin),'' it said.
   It would be unusual for leftist guerrillas to work with drug
cartels.
   Drug organizations here traditionally have considered guerrillas
their enemies and have funded hit squads aimed at killing leftist
sympathizers.
   Drug traffickers also view the army-guerrilla confrontations in
remote regions as getting in the way of their cocaine processing and
shipping operations.
   Since President Virgilio Barco decreed special emergency powers
Aug. 18 to aid in the anti-narcotics fight, authorities have been
rounding up drug suspects and seizing bank accounts and property
presumed linked to the traffickers.
   The emergency measures temporarily suspend some constitutional
guarantees and allow suspects to be held for eight days without
being formally charged.
   The current crackdown started after drug gangs Aug. 18
assassinated the leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, a foe of the traffickers.
   Also Friday, a U.S. official in Bogota backed up a declaration
made the day before by Botero Restrepo, who said there were no
American military advisers in the country.
   ``The problem is the word `advisers.' They aren't advisers. We
have trainers and technicians,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke
to foreign reporters on the condition of anonymity.
   Consternation arose in Colombia following reports from Washington
that President Bush had deployed troops to help fight narcotics in
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.

   After being brushed by several hurricanes this year,
the eastern Caribbean islands may get the brunt of Hurricane Hugo as
it churns westward with 150 mph winds, forecasters said Friday.
   ``It looks like this one is not going to miss the islands like
the others,'' said Jack Beven, a forecaster at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``It's on the most
southerly course of any this year and that should keep it down in
the Caribbean longer.''
   A hurricane warning was posted Friday from St. Lucia to the
British Virgin Islands, and a hurricane watch was issued for the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. A tropical storm watch was
issued for the islands of Barbados and St. Vincent.
   Rough seas have been reported around the islands since Thursday.
   Forecasters described the force four hurricane as ``extremely
dangerous.'' Category five is the scale's highest rank.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was near 14.9 north latitude and
56.6 west longitude, or about 340 miles east southeast of the French
resort island of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. The storm was
moving west at 15 mph.
   With nothing in the atmosphere to divert it or sap its power,
Hugo was expected to remain on its westerly course and strengthen
somewhat during the next 24 hours, according to reports from an Air
Force reconnaissance plane.
   Beven said the center of the system could reach the Leeward
Islands on Saturday night and may move toward Puerto Rico over the
weekend. Rainfall amounts of five to 10 inches is expected in the
path of the hurricane.
   Three other hurricanes this year _ Dean, Erin and Gabrielle _
turned north toward Bermuda before reaching the Caribbean.
   But Hugo's southern course is reminiscent of Hurricane Gilbert,
which pounded Jamaica and the Mexican mainland last September. Hugo
was upgraded Friday to a force 4 storm. Gilbert was a 5, the scale's
highest rank.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the present Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.

   The official Xinhua News Agency said the 85-year-old Deng met
T.D. Lee, professor of physics at Columbia University. It gave no
details of their get-together.
   Deng last appeared in public on June 9, when he met military
officers and praised their actions in leading troops into the city
on June 3-4 to suppress student-led pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people died as troops shot
their way into the city on their way to capture Tiananmen Square
from student demonstrators.
   Since then Chinese and foreign sources have reported that Deng is
seriously ill from prostrate cancer. Chinese officials have asserted
that Deng is in good health and spent part of the summer resting at
the seaside resort of Beidaihe.
   Speculation that Deng was no longer capable of carrying out his
official functions rose when he failed to meet the president of
Burkina Faso during a recent visit.
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin, however, reportedly recently told a
delegation from Hong Kong that Deng continues to swim a half-hour
daily and would appear in public during Oct. 1 National Day
celebrations.

   A top Chinese official in Beijing has said Deng
Xiaoping is in good health and will make an appearance during
celebrations of the Oct. 1 National Day, newspapers reported Friday.
   Deng, 84, has not been seen publicly since June 9, when he
praised martial law troops for suppressing the pro-democracy
movement. His long absence from the public spotlight has added fuel
to widespread rumors that the Chinese leader is in poor health.
   But Yao Yilin, a member of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo
Standing Committee, told a Hong Kong delegation that Deng will
appear in celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic, several local newspapers reported.
   Yao's message was relayed by members of the Heung Yee Kuk, a
powerful organization in rural Hong Kong, who returned to this
British colony Thursday from Beijing, where they met several Chinese
leaders.
   The group quoted Yao as saying that Deng, who is chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, continues to swim for a
half-hour daily. He also was quoted as saying he had visited Deng
three days earlier and that he was in good health.
   The delegation also said it was told that martial law in Beijing,
which was imposed May 20, will not be lifted before National Day.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Approves Newark High-Rise Demolition Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday approved the
demolition of eight buildings in two housing projects in a
compromise that was struck after a proposal to knock down nearly
five times as many high-rises drew fire.
   In addition to demolishing buildings containing about 1,900
apartments, the agreement between the Newark Housing Authority and
tenants groups calls for the renovation or construction of more than
3,000 apartments for poor people.
   Nearly $3 million in federal Housing and Urban Development funds
are committed to the renovations and construction.
   The city originally had planned to tear down 3,900 buildings
containing about 5,700 units. Tenants and advocates for the homeless
said the plan would swell the number of homeless people in Newark.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise tentatively approved
the plan on Aug. 17, but delayed final approval until Thursday to
give officials time to distribute copies of the pact to tenants and
federal housing officials.
   ``There was some disagreement, but none of the parties involved
wanted to jeapordize the HUD funding in the agreement,'' said the
judge, whose courtroom was packed with tenants and many on the
authority's long waiting lists.
   Under the agreement, buildings containing 1,506 apartments in the
Columbus Homes project and about 400 at the Kretchmer Homes will be
demolished. Most of the units in those two projects are already
vacant.
   The pact requires the city to break ground for the 1,776 new
units it has promised to build before beginning demolition at
Columbus Homes and to repair and fill 1,632 vacant apartments before
demolition at the other project.
   Many of those attending Thursday's hearing took the opportunity
to complain about the housing authority's efforts to provide
low-income housing.
   About one-third of Newark's 316,000 residents receive public
assistance. The housing authority is the eighth largest in the
nation with 13,000 apartments.
   The original plan to destroy most of the city's high-rise
projects reflected a trend toward low-rise public housing, which is
considered more manageable by many officials.

   House tax-writers' narrow approval of a capital
gains tax cut sought by President Bush sets the stage for the first
major leadership test of new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley Jr. and
his top Democratic deputies.
   Over vehement objections from Foley and other party leaders, six
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee joined 13
Republicans in a 19-17 vote Thursday to cut the tax.
   Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., called his panel's
action ``a financial disaster'' and ``ultimate expression of `feel
good' economics'' that could unravel the rate-equalizing,
loophole-closing tax reforms of 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We are pleased by
the vote and we will be working hard to sustain it on the floor.''

   Federal aviation officials doctored attendance
records of air traffic controllers who were fired in Chicago during
the 1981 strike, a House panel said today in recommending a probe
for possible criminal misconduct.
   Officials produced altered documents when Chicago controllers
appealed their firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and
then ``attempted to conceal those activities'' during testimony to
the board and a House subcommittee investigating the case, lawmakers
concluded.
   The report by the Public Works subcommittee on investigations and
oversight recommends the Justice Department review the testimony of
Federal Aviation Administration officials for possible misconduct.
   ``Our goal was to determine if a federal agency had trampled on
the rights of individuals and we are able to conclude that a gross
injustice did indeed take place,'' said Rep. James L. Oberstar,
D-Minn., chairman of the subcommittee during the investigation.

   President Bush is doubling food aid to Poland
to $100 million next year ``to support the process of change''
there, but the Democratic author of a rival plan calls it a merely a
stopgap effort.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said Bush's plan does not go nearly far enough to help
Poland meet its long-term needs.
   Bush announced the food aid increase for fiscal 1990 on Thursday,
just hours after Leahy unveiled his own $2.5 billion ``food for
peace'' package.
   The president's plan calls for shipments to Poland of beef, pork,
corn, butter, butter oil, sunflower oil, cotton and rice. The new
$50 million infusion was in addition to $50 million in food Bush
announced in early August for the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Retired Colonel Urges Vietnam-era Phoenix Program in War on Drugs
in Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How to fight Colombia's drug lords? One
suggestion, on Fox Broadcasting's ``The Reporters'' Saturday: Try
something like the Phoenix program of ``selective'' assassinations
of Viet Cong leaders that went on during the Vietnam war.
   That would be a tad controversial. But then, it comes from a
controversial soldier _ retired Army Col. David H. Hackworth, a
highly-decorated combat veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars.
   To ``win a war of terrorism, you have to employ terrorism,'' he
says.
   Although the Phoenix program ``certainly did get out of control
at times,'' he says on the show, ``it worked very effectively in
Vietnam.''
   He doesn't advocate U.S. participation in such an effort in
Colombia, or say who should set it up.
   But in fighting the drug battle, he says, ``a program like that,
a covert program, is needed to win the war'' against the cocaine
barons and their underlings. The key to it, he says, ``is to create
that fear ... that they don't know if they're going to be here
tomorrow.''
   Strong words from a man who made headlines in 1971 by breaking
ranks from his colleagues while still on active duty in Vietnam. He
did it in an ABC ``Issues and Answers'' interview in which he
sharply criticized the Army's Vietnam training and tactics, and all
but declared the war unwinnable.
   The flamboyant Aussie Steve Dunleavy is both the anchor and chief
correspondent of Saturday's ``The Reporters,'' a special called
``Narc War: The Southern Front.''
   But Hackworth is there in three unusual roles: as the special's
military advisor; as an interviewee; and, on a limited basis, as an
interviewer of some of the Colombian army's officers and men who are
fighting the drug war.
   This complex, up-from-the-ranks soldier now lives in Australia,
is an advocate of nuclear arms reduction, and on Saturday's show he
urges killing the Stealth bomber and Star Wars programs, among other
military things, and using the money instead for what he calls
``this real war'' on drugs.
   His recently-published memoirs, ``About Face,'' are true to his
pull-no-punches style.
   It is likely that eyebrows will be raised that Hackworth is on
``The Reporters'' as both an advocate of ways to fight the drug war
and as a sort-of reporter on the battle. It is considered good form
in traditional journalism to keep the roles of advocate and reporter
separate.
   That he is on the show is due to Gerald Stone, executive producer
of ``The Reporters.'' He says he knew Hackworth from his own days in
Australia and knew his Vietnam combat background.
   Stone says he thought that Hackworth's perspective would would
make him the ideal guest expert for a special on the Colombian
military's fight against drug terrorists and producers, a fight that
some have likened to the early days of the Vietnam war.
   ``This was the first time he had done something like this,''
Stone says. ``He was very effective in the role, and so we'd like to
use him more'' in future stories about the drug war in Latin America.
   ``I'm not sure whether he wants to do that,'' he said. ``The last
time I talked to him, he wanted to go off to a farm in Montana ...
but this might stir him up.''
   Stone's show, launched in July last year and often cited as a
prime example of tabloid TV, starts its second season on Sept. 30.
Ironically, at a time some network news programs have been accused
of edging toward the tabloid, Stone says his series is moving the
other way.
   He says, ``I've been moving it into a more classical `60 Minutes'
church.''
   That durable CBS congregation, incidentally, starts its 22nd
season on Sunday, with Meredith Vieira and Steve Kroft now part of
the ``60 Minutes'' flock headed by founder-executive producer Don
Hewitt.
   Its leadoff piece, a good one, is Mike Wallace's trip with Adm.
William Crowe, outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
during last summer's unprecedented visit by Crowe to Soviet military
installations.
   (In one scene in which Wallace interviews a top Soviet general, a
little editorial needling of a rival seems afoot. One clearly sees
an NBC News cameraman taping away behind Wallace.)
   ``60 Minutes'' chief Hewitt says he isn't worried that the
syndicated rash of so-called ``reality-based'' tabloid series this
fall will affect his high-rated broadcast's ratings by surfeiting
viewers with too much, er, news.
   ``I'd like to believe that we're different,'' he adds.
Furthermore, he says of tabloid TV shows, ``I don't watch 'em.''

<HEAD>Top Children's Entertainer Back With Environmental Songs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>

   In an obscure suburban rehearsal hall, Raffi
prepared to return to his pre-school audience after a one-year
sabbatical took the children's entertainer away from the grind of
concert tours.
   He and his four-piece band ran through every chord and gesture
certain to delight a young crowd, from ``Shake My Sillies Out'' to
the nonsense words that turn ``apples and bananas'' into ``ooples
and banoonoos.''
   Raffi has sold more than 4 million records and created a one-man
cottage industry of children's books and videos based on the
principle that little kids _ and their parents _ can be treated with
respect.
   He is slowly returning to work. Instead of the usual string of
concerts, he has scheduled only six shows in September, four of them
in Canada and two at New York's Carnegie Hall.
   Then Raffi, who uses just his first name, plans to spend the fall
recording his first album that won't be aimed exclusively to an
audience five years old or younger.
   The attempt to broaden his audience allows greater vocabulary and
more difficult concepts than in his previous work, but doesn't mean
he's not happy with his role as a children's entertainer.
   The sabbatical, he explained en route to his office after the
rehearsal finished for the day, was spent mostly at home in Toronto
and consisted of ``no concerts, no interviews, and no thinking about
a next record.''
   ``It took me out of the treadmill, out of the career demands,''
the 41-year-old folksinger said. ``It allowed me to listen to my own
inner voice again.''
   His trademark beard still intact and dressed in T-shirt and
casual pants for the practice session, Raffi said he wanted to take
the time to examine what he'd done recently and take stock of where
he was.
   ``For me, I just had to really examine all this touring and the
tremendous amount of travel it took,'' he said. In 1987 and 1988, he
chalked up 200 sold-out concerts in 70 cities across the United
States and Canada.
   He sorted through fan mail, some of it with words and some solely
of scrawls and pictures, as he settled into his comfortable office.
Little of this could have been anticipated when he turned to
children's entertaining in 1974, just six years after his family
emigrated to Canada from Egypt.
   ``I couldn't conceive where this would go whatsoever,'' he
recalled of his start. ``It was literally not knowing what you were
doing.''
   He recorded his first album of children's songs, ``Singable Songs
for the Very Young,'' in 1976, but didn't stop thinking of himself
as a folksinger who happened to do some children's music on the side
until two years later.
   ``It took me that long to discover the true value of the career
that opened,'' he said.
   Now, with eight albums, half a million Raffi books in print and
two concert videos out, Raffi has discovered what larger
corporations in children's entertainment have long known, that a
completely new pre-school audience is ready every few years.
   That means all his merchandise can perpetually stay in book and
record stores.
   ``I'm an entertainer of children and their families,'' Raffi
said. ``It's such a new undertaking. ... There's room for many,
especially the ones who are doing it for the right reasons.''
   Except for the concert videos that were conceived as being
interactive, he has stayed away from television because he believes
the medium contradicts children's basic nature to be doers rather
than viewers.
   ``TV is not a natural friend of the young child,'' Raffi said.
``The two videos that I have were a compromise.''
   His songs are simple, tuneful, thoughtful and fun.
   ``Did you ever see a whale with a polka-dot tail?'' he may ask in
``Down by the Bay,'' while in ``One Light, One Sun'' he sings of
``One song heard by everyone. One love, one heart, one heart warming
everyone.''
   Perhaps his biggest innovation in children's entertainment may be
that in gearing his songs to a young audience he didn't forget that
they shouldn't grate on an older one either.
   Some children's entertainment, he said, seems to have been
created on the assumption that a ``saccharine-like quality'' had to
be present.
   ``If you're comfortable in your respect for children as whole
people, there's no need to speak to them in a condescending way,''
he said.
   The entertainer said, for example, that he believes a 3-year-old
fan's question of ``Raffi, how did you get out of my tape?'' should
be considered a realistic perception.
   ``I'm just respecting the difference,'' he said. ``Any
entertainer has to know his audience; it's just that simple.''
   Raffi, who is separated from his wife, has no children but said
he draws on what he has learned in performing and his own memories.
   Plans for the new album are to call it ``Evergreen, Everblue,''
featuring songs with environmental themes. Most were written on
sabbatical but three from earlier albums, including ``One Light, One
Sun,'' ``Just Like the Sun'' and ``Big Beautiful Planet,'' will be
freshly recorded.
   He said he was deeply affected by the environmental news of the
past year.
   ``It just struck me how prevalent the global mess really was,''
Raffi said.
   One of the new songs, ``Clean Rain,'' is about acid rain, a topic
of consistent concern in Canada, and will say, ``I remember the days
when the rain fell clean.''
   Another spark for interest in environmental issues came from
another one-name pop star, Sting, who stopped in Toronto on tour to
call attention to the devastation of the Brazil rain forest.
   ``That was an interesting meeting,'' Raffi recalled. ``It turned
out Sting's kids were fans of mine.''

   People expect great things from Cameron Mackintosh,
the producer of ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of
the Opera.''
   But a musical set in Vietnam? That's something else.
   ``It's another emotional roller coaster,'' the Tony-winning
millionaire said of ``Miss Saigon,'' his most-anticipated
blockbuster to date.
   The $4.65 million-show, opening Sin Vietnam prior
to the 1975 fall of Saigon and then picks up in 1978.
   The musical at the Theater Royal, Dept. 20, is set rury Lane, reworks
the
``Madama Butterfly'' story about the doomed liaison between an
American naval officer and his Japanese bride.
   It stars Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce as a Vietnamese pimp; Simon
Bowman and Claire Moore as the lovesick American GI and his wife;
and 18-year-old Filipino actress Lea Salonga in her Western stage
debut, as Kim, the musical's tragic heroine.
   ``Miss Saigon'' reteams Mackintosh with Alain Boublil and
Claude-Michel Schonberg, the award-winning French authors of ``Les
Miserables,'' which is well on its way to being the most
internationally successful musical ever.
   Richard Maltby Jr., the Tony-winning Broadway director of ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' and ``Song and Dance,'' co-wrote ther over three years and
its
pre-opening ticket sale of $7.75 million is believed to be a London
record.
   Mackintosh said its appeal differs from that of ``Les
Miserables,'' which was based on Victor Hugo's epic 1862 novel and
has been running in London almost four years.
   ```Miss Saigon' doesn't have the revivalist emotion of the end of
`Les Mis,''' he said, referring to the earlier musical's final
number. ``They all start singing `When Tomorrow Comes'... and
there's a terrific surge of powerful emotion about survival.''
   Mackintosh said the new musical, by contrast, presents ``an
intimate tragedy about a girl who gives up her life,'' and that he
and his collaborators did not intend ``Miss Saigon'' as an overt
political broadside.
   ``It's set against the Vietnam War, but you could equally, though
not necessarily as effectively, set the story in Argentina, South
Africa or wherever colonialism rears its head,'' he said.
   ``We all militantly eschewed a political statement,'' said
Maltby. ``We believe any political statement will emerge from the
events on-stage.
   ``It's hard to miss a parallel between the war itself and what
happens to this Vietnamese girl.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' is expected to arrive on Broadway late next year,
but Mackintosh said this may well be his last mega-musical for a
while.
   ``I've had more than my share of luck; I really can't cope with
looking after any more shows,'' said the 43-year-old producer, who
will spend 1991 producing the movie of ``Les Miserables,'' to be
directed by Alan Parker (``Mississippi Burning'').
   His hit musicals have generated a truly international theater
stretching across America, Europe and Asia, but he said in an
interview: ``I'm beginning to lose my enthusiasm for it.
   ``People say, `What's your next biggie going to be?' and I think,
`Who cares?' All that matters is that what we do, we do well.''

<HEAD>You May Know More Than You Know About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers seem to understand a lot more about
inflation than they've been given credit for. Their actions prove it.
   Unlike the behavior of the 1970s, when the mere mention of the
word sent people running to the store to buy things before prices
rose _ thus assuring that prices would rise _ today's consumer
remains calm.
   It's a good thing too, because the noise made by inflation
alarmists in recent months recalls World War II days, when air raid
sirens sent people scurrying to cellars before the bombs fell.
   Throughout this year the inflation alarmists have screamed
warnings every time the government released another monthly report
on prices. And they're ready to do it again today, the scheduled
release date for August producer prices.
   Unlike the situation in the 1970s, however, people aren't rushing
to buy. They're taking their time instead, forcing automakers into
granting discounts. And they're avoiding items on which prices have
risen sharply.
   This avoidance behavior isn't much publicized, but it is very
real. People are indeed switching from inflated items to what they
consider better buys, and you can demonstrate it from the numbers.
   There are many measures of inflation, the most popular being the
consumer price index. The CPI is based on prices of a ``basket'' of
goods and services. Items in that basket were chosen in 1982, based
on existing shopping patterns.
   Another measurement is called the Gross National Product implicit
price deflator. It measures not just prices, but changes in spending
patterns too. The items in the basket vary in keeping with changes
in shopping behavior.
   Since 1982, the implicit price deflator has averaged 0.4 percent
per year less than the fixed basket index. The difference is
significant, and it can mean only one thing: Consumers have been
avoiding inflated items.
   Why this should be so isn't as clear as the fact that it is
happening.
   It could be in reaction to the foolishness of the 1970s. It could
reflect greater competition and more goods in the marketplace
because of imports. Education might be play a role. Instinct, too.
Confidence in government? Maybe.
   One of the likely possibilities is that consumers have been
forced into selectivity because workers' earnings haven't been
growing explosively, as they did in some periods of the 1970s.
Squeeze inflation from the numbers, in fact, and you can see that
average hourly earnings are no higher than a decade ago.
   Whatever the reason, the results are clear. Although shoppers may
have little flexibility in deciding what items to buy, they have
been exercising choice where they can. Otherwise, the statistical
pattern wouldn't be so clear.
   This change won't silence the alarmists. Unable to break the bad
habit, they will still scream their warnings. You might recall that
in the Ford administration they screamed all the way down into the
pit of recession.
   The big difference between now and the 1970s, however, is that
their audience is more critical and informed. Consumers aren't being
panicked into buying. Instead, they're remaining cool and selective.

   Rock music fans in upstate New York may
soon be finding their heroes in a decidedly unusual place _ the
Ulster County Legislature.
   John Hall, formerly of the 1970s pop group Orleans, and Ed
Sanders, of the 1960s satirical band the Fugs, will both be watching
ballot boxes instead of musical charts this November.
   ``Why should California be the only area of the country with
celebrities (in politics) like Clint Eastwood and Sonny Bono,'' said
Rich Mathews, chairman of the county Legislature.
   Democrats Hall and Sanders are attending zoning meetings, shaking
hands and going door-to-door to meet voters in the generally staid
Republican county about 100 miles north of New York City.
   Politics aren't new to either man, but their previous experiences
were a tad different.
   Hall, with his wife, Johanna, was the author of Top 10 hits
``Still the One'' and ``Dance With Me'' in the mid-'70s. With fellow
artists Jackson Browne and Graham Nash, he organized the
anti-nuclear Musicians United for Safe Energy benefit concerts in
Madison Square Garden 10 years ago.
   Sanders' band was known more for its antics than its music. The
Fugs satirized sex and politics with profane shows. Sanders authored
a best-selling book on Charles Manson and once published a literary
magazine with an obscene title.
   They got into local politics for the same reason: the county's
plan to consolidate 15 landfills into a huge trash-burning facility
about four miles from Hall's home in Saugerties.
   ``I tend to have all these grandiose plans, wanting to stop
nuclear power and things like that,'' Hall said. ``It's kind of
ironic that a dump and an incinerator would get me involved in
this.''
   The balding, 41-year-old singer-songwriter wore a ``stop the
dump'' T-shirt to a recent interview. Talking at length of the
intricate inner workings of local politics, he joked that he and his
wife were planning to celebrate their 20th anniversary by crashing a
closed Republican caucus.
   After initially rejecting the town committee's request to run for
office, Hall changed his mind, figuring it would give him another
platform to campaign against the dump.
   Hall dismisses talk that his pop music background could hinder
his political career.
   ``I suppose some people might think that musicians are frivolous
or that artists of any kind are less substantial people than the
lawyers and accountants who make up the political mainstream,'' he
said. ``I don't think that's true, and I think my involvement in
issues concerning Saugerties for the last 10 years shows that.''
   Hall is one of six people running for four open seats in his
district. Saugerties is Republican territory, but Hall's name
recognition and local anger over the proposed incinerator give him a
better than even chance of winning, said Republican leader Mathews.
   It also doesn't hurt when an old friend such as Bonnie Raitt
comes in for a fund-raising concert. Hall now has nearly $20,000 for
himself and other Democratic candidates.
   ``What can I do?'' quipped Mathews about having to counter
appearances by famous rock stars. ``I can play the radio.''
   Sanders' background has attracted more attention. One of the
Fugs' better-known antics was unsuccessfully trying to enter
Czechoslovakia to masturbate in front of invading Soviet tanks,
according to the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll.
   Russell Roefs, Sanders' opponent, has run radio advertisements
noting that he was fighting in Vietnam at the same time Sanders was
demonstrating against the war and being arrested for distributing
obscene literature. The charges were later dropped.
   At a time in which Judge Douglas Ginsburg's U.S. Supreme Court
nomination was scuttled because of past marijuana experimentation, a
politician's history is fair game, Roefs said.
   ``A person's background usually predicts his views for his entire
life,'' Roefs said. ``I can't believe that we have people in this
society that constantly change and become good guys and bad guys
overnight.''
   Sanders said he's 50 years old now and mainstream enough to get
federal grants for poetry during the Reagan administration. He said
he's always voted as a Democrat.
   ``I've always been an American,'' Sanders said. ``I'm proud of
it. It's just that I could not support the war in Vietnam.''
   Some of his satirical work would be considered tame today, he
said.
   ``Go listen to Rodney Dangerfield, go to a George Carlin
concert,'' Sanders said. ``What I did in my wild youth is nothing
compared to what you can hear at a Catskills resort.''
   Sanders won an early test in September by finishing first in a
three-way Democratic primary. His task in the general election is
generally considered tougher, even though his district includes the
artsy enclave of Woodstock.
   Both Sanders and Hall are trying to crack a 33-member Legislature
that has 28 Republicans.
   Hall still performs music, but he has no record contract. He and
his wife concentrate on writing songs for country artists such as
Juice Newton, Chet Atkins, the Oak Ridge Boys and others.
   He still earns about $20,000 a year in royalties for each of his
two hit songs and is constantly considering offers to use the songs
in commercial endorsements. That makes it easier to swallow the
$8,000 annual salary of an Ulster County legislator.
   ``My main job for the last year and a half has been community
organizing,'' Hall said. ``I've spent many more hours working on
zoning and illegal junkyards than I have writing and performing.''
   As for political ambitions beyond the Ulster County Legislature,
he said, ``It's really too early to speculate about that. First I've
got to get elected and stop the dump.''

   Moments after Marcella Gautier opens for
business each morning, her regular customers begin arriving for
their daily fix.
   The customers, blue-collar workers for the most part, quickly
purchase a small amount of the fine, white powder they have come
for. Many of them ingest it on the spot.
   ``They tell me they need some of my powder to get them going in
the morning,'' she says.
   If it sounds as if something illegal's going on here, no one in
Midway would be misled.
   Midway, you see, is midway between Salisbury and Winston-Salem,
two of the region's remaining three headache powder producers.
   ``Mister, you're smack in the middle of headache powder
country,'' Gautier, told a reporter. ``We sell oodles of the stuff.''
   She pointed to a shelf crammed full with packets of B.C.,
Stanback and Goody's, the last remaining brands in an industry that
once had scores of competitors.
   The powdery concoction _ traditionally a potent mixture of
aspirin and caffeine _ used to be called ``production powder'' in
the tobacco and textile mills that proliferated throughout the
Southeast after the turn of the century.
   ``The tobacco and textile mills were hot, noisy places and the .
.. workers needed something that would give them quick relief from
the long hours and bad working conditions,'' said Tom Chambers,
president and chief executive of Winston-Salem-based Goody's. He
noted the first powders came on the market around 1910.
   Dozens of druggists throughout the South _ and especially the
Carolinas _ came up with their own special formulas. In the late
1920s, Winston-Salem druggist M.C. ``Goody'' Goodman combined
powdered caffeine, aspirin and the analgesic acetaminophen.
   ``For lack of a beter name, he called his mixture `Goody's,'''
said Chambers. ``A local entrepreneur, A. Thad Lewallen, purchased
the rights to Goodman's creation in 1932 and began marketing Goody's
across the region.
   ``There were more than 100 companies back then, although some of
them were one-man operations.''
   Goody's has always been a Winston-Salem firm. The company
currently occupies a renovated overalls factory just down the street
from where Goody Goodman used to dispense the original product over
the counter.
   Chambers can recall the days when Goodys and competing powders
were sold inside the mills from so-called ``dope carts'' that also
offered cigarettes, coffee and cookies.
   ``They're still sold in the mills today, but through vending
machines,'' he said. A packet of two powders sells for about half a
dollar.
   The three companies that survived _ B.C., Goody's and Stanback _
did so because they were better able to promote and market their
product, Chambers said. ``Marketing was the key because the
ingredients weren't all that different.''
   There's one notable exception to that: B.C. and Goody's still
contain caffeine, but Stanback dropped the stimulant in 1984. ``It
hasn't worked worth a darn,'' William Stanback, son of the company's
founder, said of the move.
   Stanback, located at nearby Salisbury, and Goody's are still
small, family owned operations. B.C., which began in Durham, N.C.,
was bought out by the Block Drug Co. in the mid-1960s and was moved
to Memphis, Tenn.
   Industry insiders generally recognize B.C., which was concocted
in 1910 by the late Commodore Thomas Council, as being the first
commercial headache powder to appear on the market.
   The headache powder industry grew rapidly in the 1920s and `30s,
Chambers said. It continued to expand until World War II, when
mechanization reduced the work forces at the plants and mills across
the region.
   Today, headache powders account for about $50 million of the
annual $1.4 billion analgesic market. They remain primarily a
regional product.
   ``I'd never heard of headache powders when I came to the South a
few years ago,'' said Peter Brown, chairman of the anthropology
department at Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``Even now,'' he said, ``one of our medical residents
occasionally will tell me about seeing a patient who told him he was
taking Goody's for his health problem. The resident will look at me
and ask, `What are these things, Goody's?'''
   Because of the industry's promotion efforts, Chambers said, fewer
people ask that question these days.
   ``Everybody thought the powders would die when the older users
died off but, through our advertising and marketing, we've begun
reaching a wider market,'' Chambers said. ``Used to be, most of our
customers were rural farm people but the surveys show that the young
have begun taking headache powers.''
   Connie Watson, a 24-year-old store clerk in Salisbury, said she
became a regular user last year. ``I had a headache and didn't want
to buy a whole bottle of tables,'' she recalled. ``Now I take a
powder about every day.''
   Novices should be warned that there is an art to taking the
powders.
   ``Be sure and wash it down quick,'' Chambers said, grinning.
   Marcella Gautier can tell you this is sound advice.
   ``I never take those powders,'' she said. ``I tried one once and
like to choked to death. I found you've got to be careful not to
breathe in until you've swallowed all the powder.''

   Elvis Presley, with Memphis drawl and swiveling
hips, was one of Hollywood's ``Indian'' actors. So was Rock Hudson.
   Dame Judith Anderson, who astounded audiences as Medea and the
evil housekeeper in ``Rebecca,'' was another famous ``Indian''
actor, cast as Buffalo Cow Head in ``A Man Called Horse.''
   Today, the war paint may be off, but whites continue to play
Indians, a casting practice all too common in an industry in which
Indians comprise only a tiny percentage.
   Hollywood has long ignored accuracy and fairness in its hiring
practices, using white actors to portray blacks, Asians and
Hispanics. As far as Indian roles were concerned, all it took was a
little burnt sienna pancake, cliche costumes and cartoon accents for
white actors to be transformed into the ``red man.''
   The latest motion picture about Indians is ``War Party,'' written
by Spencer Eastman. The movie, to be released this fall by Hemdale
Films, stars Billy Wirth and Kevin Dillon as half-breeds living in
Binger, Mont., the site 100 years ago of the Milk River Battle, in
which Black Cherokees were massacred by U.S. soldiers. Wirth is part
Huron, but Dillon has no Indian blood.
   Wirth is one of the few Indian actors who have managed to get
work over the years. Others include Chief Dan George, who starred in
1971's ``Little Big Man''; Chief John Big Tree, used frequently by
John Ford; and Charles Stevens, the grandson of Geronimo who
appeared in Douglas Fairbanks Westerns.
   Roddam, who depicted British working-class kids in
``Quadrophenia'' and the plight of a black youth at a military
academy in ``Lords of Discipline,'' used a largely Indian cast in
``War Party,'' but insisted that commercial considerations became
more important when considering the leads.
   ``I took all these non-actors in,'' he said. ``I did a film test
and trained them, but in the end the studio didn't feel they had the
experience to be in a $9 million movie. If you want to make this
movie, you're going to have to compromise on the main two guys.''
   In ``War Party,'' Wirth slays a local redneck in self defense and
is forced to flee with Dillon and other Indians. They eventually
band together, vowing not to give in to the authorities.
   ``You can make a small film that no one will see like `Pow Wow
Highway,' or a larger film that a larger number of people will
see,'' Roddam said. ``At the end of the film, you're cheering for
these two Indian boys. You want them to win, you side with them. In
`Lords of Discipline,' you side with the black kid.''
   To cast his movie, Roddam consulted the American Indian Registry
for the Performing Arts, created in 1983 with the intention of
finding work for Indians in the entertainment business.
   Bob Hicks, until recently the organization's executive director,
dismissed the excuses usually given for casting non-Indians.
   ``Our numbers are so small that Hollywood has a tendency not to
take us seriously,'' he said. ``Just the fact that they went and
cast a non-Indian to play the lead because the director needed a
strong person is proof. They'll always tell us that we did look at
Indians but none of them could do the job.''
   David Wacks (``Repo Man'') traveled across the country searching
for actors to star in ``Powwow Highway,'' a critical hit that failed
at the box office earlier this year.
   ``We went to Oklahoma, Albuquerque and Sante Fe and were up in
Montana. We did casting in South Dakota, Minneapolis and Canada.
There are very, very few experienced Indian actors, and virtually
all of them are in the movie,'' he said.
   Wacks cast Gary Farmer, a Mohawk who grew up on a reservation,
and A Martinez, who is part Blackfoot, as the leads in the movie
about two Cheyennes _ Buddy Red Bow and Philbert Bono _ who travel
from their reservation in Montana to New Mexico where Buddy's sister
has been arrested for drug possession.
   ``There's more than enough talent out there _ there's a lot of
talent,'' said Farmer.
   Roddam, however, said that casting Indians to play Indians was
not absolutely necessary.
   ``It comes to the point where you say, `Do you have to have a
real killer play Charles Manson?' I was committed to portraying the
Indians in a correct way. I filmed it in a real Indian town. The
people on the reservation were just thrilled,'' he said.
   ``White liberals get very huffy about the way we portray Indians,
but the people in the town were really thrilled. ... They
appreciated that we were bringing this money into their economy.''
   Through the end of 1988, there were 170 Indians in the
70,000-member Screen Actors Guild. Blacks numbered 5,247 and
Hispanics 2,439.
   ``Certainly the guild's approach with respect to trying to remedy
this situation is the go-slow approach,'' said Rodney Mitchell, the
guild's affirmative-action coordinator. ``We try to engage the
producers in discussions and dialogue, secure their cooperation.
That's the policy.''
   Hollywood's approach has been equally slow. According to the
guild, American Indians were cast in only .3 percent of last year's
film and television roles and .1 percent of TV commercials. Mitchell
said producers don't object to lobbying for minority casting, but
don't necessarily cooperate either.
   ``What we get are comments like, `Well, you know our casting
practices are based upon First Amendment protection. You can't tell
us how to cast a film,''' he said.
   Hicks was pleased that ``Powwow Highway'' depicted Indians
without ``buckskins and feathers,'' but does not expect Hollywood to
continue the reality.
   ``They don't seem to let us get out of those stereotypes,'' he
said. ``We would like to see Indians playing doctors and lawyers and
policeman. These things are not going to change until we do our own
productions.''

   ``The only good Indian is a dead Indian.''
   Such dialogue, so odious by today's standards, was common in
Western movies a few decades ago. It stemmed from a remark
attributed to Gen. Philip H. Sheridan when he was introduced to a
Comanche chief in 1869.
   ``Me Tochoway,'' said the chief. ``Me good Indian.''
   ``The only good Indians I ever saw were dead,'' snapped Sheridan.
   The attitude of the Indian fighter was illustrated in countless
movies from 1920 to 1960. With rare exceptions, Indians were
portrayed as bloodthirsty savages who were a menace to white maidens
and America's manifest destiny.
   In the book ``The Western,'' George N. Fenin and William K.
Everson observe that film audiences seldom saw depictions of ``the
tragedy of the Indian tribes, pushed backwards and backwards again
in violation of treaties and agreements, their confinement to
reservations where unscrupulous Indian agents exploited them
shamelessly, the disintegration of their fighting spirit and their
traditional desire to live in peace with the white man.''
   'Twas not always so. Earlier in the century, movies often focused
on the ``noble savage'' with depictions of James Fennimore Cooper's
stories, the legends of Hiawatha, Pocahontas, Ramona.
   As Westerns grew more epic in scope during the 1920s, Indians
became ideal villains to maraud wagon trains, battle the cavalry and
menace the heroine with ``a fate worse than death.'' Such portrayals
continued from silent films into the talkies.
   John Ford, the greatest of Western directors, made consistent use
of the Indian menace. In his 1924 classic, ``The Iron Horse,''
railroad builders were attacked by hordes of Sioux, Pawnees and
Cheyennes. The most memorable scene of the 1939 ``Stagecoach'' was
the pursuit of the travelers by the swift-racing Indians.
   Ford's depiction of ``redskin savages'' continued in ``Fort
Apache'' (1948), ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' (1949) and ``Rio
Grande'' (1950).
   In ``The Searchers'' (1956), Natalie Wood was a white captive who
witnessed Indian atrocities and was the wife of a Comanche chief
until rescued by John Wayne.
   In his last Western, ``Cheyenne Autumn'' (1964), Ford seemed to
seek expiation for his treatment of Indians. The film traced the
bitter trek of Cheyennes from a bleak reservation in Oklahoma to
their native land in the Northwest. Critics called ``Cheyenne
Autumn'' mawkish and deplored the ``Indian'' cast of Gilbert Roland,
Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Montalban, Victor Jory and Sal Mineo.
   Such non-ethnic castings were common throughout Hollywood
history. Among the whites who portrayed Indians are: Anthony Quinn
(``The Plainsman,'' ``They Died With Their Boots On''); Rock Hudson
(``Taza, Son of Cochise''); Howard Keel (``The War Wagon''); Chuck
Connors (``Geronimo''); Linda Darnell (``Buffalo Bill''); Tony
Curtis (``The Outsider''); Julie Newmar (``McKenna's Gold'').
   Delmar Daves' ``Broken Arrow'' (1950) proved a watershed film in
Hollywood's attitude toward the Indian. James Stewart played a scout
who marries an Indian woman and sympathizes with the Apache plight.
   ``Seldom thereafter did filmmakers have the nerve to depict
Indians as if they were villains simply because they were red men,''
writes Brian Garfield in ``Western Films.''
   Despite the sympathetic view of ``Broken Arrow,'' Hollywood
casting prevailed: Jeff Chandler as Cochise, Debra Paget as the
Indian maid.
   Later years brought more films supporting the Indians' cause:
``Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here'' (1969), an Indian-turned-cowboy
deals with prejudice; ``Soldier Blue'' (1970), about two white
survivors of an Indian attack who trek across the desert; ``A Man
Called Horse'' (1970), Richard Harris' tour de force as the white
aristocrat who lives with Indians and becomes their leader; and
``Little Big Man'' (1971), a white man (Dustin Hoffman) recounts his
history with Indians.
   In the 1980s, the Western has virtually disappeared as a film
genre. But it still turns up on television, which apparently has
much to learn about the Indian image.
   Two recent miniseries, ``Lonesome Dove'' and ``Around the World
in 80 Days,'' portrayed Indians in the appalling cliche of the
savage devoted to killing as many whites as possible.

   Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' went on
sale a year ago and since then it has sold more than a million
copies, raised religious and political furor and sent the author
into hiding from assassins.
   He and his wife have split up, and no end to his predicament is
in sight.
   The extraordinary furor that engulfed much of the world following
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against the Indian-born
author has subsided to a degree, and the international writing
community is divided over whether it should go on speaking out in
his behalf or fall silent in hopes that the threat will gradually
evaporate.
   Three months after the publication of the novel on Sept. 26,
1988, Khomeini ruled it was blasphemous and imposed a death sentence
on the novelist, himself a Moslem and now a British subject, and his
publishers. Iran's Islamic fundamentalist leadership put a $5.2
million price on Rushdie's head.
   Iran's leaders say the death threat issued Feb. 14 still stands
despite Khomeini's death this past June. Rushdie, who has spent
seven months living in British-intelligence safe houses, has vowed
to continue writing while hoping for reconciliation.
   In a poem in the September issue of the British literary magazine
Granta, the 42-year-old author wrote that he had chosen ``not to
shut up. To sing on in spite of attack.''
   The copyrighted 17-line poem, titled ``6 March, 1989,'' was
written 20 days after Khomeini issued his edict.
   ``He's not free in a way a writer needs to be ... but some kind
of commitment to the truth pushes him on,'' said the British
novelist Ian McEwan. ``Nothing can stop him writing.''
   Rushdie also has been doing occasional book reviews for The
Observer, a British weekly newspaper, most recently one published
Sept. 10 of E.L. Doctorow's ``Billy Bathgate,'' a novel about the
American gangster Dutch Schultz.
   According to Tariq Ali, a friend and fellow writer, Rushdie is
not completely isolated.
   ``In one sense, he is an Iranian hostage in England,'' Ali said
in an interview. ``He meets who he wants to meet, within limits. He
talks to his friends. But the tragedy is that he cannot live at home
amongst his books, his studies and his work.''
   His wife, the American novelist Marianne Wiggins, stopped living
with him in July in what friends called ``a mutual breakup.'' Her
publishers say only that she wants to be left alone and does not
know where Rushdie now lives.
   Ms. Wiggins, who married Rushdie in 1987, had given telephone
interviews to British newspapers in which she said the couple had
moved 56 times since police took them from their London home and put
them into hiding.
   She spoke of the paranoia and isolation of their lives, where
``you can no longer pass down the street and encounter a stranger.
You lose all sense of spontaneity because you live in fear.''
   Some writers think the campaign for Rushdie should be kept on the
boil, while others say muting it would be in Rushdie's best interest.
   In an interview, novelist McEwan welcomed the dropoff in media
coverage, saying that at its height it ``made Rushdie feel more
hunted.''
   But Hans Erik Matre, chairman of the Association of Norwegian
Editors, suggested that ``publicity gives him protection.''
   Ali, who says he is in regular contact with Rushdie, said:
``Clearly he wants the affair to end. He doesn't want to do anything
to provoke the fundamentalists, but he wants people to speak up in
his favor. He knows perfectly what's at stake.''
   Josephine Pullein-Thompson, general secretary of the English
chapter of the international writers' group PEN, said: ``We support
Rushdie to the hilt, but there's no point in shouting about it. It's
the madmen you're going to stir, not the ordinary Moslems. In a way,
cooling it is a good thing.''
   The diplomatic fallout has largely settled as well. Nations of
the European Economic Community, joined by Austria, Canada, Norway
and Sweden, withdrew their envoys from Iran in protest, but nearly
all returned them within weeks.
   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Iran, and the Netherlands
recalled its ambassador again in May when President Ali Khamenei of
Iran said a bullet was still waiting for Rushdie.
   Militants among Britain's 2 million Moslems have staged
book-burning demonstrations. In India and Pakistan 26 people have
died in anti-Rushdie riots.

<HEAD>LONDON: anti-Rushdie riots.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the West, a thread of fear surfaces wherever ``The Satanic
Verses'' is concerned.
   University students in Vienna, Austria, planned a public reading
but called it off after anonymous bomb threats were made. In the
French edition of the book, the translator's name is nowhere to be
seen. The West German edition was put out by a consortium of 90
publishers, to make it harder for terrorists to identify a target.
   Assassins killed the moderate imam, or prayer leader, of a mosque
in Belgium and his aide March 29. Imam Abdullah al-Ahdal had
criticized the death sentence imposed by Khomeini.
   On Aug. 3 a bomb killed a man in a London hotel and an Islamic
group claimed the man was preparing to use the bomb against Rushdie.
   On Sept. 13, a bomb caused minor damage at a bookstore owned by
Rushdie's publisher, the Viking Penguin group, in York. The store
was closed at the time and there were no injuries. Another bomb was
defused the same day at another Viking Penguin bookstore in
Guildford.
   The office of the weekly newspaper The Riverdale Press in the
Bronx, N.Y., was firebombed Feb. 28 after publishing an editorial
defending ``The Satanic Verses.'' Two bookstores in Berkeley,
Calif., were firebombed the same day, and five stores in London were
bombed from April 9 to Sept. 3 in attacks that authorities said
could be related to the book.
   A Dutch retail chain stopped selling the book Aug. 31 after
receiving a threat, and dozens of bookstores across Westesn Europe
keep it under the counter or have refused to stock it.
   Islamic fundamentalists have said the death threat can be lifted
only if Rushdie admits he sinned and every copy of the book is
burned. Rushdie apologized Feb. 18 for any offense to Moslems, but
he refused to recant, and it is clearly too late to withdraw the
book.
   It has been on best-seller lists in the United States since its
publication and has gone into multiple printings there.
   More than 1.1 million hardback copies have been sold worldwide,
including more than 600,000 in the United States, said sources at
Viking Penguin, and translations have been published or are
appearing soon in nine European countries.
   The uproar has made it ``book of the year,'' said Remo Croce,
president of Italy's Booksellers Association. In France, it is
publisher Christian Bourgois' biggest commercial success, said an
aide.
   In Britain, the novel has been on best-seller lists for eight
months, and anti-censorship groups are anxious to see it in
paperback.
   ``If the paperback does not come out, that is creeping
censorship,'' said Frances D'Souza, director of Article 19, a
London-based free-speech organization that has collected 12,000
signatures worldwide, many from major writers, on a petition for
Rushdie.
   But Kalim Siddiqui, director of the Moslem Institute in London,
said there will be no letup in the campaign against the book.
   ``Rushdie will serve a very long life sentence protected by the
British government,'' he said in an interview. ``His own plight is a
very small part of the total misery he has caused.''
   The 46-nation Organization of Islamic Conference has banned the
book, along with India, South Africa and Kenya. Libya was the only
conference member that unequivocally supported Khomeini's death
threat. The others said Rushdie should first be tried by an Islamic
court.
   Islamic leaders say the affair has worsened the alienation of
Western Europe's 5 million Moslems. Firebombs have been thrown at
two mosques in England and ugly rumblings have come from the
European far right, demanding the expulsion of Moslems.
   Rushdie has given no interviews. Friends say he is coping well
despite the breakup of his marriage and is writing a children's book.
   ``Intellectually he is in good spirits,'' said Ali. ``He is not
cowed by the fundamentalists. ... Come what may, his book will haunt
the Islamic world forever.''

   It says something about the book put out by
William Ferris and Charles Wilson that the major complaint from
readers is that it is too heavy to read in bed. Most people don't
take an encylcopedia to bed.
   It says something, too, about the eight-pound, three-ounce
Encyclopedia of Southern Culture that not many people except for the
citizens of Fort Worth, Texas, have found much that was left out.
   Fort Worth complains because it didn't get an entry of its own,
making it appear, perhaps, less Southern than Dallas or New Orleans.
   This massive and ambitious $50, 1,600-page compendium of ``the
cultural landscape of the South'' _ exploring everything from Johnny
Cash to Moon Pies _ was published this summer.
   Even before it came out, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram carried a
piece offering a carload of mint juleps if the book would just
include Fort Worth.
   ``It was a very attractive offer,'' says Ferris, son of a soybean
farmer, now director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture
at the University of Mississippi, but in defining what constitutes
Dixie ``we had to draw the line somewhere and we basically drew it
between Fort Worth and Dallas.''
   As for the rest of the South and its institutions, folkways,
foods, burdens, icons, topics, attitudes, crops and hangups, ``to my
knowledge, there have been no real omissions,'' says Ferris.
   Which says a lot.
   Edited jointly by Ferris, a folklorist, and Charles Wilson, a
historian, and 10 years in the works (it was supposed to have taken
four), the encyclopedia has 800 contributors, including novelists,
theologians, lawyers, psychologists, historians, sociologists.
   They're specialists on everything from the role violence, race
and religion have played on the psyche of the South to the history
of the Goo Goo Cluster (``the South's favorite candy,'' it got its
name, legend says, from the first utterance of the infant son of its
creator, William H. Campbell, in 1912).
   The encyclopedia offers Billy Carter's distinction between a good
old boy and a redneck. The former rides around in a pickup drinking
beer and puts his empties in a sack; the latter rides around in a
pickup drinking beer and tossing his empties out the window.
   Ferris says the criticism he's heard most often from readers
concerned the book's size, but some critics have complained about
imbalance. Reviewer Jonathan Yardley felt there was too much Henry
Aaron, too little Willie Mays, too much Vivian Leigh, not enough
Clark Gable.
   John Egerton, author of ``Southern Food: At Home, On the Road, In
History,'' complained he couldn't find entries on Andrew Johnson,
Earl Long, Happy Chandler, Larry McMurtry or Minnie Pearl and not
enough on Southern politics and rivers.
   Never mind. The book still swarms with the stuff that makes the
South distinctive.
   The flavor is conveyed by just a smattering from the A, B and C
entries in the index:
   _A:
   Air conditioning (``Ask any southerner over 30 years of age to
explain why the South has changed in recent decades, and he may
begin with the civil rights movement or industrialization. But
sooner or later he will come around to the subject of air
conditioning.''). The Andy Griffith Show. Armadillos (come out at
night, live on insects and worms, voted in 1971 by the University of
Texas student senate to replace the longhorn as the school symbol,
but never acted upon).
   _B:
   Barbecue (``three topics upon which Southerners never agree are
religion, politics and barbecue''). The Beverly Hillbillies. The
Bible Belt. The Blues. The Boll Weevil (``During the initial
infestation many communities exclusively dependent on cotton
underwent boll weevil panics or depressions similar to other
economic depressions.'').
   Paul ``Bear'' Bryant. Burma Shave signs (``Missin' _ Kissin'? _
Perhaps Your Thrush _ Can't Get Thru _ The Underbrush _ Try _ Burma
Shave'').
   _C:
   Catfish (``Southerners have never aligned themselves as closely
with any cold-blooded creature as they have with the feline-looking
catfish.''). Chitterlings. Coca-Cola (once called ``the holy water
of the American South'').
   Company towns (``The right to occupancy was dependent upon
employment. If out on strike, or ill, or injured, a worker and his
family could be evicted on short notice.''). Confederate Memorial
Day. Congress of Racial Equality. Country Music Hall of Fame. Davy
Crockett.
   Co-editor Ferris is astonished at the encyclopedia's instant
popularity. A first printing of 15,000 sold out quickly; a second
printing is in the works.
   He thinks it says something about the country that, despite the
homogenizing effects of television, mobility, urbanity and the
Interstate highway system, interest in regionalism is taking on new
strength.
   ``A sense of being a Southerner, a New Yorker or Midwesterner
persists,'' says Ferris. ``I think Americans are realizing that
their regions are at the heart of their own identities as
Americans.''

<HEAD>Food Aid Demands Help Prompt Greater U.S. Wheat Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision to rebuild U.S. food aid reserves by
offering farmers the option of planting additional wheat for the
1990 harvest comes as global donations to hungry nations are the
smallest in six years.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced last week that
wheat farmers may, if they choose, boost plantings for 1990. Farmers
now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of their wheat
base acreage, up to a limit of 105 percent.
   ``This action is necessary to maintain our humanitarian food aid
commitments while adding slightly to U.S. carryover supplies
following two consecutive years of drought,'' Yeutter said.
   Department analysts estimated that the option will boost the 1990
wheat acreage for harvest by about 2.1 million acres to 69.6
million. Total wheat production could rise by 66 million bushels to
a projected 2.596 billion bushels next year.
   An increase of 66 million bushels due to Yeutter's decision would
be equal to 1.8 million metric tons, which would approximately
offset the 1.5 million tons of wheat authorized by the Reagan
administration to be released for donations as humanitarian food aid.
   But Yeutter said an additional 2 million metric tons has been
requested for the 1990 fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1.
   The wheat is part of a special reserve of 4 million tons
established by Congress in 1980 to help meet global emergency food
demands. It had not been tapped until President Reagan cleared the
way last October.
   According to Agriculture Department analysts, tight grain
supplies and higher prices have put financial pressure on donor
nations.
   The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization estimates
world cereal aid shipments in the 1988-89 trade year that ended June
30 dropped to below 9.8 million tons, the smallest amount since
1983-84.
   A report by the department's Economic Research Service said the
1988-89 shipments were down 25 percent from the previous year, the
sharpest one-year decline in 15 years. Even so, they were still
above the levels of shipments in the early 1980s.
   ``According to the estimates, 1988-89 was the first time in four
years that cereal aid shipments fell below the 1974 World Food
Conference target of 10 million tons,'' the report said. ``Given
continuing tight world supplies, cereal aid shipments likely will
decline again in 1989-90.''
   Cereals, mostly wheat, make up the overwhelming volume of world
food aid, the report said. The United States is the biggest donor,
accounting for 56 percent of last year's food aid total. Others
include the European Economic Community, 20 percent; Canada, 10
percent; Japan, 4 percent; and Austalia, 3 percent.
   Analysts said that some buildup in wheat stockpiles may be on the
horizon with improved weather conditions and larger plantings.
   ``Two years of stronger prices could boost foreign exporter
plantings and production,'' the report said. ``These gains should
mean that exporters will begin rebuilding stocks, that prices will
weaken and that food aid budgets will permit a somewhat larger
volume of shipments.''
   But it cautioned that world demand for grain continues to grow
and that the rebuilding process will be gradual.
   ``In the near term, the world will have only a small cushion
against a major production shock that could send prices up
sharply,'' the report said.

   General Motors Corp.'s Lakewood, Ga., assembly
plant will close in mid-March and production of the cars made there
will shift to other plants, the company said Thursday.
   The United Auto Workers union swiftly criticized the decision,
saying it ``sends a message of defeat and a message of failure'' in
GM-UAW relations.
   The plant employs about 2,200 people, 250 of whom are salaried.
About 1,000 of the employees are on indefinite layoff, a GM
statement said. Provisions are being made to ensure they get all the
benefits to which they are entitled, GM said.
   ``We want to give our employees as much time as possible to
prepare for this,'' said A.M. Beirne, head of manufacturing for GM's
Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group.
   The Lakewood plant makes the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick
Estate Wagon. The Caprice also is made at GM's Arlington, Texas,
plant. Buick spokesman Larry Gustin said the station wagon will be
built beyond mid-March, but he couldn't say where.
   ``General Motors management is not trying nearly hard enough to
fulfill its obligations under the national agreement and to source
offshore production back into domestic plants if necessary to
maintain employment here,'' said UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich,
in charge of the union's GM department.
   ``There's still time for GM to demonstrate that it truly wants a
new relationship with the union and union workers,'' Yokich said in
an apparent reference to negotiations, which will begin next summer.
   The UAW-GM national contract expires exactly a year after GM's
announcement Thursday.
   GM began producing cars at the plant in Atlanta in 1929. GM would
not comment on the production rate, but a study of automotive
capacity by Autofacts Inc. of Paoli, Pa., said the plant had a
capacity of 145,000 cars a year at a line rate of 37.75 an hour on
two shifts.
   Caprice sales through Sept. 10 of this year were 116,288, down
3.6 percent from last year. Sales of the Buick wagon were down 15
percent to 6,536 cars. As of Sept. 10, all of GM's North
American-made cars were selling at a rate 7.1 percent below last
year's.

   The government said retail sales rose a
moderate 0.7 percent in August because of strong automobile sales
but analysts foresee growing sluggishness in the remainder of the
year.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales increased to a
seasonally adjusted $144.3 billion in August following a 0.5 percent
gain in July. Sales had remained flat in June after rising 0.8
percent in May.
   Analysts said the report was consistent with the so-called
``soft-landing'' scenario sought by the Federal Reserve as it moves
to keep inflation under control while permitting continued, but
slower, economic growth.

<HEAD>Strong Growth in World Trade Expected to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The volume of world merchandise trade is expected
to increase by about 7 percent in 1989 and growth will likely remain
strong in the next few years, the organization that sponsors
trade-liberalizing agreements said today.
   In an optimistic report, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade said technological progress, the fall in the price of oil and
new national economic policies were among factors behind
``unexpectedly high'' recent growth in international commerce.
   It said trade in services such as tourism and banking had grown
even faster than merchandise trade during the 1980s and reached an
estimated value of about $560 billion last year.
   Merchandise exports were worth an estimated $2.88 trillion in
1988, 14.5 percent higher than the previous year. The volume of
goods traded increased by 8.5 percent, a record for the 1980s, the
report said.
   Despite the expansion in world trade, many Third World countries
suffered a drop in export earnings during the decade, the report
said.
   It warned that the world's poorest countries can no longer rely
on exports of commodities, which account for three-quarters of their
foreign exchange, to fuel economic growth.
   Examining the reasons for the expansion of international
commerce, GATT said one factor was technological innovations that
have increased the scope of goods and services that can be traded on
world markets.
   The halving of the price of oil since the 1980 peak, the rising
share of manufactured products in trade, and the increase in the
number of international mergers were also responsible, the report
said.
   Economic reforms in the Soviet Union and China, relatively low
inflation in Western countries, deregulation of business and freeing
of capital movements further combined to boost world trade and open
up international markets, the report said.
   In the longer term, GATT predicted the world economy ``may have
entered a period in which the average growth rates for output and
trade ... will be higher than they have been since the onset of
economic difficulties in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.''
   GATT spokesman David Woods said this forecast covered the next
five to 10 years.
   The 97 nations that belong to the trade forum account for over
four-fifths of world trade. Bolivia became a member of GATT last
month.

   Five activists chained themselves to a banister
at the New York Stock Exchange to protest the high cost of AZT, a
drug used to treat AIDS.
   Three of the five, members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, were described as having AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   According to Sharon Gamsin, vice president for media relations at
the exchange, the incident occurred at the start of trading
Thursday, 9:30 a.m.
   The five, dressed as floor traders and wearing fake brokerage
firm IDs, chained themselves to a banister of a balcony overlooking
the exchange floor.
   There, they unfurled a banner that read, ``SELL WELLCOME'' _ a

   Ms. Gamsin said the five were removed by guards and turned over
to police. ``We will file charges against them,'' she said.
   She noted that Burroughs Wellcome is traded over the counter, not
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Federal studies have found that AZT is effective in slowing the
course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but it costs $8,000
to $10,000 a year.
   Burroughs Wellcome is the sole manufacturer of the drug, and
company officials have said the high price is necessary to pay for
manufacturing and for research.

<HEAD>Ford Says New Truck Production Heading to Ky. Truck Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. says it will move production of its
Cargo line of medium- and heavy-duty trucks from Brazil to its
Kentucky Truck plant near Louisville.
   The company also said Thursday it plans to spend three times as
much on its North American heavy-truck business over the next five
years than it did in the previous five years.
   Spokesman D.W. Haines said the company would provide no figures
because of competitive reasons.
   Edward Hagenlocker, a vice president and general manager of Ford
Truck Operations, made the announcements at the North American Ford
Heavy Truck Annual Dealer meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia,
according to a news release received in Detroit.
   He said production of the Cargo trucks at the Kentucky truck
plant would start in the last three months of next year. The company
said it would continue its current production at the plant along
with Cargo production, bringing total production to about 70,000
vehicles a year.
   The 2,000-employee work force will not change with the addition
of the Cargo trucks, Haines said.
   Cargo line trucks also are made in Australia and the United
Kingdom, but none of their production is for the U.S. market.
   On Wednesday, Ford announced it would move production of its
Ranger light pickup from the Louisville Plant, which is near the
Kentucky Truck plant, to Edison, N.J., to make way for a new
two-door and four-door Explorer sport-utility vehicle that will
replace the Bronco II.

<HEAD>House Panel Backs Bill Aimed at Ozone-Depleting Chemical Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee has agreed
to legislation that would siphon off $4.3 billion over five years
from profits of companies making ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The provision, approved Thursday, was added to a tax and
entitlement bill.
   The Bush administration has sought such a revenue-raising measure
because it targets windfall profits that chemical firms could earn
after an international treaty reduces supplies of
chlorofluorocarbons.
   The so-called CFC's destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere
and increase the risk of skin cancer. There is similar language
pending before the Senate.
   The proposal, which the Ways and Means panel labels a ``tax on
ozone-depleting chemicals,'' would bring in an estimated $362
million in the 1990 fiscal year, while revenues in the following
four years were put, respectively, at $614 million, $753 million,
$1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. The tax would become effective Jan. 1.
   The chemical industry denies there will be windfall profits after
the United States begins implementing the Montreal Protocol, a 1987
international agreement to cut production of CFC's
   The theory behind the tax is that demand will far outstrip supply
once production is frozen at 1986 levels. The protocol requires that
by 1998, production can be only 50 percent of the 1986 figures.
   The five manufacturers of CFC's are developing substitutes, but
they are reportedly three to five years away from production.

<HEAD>Business Group Alleges Budget Cuts Are Mostly Phony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. business leaders have called on Congress
and the Bush administration to end what the group charged was a
budget charade and begin work on a realistic effort to cut the
federal deficit.
   The Committee for Economic Development, composed of executives
from some of the country's top corporations, issued a report
Thursday that charged that the bipartisan budget agreement between
President Bush and Congress ``dodged the important budgetary issues
and made little substantive and lasting improvement in the outlook
for the deficit.''
   That agreement, covering the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1, is
designed to meet the legal target of reducing the budget deficit
from an expected $150 billion this year down to $100 billion in 1990.
   But the committee's report charged that more than one-third of
the projected savings in the bipartisan agreement were composed of
``one-time savings, accounting gimmicks and other smoke and mirrors
that merely improve the appearances of the budget.''
   The report, titled ``Battling America's Budget Deficits,'' also
called for trimming Social Security and Medicare, saying that
significant deficit reductions could not be made unless these huge
middle-class entitlement programs were scaled back.
   Roy Ash, head of the Office of Management and Budget in the Nixon
administration and a member of the panel which prepared the CED
report, said that official Washington was currently ``obfuscating,
misleading and deceiving the public'' about the deficit crisis
facing the country.
   The committee proposed a program to trim the deficit by $40
billion to $50 billion each year through a combination of budget
cuts and unspecified tax hikes. Members of the group said they took
no stand on which taxes to increase because they could not reach
consensus, although some said they favored creation of a
consumption-based tax such as the Value Added Tax used by many
European nations.
   The recommendations of the group were being presented to OMB
Director Richard Darman and congressional budget leaders, according
to Robert Holland, president of the CED and a former member of the
Federal Reserve Board.
   Holland complained that the country's deficit woes were not as
dominant in the news currently as they were a few years ago, even
though the problem is far from being solved.
   ``The deficit problem today rarely makes front page news,'' he
said. ``The result is that few people care deeply about the issue
and our political system feels little pressure to tackle it
effectively.''
   The Committe for Economic Development is a non-profit research
group composed of 250 business and education leaders.

<HEAD>Lawn and Garden Industry Looks To Boom In 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawn and garden industry has to be
nimble to deal with fickle weather _ drought last year wilted
national sales 11 percent to $15.5 billion _ but retailers are
poised for fast growth in the 1990s, experts say.
   In trend-setting California, lawn and garden sales grew 9 percent
to $3.8 billion in 1988, and part of the reason was a switch by
homeowners to plants and irrigation systems that use less water.
   ``Weather is the primary factor that affects this industry and
it's something the industry has no control over,'' said Charles W.
Dunn, founder of the Garden Center Institute in Atlanta, during a
visit to the huge Pacific Horticultural Trade Show here.
   ``Rain drenched the Southeast and East this summer and hurt
sales. But there are some shifts occurring out there in the
marketplace, and the future looks bright,'' Dunn said.
   ``The Baby Boom generation,'' he said, ``is probably the best
segment of the marketplace out there for gardening, and it's going
to drive this industry into the 1990s, along with the `50-50'
generation _ people who are 50 years old and have a $50,000-plus
annual income.''
   As the Baby Boomers, approaching or just over 40, become more
established in homes, they are spending more money to spruce up
gardens and lawns for both enjoyment and investment.
   ``We did a nationwide study and found new homeowners felt that a
well-landscaped home could add up to 15 percent of real estate
value,'' Dunn said. ``It was as good or better investment as
remodeling the kitchen or bath when it came time to sell that home.''
   Limited garden space and a new influx of immigrants also are
having an impact on garden suppliers. The nursery of the '90s is
likely to sell more container plants, dwarf trees and fruit trees
popular in Asia and the Middle East.
   ``We're selling more dwarf citrus trees, which don't take up as
much space and bear a `manageable' amount of fruit for today's
smaller family,'' said Don Dillon Jr. of Four Winds Nursery in
Fremont.
   Garden suppliers, Dunn said, report four types of landscapes
increasingly being installed at American homes:
   _An area for public view that looks good but requires low
maintenance.
   _A grassy play area for children with less emphasis on flowers.
   _An entertainment area with movable furniture.
   _The garden retreat, where people can sit and read or just get
away from it all, integrating water, flowers, rocks, bridges and
exotic furniture.
   But no matter which landscape is selected, thought has to be
given to water use and cyclical bouts of heat and drought.
   Gardening tips being distributed at many retail nurseries teach
homeowners how to conserve water and maintain landscapes through
proper design, grouping of plant material, correct planting methods
and mulching, as well as water-saving practices.
   Among the products on display at the Pacific Horticultural Trade
Show are several that save water: crystals that hold water like tiny
reservoirs around the roots of plants, root sponges that reduce
watering after transplanting, drip irrigation systems, and planters
that have built-in reservoirs and moisture control sensors that turn
the watering function on and off as needed.

<HEAD>Battered Junk Bond Market Awaits Campeau's Next Move</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battered junk bond market is anxiously
waiting to see whether Campeau Corp. can snatch its prime retail
operations from the precipice of default.
   Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. is scheduled to make a
loan payment today reported to be in the $50 million range, but
Campeau needs an outside infusion of cash to prevent a default.
   In the junk bond market, where trading of the high-yield,
high-risk securities took a gut-wrenching hit earlier this week,
``everybody is looking to see how Campeau gets out of this mess,
because it could have a big effect on everything,'' said John Moran,
a trader at Advest Inc.
   Admissions that both Federated and Campeau's Allied Stores Corp.
units could default on their debt payments triggered a broad junk
bond selloff earlier this week that spread to issues regarded as
among the most stable and attractive.
   Critics have long contended that junk bonds, typically used to
finance expensive, highly leveraged takeovers, were ripe for a fall.
The thinking goes that companies would default on interest payments
either because they would be unable to sell divisions at the heady
prices they anticipated or because cash flows would not live up to
expectations.
   Robert Campeau, head of the Toronto-based real estate and retail
concern, was scrambling to line up financing from Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. to pay the debt.
   Any success in getting more financing for Allied and Federated,
which are in dire need of credit so they can stock up on inventory
ahead of the Christmas shopping season, would help not only to prop
up those precarious issues but the junk market in general.
   Traders fear that if the market is widely perceived as too risky
and unstable, investors will dump their holdings.
   ``If too many people start jumping on the band wagon, the
(junk-bond) mutual fund managers are not going to have enough cash
to cover redemptions, and they're going to be forced to blow out of
their positions,'' one observer said.
   So far traders said they had not detected any significant selling
by mutual funds that invest in junk bonds.
   Moran said managers ``are studying the situation'' and are not
likely to act hastily. ``Besides, the whole thing is up in the
air,'' he said, noting that Campeau could succeed in its
restructuring plans.
   While some market experts said this week's selloff was
particularly significant because more stable, attractive issues fell
in tandem with distressed bonds, others contend the downturn was due.
   Robert Levine, president of Kidder Peabody High Yield Asset
Management, characterized the decline as more of a ``technical
correction'' because prices had been on the upswing recently.
Furthermore, there has been no change in the credit quality of most
companies, he said.
   Yields quoted on some Allied and Federated issues have soared
well above 25 percent to compensate for heightened risk.
   But, said Anthony Naylor, a senior vice president at Rodman &amp;
Renshaw Inc., ``When a bond is trading at a 25 percent yield, it
means they're not going to pay.''
   Campeau used billions of dollars from the sale of junk bonds to
finance its $8.8 billion takeover of Federated last year. Not only
did he pay top dollar for the retail company, but a stagnant
consumer market dashed his plans for relying on cash flow to pay
down the debt.
   Last week, Campeau put its flagship Bloomingdale's department
store chain on the auction block in an effort to raise cash.

<HEAD>Milken Lawyers Ask Court To Force Government To Stop Alleged Leaks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken's lawyers say they aren't picking
a fight with the press in an attempt to squelch alleged leaks by
government prosecutors in the highly publicized securities fraud and
racketeering case.
   In court papers filed this week, lawyers for the former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. high-yield bond division leader claim that ``a
constant stream'' of press leaks is threatening Milken's right to a
fair trial.
   The motion asks U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to order the
government to stop leaking confidential material, hold a hearing to
identify the sources of the leaks, punish the leakers and make
public a confidential Securities and Exchange Commission memo
written about in The Washington Post.
   No members of the media would be called at any hearing on the
motion because ``we are not interested in confrontations with the
press,'' the motion adds.
   The lawyers claim the government has turned confidential grand
jury proceedings into ``a spectator sport'' by releasing information
about the Milken probe repeatedly over the last three years to
pressure witnesses and other possible targets to cooperate.
   The motion, filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, claims
the alleged leaking ``flatly violates'' federal criminal regulations
and other legal and ethical rules requiring confidentiality in
government investigations.
   ``We are asking the court to stop the government from continuing
its leaking and to punish those government officials responsible,''
Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Milken, said Thursday.
   A hearing to ferret out media leaks would not be unprecedented.
The motion cites the 1980 bank fraud case of former Carter
administration budget director Bert Lance, in which a federal
appeals court ordered such a hearing.
   Though the Milken motion seeks to exclude reporters, ``Motions
like this have the potential for leading to First Amendment
confrontations with the press,'' according to one prominent First
Amendment attorney, who asked not to be identified.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were charged March 29 in a 98-count fraud and racketeering
indictment that alleges insider trading, securities law violations
and other crimes in the broadest action of the government's Wall
Street crackdown. They pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial is
set.
   Milken was first named in news reports as the government's main
target shortly after now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky agreed
to cooperate with prosecutors in late 1986.
   Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advance
details of the government's investigation and indictment plans,
including the charges.
   The Milken motion cites stories published in The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles
Times about the case quoting ``sources close to the investigation''
or ``people familiar with the government's investigation.''
   Roger May, spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., which owns The
Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper does not comment on its
sourcing policies.
   ``Our job is to try to find out what people are doing. That's
what we do, added Martin Baron, business editor of The Los Angeles
Times.
   The 31-page motion states that, ``The government has presented _
and is continuing to present _ its case to the grand jurors as much
through the pages of the daily papers as through the testimony of
witnesses in the grand jury room.''
   The document cites three recent stories in the Post based on a
confidential May 1988 SEC report containing details of secret
testimony of government witnesses, and other articles specifying the
contents of a new Milken indictment expected in October.
   The leaks are the result of ``decisions by some in the government
to use publicity as a prosecutorial weapon, carefully timing the
disclosures to `pressure' defendants, witnesses and those under
investigation,'' the motion states.
   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the memo. The U.S.
attorney's said it would respond to the motion in court.

<HEAD>Breeden: SEC Staff Needs More Money to Remain Competitive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard C. Breeden, President Bush's choice for
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, pledges to crack
down hard on inside traders but says his No. 1 problem is improving
the pay of the agency's staff.
   The nominee told senators at his confirmation hearing Thursday
that he would ``absolutely'' continue the SEC's current efforts ``to
root fraud out of the securities markets.''
   But Breeden also said pay increases for SEC staffers were
necessary to attract new talent and cut the agency's high turnover
rate.
   ``I don't know of any single issue facing the commission today
that is more important than our ability to maintain the caliber and
the quality of the staff,'' Breeden said.
   The starting salary for an SEC staff attorney is $27,130 _ well
below what a top law school graduate can make at a Wall Street law
firm, SEC officials said.
   In a morning-long hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and
Urban Affairs Committee, Breeden, who once headed a task force on
deregulation of the financial industry, said he believed in free,
competitive markets.
   But, he added, ``Free markets don't work if investors or
participants believe they are dominated by fraud or corruption.''
   The committee will decide if Breeden's nomination should be
recommended to the full Senate.
   ``I think you can do an exceptional job, but it won't be easy,''
said Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., adding that he
intended to vote for Breeden's confirmation.
   After the hearing, Riegle told reporters he expected a
confirmation vote would come ``in a few days.''
   Riegle noted Breeden still had to supply detailed answers to
written questions posed by the committee staff.
   Breeden, a White House aide who helped write the legislation to
bail out the nation's savings and loan industry, was tapped by Bush
for the SEC post last month.
   At the time, Riegle and other senators expressed skepticism about
the banking lawyer's experience in the securities industry.
   But the promised public grilling of the nominee never
materialized, apparently due to Breeden's impressive performance in
private meetings with committee members earlier this week.
   Several senators remarked about those private meetings in
praising Breeden's intelligence and candor during the hearing.
   Breeden told Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., that it's ``a
perfectly legitimate role of government to keep the markets clean.''
He said that would restore individual investors' confidence in the
markets and attract foreign investment.
   When Riegle expressed hope that wrongdoers would find Breeden a
``fair but tough cop on the beat,'' Breeden replied, ``Certainly, if
I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, under my leadership that will
be the case.''
   Breeden appeared relaxed but cautious as he answered committee
members' questions, constantly asserting that his views were his own
and he couldn't speak for the SEC.
   He said the $200 billion junk bond market ``is worth the careful
attention of the commission'' although he was ``not suggesting
there's any particular problem in the market today.''
   Breeden also said he didn't think the SEC had been
``overzealous'' in its pursuit of insider trading and said the
charges against the investment banking giant Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. were for more than ``harmless technical problems.''
   He said the SEC and the rival Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should remain separate agencies and called for a better
working relationship, including staff exchanges, with the CFTC,
which has disputed the SEC jurisdiction over some new financial
instruments that have elements of both securities and futures
contracts.

<HEAD>Lexus and Infiniti Bear Watching, Cadillac Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cadillac should hang on to its share
of the luxury car market in 1990 despite the entry of two Japanese
luxury car lines this year, the division's general manager says.
   John Grettenberger also said Thursday that the popularity of
Nissan's Infiniti line and Toyota's Lexus cars would be watched
closely by Cadillac officials.
   Lexus cars officially went on sale Sept. 1, but some had been
sold before they arrived in showrooms. Infiniti's two models go on
sale Nov. 8.
   ``We're not taking it lightly at all,'' Grettenberger said during
Cadillac's 1990 introduction. ``I'm not surprised that Cadillac
owners are susceptible.''
   A survey by Thomas O'Grady of Integrated Automotive Resources
Inc. in Wayne, Pa., showed that of 200 people who bought Lexus cars
during the first month of sale, 12.2 percent of them traded in
Cadillacs and 6.1 percent switched from Lincolns.
   Early predictions by Lexus officials forecast that about 10
percent of the cars traded in on their two models would be Cadillacs
or Lincolns. Many more people would trade in European luxury cars,
including Mercedes and BMW, and others would step up to Lexus from
other Toyota-made cars, they said.
   Infiniti's two cars will be in about 50 Infiniti dealers on Nov.
8. Dave Hubbard, Infiniti's national advertising director, said
Thursday the division had not predicted the kinds of cars that would
be traded in.
   However, he added, Infiniti had a long-range goal of capturing
buyers moving into the luxury segment for the first time.
   Grettenberger said it was understandable that a large percentage
of trade-ins would be Cadillacs since Cadillac is the largest player
in the luxury car market, holding about 26.8 percent of it.
   ``There's no question that the newest products from Japan will
represent formidable competition,'' Grettenberger said.
   Cadillac's base prices for 1990 range from $26,960 to $36,980
with the Allante's prices at $50,900 for the new convertible-only
version at $50,900 and $56,533 for the model with a removable
hardtop, the same price as last year.
   Lexus' two cars carry base prices of $21,050 and $35,000, and
Infiniti cars cost $23,500 and $38,000.
   ``They've done a very good job of preparing the market for the
car,'' Grettenberger said of Lexus. ``It will be interesting to see
if they can maintain this level over the next couple of months.''
   Lexus has forecast annual sales of about 75,000 cars, about
one-fourth Cadillac's prediction. Hubbard said Infiniti would make
no sales projections for the first year.
   Grettenberger said he expected Cadillac to continue to command
the lion's share of the luxury car market. holding on to its 26.8
percent share.
   Asked where Lexus and Infiniti would get their buyers,
Grettenberger said they most likely would come from the European
makers.
   ``Luxury car buyers like to buy new things,'' he said.
   For 1990, Cadillac has kept the basic exterior designs of its
entire line. It is introducing the convertible Allante, adding a
traction control system for the two-seater.
   It also is putting more powerful engines in the De Ville,
Fleetwood, Seville and Eldorado models. In addition, Cadillac is
making other changes in all its cars, none of which will affect how
the vehicles look.

   The Washington Public Power Supply System's
executive board has approved the sale of $721.4 million in refunding
bonds for two mothballed nuclear power plants.
   The supply system had planned to offer $450 million worth of
high-interest bonds for resale, but demand resulted in the higher
offering.
   The bonds will be sold over the next several weeks. The executive
board acted Thursday.
   Investors will be offered tax-exempt bonds with annual yields
ranging from 6.25 percent to 7.7 percent, with the long-range bonds
maturing as far in the future as the year 2015.
   The bonds are secured by agreements that obligate payment by the
Bonneville Power Administration.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to refund bonds sold in 1981
and 1982 and carrying interest rates as high as 15 percent.
   The supply system plans to refinance a total of about $2 billion
in bonds sold to pay for construction on plants Nos. 1 and 3, both
of which have been mothballed unfinished.
   WPPSS also wants to refinance about $800 million in high-interest
bonds for plant No. 2, which is operating.
   The supply system estimates annual savings from the entire
refunding package will be $70 million to $80 million annually.
   The No. 1 and No. 2 plants are at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in Eastern Washington; No. 3 is at Satsop, west of Olympia.

   Kroger Co., the grocery store chain operator,
says it expects to reap $260 million in aftertax proceeds from the
sale of nine food processing plants and two more whose sales are
under negotiation.
   Kroger said Thursday it would sell the plants as part of a $4.6
billion corporate restructuring begun last fall to stave off two
unsuccessful takeover attempts.
   Cincinnati-based Kroger owns supermarkets, convenience stores and
food processing plants in 32 states.
   Company officials said Thursday they had signed a letter of
intent to sell eight of the plants to a corporation to be formed by
New York City businessman Eli S. Jacobs of New York and Engles
Capital Corp., of Dallas, Texas.
   The eight plants are North Coast Bakery, of Cleveland; Delight
Products, of Springfield, Tenn.; Kenlake Foods, Murray, Ky.; Pontiac
Foods, Pontiac, S.C.; State Avenue plant, Cincinnati; Tara Foods,
Albany, Ga.; K.B. Specialty Foods, Greensburg, Ind.; and Pace Dairy,
Rochester, Minn.
   The eight plants' new owner will offer jobs to the plants'
current employees and also may employ some manufacturing personnel
now working in Kroger's Cincinnati headquarters offices, Kroger said.
   Kroger officials said the deal, to be concluded by mid-November,
includes an agreement to continue offering Kroger's private-label
products.
   In a separate transaction, Kroger said it has agreed to sell its
Meadowland Creamery in Conroe, Texas, to Borden Inc.
   The remaining two plants, Kroger's Gateway Bakery and Heartland
Farms Dairy, both in St. Louis, are under consideration by separate
buyers, Kroger said.
   Negotiations are under way for the bakery with Alpha Baking Co.
of Chicago, while an unidentified party is bargaining for the dairy,
Kroger said.

   The Pentagon's chief supplier of hydraulic
aircraft landing gear has agreed to repay the government about $1.4
million in contract overcharges for the Air Force's largest
transport plane.
   The government claimed that labor charges on a $6.7 million
contract were twice as high as original estimates by the company,
Curtiss-Wright of Ridgefield, N.J., said U.S. Attorney Samuel A.
Alito Jr.
   The contract was for 60 spare landing gear actuators that control
landing gear, flaps and other moveable exterior systems on the Air
Force's Lockheed C-5A Galaxy.
   Alito said the company's failure to provide Air Force auditors
with labor standards and data on the company's internal cost
estimates ``led to a gross inflation of the labor costs.''
   Curtiss-Wright has denied any wrongdoing. Attempts to reach
corporate officials after the settlement was announced Thursday
evening were unsuccessful and the switchboard at the company's
headquarters was closed.
   The government contends Curtiss-Wright's contract was based on a
company estimate of 46,000 labor hours for the contract. Alito said
investigators found the contract was completed in 23,000 hours.
   ``The company's failure to live up to its certification with
respect to the C-5A flight actuators subjected it to civil
liability,'' Alito said in a statement.
   Under the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era statute aimed at
wartime profiteers, the government can demand reimbursement when it
can prove a contractor was not negotiated in good faith. The act was
further bolstered in 1986 by amendments that allow the government to
claim triple damages and apply large fines.
   Alito said the claims were not part of criminal or civil court
proceedings but were the result of a preliminary investigation by
his office and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, an arm of
the U.S. Defense Department.

   Bruce G. Allbright plans to retire early next
year as president and a director of Dayton Hudson Corp., the
retailer said Thursday.
   Allbright, 60, has been president of the Minneapolis-based
corporation for two years. He will retire from that position and as
a director on Feb. 1, 1990, at the end of the corporation's fiscal
year.
   Allbright was elected president of the corporation in September
1987 after having been chairman and chief executive officer of its
Target discount store division since 1984. He joined Dayton Hudson
in 1971 as president and chief executive of its B. Dalton Bookseller
unit.
   He left Dayton Hudson in late 1981 to join F.W. Woolworth Co. as
chairman and chief executive officer but returned to the company the
next year.
   Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson chairman and CEO, praised
Allbright's contributions. ``He was very influential in the speeding
up of Target's growth and its entry into the key West Coast
markets,'' Macke said.
   Macke also announced the election of Stephen E. Watson as
executive vice president of the corporation. Watson has been with
Dayton Hudson since 1973.
   Watson, 44, has been chairman and CEO of Dayton Hudson Department
Store Co. since 1985. He will continue to hold those positions.
   Dayton Hudson has about 135,000 employees in its Target, Mervyn's
and Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. divisions and operates 675
stores in 38 states.

<TEXT>
   The former head of Ashland Oil Inc. has pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud for his role in a scheme to try
to sell confidential company documents.
   Orin Atkins, 65, of North Palm Beach, Fla., entered the plea in
U.S. District Court on Thursday. He faces a maximum of 10 years in
prison and a $500,00 fine when sentenced Nov. 16.
   An attorney whose firm once worked for Ashland was indicted
Thursday for his alleged role in the same scheme.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said Atkins and the lawyer, Charles
D. Barnett, were involved in a secret scheme to defraud Ashland by
attempting to sell confidential papers to the National Iranian Oil
Co., which was involved in a dispute with Ashland.
   The documents dealt with the 1979 sale of $283 million in crude
oil from the Iranian company to Ashland Overseas Trading Ltd., a
Ashland subsidiary in Bermuda. Court papers said Ashland never paid
for the oil.
   Atkins was Ashland's chairman and chief executive from 1974 to
1981. He was a consultant to Ashland, earning $425,000 a year, from
1981 to 1984.
   In 1982, while he was a paid consultant, Atkins received about
260 privileged documents about the oil sale through an unidentified
Ashland employee, Romano said.
   According to the indictment against Barnett, Atkins and Barnett
made repeated attempts from 1982 to 1988 to sell the documents and
Atkins' consulting services to the Iranian company. They had planned
to use a Swiss bank account to receive their payment, it said.
   As compensation, Atkins and Barnett asked for 25 percent of the
Iranian company's recovery from Ashland, the indictment alleged.
   In court Thursday, Atkins said the deal was never finalized
although representatives of the Iranian company were allowed to view
the documents in 1985.
   After seeing the papers, the National Iranian Oil Co. sued
Ashland and Ashland Overseas for payment on the oil. Those suits,
filed in Mississippi and Bermuda, were settled last week when
Ashland agreed to pay $325 million, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Herve Gouraige.
   Neither Ashland or National Iranian Oil Co. were charged with any
wrongdoing. Romano praised the cooperation of Ashland in the
investigation.
   Barnett, 38, of Palm Beach, Fla., was charged with conspiracy and
six counts of wire fraud. If convicted, he faces five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.
   He was not in custody and was scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 21.
An earlier complaint charging Barnett and former Ashland vice
president Charles Dugan with interstate transportation of stolen
property was dismissed during the investigation that led to the
latest charges.
   Barnett was identifed as a former partner in the law firm of
Barnett &amp; Alagia, based in Louisville, Ky., with offices around the
country. The indictment said the firm represented Ashland in certain
legal matters while Atkins was chairman.
   Gouraige declined to discuss why the earlier complaint against
Barnett and Dugan was dismissed.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Announces Restructuring, Early Retirement for 1,000
Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. has launched a
restructuring program that will trim as many as 1,200 managers from
the workforce despite years of steady profit growth.
   The regional telephone company announced Thursday it would offer
early retirement incentives aimed at cutting 1,000 to 1,200 managers
and said it is also considering several financial moves such as
refinancing some debts and revaluing spare parts inventories.
   The reorganization will lead to the company's first quarterly
drop in profit since it was created in 1984 by the breakup of
American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
   Bell Atlantic will break even or make a small profit in the
fourth quarter, officials said. For the same period last year, the
company made $1.53 per share.
   In the second quarter of this year, the company's net income rose
4.9 percent to $360.8 million, or $1.84 per share.
   ``We think the time to change is when you're doing well,'' said
Dennis Mollura, Bell Atlantic spokesman. ``If you wait until things
go bad, it's too late.''
   ``In a very real sense we are laying the groundwork for the Bell
Atlantic of the future,'' Raymond W. Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman
and chief executive, said in a news release.
   Managers will be offered cash incentives and pension benefits to
retire early, the company said.
   The company will eliminate one level of management, based in
Washington, overseeing the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone
companies in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington. The
four telephone companies will report directly to Anton J.
Campanella, Bell Atlantic president.
   Duties at the Chesapeake and Potomac headquarters will be
absorbed by other units and the employees will be reassigned, Bell
Atlantic spokesman Kenneth A. Pitt said.
   Several internal operations such as office planning, the motor
pool, real estate management and administrative services will be
centralized.
   ``While change always will be with us, we expect this will be the
last major reorganization for the foreseeable future,'' Campanella
said.
   The company is considering seeking lower interest rates on debts
owed by Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Companies in Maryland and
West Virginia and by Diamond State Telephone in Delaware.
   Other possible moves include revaluations of spare parts in its
computer maintenance business and reducing the book value of its
assets of smaller subsidiaries.
   The moves would decrease earnings in one quarter but give a
``slight lift'' to earnings in 1990, said Philip A. Campbell, Bell
Atlantic chief financial officer.
   Pitt said the recent three-week strike by members of the
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers against Bell Atlantic played no part in the
restructuring decision or its timing.
   Bell Atlantic's seven subsidiaries are Bell of Pennsylvania, New
Jersey Bell, Diamond State Telephone in Delaware and the Chesapeake
and Potomac companies in Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.

<TEXT>
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox usurped federal
authority and picked on Quaker Oats Co. by suing it for false
advertising, according to the cereal maker's countersuit against the
state.
   The Quaker suit, filed a week after Mattox sued the Chicago-based
company, accuses the attorney general and Texas Health Commissioner
Robert Bernstein of violating Quaker's rights to freedom of speech
and equal protection under the law.
   Mattox claimed the country's No.1 maker of hot cereal misleads
consumers through advertising claims that its product can help
reduce the risk of heart disease by helping lower cholesterol.
   Quaker's suit, filed Thursday, asks a federal judge to declare
Quaker's advertising truthful and to prevent Mattox from interfering.
   It also asks for unspecified damages, noting Quaker's name ``has
come to be recognized by consumers as signifying wholesome and
nutritious food products, and is accorded very high consumer loyalty
and brand recognition.''
   Mattox's suit, originally filed in state district court, was
switched to federal court with the filing of Quaker's suit.
   ``It doesn't matter to us whether we win this case in state court
or federal court,'' said Mattox spokesman Ron Dusek in Austin. ``It
doesn't matter if they counter-sue or shoot off a cannon. We're
going to prove that they illegally misrepresented their product in
their advertising.''
   The Quaker suit claims Mattox's action violates federal antitrust
laws, places unlawful restraints on interstate commerce and puts
Quaker at a competitive disadvantage.
   ``There are several competitors of Quaker Oats, both national and
regional, that are selling food products containing oats or oat bran
and who are making similar or stronger claims for their products,''
Quaker vice president Luther C. McKinney said. ``Yet, the attorney
general has selectively challenged only Quaker Oats' advertising.''
   The Quaker suit also cites examples of several studies indicating
bran is effective in reducing serum cholesterol, thereby reducing
the risk of heart attack.
   Since last week, Quaker has repeatedly noted that its ads were
approved by the Federal Trade Commission.
   But, Dusek said lax regulation and protection of consumers ``is
why the states ... took it upon themselves to form task forces to
deal with problems that the federal government has decided it
doesn't want to deal with.''
   Texas has led nine other states in policing truth-in-advertising
and other consumer protection areas.
   Other targets have included Sara Lee Corp., Chrysler Corp. and
Carnation Co., all of which deny they have used misleading
advertising or violated consumer protection laws.
   Quaker's suit also attacks this coalition, claiming it is an
unconstitutional ``compact'' among states and promotes ``the
political ambitions of the attorneys general by publicizing their
actions.''

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Bank to List on New York Stock Exchange Next Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. next week will become the first Japanese
bank to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and also will rank
as the largest foreign company traded on the Big Board, published
reports said Friday.
   Mitsubishi, the world's fourth-largest bank, will be the ninth
Japanese company to be listed on the NYSE, according to the New York
Times.
   American investors will be allowed to trade more than two billion
Mitsubishi shares, which initially will trade in the form of
American depository receipts, the paper said.
   The move marks the first attempt by a Japanese bank to raise
money in the American capital markets, which some Wall Street
observers have predicted would be a growing trend, the paper said.
   The major Japanese banks are under pressure to raise $35 billion
over the next four years in order to comply with new capital
requirements that the world's leading central banks have set for
international banks.
   The Times noted that Japanese banks had not been expected to
resort to the New York Stock Exchange to raise capital because they
would have to meet Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure
requirements as well as alter their accounting practices. But
Mitsubishi has met the requirements.
   In Tokyo, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the
listing would be made on Sept. 19.
   Established in 1919, Mitsubishi had assets totalling about $343.2
billion and net income of $1.15 billion for the fiscal year ended
March 31, according to a company report.
   The Tokyo-based bank has 245 domestic offices and 37 overseas
affiliates in 24 countries.
   Mitsubishi and Japanese government officials were not available
for comment Friday, which was a national holiday in Japan.

   The stock market turned upward today, getting
support from unexpectedly favorable economic news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.08 to 2,670.97 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 406 down and
568 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 78.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour,''
involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   There had been concern that professional traders engaged in
multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the
market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks.
   But at the opening the market absorbed whatever pressure resulted
from the witching hour, with a big assist from the latest data on
the state of the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third
consecutive monthly decline.
   And the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $8.01
billion in June.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Merck, up ] at 70};
American Express, up \ at 36[; General Motors, up ] at 48~, and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up [ at 40].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.31 to 191.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .16 at 381.10.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.63 to
2,664.89, bringing its loss over the past two sessions to 42.37
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 387 up, 1,112 down and 459 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 149.25 million shares, down from 175.33
million in the previous session.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. has emerged as the
most likely buyer of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s theme parks as
talks intensified between the two companies this week, according to
news reports.
   HBJ has been negotiating with the giant brewing company to accept
HBJ's chief executive officer, Ralph D. Caulo, to run the parks, but
Anheuser-Busch wants to install its own chief executive, a source
close to the deal told The Orlando Sentinel for today's editions.
   The problem is that Anheuser-Busch ``doesn't want him,'' said
Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage. Obolensky said Caulo's background is in publishing, HBJ's
key business, and not in theme parks.
   Business Week magazine reports in its Sept. 25 issue that
Anheuser-Busch earlier this month began preparing a second round of
bids for Harcourt's theme parks, which it said are expected to fetch
from $1.2 billion to $2 billion.
   Talks between Orlando-based HBJ and St. Louis-based
Anheuser-Busch have reached a higher level of intensity in the past
few days, the Orlando Sentinel said.
   HBJ has said it hopes to complete a sale of its parks by the end
of September.
   On June 20, HBJ said it would sell its six theme parks, including
Sea Worlds in Orlando, Fla.; San Diego; San Antonio; and Aurora,
Ohio; Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla.; and Boardwalk and
Baseball near Haines City, Fla.
   The parks employ more than 7,000 people during the peak summer
months and full-time employment year-round is nearly 3,500.
   Analysts say companies reported to have bid for the theme parks
include Walt Disney Co.; MCA Inc.; Florida Leisure Acquisition
Corp., which owns the Silver Springs attraction near Ocala; and
Wesray Capital Corp. of Morristown, N.J., which owns 80 percent of
Six Flags Corp.
   Also, a group of three former HBJ and Sea World executives have
said they made a bid for the parks.
   HBJ wants to sell the parks to pay off some of the $2.9 billion
in debt that it acquired in warding off a bitter takeover attempt by
British publisher Robert Maxwell in 1987.
   Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst for Gabelli &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage, said she is not aware that an agreement between HBJ and
Anheuser-Busch is imminent, but ``it would be a strategically
brilliant move for Anheuser-Busch. I think it would be a very good
fit.''
   Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer with well-known
brands including Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob, is also a
successful operator of the Busch Gardens theme parks.
   Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Robyn Meyer would not comment on
reports that a deal between HBJ and Anheuser-Busch is near.
   Margaret Mary McQuillan, senior vice president and spokeswoman
for HBJ, said she had ``no information'' about a deal between
Anheuser-Busch and HBJ, adding that ``there is nothing to report.''
   HBJ's stock fell 12{ cents a share Thursday to close at $15.87{
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   HBJ wants Caulo to work for the parks' buyer because William
Jovanovich, HBJ's iron-willed and autocratic chairman, eventually
wants to put his son, Peter, at the company's helm, a source close
to the discussions told the Sentinel.
   Caulo, 54, outranks Peter Jovanovich, 40, who is an executive
vice president, but Caulo is outranked by William Jovanovich, 69.
   A secretary in Caulo's office said he was not available for
comment.

   Wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive
month in August as a big drop in energy costs pushed inflation down
by 0.4 percent, the government said today.
   The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
followed a similar 0.4 percent plunge in July and a 0.1 percent dip
in June. It was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for
three consecutive months since early 1986.
   The August price moderation was even better than had been
expected and provided further evidence to support arguments that
inflation should be well under control in the second half of the
year.
   In other good economics news today, the government reported that
the U.S. trade deficit narrowed for the second straight month in
July, falling to $7.58 billion, the smallest gap since December 1984.
   The 5.3 percent decline in the merchandise trade figure from June
was a pleasant surprise to economists who had been fearing a sharp
jump in the imbalance between exports and imports.
   In another report, the Federal Reserve said output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August.
It was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent rise in April and
was credited to a rebound in production at auto factories and a
pickup in coal mining following a strike.
   The three-month string of declines in wholesale prices was
particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier
this year had triggered fears of a possible inflationary spiral.
   Wholesale prices were surging ahead at an annual rate of 9.4
percent through May. However, with the monthly declines since that
time, wholesale inflation is now running at a much more moderate
annual rate of 4.4 percent through the first eight months of the
year. In 1988, wholesale prices rose 4 percent.
   A broadbased drop in energy costs was credited for the price
decline in August.
   Gasoline prices plunged 12.1 percent, the third consecutive
monthly decline. Prices of natural gas were also down, dropping 5
percent, while prices of home heating oil fell 2.1 percent.
   Food costs were not as well-controlled, posting a 0.3 percent
increase as the costs of beef, dairy products and bakery goods
accelerated. The price of eggs and pork rose in August after having
fallen in July.
   Inflation, excluding the food and energy categories, was up 0.5
percent, reflecting in part higher prices for new cars. Many
economists look to price increases of other goods as a better
indicator of the underlying inflation rate because food and energy
costs are more volatile from month to month.
   The June-July-August declines marked the first consecutive
monthly drops in the Producer Price Index since a four-month period
of falling wholesale prices from January through April in 1986.
   The improvement in August left the PPI at 113.3, meaning that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost
$113.30 in August. Unlike the other figures in the report, this one
is not adjusted for normal seasonal variations.
   Economists had worried that higher food and energy costs were
threatening to become imbedded in permanently higher inflation rates
as workers demanded higher wage increases to make up for the ground
lost to rising prices.
   That also was a concern at the Federal Reserve, which began
moving in March 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort to
dampen inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's goal was to slow economic growth enough to allow
inflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession.
In June of this year, the Fed switched course and began lowering
interest rates because of signs the economy might be slowing too
much.
   Many economists believe the Fed's delicate balancing act has
worked and inflation will remain moderate in the second half of the
year while the economic expansion, already the second longest on
record, continues at a steady pace.
   Although the Bush administration has complained the central bank
needs to do more to boost growth by lowering interest rates, Michael
Penzer, an economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco, said
he did not expect any further credit easing in the immediate future.
   ``The Fed knows that much of the good news on inflation has come
because energy prices and food prices have been falling, reversing
their steep climb earlier in the year,'' he said. ``The inflation
situation is better but the inflation problem has not been solved.''
   The PPI tracks inflation at the wholesale level. The Consumer
Price Index, which measures inflation at the retail level, will be
released next Tuesday. So far this year, consumer prices have been
rising at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, more than a full percentage
point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988 and 1987.

   If you took takeover mania out of the stock
market, what would it cost investors?
   That's the tough calculation many analysts are trying to make
right now, prompted by the latest tremors in the high-yield ``junk''
bond market that has provided the fuel for the buyout boom of the
1980s.
   The immediate issue the markets had to contend with last week was
the problems of Toronto-based Campeau Corp., faced with the
challenge of reshuffling the coast-to-coast U.S. retailing empire it
had built with debt-financed acquisitions.
   Whatever the outcome of that particular case, analysts said, it
set up a compressed demonstration of the broader psychological
effects that might arise should big trouble develop in the takeover
debt markets.
   Through the late 1980s, the market for ``junk'' debt has proved
much more resilient than most of its critics and skeptics ever
expected.
   It has weathered defaults and bankruptcy filings by some
prominent bond issuers _ for example, LTV Corp.
   It has ridden out a prolonged scandal at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., the Wall Street firm that virtually invented the market for
junk securities as financing tools, and has been its chief sponsor
since.
   Still, some observers said events in the markets on Wednesday and
Thursday, when Campeau's situation became the subject of intense
scrutiny, unfolded as a sort of unscheduled ``fire drill.''
   Stock prices fell for a good many companies that had been
discussed as the next possible subjects for takeover bids, on the
reasoning that Campeau's experience might deter lenders and reduce
the ranks of eager acquirers.
   So did the share prices of leading banks that also play a major
role in takeover financing.
   Traders in all the markets watched warily for any sign of
stepped-up redemptions by investors in mutual funds that specialize
in junk bonds. Such redemptions could force interest rates higher
for lower-quality securities and put other junk-bond investors in a
bind.
   And onlookers with a longer-term perspective wondered at what
level stocks would trade if market participants were no longer so
eager to appraise them on their prospective buyout values.
   The Campeau situation apart, Robert Nurock, a Paoli, Pa.,
investment adviser, cites ``mounting evidence that viable deals are
becoming more difficult to come by:''
   _ Increasing numbers of past buyouts that have faltered;
   _ A shrinking number of companies that make sensible, or even
fanciful, future targets;
   _ Higher interest costs to finance takeovers, stemming from
reduced enthusiasm for junk bonds;
   _ The perception of greater difficulty in meeting takeover debt
burdens in a period of soft or declining business profits.
   ``No one knows exactly how soon the next recession will strike,
how deep it will inevitably be, or how many debt-laden corporations
will ultimately default on their bonds,'' said James Stack, editor
of the financial advisory service InvesTech.
   ``But with total corporate debt running at two times the level of
the last recession, we can rest assured there'll be a few
surprises.''
   The stock market crash of 1987 was blamed in part on a scare that
Congress would move to discourage takeover activity by changing the
tax laws.
   But when stock prices tumbled, the Federal Reserve stepped in
quickly to provide ample reserves of money. No credit crisis
occurred, and within a matter of months the buyout mania was bulding
up a new head of steam.
   Now, analysts are left to consider, how would the Fed respond to
a crunch in takeover debt?

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows to Smallest Gap in Nearly Five Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds last 3 grafs, `In other ...,' with other reports. This
also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed for the second
straight month in July, to $7.58 billion, the smallest gap in nearly
five years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department reported the July deficit represented a
5.3 percent decrease from a revised June deficit of $8.01 billion.
   In another report, the government said wholesale prices fell for
the third consecutive month in August as a big drop in energy costs
pushed inflation down by 0.4 percent.
   The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
followed a similar 0.4 percent plunge in July and a 0.1 percent dip
in June. It was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for
three consecutive months since early 1986.
   The narrowing trade gap came from a 2.5 percent decrease in
imports to $38.32 billion and a 1.8 percent decrease in exports to
$30.74 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports
and exports.
   The overall July deficit of $7.58 billion was the smallest since
a $6.79 billion imbalance in December 1984.
   Economists had been expecting the deficit to widen as imports
fueled by oil purchases rose while the higher dollar cut exports by
making them more expensive overseas.
   America's foreign oil bill rose 2.9 percent to $4.3 billion in
July. The amount of imported oil rose to 8.14 million barrels a day
from 7.93 million in June and the price per barrel fell to $17.12
from $17.67 in June.
   The decrease in exports included such manufacturered goods as
automboiles, machinery and materials while shipments of airplanes
increased.
   In addition to oil, increased imports included clothing and
footwear and general industrial machinery. Decreases included
automobiles and trucks and electrical and specialized industrial
machinery.
   Analysts had been looking for an imbalance of between $8.5
billion and $9 billion in July.
   But despite the July improvement, economists are predicting that
the deficits will begin rising in the second half of the year as
American exports suffer from the rising value of the dollar.
   Analysts also say oil imports will continue to rise as U.S.
consumption increases and domestic production falls, becoming a
major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months.
   The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported
imported oil in July accounted for more than half of U.S. petroleum
needs, the first time that has occurred in 12 years.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co., said ``the big
surprise so far this year has been how good exports have done in the
face of a rising dollar.''
   He attributed that to ``very strong economies overseas ... with a
big capital spending boom spilling over and helping U.S. exports.''
   ``But by late in the year, the higher dollar will be denting
exports,'' Sinai added.
   A higher dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive in overseas
markets.
   For the first half of the year, the deficit has been running at
an annual rate of $108.6 billion, down 8.4 percent from last year's
total merchandise trade deficit of $118.5 billion.
   Despite the first-half improvement, many economists predict
deficit growth in the last half of the year will make the total
imbalance for 1989 about what it was in 1988.
   A worsening trade deficit means a double dose of bad news for the
Bush administration. The administration based its predictions of
healthy economic growth partly on a belief that exports would keep
expanding. If this does not occur, the federal budget deficit will
be higher because tax revenues will be lower.
   Additionally, higher trade deficits increase the pressure for
protectionist trade measures to keep out imports, something the
administration opposes.
   In other economic reports today:
   _ The Federal Reserve said output at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August. It was the biggest
increase since a 0.7 percent rise in April and was credited to a
rebound in production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining
following a strike.
   _ The government said business inventories climbed 0.6 percent in
July while business sales were falling 0.9 percent.

   The stock market showed some spotty gains today,
getting support from unexpectedly favorable economic news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.93 to 2,673.82 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 597 up, 624 down and 578
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 106.29 million shares at
midmorning.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour,''
involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   There had been concern that professional traders engaged in
multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the
market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks.
   But at the opening the market absorbed whatever pressure resulted
from the witching hour, with a big assist from the latest data on
the state of the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third
consecutive monthly decline.
   And the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $8.01
billion in June.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Merck, up \ at 70|;
American Express, up ] at 36\; General Motors, up { at 49, and

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was off .36 at 380.58.

<HEAD>From Slurpees to Bloomies, Debt Exacts Toll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oh, the wages of debt.
   Consider Campeau Corp. The big Toronto-based retailer, scraping
to make payments on a mountain of borrowed money, has been forced to
put its crown jewel, the Bloomingdale's chain, on the block.
   Then there's Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, purveyor of items ranging from milk to magazines to
Slurpees slush-ice drinks.
   Revenue projections it issued when the founding family took the
Dallas company private two years ago soured, and the price of $1.5
billion in Southland junk bonds plunged in recent weeks as investors
fretted about the company's ability to pay its debt.
   Another recent victim of excessive borrowing is Resorts
International Inc., the hotel-casino company controlled by
entertainer-turned-investor Merv Griffin. Resorts late last month
stopped paying interest to bondholders after reporting a
second-quarter loss and lower revenues.
   The chief culprit in all three cases was overestimated
projections of what is known as cash flow, composed of profit plus
bookkeeping charges such as depreciation. Many financial analysts
regard cash flow as the most important measurement of a company's
health.
   The dealmakers expected the well-known retail operations of
Campeau and Southland and the cash-cow casinos of Resorts to churn
out enough money to keep up with huge debt-service payments.
   It didn't work out that way.
   The Campeau, Southland and Resorts transactions were based on
``outrageously optimistic assumptions,'' said Roger E. Brinner,
chief economist at the economic consulting firm DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
   ``Just like Reagan and Congress they assumed growth would solve
all problems,'' he said. ``Maybe these people are just guilty of a
private-sector version of Reaganomics.''
   A slump in the apparel industry hurt Campeau, which sold billions
of dollars worth of junk bonds as it laid out more than $12 billion
to buy Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores over the past
few years. Some analysts believe Campeau paid too much for the
chains.
   At Southland, 7-Eleven sales didn't meet expectations after the
$4.9 billion leveraged buyout, despite a belief that convenience
stores are steady cash generators.
   ``The profit margins are thin, and slight (revenue) deviations
mean big hits to the bottom line,'' said Carol Palmer, an industry
analyst at the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   As for Griffin, he told bondholders in a recent letter that
Resorts' cash flow was lower than expected, ``in part because we
underestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take to
turn around the company's operations to generate increased profits.''
   Griffin sold $325 million in notes to buy Resorts from developer
Donald J. Trump last year, a debt that was piled on top of existing
Resorts bonds totaling about $600 million.
   Resorts faces payments of more than $130 million this year in
interest and principal, but its operations are not likely to
generate that much, analysts say. In 1988, the company's cash flow
was only $60.2 million. Resorts plans to release a restructuring
plan to its debtholders soon.
   The troubles at these three companies once again highlight the
huge amount of debt involved in corporate restructurings and
takeovers. Some say they may lead to more caution by the banks and
junk-bond financiers that bankroll these deals.
   ``People are becoming conditioned to these high debt levels,''
said Ms. Palmer. However, she said, if one of the high-profile,
highly leveraged deals of recent years goes bad, ``I think the
confidence would be shaken very badly.''
   Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los
Angeles, said a consumer spending slowdown is causing the cash
crunches at these and other consumer-industry companies.
   Consumer spending was strong a few years ago when these takeovers
and buyouts were put together, Jordan said. But since then it has
lagged, due partly to the 1986 federal tax revisions and concern
about an economic slowdown. Such a reversal was inevitable, he said.
   ``You can't tell that to the kind of people that put these deals
together. They simply extrapolate the recent past forever,'' he said.
   The problems at these highly leveraged companies, which developed
despite a reasonably strong economy, are a sign of things to come,
said Brinner and Jordan.
   ``It is a tip of an iceberg, but I don't think it's about to sink
our economy,'' Brinner said.

   Trading in Campeau Corp. stock remained halted today while the
debt-crippled retail and property holding company worked out
arrangements for a financial rescue.
   Toronto Stock Exchange spokesman Steven Kee said this morning the
exchange had been advised that Campeau expected to make a statement
shortly.
   The company Thursday had told the exchange it expected to have an
announcement before the market opened Friday. Campeau stock has been
halted since Wednesday, pending an announcement from Campeau.
   There was no indication from the company when any news might be
forthcoming. The company's spokeswoman was not taking telephone
calls.
   Campeau has such a desperate need for cash to run its retail
subsidiaries that it was forced to turn to a major stockholder for
funds and was widely expected to cede control to the lender, Olympia
&amp; York Developments Ltd.
   As part of a restructuring to cope with its debts, Campeau also
decided to put its Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale.
   Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc. divisions, which operate numerous U.S. chains, have run very
short of working capital.
   Without the $250 million loan from Olympia &amp; York, it appeared
uncertain how Campeau would be able to obtain credit so that its
department stores could stock shelves adequately before the crucial
Christmas season. Plus, Federated needs an infusion of funds because
it faces a loan payment deadline today.
   Disclosure of the severity of Campeau's financial problems on
Wednesday rocked the market for high-interest ``junk bonds'' that
the company used to finance its buyouts of Allied and Federated and
contributed to a selloff in the stock market.
   The junk bond market calmed on Thursday as trading slowed and
participants awaited more word from Campeau.
   Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York, which has a 24.5 stake in Campeau,
was expected to gain a larger interest in Campeau in exchange for
granting the loan. There has been speculation that Chairman Robert
Campeau, who owns nearly 54 percent of the Toronto-based company,
would relinquish controlling interest.
   Campeau and Olympia &amp; York entered an agreement in principle but
various other parties _ Campeau's creditors _ had to agree to the
arrangements before the loan deal could be activated.
   Separately, Campeau issued its second-quarter financial results
Thursday. It reported a loss of $124 million in the three months
ended July 31 on revenue of $2.26 billion, compared to a loss of
$109 million and revenue of $2.21 billion a year earlier.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade in light trading
amid an absence of significant changes in supply-and-demand factors.
   Soybeans were a little stronger, reflecting temporary supply
tightness in Europe caused by weather-related delays in shipping
soybeans and soybean meal from Brazil, Europe's main source of
imported soybeans.
   ``They've had a tremendous amount of rain in some of the South
American ports and that's created a situation where stuff that
should be in Europe by now hasn't gotten there yet,'' said Gerald
Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the
Board of Trade.
   Corn futures were mostly lower in light of forecasts for fair
weather this weekend in the Midwest, which could speed up harvest
activity.
   Wheat futures were a little stronger but trading activity was
light in the absence of new export business.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.86{ a bushel; corn
futures were 2\ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with September at
$2.37{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with December
at $1.42{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1\ cents higher
with September at $5.85 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .12 cent lower with October at 72.40
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .12 cent lower with
October at 82.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .15 cent
higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent to .72 cent lower with February at 47.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday, paced by
the pork bellies, on reports that President Bush was authorizing an
additional $50 million in food aid to Poland that would include pork
products.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges Despite Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with central banks selling dollars
after dollar surges.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against all major
currencies in active European trading Friday after the release of
unexpectedly good U.S. trade data. Gold traded in a tight range.
   The dollar gained sharply after the U.S. government reported that
the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $7.58 billion in July from
$8.01 billion in June. Economists had predicted a trade gap of
around $9 billion.
   Though the data triggered an apparently concerted round of
dollar-selling by central banks, the dollar edged up to three-month
highs against a batch of currencies.
   In London, the British pound fell nearly two cents on Friday to
$1.5375, compared with $1.5582 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with morning rates in
parentheses, compared with Thursday's late rates included: 2.0015
(1.9758) West German marks, up from 1.9705; 1.7305 (1.7050) Swiss
francs, up from 1.7000; 6.7375 (6.6660) French francs, up from
6.6485; 2.2470 (2.2250) Dutch guilders, up from 2.2185; 1,432.50
(1,417.20) Italian lire, up from 1,413.00; and, 1.1895 (1.1840)
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849.
   The yen was not traded Friday in Tokyo, because markets were
closed for Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday. In London
the dollar traded at 148.95, compared with 146.90 yen earlier Friday
and 145.85 yen in Tokyo Thursday.
   New York currency dealers also said they detected the Federal
Reserve Board selling dollars to stem a surge after the economic
reports were released. The U.S. central bank never comments on
intervention.
   Gold opened in London at $359.75 bid per troy ounce, down from
Thursday's late price of $362.00. At mid-morning the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.65.
   Gold traded in Zurich at $359.70 bid per troy ounce, compared to
$361.75 late Thursday.
   Hong Kong's gold market was closed today because of the Chinese
mid-autumn festival.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $5.07 a troy ounce, down
from $5.12.

<HEAD>MGM-UA Reaches Quits Talk With Murdoch, Reaches Agreement With Qintex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH COTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Corp. today
accepted a $1.9 billion buyout offer from Australia's Qintex Group,
a sweetened bid that topped a $1.8 billion offer from Rupert Murdoch.
   Qintex increased its offer to $25 per share from its earlier $20
bid, MGM-UA spokeswoman Mary Hardy said.
   Two companies controlled by Murdoch, News Corp. Ltd. and Fox
Inc., offered $23.16 a share in a surprise bid announced Tuesday.
   Qintex sealed its latest offer with a promise to promptly make a
non-refundable $50 million deposit on MGM-UA, which encompasses the
remainder of the old United Artists and MGM movie studios.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Qintex would acquire all of
MGM-UA's outstanding common stock for $25 per share and all its
preferred stock for $18 per share, she said.
   MGM-UA negotiated with News Corp. and Fox until late Thursday,
but then ended their talks.
   Howard Rubenstein, a Murdoch spokesman, said MGM-UA had
approached him about a buyout.``He thought he had a deal, but then
the transaction fell apart,'' Rubenstein said.
   MGM-UA has spent 18-months trying to find a buyer satisfactory to
MGM-UA's controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian, who has repeatedly
sold and then repurchased many of the assets of the studios.
   The Qintex deal provides for $1.33 billion to be paid for
MGM-UA's common stock, $180 million for its preferred stocks, and
$400 million in junk bond debt that Qintex is assuming.
   Murdoch's offer valued MGM-UA at about $1.8 billion, including
the debt.
   A previous Qintex deal would essentially split MGM-UA, with
Qintex paying about $600 million for the United Artists studio and
some other assets. It would have given the famous lion logo, the MGM
TV operations, a library of 34 recent movies, and the MGM-UA
headquarters building in Beverly hills to Kerkorian.
   But under the agreement announced today, there would be no
repurchase of any MGM-UA's assets or any investments in Qintex by
former MGM-UA shareholders.
   Kerkorian owns 82 percent of MGM-UA's common stock and all but a
tiny fraction of the preferred stock.
   However, MGM Grand Inc., a Kerkorian-controlled company that
operates a first-class airline and Nevada casinos, will purchase the
MGM-UA headquarters building in October for $43 million or its
independently appraised value.
   MGM-UA will make about $26 million on that deal, the company said.
   In addition to the 20th Century Fox studio, Murdoch's newspaper,
magazine and television enterprises on four continents are said to
be worth more than $8 billion.
   Murdoch, who needs programming for his Sky Television satellite
channels in Britain, had his eye on MGM-UA's huge United Artists
film libraries, which include the recent movies ``Rain Man,''
``Betrayed'' and ``Baby Boom,'' as well as the ``Rocky,'' ``Pink
Panther,'' and James Bond pictures.
   Qintex, also owns 43 percent of Qintex Entertainment, a Los
Angeles based producer of television movies and miniseries such as
``Lonesome Dove.''

<HEAD>Broken 7-Iron Inspiration For Las Vegas Discount Golf Chain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voss Boreta was a failed casino host between
jobs when a broken 7-iron got him off the golf course and into the
golf equipment business.
   Fifteen years later, he heads one of the country's biggest golf
retailing outfits, one now poised to enter the lucrative Japanese
market with a chain of 30 new stores.
   ``We were just going to have a little store,'' Boreta said of the
humble beginnings of his Las Vegas Discount Golf &amp; Tennis empire.
``It's just kind of grown from there.''
   From the 1,200-square-foot store tucked in the corner of an aging
shopping center, Boreta's discount golf outfit has grown into a
multimillion-dollar operation with 42 franchises nationwide and 13
more ready to open this year.
   The chain, riding a nationwide boom in golf, did $47 million in
business in 1988, $12 million of that at its main Las Vegas store
alone, ranking it near the top golf equipment retailers in the
country.
   Not bad for a one-time avid golfer who doesn't even play the game
anymore.
   ``I haven't played since 1975,'' Boreta said recently in an
interview in his cramped and cluttered office in the back of the
original store. ``With the company growing like it has, I didn't
have the time to devote to playing.''
   Timing has been everything for the 52-year-old Boreta, a former
San Francisco nightclub operator who freely admits he stumbled into
the golf game almost by accident.
   Boreta came to Las Vegas in 1974 to become a casino host at the
Tropicana Hotel. But, after three days, he decided the job didn't
suit him and spent his days playing golf while deciding his future
plans.
   ``One day I broke a 7-iron and there was no place to fix it,''
Boreta recalled. ``I sent it to a friend who ran a golf shop in San
Francisco and told him there was a great opportunity here. He said,
`Why don't you do it?'''
   Boreta took the advice and opened the original Las Vegas Discount
Golf store in a shopping center near the Las Vegas airport. The
store grossed $275,000 the first year and Boreta was off and running.
   It was a tenative step into mail order two years later, however,
that put the company name on the national map and on its way to
being a major player in the golf equipment business.
   ``We put a little ad in Golf Digest (magazine) that people had to
call with their own dime,'' Boreta said. ``When they called, we told
them we'd send them a catalog when we didn't even have one put
together yet. But the next thing you know, here comes a couple of
orders in.''
   Ironically, one of the country's largest golf mail-order outlets
and franchisers, Nevada Bob's, also got its start in Las Vegas.
   At the same time the discount golf shops were beginning to
expand, golf club manufacturers were broadening their club lines to
tap the beginners market.
   ``These manufacturers got smart and started making game
improvement clubs,'' Boreta said. ``That is what really started the
golfing boom. Now, you can take a non-player and after one lesson he
can hit the ball in the air and in the general direction he or she
wants it.''
   Those clubs have been constantly improving and Japanese companies
have taken the lead in marrying boron and graphite shafts that are
stronger, longer and more accurate than their steel predecessors.
   Partly as a result, according to the Florida-based National Golf
Foundation, some 23.4 million people played at least one round of
golf last year, up from 15.1 million in 1980.
   More than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the United
States, bringing the total to more than 13,000. In Japan, there are
an estimated 12 million golfers and 1,600 courses.
   ``I've never seen anything like the last few years as far as
people playing the game,'' Boreta said. ``It seems like just in the
last two years it has really taken off.''
   Boreta sees an even bigger opportunity in the lucrative Japanese
market and his chain has signed an agreement with a Japanese company
to open a store in Tokyo next month followed by 29 others for other
locations in the golf-crazy country.''
   ``We get a tremendous amount of Japanese who come here and buy
three or four sets of clubs and take them home to sell to friends,''
Boreta said. ``We figured we'd take the operation to them.''

   The stock market was mixed today in an uninspired
response to favorable economic news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.71 to 2,666.60 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 470 up, 872
down and 522 unchanged.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour,''
involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   There had been concern that professional traders engaged in
multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the
market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks.
   At the opening the market absorbed whatever pressure resulted
from the witching hour, with a big assist from the latest data on
the state of the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third
consecutive monthly decline.
   And the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $8.01
billion in June.
   But after a gain of about 15 points in the Dow at the outset, the
market settled back.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose \ to 70|; American
Express gained \ to 36[; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped [ to
40[, and International Business Machines was down ] at 115].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .47 to 190.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off 1.21 at 379.73.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.25 million shares at

<TEXT>
   Mercantile Co., parent of 12 groups of
department and specialty stores, has announced plans to move its
headquarters to Cincinnati from New York.
   Mercantile said Thursday it will transfer its executive staff and
accounting, financial and data processing offices to Cincinnati, but
will keep its merchandising operations in New York. The shift will
take place during the next few years and could involve several
hundred employees.
   David Huhn, Mercantile's new chairman and chief executive
officer, said no Cincinnati site has been selected and no timetable
has been set for the move. He was in Cincinnati on Thursday, but
declined to say why the move is being made. The company will remain
incorporated in Delaware.
   Huhn, a Cincinnati native, had kept his family residence in
Cincinnati since moving to New York last year as executive vice
president. He had been president of the company's group of McAlpin's
department stores, which includes nine stores in Cincinnati and
Lexington, Ky., since 1972.
   His promotion to chairman and chief executive officer was
announced Monday.
   Mercantile's other store groups are Bacon's, in Louisville, Ky.;
Root's, Terre Haute, Ind.; Castner Knott Co., Nashville, Tenn.;
Gayfer's, Mobile and Montgomery, Ala.; Jones Store Co., Kansas City,
Mo.; J.B. White, Augusta, Ga.; Lion's, Toledo, Ohio; Joslin's,

   Steel imports fell 5.9 percent to 1.46 million
tons in July compared with the previous month and represented 19.3
percent of the domestic supply, the American Iron and Steel
Institute reported Friday.
   Steel imports for the first seven months of 1989 were 10.2
million tons, down 19.7 percent from the same period last year and
representing 17.5 percent of domestic supply, the trade group
reported.
   Steel exports in July amounted to 303,000 tons, down 24.8 percent
from June, the group said. In July 1988, American steel
manufacturers exported 128,000 tons.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel Inc., which represents
leading steel importers and exporters, said imports for the first
seven months amounted to 15.2 percent of domestic demand when
semifinished steel bound for U.S. mills is excluded.
   The steel import group noted the percentage without semifinished
steel is below the Bush administration's Voluntary Restraint
Agreements target of 18.5 percent of imported steel in the domestic
market.

<HEAD>Cable Operator to Debut Independent Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent television station being
launched by a local cable operator could signal the opening of a new
battleground between cable and free television.
   WGRC-TV, scheduled to debut Thursday in Rochester, will air
syndicated network reruns, sports, movies, and locally produced
children's shows. The station hopes eventually to debut a local
newscast and is negotiating to broadcast some New York Mets and
Yankees games.
   ``It's an expansion of cable's promise, which is to deliver
programming choice to subscribers,'' said Robert Alter, president of
the Cable Television Advertising Bureau in New York City.
   ``It's providing expanded, enriched service that is very
localized.''
   The station will be programmed and operated by local cable
operator Greater Rochester Cablevision, which currently reaches 62
percent of the area's households with televisions. The Rochester
market has one non-cable independent station.
   Alter predicted that if the Rochester station is successful,
independent stations will be launched in other markets. Some cable
operators have already begun airing local news shows, he said.
   Lana King, marketing vice president for the Association of
Independent Television Stations, reacted with dismay to the advent
of the new station and the possibility of others like it.
   ``This threatens our ability to serve the community free of
charge,'' she said. ``It's a fear that we have had for a long time.''
   King said that cable stations, with the added revenue from
subscriber charges as well as advertising, can outbid independent
television stations for syndicated programming.
   Eventually, she said, viewers could end up having to pay to see
the same programs they would have gotten for free.
   ``We're seeing it happening in sports,'' she said. ``That same
phenomenon is now happening in all programming.''
   The Rochester cable station currently carries locally originated
programming like fishing shows.
   GRC President and chief executive officer Frank Chiaino said the
idea for the station originated in Rochester, but that GRC's parent
company, New York City-based Time Warner Inc., will be ``watching
what we do with interest.''
   The station was created to increase advertising revenues and
subscribers and in response to new syndication laws, Chiaino said.
   Time Warner may sell advertising on the station in packages with
its other products, including Sports Illustrated and Time magazines,
according to James P. Murtagh of Seltel Inc., a sales representative
for the station.

   Di Giorgio Corp., a $1 billion a year food
and building materials company that has rejected a $163 million
buyout offer, said Friday it is seeking formal proposals for sale of
all or part of the company.
   Di Giorgio, parent of White Rose foods, said several third
parties had expressed interest on a preliminary basis but did not
say who they are.
   The company last month rejected as inadequate an unsolicited
offer of $32 a share made by an investor group led by Arthur
Goldberg and urged its shareholders not to tender shares to the
Goldberg group. The offer, which had been due to expire on Aug. 30,
was extended to Sept. 20.
   In late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Di
Giorgio was up $1 a share at $33.75, indicating traders' belief that
a better offer than Goldberg's is likely.
   For the first six months of this year, Di Giorgio earned $4.5
million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $565 million. It had
$1.05 billion in revenue for all of 1988.
   The company is engaged in food distribution through its White
Rose Food Division. It processes and sells speciality meats through
its Cerando Division. Di Giorgio also makes and sells a variety of
building materials through its DG Mouldings, BiltBest Windows and
Las Plumas Lumber Divisions.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Drop On Lack Of Expected Soviet Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a quiet session marked by a
lack of significant supply-and-demand developments.
   The corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of
a rumored Soviet corn purchase failed to materialize.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the exchange, said the speculation was premature.
   ``I think the Russians are going to be significant buyers of U.S.
corn ... but not at this time,'' he said. ``You buy during the
harvest, not before the harvest. You don't get the lowest prices
right now.''
   Corn harvesting has begun but won't get into full swing for
another week, he said. The peak of the soybean harvest is still two
weeks away.
   Forecasts for clear dry weather in the Midwest this weekend also
weighed on the markets. Analysts said those conditions would help
the crops mature and speed up the early harvest activity.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1} cents lower to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.88} a bushel; corn
was 2\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.35 a
bushel; oats were } cent lower to 2{ cents higher with September at

   Sharon Steel Corp.'s chief operating officer
would have people believe his company is failing when times are good.
   True or not, E. Leonard Kern's view is rejected by employees who
will soon be asked by company negotiators to grant a third
consecutive round of contract concessions.
   ``I don't believe it, not one bit of it,'' said Jim Thompson, 56,
of Sharon, a veteran of nearly 30 years with the company. ``They're
cutthroats.''
   Kern says the company's ability to persuade the United
Steelworkers union could determine whether Sharon Steel rises from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization or is liquidated under Chapter
7.
   That in turn will influence the economy of this steelmaking area
of western Pennsylvania, into which Sharon Steel pumps about $200
million annually as one of the largest employers with 2,600 workers.
   ``We lost money in the best steel market in a decade and have the
dubious distinction of being the only company to say that. That
gives you an idea of the destitute situation here,'' Kern said in a
recent interview in his spartan office.
   The nation's 16th-largest steelmaker has been trying to
reorganize under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since April 17,
1987, listing $740 million in debts it could not pay.
   Kern's plan for saving the company begins with lowering
employment costs by cutting direct cash outlays and erasing what he
calls wasteful and inefficient work rules. New equipment would come
later.
   ``A contract has to be clearly in sight by Thanksgiving and
ratified by no later than January or February or we will face a
number of things,'' he said.
   By early next year, Kern said, the company could run out of cash
and be forced to delay bill payments, echoing events that forced it
into bankruptcy court two years ago.
   ``We're that close if the market stays soft, and I think it will
get softer,'' said Kern, a 14-year veteran of Sharon Steel
management who left in 1982 and returned in late April as chief
operating officer.
   It was not clear when contract talks would begin.
   Sharon Steel owes $70 million to pension plans for 3,500
retirees, and total labor costs are around $28 per hour, among the
highest even for major producers, said Phil Smalley, vice president
of industrial relations.
   The company's steel and steel-related segments lost $16.3 million
on sales of $263.1 million during the first half of this year,
according to the court-appointed trustee serving as chief executive.
   The company's non-steel operations _ copper and brass fabrication
at Mueller Brass Co., and coal mining at U.S. Fuel Co., and gold
mining at Alaska Gold Co. _ continue to offset much of steel's
losses and helped limit the first-half consolidated net loss to $2.5
million.
   ``How can they not be making money?'' said Sharon Steel veteran
Bud Pears. ``Guys are working overtime out their ears. We're
producing steel like crazy''
   Workers say there are plenty of signs that the company is making
money.
   Sharon Steel expanded its workforce to 2,600 by early this year
to meet demand for its products.
   Average shipments climbed from 70,000 tons per month in 1987 to
89,000 last year and were running at 92,000 tons per month through
the first half of this year.
   The steel industry is enjoying its third year of recovery.
   And Victor Posner, the Miami Beach financier accused of sucking
Sharon Steel dry of cash after acquiring control, still owns the
stock but has been stripped of his authority.
   ``People say, `Who are you kidding?' '' Kern said, acknowledging
the skepticism. ``I say even in the good days, Sharon was one of the
laggards.''
   A landlocked blast furnace, for which iron ore, coke and
limestone must be delivered by rail and truck instead of cheaper
barge transportation, is one of the disadvantages that Kern calls
congenital defects.
   ``Near-Neanderthal tools,'' an unwieldy product mix and work
rules that inflate production costs also work against the company,
he said.
   ``The market is weaker, and prices are softening, and the loss
rate is accelerating,'' Kern said. ``We're losing money, dissipating
assets.''
   Management sees another crunch coming, and warns employees in a
series of red-lettered pamphlets that without large sums of money to
buy new equipment, lower labor costs may be the only hope of
avoiding Chapter 7 liquidation.
   ``Not as far as I'm concerned,'' said Pears. ``I don't care what
they do. I'm just down there working. When it's over, it's over.
I'll go find the next job.''
   Pears and others say they're particularly bitter about an
employee stock ownership plan that the employees say is overdue in
repaying their investments.
   ``I've got $16,000 in it, and I'll never see it,'' said Pears.
``So you tell me how you'd feel towards the place. Bottom line.''
   Even those workers who are convinced Sharon Steel is in trouble
don't sound sympathetic.
   ``As far as concessions are concerned, I do believe they need
them. But as far as I'm concerned they're not going to get them,''
said Bob Ivanovich of Farrell. ``I gave and gave. There's no more to
give.''

   The stock market was mixed today, showing few ill
effects from the quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   Heavy activity at the opening and again at the close was prompted
by the witching hour, involving the last trading in a group of
expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   There had been concern that professional traders engaged in
multiple strategies involving those contracts would depress the
market with a barrage of sell orders for stocks.
   But the market got a boost from the latest data on the state of
the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in August for its third
consecutive monthly decline.
   And the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $7.58 billion in July from a downward-revised $8.01
billion in June.

<HEAD>Hoylake Gets More Time for Its BAT Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's takeover watchdog, recognizing the
increasingly international nature of the bidding process, on Friday
allowed Hoylake Investments Ltd. more time for its $21 billion bid
for BAT Industries Inc.
   In an unprecedented step, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers,
which imposes a complex timetable on takeovers in Britain, said it
would allow Hoylake to rebid for BAT after it obtains approval from
U.S. state insurance regulators to change the ownership of BAT's
Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   It said delays by the U.S. regulatory process meant BAT
shareholders were not able to properly consider the offer of 878
pence, or $13.52, a share in securities. The purchase would be the
world's second-largest takeover after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co.'s $24.5 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   BAT, a British conglomerate with interests in tobacco, retailing,
financial services and paper, said it would take the ruling to the
panel's appeal committee. That stops the current British takeover
clock until a final decision is reached.
   BAT's shares soared on the developments. They rose 18 pence, or
28 cents, to 819 pence, or $12.61, a share on London's Stock
Exchange on Friday.
   Hoylake still must win the green light from the U.S. regulators.
In addition, Hoylake probably would have to increase its offer or
include some cash to lure BAT's shareholders, analysts have said.
   BAT attacked the panel's decision, saying it undermined the
watchdog's goal of protecting targets from ``an indefinite and
damaging siege.''
   Hoylake said it welcomed the news and that Anglo-French financier
Sir James Goldsmith, who is spearheading the bidding group, would
depart immediately for the United States ``to establish the best way
to continue to expedite the U.S. regulatory approval.''
   Goldsmith is to meet with Claude Bebear, chairman of the French
insurance giant Axa-Midi Assurances, which wants to buy Farmers
under Hoylake's proposed break-up of BAT. Hoylake says it wants to
sell off all of BAT's non-tobacco assets.
   Other investors in Hoylake include British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer.
   Concern has grown in Britain over interference from U.S.
regulators and courts in takeover fights involving British companies
with U.S. interests.
   South African-controlled Minorco SA's bid for the British mining
group Consolidated Gold Fields PLC failed earlier this year because
the offer expired under British takeover rules while it was being
reviewed in U.S. federal court.
   Under the panel's rules, Hoylake, which launched its offer for
BAT on July 11, had had until Oct. 7 to obtain a majority stake in
BAT. If it had failed, it would have had to wait for a year to bid
again.
   The panel, after holding a full hearing on Wednesday, said Friday
morning that it would allow Hoylake 21 days to complete its bid for
BAT after it wins U.S. approval.
   The panel has altered its timetable in the past under varying
conditions, but it has never before granted an extension because of
U.S. regulatory holdups, said a panel official, who asked not to be
identified, in accordance with British practice.
   Explaining its decision, the panel said the delay caused by the
U.S. proceedings meant BAT shareholders were not getting a real
opportunity to consider the offer on its merits.
   ``One of the principal objects of the code is to enable the
shareholders in the target company to have an opportunity to
consider an offer for their company on its merits on an informed
basis in an orderly and limited time scale,'' the panel said.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said BAT didn't want to deprive its
shareholders of the opportunity to consider a bid.
   ``We are simply seeking to remove the uncertainty, and also the
damage which a prolonged siege would inflict on the company,''
Sheehy said.
   BAT said the panel's ``wrong decision'' allows Hoylake to free
itself from regulatory difficulties which are ``entirely of its own
making.''

<HEAD>Chris-Craft Appealing Ruling In Time-Warner Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chris-Craft Industries Inc. said Friday it was
appealing a Delaware judge's ruling that the company, a major
shareholder in Warner Communications Inc., has no power to veto the
merger between Warner and Time Warner Inc.
   The ruling last week by Chancery Court Judge William Allen said
the terms of a class of Warner preferred stock held by a Chris-Craft
subsidiary, BHC Inc., did not entitle Chris-Craft to vote on the
merger of the two media giants.
   A Chris-Craft attorney, Charles S. Crompton Jr., said the company
was asking the Delaware Supreme Court to overturn the ruling on the
ground Allen had inaccurately interpreted the terms of the stock.
   A three-judge panel of the state's highest court was to hear
arguments in the case on Oct. 18 in Dover.
   Allen ruled in response to a request for a declaration of
Chris-Craft's rights by Warner and Time Warner, who want the issue
resolved so they can consummate their merger.
   Time Inc. completed a $14 billion tender offer for Warner in
July, and then changed its name to Time Warner Inc. The companies
hope to finalize their merger later this year.
   A decision by Allen, later upheld by the state Supreme Court,
threw out a challenge to the merger by Paramount Communications
Inc., which had sought to acquire Time Inc. for $12 billion.
   In his latest decision, Allen said that under the terms of the
stock Chris-Craft does not ``possess a veto over every merger in
which its interests would be adversely affected.''
   Chris-Craft contended it had a right to vote on the merger
because its preferred Warner shares can be converted into preferred
Time Warner shares.
   Warner and Chris-Craft Chairman Herbert Siegel have been feuding
since Chris-Craft helped Warner fend off an unwanted takeover bid
from publisher Rupert Murdoch in 1984.

   The dollar fell sharply Friday in panicky
domestic dealings characterized by wild rumors and price swings,
erasing gains posted in earlier foreign trading.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for current delivery jumped to $363.90 a troy ounce, up
$3.40 from Thursday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for
gold of $362.50 an ounce, up from $359.35.
   The dollar rallied sharply in foreign trading, climbing above the
benchmark 2.00 level against the West German mark following a
better-than-expected report on the U.S. trade deficit.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit narrowed to a seasonally
adjusted $7.58 billion in August from a revised $8.01 billion in
July, shocking a market that had expected a $9 billion shortfall.
   But traders at home said the euphoria was short-lived. By
mid-afternoon, the market was hit with a string of outrageous rumors
ranging from the assassination of President Bush to the failure of
Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
   ``With the slew of rumors, the dollar came screaming off,'' said
Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of Boston's New York
office. ``It was scary.''
   Within an hour, the dollar plunged 6 pfennigs against the West
German mark.
   ``That's a pretty dramatic move,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice
president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. ``We were
sitting at 2.00 marks _ it was a wild and crazy day.''
   One by one the rumors were denied, which helped pick the dollar
up from its lows. But Lawrie said many investors had been ``scared
enough today to step out of their positions and take a breather.''
   The central banks joined forces to sell dollars throughout the
day, and ultimately traders welcomed the move for smoothing out the
dollar's decline.
   The session's extreme volatility has forced technicians to revise
their trading ranges. ``It will be a while before we test 2.00 marks
again,'' Johnson said.
   Fundamentally, dealers noted that the trade report showed a
decline in both imports and exports, perhaps pointing to a weakening
economy and lower interest rates, which do not bode well for the
dollar.
   The yen was not traded Friday in Tokyo, where markets were closed
for a holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 148.65 yen,
compared with Thursday's closing price in Tokyo of 145.85 yen. In
New York, the dollar closed at 146.35 yen, down from 146.85 yen on
Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5390 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5582 late Thursday. In New
York, it cost $1.5660 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Thursday's $1.5540.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.9660 West German marks, down from 1.9750;
1.6945 Swiss francs, down from 1.7040; 6.6295 French francs, down
from 6.6615; 1,410.50 Italian lire, down from 1,418.50, and 1.1848
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1850.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 2.0005 West German marks, up from 1.9705; 1.7260
Swiss francs, up from 1.7000; 6.7430 French francs, up from 6.6485;
2.2490 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2185; 1,433.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,413.00; and 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $356.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $362.00. In Zurich, gold fell to
$356.00 an ounce from $361.75 late Thursday. Hong Kong's gold market
was closed Friday for the Chinese mid-autumn festival.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.084 an ounce from $5.055 Thursday. In
London, the metal was trading at a late bid of $5.03 a troy ounce,
compared with Thursday's $5.12.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Rise on Late Buying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices resumed their upward climb
Friday after one trader entered the gasoline market in late
afternoon and sparked activity in crude and heating oil futures.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 24 cents to $19.96 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the October
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up 0.94 cent to
close at 57.61 cents a gallon and home heating oil for October
delivery rose 0.91 cent to settle at 55.95 cents a gallon.
   On Thursday, energy futures, which have rallied in recent weeks,
paused for a round of profit-taking, and for much of Friday's
session, the market was quiet.
   However, in late afternoon, one trader began buying the October
contract for gasoline, and ``ran it up to a level where they got
everyone else's interest,'' said Greg Dreis, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures.
   ``Crude and heating oil had to come up with it,'' Dreis said.
   There were no news developments to influence trading, he said.

<HEAD>Davis Counters Pilot-Management Bid for UAL</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 15th graf pvs, In late-afternoon ... to update with closing
stock price.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California billionaire Marvin Davis on Friday
offered to match the $6.75 billion buyout offer that UAL Corp.
agreed to with its pilots and managers if that deal collapsed and
said he would demand no labor concessions _ a key point for unions.
   Although he noted his ``clear competitive disadvantage,'' Davis
said he too would pay $300 a share for the parent of United
Airlines. Late Thursday, UAL approved an offer in which employees
would own 75 percent of the company, British Airways PLC would own
15 percent and management 10 percent.
   The pilots' offer requires labor and wage concessions and is
opposed by the union representing United machinists. Flight
attendants are still weighing the deal.
   ``The magnitude of the labor concessions (the pilot-management
group) contemplates is significant,'' Davis said in a letter to
UAL's board. ``Any bidder lacking those concessions is at a clear
competitive disadvantage.''
   The pilot-management group plan includes a seven-year, no-strike
guarantee by the pilots and other cost-cutting labor concessions,
including lowered wages and benefits.
   UAL declined comment on Davis' letter Friday.
   But Robert Decker, an airline industry analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc. in Chicago, said the latest volley by Davis suggests he
believes a bid of more than $300 per share would be too much to pay.
   ``He recognized that he can't top a bid by employees,'' said
Decker. ``But if the bid falls apart, then he'll be there to buy the
company.''
   A spokesman for United pilots, who have been attempting to buy
the airline since 1987, said he feels certain the deal will be
completed.
   ``We have proven our tenaciousness,'' said Hank Krakowski of the
Air Line Pilots Association, representing 7,000 pilots. ``We are not
going to relax until this company becomes an employee-owned
airline.''
   The pilot-management coalition still faces several hurdles,
including a decision by the airline's machinists to oppose the
buyout.
   The International Association of Machinists, representing 25,000
United employees, ``has no intention of participating in the
proposal in its present form,'' Louis Schroeder, president of the
union's District 141, said in a letter released Thursday.
   The machinists believe the deal would leave UAL heavily in debt
and could threaten the job security of union members.
   Flight attendants have begun talks toward possible participation
in the buyout, said Carol Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Association
of Flight Attendants, representing more than 12,700 United workers.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL fell 75
cents a share to $279.75.
   If a settlement were reached, UAL would top Avis Corp., with
11,000 employees, as the country's largest employee-owned
corporation.
   Davis, the California investor who started the takeover battle
six weeks ago and previously bid $6.19 billion, or $275 a share for
UAL, would not disclose his current stake in UAL, said spokesman Jim
Fingeroth.
   Davis said Friday that the course he has chosen to follow ``may
provide us with a higher probability of success in acquiring UAL
than attempting to bid against the coalition that has been arrayed
against us.''
   The pilot-management agreement was announced Thursday after the
employee group made a final presentation to a special committee of
the UAL board and revealed the financing for its bid.
   The deal still requires the approval of shareholders and the
Department of Transportation, which is not expected to raise major
objections.
   With inclusion of financing costs, the deal would total $7.2
billion. Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank have committed $3
billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an
additional $4.2 billion, officials said.

<HEAD>Rumors Wrench Gold Market, Which Ends Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices made strong gains Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange after being wrenched back from three-year lows by
unfounded rumors that President Bush had been shot and that a major
U.S. bank was near collapse.
   ``From what we can see it was purely rumor-driven,'' said John
Jonat, a metals trader with Deak International Inc.
   On other markets, energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans
were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.40 higher across the board with the
contract for delivery in October at $365.20 a troy ounce. Silver
futures were 2.7 cents to 2.9 cents higher with September at $5.084
a troy ounce.
   Analysts said the moves in the metal markets were mainly
reactions to the dollar, which strengthened early in the day
following positive reports on inflation and the trade deficit, then
collapsed in the afternoon amid the wild rumors.
   ``We had a complete reversal,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``The
dollar went through what was described as a free fall.''
   The market gave more credence to the talk of an impending bank
collapse than to the rumors about Bush, analysts said, because the
financial markets already were jittery about the credit troubles of
retailing giant Campeau Corp.
   For the gold market, which has been weakening gradually for
months, the turnaround could mark a turning point, Sloane said.
   ``New lows were made and then you came up with a higher close on
the day. That could be considered a key reversal,'' signalling the
start of a major bull move, he said.
   Energy futures also rallied late in the session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, more than offsetting the significant
technically inspired losses that had accrued earlier in the week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 26 cents
higher with October at $19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .74 cent to
.91 cent higher with October at 55.95 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .74 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 57.50 cents
a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade in a quiet session marked by a lack of significant
supply-and-demand developments.
   The corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of
a rumored Soviet corn purchase failed to materialize.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the exchange, said the speculation was premature.
   ``I think the Russians are going to be significant buyers of U.S.
corn ... but not at this time,'' he said. ``You buy during the
harvest, not before the harvest. You don't get the lowest prices
right now.''
   Corn harvesting has begun but won't get into full swing for
another week, he said. The peak of the soybean harvest is still two
weeks away.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with
September at $3.88} a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 1\ cents
higher with September at $2.35 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to
2{ cents higher with September at $1.37 a bushel; soybeans were 2
cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $5.83{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in a day of profit-taking following Thursday's fierce
rally, which was prompted by proposals to include pork products in a
food-aid package to Poland.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .45 cent higher
with October at 72.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with September at 83.37 cents a pound; hogs
were .32 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 40.97 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with February at 48.25 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Minority Broadcast Rules Need Congressional Protection, Senate Panel
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Communications Commission rules that
have increased minority and female ownership of radio and TV
stations need congressional protection from recent attacks in the
courts and from the FCC itself, a Senate panel was told Friday.
   Minority and women broadcasters said they had made great strides
in gaining licenses during the 1970s when the rules were established
to ease their entry, but that progress slowed under the Reagan
administration during the early 1980s.
   The Republican-led FCC ``began a concerted attack upon minority
ownership polices. ... Eight years after the Reagan administration
took office there are only 160 radio stations and 15 television
stations'' owned by blacks, which represents 2 percent of all
stations, said James L. Winston, executive director of the National
Association of Black Owned Broadcasters.
   Congress in 1988 ordered the FCC to stop reconsidering the
minority and female preference rules, but the rules suffered a major
blow earlier this year when a court declared part of them
unconstitutional.
   Witnesses urged the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation
communications subcommittee to write the FCC rules into law to
protect them from constitutional attack.
   Subcommittee chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said his
staff was preparing such legislation.
   ``In the Reagan years, the FCC got on the wrong track,'' Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., the full Commerce committee chairman,
said in written testimony. ``While it used fancy words and phrases
to claim these policies were unconstitutional, we knew all along it
simply did not support the spirit of these policies.''
   Hollings said a Senate appropriations subcommittee this week
included a provision in an FCC appropriations bill that would
maintain the rules.
   The FCC rules, first adopted in 1973, give preference to
minorities and women in license renewal proceedings. In 1978, the
FCC added an important provision that gives a tax break to station
owners who sell to minorities.
   ``If the tax certificate policy is ever eliminated, minority
purchasers might as well disconnect their telephones, because they
will never get another call to purchase a station,'' Winston said.
   Another provision added in 1978 was the distress sale policy that
allows broadcasters facing license revocation to sell quickly to
minority groups for 75 percent of the fair value of the station and
end further FCC action against them.
   But the U.S. appeals court in Washington this year struck down
the policy, saying the FCC had not demonstrated there was a link
between minority ownership and a proliferation of minority
programming and that the agency had not demonstrated there is a
history of racial discrimination in broadcasting requiring the
preference policies.
   Less than a month later, however, another three-judge panel of
the court upheld the constitutionality of the female and minority
preference provisions.
   The lone witness testifying against codifying the rules was Alan
Shurberg, the Hartford, Conn., broadcaster who won the appeals court
test.
   Shurberg, who opposed a minority broadcaster who had won station
WHCT-TV in a distress sale, cited the court's view that without firm
evidence that would-be minority owners are subject to discrimination
when they try to buy stations, Congress should not intervene.
   He said minorities don't necessarily program for the benefit of
minorities once they've achieved their licenses, particularly if the
station is located in a market made up of primarily non-minority
listeners.
   ``Diversity is driven by the marketplace,'' Shurberg said.

<HEAD>Ralston to Buy Beech-Nut Baby Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co., the world's leading maker of
dog and cat food, is going into the baby food business.
   Ralston officials said Friday they had reached a tentative
agreement with Nestle Enterprises, Inc., to buy its Beech-Nut baby
food business, which has annual sales of about $150 million.
   Beech-Nut is the second largest maker of baby food in the United
States, far behind Gerber in the $1 billion baby food industry. The
deal does not include Beech-Nut gum, which is produced by another
company.
   ``Because there are a great many similarities between how some of
our products and Beech-Nut products are sold and marketed, we
believe this deal offers us some tremendous opportunities,'' said
Ralston spokesman Pat Farrell.
   Terms of the deal, which should be completed in 30 to 60 days,
were not disclosed, Farrell said.
   Beech-Nut, headquartered in Fort Washington, Pa., makes jarred
baby food, fruit juices and cereals in three plants around the
country, two in upstate New York and one in San Jose, Calif.
   The company has about 1,100 employees.
   Ralston, with annual sales of $5.8 billion, is best known for its
cat and dog chow, but the company also makes breakfast cereal, and
owns Continental Bakery, which makes Hostess snack cakes and Wonder
bread and is the largest wholesale baker in the country.
   The company also owns Everready Battery Co.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Up After Uneven Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices gyrated Friday before finishing
higher in a session dominated by mixed economic news and rumors.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up in early trading,
down slightly at midday, and back up by the close. It finished 15-32
point higher, or nearly $4.70 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield,
which falls when prices rise, fell to 8.07 percent from 8.12 percent
late Thursday.
   Analysts said bonds got their first boost from the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index, which showed wholesale prices
falling in August for the third consecutive month, down 0.4 percent.
But bonds dropped later when traders noted that excluding the
volatile food and energy sector, inflation actually rose 0.5 percent.
   Inflation is the enemy of bonds, which pay fixed interest.
   The bond market reacted uncertainly to long-awaited reports on
trade and factory output. The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in July to
$7.58 billion, the smallest gap since December 1984. Output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August.
   Several rumors of bad news also affected the market. Financial
markets are susceptible to rumors because many people trade on them
without taking time to see if they are true.
   By the end of the day traders decided that on balance the news
was good.
   ``What the market got was kind of an information overload,'' said
Robert Chandross, economist for Lloyds Bank PLC in New York.
``Overall the economic numbers confirmed we're not in a recession
and that growth is continuing at a respectable rate in the third
quarter.''
   Trading remained thin in the junk bond market, where lower-grade
issues have been hit by the cash crunch at the Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. units of Canadian retailing
giant Campeau Corp.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments were up about 1-32 point, intermediate
maturities were up 3-32 to 3-16 point and long-term issues were up
close to { point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.89 to 1,183.49.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of
five years or longer, gained 1.06 to 331.79.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point to 92 11-16. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.36 percent from 7.35 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.76 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 7.52 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.94 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to
7.54 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 7.98
percent as the discount remained at 7.45 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9 1-16 percent, up from 8~ percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Douglas Makes Safety Modifications to DC-10s Following Freak Iowa
Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Friday it would
modify its DC-10 jetliners to ensure safe landings even if all three
hydraulic systems fail.
   The modifications, developed in response to a DC-10 crash that
killed 112 people in Sioux City, Iowa, last July, were greeted
warmly by James B. Busey, the head of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   ``The system design changes proposed by McDonnell Douglas ... are
a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the July
19 accident,'' Busey said in a statement issued in Washington, D.C.
   ``Once these design changes are in place, they will raise the
already high safety standards required of the DC-10 and, in effect,
make a good airplane even better.''
   Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas based in
Long Beach, manufactured the DC-10s, which have been replaced by the
newer but similar MD-11s.
   McDonnell spokeswoman Elayne Bendel said in a telephone interview
that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same
modifications to its MD-11s.
   ``We are going to look at the MD-11 and evaluate it and we'll do
what is appropriate there,'' she said, ``and of course we will
comply with whatever directives the FAA issues.''
   The three hydraulic systems on the planes are designed to be
redundant, that is to operate independently and to back each other
up in case one fails.
   In the July crash, the tail engine on the DC-10 disintegrated,
knocking out all three hydraulic systems _ an event a McDonnell
Douglas release Friday called ``one in a billion.''
   The pilot lost virtually all control of the plane, which exploded
in flames in a corn field near the runway.
   Dale Warren, a vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co. who headed
the investigation of the crash, said the following modifications
will be made:
   _An electrically operated shutoff valve will be installed in the
supply line and a check valve in the return line of the No. 3
hydraulic system.
   _A check valve will be installed in the No. 3 hydraulic reservoir.
   _A cockpit light will be added to alert the crew if the shutoff
valve is activated.
   The new fast-acting shutoff valve, located just behind the back
wall of the cabin, will close automatically and the cockpit light
will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a
preset level in the reservoir.
   Even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage
to the tail section, as happened in Sioux City, the valve will stop
fluid flow through the No. 3 system, Warren said.
   With adequate hydraulic pressure thus preserved in that system,
the crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe
landing.

   Vitro S.A. extended its $280 million takeover
bid for Anchor Glass Container Corp. a second time, but the
Tampa-based glass maker said Friday it still recommends stockholders
reject the $20-per-share offer.
   Anchor spokesman Tom Davies said the nation's No. 2 glass maker
is still conducting talks the others interested in acquiring the
company.
   Vitro extended its offer until 5 p.m. EDT Sept. 21. The previous
deadline was 5 p.m. Thursday.
   Vitro, based in Monterey, Mexico, made the takeover offer Aug. 9.
It was one of the first unsolicited bids by a Mexican company for a
major U.S. manufacturer.
   Vitro announced Friday it has tendered about 66 percent of the
13.9 million shares outstanding of Anchor.
   Anchor's stock was trading below $10 a share the week before the
Vitro offer. Anchor closed Friday at $18.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

   Buyers in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico
and Canada can bid on Hereford cattle being sold here Sunday in what
is believed to be the first international satellite auction of
registered beef cattle, organizers said Friday.
   The first international satellite sale of registered beef cattle
will be beamed throughout the world and the United States to
television viewers who call in their bids to a telephone bank at the
auction here.
   ``We feel like this is going to be the way to go in the future,''
said Willard Wolf, the Northwest representative of the American
Hereford Association who proposed the satellite auction after
attending a similar ``sky bridge'' between U.S. and Australian wheat
farmers last January.
   Cattle ranchers in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico and the
United States can buy from 26 consignments of registered Hereford
bulls, heifers, semen and embryos by telephone and save the costs of
traveling to the auction, Wolf said.
   ``The price of an airline ticket would buy enough semen to
inseminate 20 cows,'' said Wolf, a Spokane rancher and co-chairman
of the event. ``This way, a breeder in Australia can make a $25
telephone call and save the cost of a ticket.''
   ``You no longer have to be in the heat of cattle country to have
a significant cattle sale,'' said Carey Hegreberg, program
coordinator and Spokane Area Chamber of Commerce representative.
   Sixty head of cattle from 11 states will be auctioned, as well as
frozen embryos and semen, said Wolf. Animals are expected to fetch
$2,500 to $20,000 apiece.
   Videotapes of animals not at the auction, or of bulls and cows
from which semen or embryos were taken, also will be shown, Wolf
said.
   The Foreign Agriculture Service of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and a veterinary corporation gave the pilot project
grants of more than $12,000, Hegreberg said.
   A USDA analysis of the event will largely determine whether
similar grant money is available in the future, Hegreberg said,
noting skepticism among some agriculture interests.
   The satellite auction may help to cut through some regulations,
restrictions and politics surrounding livestock imports and exports,
Wolf said. Logistics of transporting the sale animals and other
items will be worked out between the sales manager and buyers, he
said.
   ``We're very excited about it and we hope it will become an
annual event,'' said Wolf. If the pilot program is a success, plans
for next year call for satellite sales in Japan, where there is
strong interest in both dairy and beef herds, Hegreberg said.
   Future satellite auctions would not be limited to cattle, and
other agricultural commodities could be offered for sale, said
Hegreberg.

   A state judge on Friday refused to prevent
Universal Press Syndicate from pulling 26 comics and other features
from the Dallas Times Herald until the newspaper's lawsuit against
its main competitor is resolved.
   Judge David West said the Times Herald did not prove it would be
irreparably harmed if it lost the features as a result of a deal
between Universal Press and A.H. Belo Corp., parent company of The
Dallas Morning News.
   ``They didn't prove to the judge's satisfaction that irreparable
harm would take place and at the time of trial the Herald would
likely prevail,'' West said.
   The order took effect immediately, but West said he would not
hold the Times-Herald in contempt if some Universal Press features
continue to appear in the newspaper for a few days. The judge said
he realized some of the features were printed ahead of time and
couldn't immediately be withdrawn.
   A Universal Press official testified that The Morning News has
agreed to run all 26 of the comics and columns in question, and Belo
spokeswoman Jodie Hughes said some of them will appear beginning
Monday.
   ``We're very pleased with the decision, and now we can move on,''
Ms. Hughes said. She declined further comment.
   Times Herald Editor Roy E. Bode said the newspaper will continue
to pursue its antitrust case.
   ``We will fully and vigorously peruse all available legal
remedies in an attempt to recover these features and all damages to
the Dallas Times Herald,'' Bode said in a prepared statement.
   ``We will continue our suit and continue to fight for fair
competition in Dallas with all our energies,'' he said.
   The judge issued his decision after attorneys asked him to
indicate how he was leaning. He said that although he was ruling
from the bench, he had given much thought to the decision.
   ``No one thinks a one-newspaper town is advantageous. I'm taking
this very seriously,'' he said.
   He asked attorneys to agree on a trial date later this year for
the antitrust suit and set a Nov. 6 hearing to decide whether the
case should be transferred back to Dallas.
   ``I think the evidence overwhelmingly showed that this was a
fantastic business opportunity for The Morning News,'' the paper's
attorney, Bill Sims, said after the ruling.
   The Times Herald suit accuses Belo of unfairly increasing its
influence in the Dallas media market.
   Belo last month formed a joint venture with Kansas City-based
Universal Press to develop some of the syndicate's features for
television. As part of the agreement, Belo _ which also owns Dallas'
top-rated TV station, WFAA _ acquired exclusive rights to Universal
Press material.
   Universal pulled its features from the Times Herald, but the
newspaper regained the right to print them under a temporary
restraining order issued by West on Sept. 5.

   Wholesale prices declined for the third
straight month in August as a big new drop in energy costs helped
keep inflation in check, the government said Friday in releasing a
string of generally upbeat economic reports.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which
measures costs one step short of the retail level, plunged 0.4
percent last month, matching the decline in July. The index had been
down 0.1 percent in June.
   It was the first time that wholesale prices had fallen for three
consecutive months since a four-month drop from January through
April, 1986.
   Adding to the good economic news, the government said that
production at the nation's factories rose in August at its fastest
clip in four months while the U.S. trade deficit in July fell to its
lowest level in nearly five years.
   President Bush said the various government reports showed that
the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history was moving
forward, continuing ``to produce jobs for the American people.''
   Private analysts were generally enthusiastic as well, saying the
reports represented a victory for the Federal Reserve Board, which
has been trying at the same time to keep the recovery alive and
restrain inflationary pressures.
   ``From the Fed's viewpoint, all the news looks very good,'' said
David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. ``The only
danger is that Fed officials might sprain an elbow patting
themselves on the back.''
   While the trade report sent the dollar surging on foreign
currency markets, the stock market appeared unimpressed by the
favorable economic news, with the Dow Jones industrial average
rising 9.69 for the day.
   Prices on the bond market fell as traders focused not on the
overall 0.4 percent decline in wholesale-price inflation but in a
0.5 percent rise in inflation excluding the volatile energy and food
categories. This inflation figure is considered a better indication
of the economy's underlying inflation rate.
   While some private economists said the non-food, non-energy
inflation increase was worrisome, other analysts maintained that the
figure has had temporary monthly surges in the past without
signalling that the overall inflation rate was getting out of hand.
   ``Inflation is falling, not running away or accelerating as many
people have feared,'' said Lawrence A. Hunter, an economist at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Our forecasts indicate that inflation
will continue to decline.''
   The three-month string of declines in wholesale prices was
particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier
this year triggered by higher world oil costs and the lingering
effects on food supplies from last summer's drought.
   Wholesale prices were racing ahead at an annual rate of 9.4
percent from January through May. But, with prices falling since
June, the annualized inflation rate for the first eight months of
the year is a much more subdued 4.4 percent. For all of 1988,
wholesale prices rose 4 percent.
   In August, gasoline prices plunged 12.1 percent, their third
consecutive monthly decline, while natural gas prices dropped 5
percent and home heating oil costs fell 2.1 percent.
   Analysts said the good news on energy prices should soon be
coming to an end, however, given recent increases in crude oil
prices.
   Food costs posted a 0.3 percent rise in August, led by a 4.4
percent jump in beef prices and a 3.9 percent rise in the cost of
eggs. Prices of fruits, vegetables, chickens and turkeys all fell
during the month.
   The various changes left the Producer Price Index, before
adjusting for normal seasonal variations, at 113.3, meaning a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have
cost $113.30 in August.
   The Consumer Price Index, which measures retail-price inflation,
has also been moderating in recent months, with many economists
forecasting that the August report, due Tuesday, will show a slight
increase of around 0.2 percent.
   In the other economic reports Friday, the government said:
   _The merchandise trade deficit in July shrank by 5.3 percent from
the June figure to $7.58 billion, the smallest imbalance since
December 1984. The improvement reflected a 2.5 percent drop in
imports, which offset a 1.8 percent decline in U.S. export sales.
   _Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in August, the best
advance since a 0.7 percent rise in April. The gain was credited to
a rebound in mining after the end of a strike and a rise in
production at auto plants.
   _Business inventories in July climbed 0.6 percent while total
business sales were falling 0.9 percent. While rising inventories
and falling sales would normally be worrisome, economists noted that
August data was pointing to a rebound in sales, which should insure
that inventory levels stay at manageable levels.

   ``If you're looking for great pizza, make no Mcstake,'' say ads
that have been running in newspaper for the past few weeks in the
Evansville area, where McDonald's outlets have been selling pizza.
   ``We always use dough that's made fresh daily. Not McFrozen,''
the Pizza Hut ads say.
   The nation's largest pizza chain expanded the attack to
television commercials Thursday night.
   Pizza Hut launched the campaign in response to the addition of
pizza to menus at 24 McDonald's restaurants in southern Indiana and
western Kentucky earlier this summer. The McDonald's experiment is
aimed at attracting families and couples during the dinner hour, a
slack period in many fast-food outlets.
   The pizza, which comes in four varieties and ranges in price from
$5.84 to $9.49, is promised within 5{ minutes after customers place
an order.
   Although Pizza Hut owns about 22 percent of the $314
billion-a-year pizza market, it's not taking the McDonald's test
lightly.
   ``The television commercial is very humorous. We're being,
however, very serious to our approach to the McDonald's threat,''
said Roger Rydell, a spokesman for Pizza Hut in Wichita, Kan.
   ``We want to make it clear to them that we are very strong
competitors and make sure people are aware of the quality difference
between our two products,'' Rydell said Friday.
   Pizza Hut officials have not determined how long the advertising
campaign will last, Rydell said.
   ``It really depends on how long the test takes. Once we see
there's really no need to continue it, we'll discontinue it.''
   Rather than fighting back, McDonald's is ``McDelighted that they
noticed how good our test product is,'' said company spokesman Chuck
Rubner.
   ``We want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra
topping,'' he said.

<HEAD>Regulators Reportedly Preparing $1.1 Billion Fraud Suit Against Thrift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>

   Federal regulators are about to file a lawsuit
against Lincoln Savings and Loan Association seeking $1.1 billion in
damages from the failed thrift for alleged widespread fraud, experts
said Thursday.
   Several newspapers have reported that the Resolution Trust Corp.
would sue Lincoln, its parent American Continental Corp. of Phoenix
and officers of both companies.
   Stephen Pizzo, co-author of ``Inside Job,'' a book about fraud
among S&amp;Ls, said sources had told him the 150-page complaint was
readied six weeks ago but stalled when Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. lawyers took it to their counterparts in the Justice
Department for approval.
   FDIC spokesman David Barr in Washington denied knowledge of any
pending action against against the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift or
American Continental.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. was established under the sweeping
thrift bailout which President Bush signed into law Aug. 9.
   The Los Angeles Times and the Orange County (Calif.) Register
reported Thursday that the suit might invoke the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, which allows triple
damages in civil cases.
   American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. could not be
reached for comment Thursday. In the past the company has denied any
wrongdoing.
   The suit will allege misconduct in transactions involving a
tax-sharing plan, the high-yield corporate securities known as junk
bonds, a hotel in Detroit, a Dallas company and three Arizona
communities, Pizzo and others said.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14. It now is under
control of the RTC, and analysts said the Lincoln crisis will be the
new agency's costliest bailout.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, has said $1.5 billion had been lost ``in the Lincoln
fiasco'' and that discovery of further losses was inevitable.
   The government took over Lincoln the day after American
Continental filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law.
   Keating and his advisers also face a dozen class-action suits
filed by about 23,000 bondholders. American Continental has
responded by suing the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and FDIC to
remove Lincoln from federal conservatorship.
   In another development, a rating newsletter in Coral Gables,
Fla., listed Lincoln as the worst-performing thrift in the nation,
with $787.9 million in losses for the April-June quarter.
   Bauer Financial Reports Inc. said Lincoln accounted for 16
percent of the losses incurred by the 939 S&amp;Ls that ran in the red.

<HEAD>Oklahoma Oil Pioneer Dies At Age 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dean A. McGee, one of the founders of the
Kerr-McGee Corp., died Friday at Baptist Medical Center, hospital
officials said.
   He was 85. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   McGee was a pioneer in the offshore oil drilling industry that
helped elevate Kerr-McGee to a Fortune 500 company. He and the late
Sen. Robert S. Kerr were founders of the company that bears their
names.
   McGee was vice president of Kerr-McGee Oil Industries Inc. when
he backed a plan to construct the nation's first offshore oil
derrick and platform 10 miles into the Gulf of Mexico in 1947.
   Oil began to flow from that first well Nov. 15, 1947. It was
plugged in 1984 after producing 1.4 million barrels of crude and 307
million cubic feet of natural gas.
   ``It didn't take long for other companies to get out there,''
McGee said in a 1987 interview.
   McGee became president and chief executive officer of Kerr-McGee
in 1954 and became chairman in 1963. He retired as chairman and
chief executive officer in May 1983. He then became chairman
emeritus of the executive committee.
   McGee continued to be active, serving as treasurer last year of
the initiative petition drive to limit the length of legislative
sessions.
   McGee was born in Humboldt, Kan.
   Services are scheduled Monday at Westminster Presbyterian Church
in Oklahoma City.

   Jitters continued Friday in the junk bond market,
where trading remained thin amid wild rumors, further price drops
and lack of new information about the credit troubles of retailing
giant Campeau Corp.
   In response to one widespread market rumor, the Federal Reserve
Board late Friday denied through a spokesman that it planned a news
conference to discuss serious problems at an unnamed, major
commercial bank, whose creditworthiness allegedly had been battered
by the recent plunge in value of its junk bond holdings.
   Meanwhile, traders remained anxious for word on whether Campeau
was able to pull off a financial restructuring that would prop up
its own troubled high-yield junk bonds, which are the crux of the
market's current difficulties.
   One of Campeau's ailing businesses, Allied Stores Corp., was
scheduled to make a major loan payment Friday to prevent default on
its bonds, and Campeau was engaged in feverish negotiations with
investors to draw capital needed to pull off the rescue.
   Late Friday, Campeau said it had reached conditional agreement
with one of its major stockholders, Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd., on a $250 million loan to help meet the payment.
   Disclosure on Wednesday that Campeau might not be able to make
the payment sent the junk bond market into a tailspin, as panicky
investors dumped issues they deemed especially risky.
   Traders said there was very little dealing in Allied junk bonds
as well as the high-yield, high-risk bonds of Campeau's other retail
unit, Federated Department Stores Inc., which also is in financial
straits.
   Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult,
because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is, between
dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond _
instead of in bidding on an open exchange. Very few junk bonds are
listed on the American and New York Stock exchanges and tallies on
overall market volume are not available daily.
   Though quoted prices on a number of junk issues moved sharply
lower in recent sessions, traders noted there was little actual
buying and selling.
   Among distressed issues, Federated bonds have lost $200 per
$1,000 in face value in recent days while yields jumped to 28
percent, although traders said few of the bonds changed hands.
   But rumors that Campeau would meet the debt payment spiked
Federated bonds up $30 per $1,000 in face value around midday and
they held at those levels in later trading. Traders agree that
making the payment will help prop up Federated bonds, but they were
less optimistic that it would immediately cure the ills of the rest
of the market.
   ``In terms of lending credibility to the junk market as a whole,
it's not going to take just one day,'' said one trader.
   Even quality issues continued to be depressed on Friday, even
though there was no indication their creditworthiness had changed.
Some RJR Nabisco bonds lost $15 per $1,000 in face value, while Stop
'N Shop bonds, touched by trouble in the retail sector, also slipped
as much as $30 per $1,000.
   ``The trend in the market is separation between quality junk and
junky junk,'' one trader said. ``If people are going to start
reinvesting, they're going to feel a whole lot happier owning
quality.''
   One economist who spoke on condition of anonymity characterized
junk bonds as a daring investment fit only ``for a submarine
commander.''
   But others countered that junk bond investors typically are thick
skinned. ``People in the market are somewhat accustomed to `event'
situations like this,'' said one trader referring to Campeau's
domino effect on the market. She was confident emotions would settle
down and investors would sit tight.
   Critics have long complained about junk bond-financed leveraged
buyouts and restructurings, arguing that the big, high-interest rate
debt loads endangers a company's ability to repay. While
sophisticated investors will remain loyal to their pet junk issues,
one trader conceded that ``anyone who hated an LBO to begin with is
going to say `I told you so.'''

keep inflation in check, the government said.
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index, which

percent last month, matching the decline in July. The index had been
down 0.1 percent in June.
   It was the first time that wholesale prices had fallen for three

   Although he noted his ``clear competitive disadvantage,'' Davis

would own 75 percent of the company, British Airways PLC would own

<HEAD>Court Gives Eastern Extension on Disclosure Statement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday gave
strikebound Eastern Airlines an additional 60 days to file a
disclosure statement for its bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   At a hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland granted
Eastern's request that Friday's deadline for filing the statement be
extended to Nov. 13. The airline's unions opposed the request.
   If the deadline hadn't been extended, other parties would have
been free to file competing reorganization plans.
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
March 9, five days after the start of a strike by pilots, Machinists
and flight attendants. The Miami-based airline filed its proposed
reorganization plan July 21.
   The disclosure statement will contain details on Eastern's
financial position, including 5-year projections, the company has
said. The statement will describe how Eastern intends to emerge from
bankruptcy.
   Eastern recently revealed to creditors that it will have about
$370 million less in cash by year end than first projected, having
abandoned a plan to sell its Latin American routes. The airline has
been renegotiating with its creditors the repayment terms to reflect
the anticipated shortfall.
   Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. appears set to underwrite some of
Eastern's obligations. In another hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
this past week, Lifland approved a plan for payment of $98.3 million
Eastern owes to employee pension plans. Texas Air is lending Eastern
$45 million toward the payment, Eastern is paying $27 million with
the proceeds of asset sales, and the rest has been deferred until
July.

   Amoco's United Kingdom operations announced Friday

   Chicago-based Amoco Corp. said it has been approached by parties

interest in the Mainline Pipeline, about 250 service stations and
its interest in five product terminals.
   The sale would not include Amoco's synthetic fabric operations in
Dundee and Consett, or other affiliates in the United Kingdom, the
company said.
   Amoco said it is considering selling the refining and petroleum
product marketing operations as part of a long-term strategy to
divest such operations outside the United States.
   Amoco subsidiaries sold refining and marketing operations in
Italy, Australia and India in the mid-1980s.
   The Milford Haven refinery has a rated capacity of 108,000

   Campeau Corp. said Friday it had reached
conditional agreement with one of its major stockholders, Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd., on a $250 million loan to help the
struggling retail and real estate company meet interest payments due
on its bonds.
   However, Campeau was technically in default on one series of
bonds issued by its Allied Stores Corp. division. The company said
it was unable to make an interest payment on the bonds Friday.
   The Toronto-based Campeau said in a statement it had entered an
automatic 30-day grace period during which it could still make the
payment. Campeau said it had met a separate interest payment due on
another series of Allied notes.
   The loan from Olympia &amp; York would be used to provide cash for
Allied and Campeau's other retail unit, Federated Department Stores
Inc., to operate while Campeau refinances and restructures and to
meet their interest payments.
   The company said the loan from Olympia &amp; York was subject to
Campeau's bankers agreeing to several conditions, including
Campeau's securing from Citibank an extension until April 1990 of an
$800 million loan.
   Campeau said it was continuing negotiations with Citibank and the
other banks.
   The company announced last week that it was being forced to
restructure and put its prize Bloomingdale's department store chain
up for sale to cope with its massive debt, much of which was
incurred in the separate acquisitions of Allied and Federated.
   Campeau has approximately $11.5 billion in outstanding debt. Of
that amount, $3 billion is in short-term obligations, Carol Sanger,
a Campeau spokeswoman said from Cincinnati.
   Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York, which has a 24.5 percent stake in
Campeau, was expected to gain a larger interest in Campeau in
exchange for granting the loan. There has been speculation that
Chairman Robert Campeau, who owns nearly 54 percent of the
Toronto-based company, would relinquish his controlling interest.
   Ms. Sanger declined to confirm that Olympia &amp; York would increase
its interest in Campeau, but said the terms of the agreement between
the two companies would be announced when all details of the
restructuring were finalized.
   The Campeau statement described the loan as convertible, which
suggested the loan could be converted into stock in Campeau.
   The statement also indicated Olympia &amp; York would be taking an
active role in the management of the firm. Campeau said a management
group which was overseeing the restructuring would report to a
committe of directors, ``including representatives of minority
shareholders.''
   Without the loan from Olympia &amp; York, it appeared uncertain how
Campeau would be able to obtain credit so that its department stores
could stock shelves adequately before the crucial Christmas season.
   Campeau stock again did not trade Friday while the company
negotiated with Olympia &amp; York and its creditors. Trading in
Campeau's shares had been halted since Wednesday.
   Disclosure of the severity of Campeau's financial problems on
Wednesday rocked the market for high-interest ``junk bonds'' that
the company used to finance its buyouts of Allied and Federated and
contributed to a selloff in the stock market.
   The market waited Thursday and Friday for further word from
Campeau, but the lack of news kept the market on edge. Trading was
thin and dominated by rumors.
   On Thursday, Campeau reported a loss of $124 million in the three
months ended July 31 on revenue of $2.26 billion, compared to a loss
of $109 million and revenue of $2.21 billion a year earlier.

   The struggle over control of New
Hampshire's largest electric utility settled on four companies
Friday as the deadline passed for filing bankruptcy reorganization
plans.
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in January 1988, announced its plan to retain
control Tuesday and formally filed the proposal with the bankruptcy
court early Friday afternoon.
   Several hours later, United Illuminating of Connecticut became
the fourth to add its name to the list.
   Northeast Utilities, Connecticut's largest electric utility, and
New England Electric System of Westborough, Mass., filed their plans
earlier.
   The United Illuminating plan proposed a merger with Public
Service, the only plan to do so. It also called for electricity rate
increases of 5.5 percent a year for seven years for Public Service
customers, matching the rates proposed by Public Service and
Northeast Utilities if Seabrook operates.
   The New England Electric plan called for increases of 4.8 percent
during that period.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg endorsed the Northeast plan when it
was introduced in July, but then switched allegiance this week to
New England Electric because of the lower rates.
   But Charles Bayless, Public Service financial vice president,
called his utility the favorite to retain control because its plan
already has the approval of shareholders and creditors. Public
Service also needs only state regulators approval for its plan, he
said.
   The other utilities still would have to reach agreement with
shareholders and creditors, and get approval from the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
something Bayless said could prolong the bankruptcy case for two
more years.
   The fact that Public Service's payoff to creditors and
shareholders would be in securities while some of the other
proposals offered cash or a combination did not deter Bayless.
   ``To our creditors, getting paper in April is a heckuva lot
better than getting cash a year or two later,'' he said.
   The next step in the bankruptcy case will be hearings on the four
plans, which federal bankruptcy Judge James Yacos hopes to conclude
by mid-November. Then creditors and shareholders would vote on their
choice, and Yacos would make the final decision.
   Public Service, with almost 400,000 customers, filed for
bankruptcy under the burden of its 36 percent share of the $6.2
billion Seabrook nuclear plant. Negotiations have dragged on since
then for a reorganization plan that would satisfy creditors,
shareholders and the state.
   Public Service has the largest share of Seabrook, which has been
completed for three years, but has been unable to get a commercial
operating license. United Illuminating's 17.5 percent is the
second-largest share of Seabrook.
   New England Electric System and Northeast own smaller shares.
   United Illuminating valued its plan at $2.2 billion, matching the
value of the plan proposed by Public Service, regardless of whether
Seabrook operates commercially. New England Electric placed a $2
billion value on its plan if Seabrook runs, $1.9 if it does not.
Northeast valued its plan at $1.9 billion regardless.

   In an apparent effort to soften the impact of
travel bargains offered to fall vacationers, several major airlines
have raised a type of discount fare popular with business travelers.
   This past week the airlines hiked ``Supercoach'' one-way fares,
favored by business fliers because they have more lenient
advance-purchase requirements than cheaper discount fares and don't
require a Saturday-night stay.
   The ``Supercoach'' fares, usually 15 percent to 40 percent below
standard economy fares, were raised by around $20 for a one-way
ticket.
   For example, United Airlines' lowest ``Supercoach'' fare from New
York to Minneapolis has been increased from $221 one way to $241. A
three-day advance-purchase fare on American Airlines from Dallas to
Boston was boosted from $269 to $289.
   The action appears aimed at recovering part of the revenue lost
from the big industrywide fare cuts for the fall season announced in
mid-August. At that time, the carriers extended summer travel
bargains and cut round-trip fares by as much as $160 to lure
passengers in the historically weak autumn season. Most fares to
Europe were reduced by $100 into next spring.
   But the latest increase's effect is akin to putting a finger in
the dike, some analysts believe.
   ``The carriers are desperately trying to salvage a very serious
problem that has occurred,'' said Julius Maldutis, who follows the
airline industry for Salomon Brothers Inc. ``They have had a massive
erosion in yield. ... Any fare actions that are taken now are
basically to stem the damage.''
   An airline's yield, which reflects the average price of a ticket
paid by a passenger for each mile flown, has become the name of the
game in the competitive climate of the nation's airline industry.
   The increase was started by Midway Airlines, an aggressive
mid-sized carrier based in Chicago that is paying $210 million to
buy 16 DC-9 aircraft, as well as gates and other airport facilities
in Philadelphia, Washington and New York from strikebound Eastern
Airlines. Midway upped its ``Supercoach'' fares Wednesday by $10 one
way.
   The bigger carriers, including United, American, Trans World
Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and USAir Group
Inc., quickly matched the move. But they raised the fares by $20.
Some airlines raised ``Supercoach'' fares only in a few cities they
serve to match competitors, while others made widespread boosts.
   USAir spokesman David Shipley, for example, said that carrier was
increasing the fares in markets ``all over the country''. But Delta
is making the change only ``in a very, very few selected markets,''
said spokesman Jim Lundy.
   Eastern is ``considering some selective increases,'' said
spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   Continental, like Eastern a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., had
proposed six weeks ago eliminating many ``Supercoach'' fares, but
the move wasn't matched by competitors and it dropped the idea.
   ``It was an effort on our part to simplify the one-way fare
structure,'' said Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman in Houston.
