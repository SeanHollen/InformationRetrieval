<HEAD>Proposal Would End 5-year-old Dispute over Logging in Owl Habitat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and loggers are considering
a proposal that would protect woods where the rare spotted owl lives
but guarantee the timber industry could resume logging in other
areas of the Pacific Northwest.
   The proposal was made after a daylong meeting Saturday attended
by environmentalists, timber industry representatives, Oregon's
congressional delegation and Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said at the beginning of the session
that federal courts have blocked the harvest of 1.2 billion board
feet of timber scheduled for harvest in Oregon this year,
representing 28 percent of the annual harvest from federal lands in
the state.
   The courts have put off limits nearly a third of the federal
lands usually open for logging in Oregon and Washington in response
to lawsuits filed by environmentalists to save old-growth forests as
spotted owl habitat.
   The timber industry has estimated that 20,000 jobs could be lost
in Oregon by 1991 if federal court injunctions restricting timber
supply remain in force.
   Estimated to number fewer than 6,000 in the Northwest, the
spotted owl hunts and nests almost exclusively in old-growth forests
that produce the logs most prized by the timber industry. The bird
also has been proposed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   The proposal would guarantee the timber industry 8 billion board
feet of timber from national forests in Oregon and 1 billion board
feet from Bureau of Land Management forests over the next 15 months.
   In return, environmentalists would get legislation preserving
``significant'' old-growth stands and a commitment to adopt forest
planning processes that minimize fragmentation of remaining stands.
   Once agreed to, there would be no appeals of the type that have
tied up timber on federal lands.
   Hatfield gave both sides until Tuesday to decide whether to
accept the proposal.
   The meeting was the first time both sides in the 5-year-old
dispute have met.
   ``I think what the delegation has done here is unprecedented,''
said John Hampton, a timber company owner representing his industry
at the summit. ``I personally find the recommendation difficult to
accept.
   ``Once again we find our industry asked to ramp down,'' or reduce
the timber base, Hampton said. ``We never seem to ramp up.''
   ``Thinking of the 90,000 people who work in the timber industry,
I have to give it serious consideration,'' he said.
   Art Johnson, a lawyer representing environmentalists at the
meeting, was even less encouraging.
   ``There are a number of plaintiffs in the lawsuit,'' he said.
``We will respond as quickly as we can.''
   Johnson repeated his suggestion to go to mediation to achieve
agreement in the forest management dispute.

<HEAD>Federal Government Assigns Value to Alaska Wildlife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department has come up with a
specific dollar value for the thousands of birds, mammals and other
animals killed in the Alaskan oil spill, according to the Washington
Post.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It is the first time the rules have ever been applied to a
large-scale disaster such as the March 24 spill caused when the
tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Prince William Sound, the
newspaper reported in its Monday editions.
   For example, each of the furry seals was worth $15, seagulls were
worth $7.88, and Canadian geese were worth $35.74 each, the
newspaper reported. Striped bass were valued at $1.84 per pound.
   The figures were developed from a computer model which is
supposed to reflect the market value of the wildlife, the Post
reported. Similar computer models will be used to determine a market
value for the wildlife killed in three weekend oil spills in the
waters off the continental United States, the newspaper said.
   The bill will eventually be sent to Exxon, owner of the tanker
that spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   The damage assessment procedures have come under fire from
environmentalists, who argue that the rules don't account for the
long-term damage to the environment, the newspaper said.
   Thus far, the oil has washed up on 728 miles of beaches and the
dead wildlife count stands at 25,700 migratory birds, 800 sea
otters, 84 bald eagles, and 20 harbor seals, the Post said.
   But at this point, it isn't yet even clear who will pay for the
damage assessment, the Post said. That is expected to take up to
five years and cost $100 million, but Exxon has paid $15 million.

<HEAD>NRC Spurned By Three Seabrook Officials On Shutdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors
told three Seabrook nuclear plant employees they should shut the
reactor down before a plant operator belatedly responded, NRC
officials said.
   But Noel Dudley, who was present as senior NRC inspector at the
plant, denied previous allegations that NRC officials had to grab
anyone to get a response, as one prominent Seabrook critic alleged.
   U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Friday that he was told by
commission officials, including Chairman Lando Zech, that an NRC
official grabbed a plant operator prior to Thursday's unplanned
shutdown.
   The Boston Sunday Globe reported details of the shutdown based on
interviews with Dudley, plant officials and others. The shutdown on
the 10th day of low-power tests at the $6 billion plant, prompted
the NRC to suspend further tests pending a thorough review.
   Plant officials said Thursday's events began when a
malfunctioning valve on the non-nuclear side of the plant produced
changes in readouts from a component called a pressurizer on the
nuclear side. Under plant procedures, the change was sufficient to
warrant a shutdown, spokesman Ron Sher said Sunday.
   One NRC inspector and then Dudley approached three different
plant officials pointing out the problem, but got no immediate
results, the Globe said. Minutes later, an operator did shut down
the plant.
   ``They were making a conscious decision to attempt to regain
pressure control'' even though plant procedures called for a
shutdown, Dudley said.
   Sher said the operator in charge ``chose to continue to monitor
plant conditions because they were returning to the test condition.
... Several minutes later, the operator recognized that the plant
condition was still not within the parameters of the test procedure,
and then he shut the plant down.''
   The Globe said an unidentified NRC inspector first approached
Seabrook's startup manager about the pressure reading. ``When the
manager did not respond, the NRC inspector approached the test
director, who was closer to the scene in the control room, and the
director agreed the plant should be shut,'' the paper said.
   ``But the test director then talked to the shift supervisor, a
higher-ranking official, who said that pressure was (correcting) on
its own and that there was no need to turn off the plant,'' the
paper said.
   ``Dudley stepped in at that point, approaching a still higher
Seabrook official, the assistant operators manager. The assistant
manager consulted the operations manager, `who acknowledged the
information and deferred to the decision of the shift supervisor to
continue to operate,''' NRC spokesman Steve Horwitz told the paper.
   Spokesmen have said neither the plant nor the public was
endangered.
   A decade behind schedule and 10 times over budget, the bitterly
contested plant won permission to conduct low-power tests earlier
this month. Delayed by one malfunction, the tests began June 13 and
had been running smoothly until the shutdown.

   The Coast Guard on Sunday slashed its
estimate of the amount of oil spilled at the mouth of Narragansett
Bay by more than 1 million gallons to 420,000 gallons.
   A wind shift blew much of the oil away from shore, but a
shellfishing ban remained in effect and beaches were closed again.
   Officials said they did not believe alcohol or drugs were
involved in Friday's spill but acknowledged that an initial test on
two crew members was mishandled.
   Elsewhere, oil was found on beaches in three states along the
Delaware River, where a tanker carrying 18 million gallons of
industrial heating oil leaked after running aground Saturday. The
ship was refloated early Sunday.
   It was reported earlier that 800,000 gallons had leaked from the
ship, but officials said that figure covered unaccounted-for oil and
included oil still aboard the vessel.
   In Texas, cleanup continued on the Houston Ship Channel in
Galveston Bay, where about 250,000 gallons of heavy crude oil
spilled after a barge collision. Officials said the weather and
currents had pushed most of it into a separate channel, where it
would be easier to clean up.
   Coast Guard Lt. Alan Brown said the latest estimate for the Rhode
Island spill from the World Prodigy was estimated at 420,000
gallons. Earlier Sunday it was estimated at 500,000 to 600,000
gallons, down from estimates of up to 1.6 million gallons made
shortly after the Greek-licensed tanker hit Brenton Reef on Friday.
   ``The 1.6 million was the most we could have potentially spilled
if all the oil leaked from all the tanks that were holed,'' Brown
said. `` good amount of the product that was in those tanks did not
leak out.''
   Crews worked overnight to pump the ship's remaining 6 millions
gallons into barges. Brown said the unloading probably would take
until Monday.
   Alan McKin, president of the cleanup company Clean Harbors,
worked with the World Prodigy's 28 crew members during the unloading.
   ``They're very sad about what's happened and show an awful lot of
remorse, particularly the first mate who's been working with us
unloading the tanks,'' McKin said. ``He just keeps talking about
it.''
   The wind shifted overnight and most of the oil was being blown
out to sea instead of onto the state's southwestern beaches, and
those beaches were reopened to swimming. They were closed again,
however, when the tide turned late in the day.
   Despite the offshore wind, the Coast Guard reported that a sheen
had been seen as far up the bay as East Greenwich, about 20 miles
away. But Brown said the sheen was the ``lightest concentration of
oil'' and not necessarily an environmental threat.
   Closer to Newport, however, the damage was plain. In Brenton Cove
in Newport Harbor, yellow muck had begun accumulating on the shore
and cleanup crews used a vacuum truck, booms and hundreds of
absorbent pads.
   About 200 National Guardsmen, 120 state prison inmates and some
200 volunteers fought the oil. Save the Bay, an environmental group
that coordinated the volunteers, reported at least 800 telephone
calls from people wishing to help. By midafternoon, authorities had
begun to withdraw the Guard and the volunteers.
   Thomas Walsh, a lawyer for Ballard Shipping, the tanker's owner,
said the company, registered in Liberia with operations in Greece,
will pay the cost of the cleanup.
   A statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect, and fin-fishing
and lobstering were discouraged, said Roger Greene of the state
Department of Environmental Management.
   Biologists said oil on the surface posed the greatest threat to
fish and lobster eggs and newly hatched offspring, while adult fish
and lobsters could swim beneath the contamination. Greene said
shellfish were at greatest risk because poisons become concentrated
in their bodies as they pump water through themselves to feed.
   Greene said two oil-soaked cormorants and a gull had been
spotted, and Robert L. Bendick Jr., director of the state Department
of Environmental Management, said a number of small lobsters had
been found dead, along with several birds. Two loons that were
discovered coated with oil were cleaned and released, he said.
   Coast Guard officials said the results of drug tests on the
ship's captain, Iakovis Georgudis, and mate, whose name was not
immediately available, would not be available until late Sunday or
Monday.
   Petty Officer Ellen Harrington of the Coast Guard district office
in Boston said the original urine sample was mishandled, reportedly
through improper refrigeration, and a second sample had to be taken
19 hours after the accident. But Harrington said the captain and
mate had volunteered for the tests and investigators did not believe
drugs or alcohol played any role in the accident.
   State Attorney General James E. O'Neil said he hoped to learn if
Georgudis violated state law by approaching too near the bay without
a pilot.
   Coast Guard Capt. Eric Williams of the Marine Safety Office said
the ship was just outside the pilot zone. But Gov. Edward DiPrete
said Georgudis admitted his failure to wait for a pilot was a
mistake, as was a course correction that sent the ship headed for
rocks.
   On the Delaware River near Wilmington, Del., the Uruguayan tanker
Presidente Rivera carrying 18 million gallons of industrial heating
oil that ran aground Saturday was taken to a refinery Sunday and
unloaded.
   Coast Guard patrols found beach contamination _ ranging from
heavy to light _ from Chester, Pa. to New Castle, Del. There was
also some contamination on the New Jersey side.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that the tanker was
having mechanical difficulties when it ran aground. ``It didn't look
like a navigational problem,'' Paul Ives, president of the Delaware
Bay and River Pilots Association, told the newspaper.
   In Texas, Coast Guard Chief Mark Kennedy said much of the oil
spilled in the Houston Ship Channel ended up in intersecting Bayport
Channel.
   ``Because of the weather we couldn't get much booms deployed to
direct more oil into the channel. But much of it is naturally
heading into the channel anyway,'' he said. The confinement of the
smaller channel will make cleanup easier, he said.
   Officials said environmental damage appeared minimal and that
most oil that washed ashore affected industrial property.
   ``There's no telling how long any cleanup will take, but I can
tell you this one will take less time than most others,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead.
   Of the 6,000 barrels spilled from the ruptured barge, about 4,000
barrels had been contained in the Bayport Channel. About 1,000
barrels already had been sucked from the channel by midday Sunday,
Morehead said.

   The defense minister told a military tribunal
Sunday that a decorated war hero charged with aiding the world's
most notorious cocaine ring gave Cuba a ``stab in the back.''
   Gen. Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro, spoke during
the presentation of charges against Division Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa
Sanchez at the first session of a tribunal of honor hearing the case.
   Ochoa is alleged to have had a three-year involvement with
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   But in his speech, Gen. Castro said Ochoa also was involved in
the smuggling of ivory and diamonds _ a new revelation in the
biggest scandal to rock Cuban power circles in 30 years of communist
rule.
   Ochoa's actions ``represent an outrage, a stab in the back to the
fatherland and a slap in the face,'' he said.
   The 47-member military tribunal of top-ranking officers met
behind closed doors at the Revolutionary Armed Forces headuarters in
downtown Havana all day. The session was to resume Monday.
   A 40-minute videotape of the hearing, including Gen. Castro's
entire speech, took up most of the 8 p.m. news program on state-run
television. A newscaster said eight witnesses, all military
officers, also testified at the hearing.
   Gen. Castro told the court that Ochoa should receive ``punishment
that sets an example'' because he was such a highly regarded officer.
   Authorities say Ochoa was the ringleader of officers who let
cocaine smugglers use Cuban military air bases and arranged for
drug-laden boats to be escorted through Cuba's territorial waters.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the tribunal will decide if the general is to be stripped of
his rank and ordered to stand trial.
   On June 2, Gen. Castro talked to Ochoa alone about the accusation
he smuggled ivory and diamonds, the defense minister said. He gave
no further details about the accusations.
   ``I hugged him and said that no matter what may happen, today,
tomorrow and always we (the military) would be his brothers,'' Gen.
Castro said.
   It was later, according to informaton that has appeared in the
official newspaper Granma, that Ochoa's connections to drug
trafficking and the Medellin Cartel came to light.
   During Gen. Castro's speech, Ochoa did not once look up and
appeared at times as if he were about to break down. He sat with his
head bowed and a tense look on his face.
   Among the officers on the honor tribunal are four division
generals, 31 brigadier generals, a vice admiral and rear admrial.
   Ochoa, 57, is a veteran of the Cuban revolution who was decorated
for his service as a field commander of Cuban troops in Angola. He
is one of only five officers ever awarded the medal of the Hero of
the Republic of Cuba.
   ``He was admired,'' Lt. Col Fidencio Frias Figueredo, a veteran
of the Angolan conflict, told Radio Rebelde on Sunday in one a
series of interviews on the drug scandal with soldiers and officers.
   ``They should apply the maximum penalty,'' Frias said. ``He has
betrayed the principles of the revolution, he has betrayed the
Revolutionary Armed Forces and, especially, he has betrayed our
maximum leader,'' Fidel Castro.
   Frias, who returned from his second tour of duty in Angola on
June 9, said many of his comrades in arms shared his anger.
``Ochoa's attitude makes our officers indignant,'' he said.
   Along with the indignation came the realization that not even
isolated Cuba is beyond the reach of the Medellin cartel.
   ``The amount of money that they control could turn anybody's
head. These people talk about $4 million like it was nothing,'' said
a Foreign Ministry official who asked not to be named.
   There were reports that U.S. officials wanted to talk to Ochoa.
The ministry official did not rule out the possibility.
   ``These things are from top level to top level,'' the ministry
official said. ``This sort of thing has been done before.''
   He would not elaborate.
   U.S. prosecutors say the names of some of the Cuban officers
surfaced in a 1987 probe of a smuggling ring that culminated in two
indictments and a 1988 trial.
   In addition to Ochoa, Cuban authorities have arrested a brigadier
general, two colonels, a lieutenant colonel, a captain and a major.
   U.S. authorities say an undercover agent flew into Cuba's
Varadero air base in 1987 escorted by Cuban MiGs, and used Cuban
military frequencies.
   Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, has
said that U.S. allegations about Cuba being a way station for
cocaine traffickers prompted Castro to order the investigation that
led to the arrest of Ochoa and the other officers.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
has halted or is reviewing payments to nine mortgage companies that
finance federally-backed housing in its coinsurance program,
according to the Washington Post.
   The action is part of an attempt to head off another potential
scandal for the agency, which is the target of congressional
investigations involving allegations of influence peddling in HUD
housing contracts.
   Coinsurance permits private lenders to earn lucrative fees by
making mortgage loans to federally-backed housing programs. But HUD
assumes most of the losses if a project defaults. The program is
designed to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of
moderately priced housing.
   HUD has approved a four-month moratorium on new participants for
the program, the Post reported in its Monday editions, after a
recent review by the HUD inspector general found mismanagement and
alleged fraud in the program. Almost $700 million worth of mortgages
are in default, it said.
   Three lenders were thrown out of the program in March and six
others were put on six-month probation, the Post said.

   A tropical storm watch was posted Sunday along the
northwestern Gulf Coast as the season's second tropical depression,
laden with heavy rain, drifted slowly northward toward Texas.
   ``The surfing and windsurfing are real popular today _ they're
out there right now,'' Corpus Christi police dispatcher Richard Diaz
said. ``Right now it's just raining and the tide is up a little bit,
but another 24 hours and it may be another story.''
   In places along the coast, tides were running 2 to 3 feet above
normal with 6- to 8-foot waves, officials said.
   If the storm strengthened, it could become Tropical Storm Allison.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression's poorly defined center was
near latitude 27.5 degrees north, longitude 96.2 degrees west, or
about 70 miles south of Matagorda, Texas, said meteorologists at the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. It appeared to be stalled,
meteorologists said.
   The depression's top sustained wind was estimated at 35 mph, with
higher gusts in heavy rain areas north and east of the center.
   A tropical storm watch was posted for an area stretching from
Baffin Bay, Texas, to Morgan City, La., advising coastal residents
that a tropical storm or incipient tropical storm conditions may
pose a threat. If the sustained wind hits 39 mph, the depression
would become a tropical storm.
   The Galveston County beach patrol banned swimming in the choppy
surf.
   ``It's got the gulf kicked up pretty nasty out there right now,''
beach patrol director Vic Maceo said. ``We're trying to keep all the
inexperienced surfers out of the water.''
   The National Weather Service also extended a coastal flood
warning Sunday for Matagorda and Brazoria counties south of Houston.
   ``We have had some minor flooding in Bay City proper, but it's
only been on a few secondary streets,'' said Craig Sharp, spokesman
for the Matagorda County Sheriff's Department.
   ``The ground is saturated and, of course, if we get a lot more
rain we expect the situation to deteriorate,'' Sharp said.
``Fortunately, so far, the rainfall has been coming in small bands
and the water is still having a chance to run off at this time.''
   The Matagorda area received about 10 inches of rain Saturday,
officials said.
   ``We don't have any reports of flooding yet, but the water's up
high and there's no beach right now,'' said Brazoria County
Sheriff's Department dispatcher Donna Fillmore.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., who moved his
family to a safe house after allegedly being threatened by the
city's airport commissioner, appeared at a Democratic meeting
Saturday accompanied by police.
   Luther Boykins was arrested late Friday for allegedly threatening
Schoemehl, police said. Police said Boykins was charged with two
misdemeanor counts of third-degree assault that can be based on oral
threats. Boykins allegedly made the threats after the mayor
supported legislation that limited the duties of Boykins' ex-wife,
Billie Boykins, who is the city's license collector.
   ``He specifically said he was going to catch me at my home this
weekend,'' Schoemehl said Saturday. ``I'll just wait until the
police say it's OK to go back.''
   The mayor was escorted by four plainclothes police officers
during an appearance Saturday at an annual meeting of St. Louis
County Democrats in suburban Bridgeton.
   Schoemehl, who launched the effort earlier this year to reduce
Billie Boykins' power, said he moved his family late Friday to the
safe house because of threats Luther Boykins made to two mayoral
aides.
   The alleged threats apparently came shortly before the Board of
Aldermen on Friday voted 16-13 vote to strip Billie Boykins of her
tax-collecting duties. Circuit Attorney George Peach has filed a
lawsuit against her, alleging she lost city money totaling $242,550
in unearned interest and principal because of $2.7 million she
invested in a mutual fund.
   Billie Boykins, 43, a Democrat who was elected in 1982 and
re-elected in 1986, also faces felony drug charges in Bloomington,
Ill., that stem from her arrest near there last fall.
   The board's action Friday reduced Billie Boykins' staff of 54 to
three. It also drastically reduced her $1.1 million budget.
   After it was passed, administrative employees began changing
locks on doors and setting up barricades at the public entrance to
her City Hall office.
   Luther Boykins was released later Friday. He was scheduled to
appear in St. Louis Circuit Court July 6.

   Headline writers gathered Saturday for the
first awards program devoted to honoring their skills.
   The Wuxtry Awards, named for the garbled cry of ``Extra!'' by
newsboys, were created by the International Society for General
Semantics and its journal Et cetera to honor the best _ and worst _
in headlines.
   The Houston Post and the Daily News in New York shared the Wuxtry
prize for best headlines on a given day, while David Sanford, who
edits front-page feature stories for The Wall Street Journal, won
the $1,000 Wuxtry Award for individual achievement in headline
writing.
   ``It's a very interesting, nice job,'' Sanford said. ``Anonymous.
And thankless.''
   One of ten headlines submitted by Sanford topped a story about a
city in Yugoslavia where people wear no clothes: ``Dressing for
dinner remains an issue in the naked city.''
   Finalist Donald Russell of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote his
entry on a story about Prince Charles' horse testing positive for
drugs: ``Just Say Neigh.''
   And David Hall, a finalist from The Orlando Sentinel, submitted
the following on a story describing the difficulty of finding a
taxicab in the Soviet Union: ``Death and Taxis in the U.S.S.R.''
   Russell Joyner, executive director of the semantics society, said

   Con Edison signed a tentative agreement with a
union representing 600 utility workers early Sunday and agreed at
midnight Saturday to extend a strike deadline by 48 hours with
another union.
   Con Ed spokesman Marty Gitten said the tentative agreement was
reached at about 2 a.m. Sunday with Local 3 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Talks recessed for the night and were to continue later Sunday
with Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America, which represents
14,000 people.
   The utility unions had set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m.
Sunday. Their three-year contract expired at midnight.
   The unions, which represent clerical and technical workers, have
been seeking improvements in pensions and job safety.
   Gitten said no details would be made public of the tentative
agreement signed by Con Ed and Local 3 pending the union's
notification of its members.
   Earlier, Bea Meltzer, a Con Ed spokeswoman, said that 6,000
management employees would run the utility in the event of a strike,
as they did when the unions last went on strike in 1983 for nine
weeks.

   The Coast Guard on Sunday cut its estimate
of an oil spill from the tanker World Prodigy in Rhode Island Sound
by two-thirds.
   Meanwhile, a tanker that spilled an estimated 800,000 gallons in
the Delaware River on Saturday near Wilmington, Del., was floated
early Sunday. Patrols working overnight found beach contamination
from the spill.
   Lt. Alan Brown of the Coast Guard said the Rhode Island spill was
now estimated at 500,000 to 600,000 gallons, far below initial
estimates of up to 1.6 million gallons. The spill occurred Friday
after the tanker hit Brenton Reef at the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   ``The 1.6 million was the most we could have potentially spilled
if all the oil leaked from all the tanks that were holed,'' Brown
said. ``A good amount of the product that was in those tanks did not
leak out.''
   A helicopter inspection of the area Sunday morning showed less
beach damage than officials had feared. The wind shifted overnight
and most of the oil was being blown out to sea, instead of onto the
state's southwestern beaches, said Gary Ott of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The oil remaining in the tanks was being held in place by the
water that rushed in through the holes in the ship's bottom, Brown
said. Crews worked overnight on the delicate task of pumping oil
onto barges.
   The Coast Guard reported early Sunday that a sheen of oil from
the World Prodigy had been seen as far up the bay as East Greenwich,
about 20 miles.
   In the Delaware River spill, Coast Guard patrols worked through
the night and found shoreline contamination _ ranging from heavy to
light _ from Chester, Pa., to New Castle, Del. There is also some
contamination on the New Jersey side.
   In a third oil spill, about 250,000 gallons of heavy crude oil
spilled from a tug-driven barge in a collision with a cargo vessel
Friday night in the Houston Ship Channel at Galveston Bay, Texas.
   Together, the accidents spilled about 1.5 million gallons of oil.

   Communist hard-liners who purged party chief Zhao
Ziyang appear to have skirted drastic measures that could have
further split the party and alienated the nation.
   Their announcement of his replacement on Saturday also indicated
that, though hard-line conservatives now dominate, the economic
reforms championed by Zhao and other moderates will not be abandoned.
   Zhao's own fate remains unclear, but he may have escaped the
worst-case scenario of a public trial.
   Although he was accused of backing student protesters and sowing
discord in party ranks, 69-year-old Zhao was apparently allowed to
keep his party membership and was not branded a
``counterrevolutionary.'' That is how party leaders are now labeling
the pro-democracy activists whose movement led to Zhao's downfall.
   In addition, in announcing his replacement by Shanghai party
leader Jiang Zemin, party leaders made no mention of criminal
charges against Zhao.
   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power after he opposed
a decision by Premier Li Peng and senior leader Deng Xiaoping to
declare martial law in Beijing and bring in troops to put down the
student movement.
   However, the party Central Committee, in announcing Zhao's
ouster, acknowledged his contributions to the nation's open-door
policy and economic reforms during nine years as premier and then
party general secretary.
   Zhao has won popularity among Chinese students and intellectuals
for stressing that political reforms, such as greater popular
participation in public affairs, must accompany the market-oriented
economic reforms that China has pursued over the past decade.
   Like the late Hu Yaobang _ Zhao's predecessor who was purged
after smaller student demonstrations two years ago _ Zhao was
accused of a ``passive approach'' toward ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or favoring Western ideals.
   In consolidating their control, hard-line party leaders cleaned
house elsewhere over the weekend. They removed moderate Hu Qili from
the powerful Standing Committee of the ruling Politburo, and they
ousted two Zhao allies from the Secretariat, the party's
administrative office.
   However, they did not accuse them of specific wrongdoings.
   More Zhao followers are bound to lose their positions as the
hard-liners weed out lower-ranking moderates in coming weeks.
However, such purges could be less sweeping than many have feared.
   In addition, it appears that China's economic reforms and
interest in foreign investment are safe.
   Jiang represents China's new echelon of leaders who are
well-educated, sophisticated in world affairs, and believers in the
idea that China must maintain its open-door policy to achieve
prosperity.
   The other two new members of the Politburo Standing Committee,
Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan and economist Song Ping, are also regarded
as firm supporters of keeping China open to the world.
   Over the weekend, party leaders in a communique outlined four
``important tasks.''
   The first task is to ``quell the counterrevolutionary
rebellion,'' it said.
   Second, China must continue to improve its economic environment _
meaning cool down the current overheated economy _ so as to further
economic reform and the open-door policy.
   The third task, reflecting the hard-liners' line, calls for
enhancing ideological and political work, promoting such ideas as
patriotism, socialism and hard work, and opposing bourgeois
liberalization.
   The fourth, responding to some of the demands put forth by the
students, said the party must enhance democracy and the legal system
and fight corruption.
   It said China will continue its independent foreign policy and
that the nation ``must not return to the old closed-door path.''

   The Stockholm daily Svenska Dagbladet quoted Pehr G. Gyllenhammar

public transportation and save cities from ``choking.''
   Gyllenhammar said city councils should improve and expand fleets
of buses, trolleys, subways and taxis, according to the newspaper.
   Proposals made by others to reduce pollution and congestion
include building a ring around Stockholm and forcing motorists to
buy monthly passes costing $31 to bring their cars into the capital.

<HEAD>Waiting For Missouri Decision Prompts High Anxiety in Many Places</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in a
Missouri abortion dispute is no lonely vigil.
   Never, it seems, have so many waited so anxiously, or made such a
public display of their anxiety.
   The potential stakes are enormous. The court is being asked to
use the Missouri case, called Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, to reverse or substantially limit its 1973 decision that
women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   Such a ruling could allow states to outlaw abortion, or otherwise
curtail legal abortions, which number 1.5 million each year.
   With time running out on the court's 1988-89 term, partisan
lawyers gather in the hushed courtroom each day before the 10 a.m.
starting time to catch the first word. Interest groups make known
their availability to supply instant reactions. Scores of reporters
jam the courtroom press row and the court's public information
office a floor below. Satellite transmission trucks are parked
nearby.
   Each day, the word passes quickly: ``No Webster today.''
   Meanwhile, rumors rise _ and then crash to earth.
   At least one such erroneous rumor got into print, after Arkansas
Attorney General Steve Clark went public with the ``scuttlebutt''
out of Washington that the decision would be announced June 19.
   ``We've never been through anything quite like this,'' says court
spokeswoman Toni House. ``Hectic,'' she offers as a one-word summary.
   The most senior reporter covering the court, Lyle Denniston of
The Baltimore Sun, says the anticipation is rivaled only by that
experienced before the 1976 decisions reinstating capital punishment
and the 1978 ruling in which the court first condoned the concept of
affirmative action.
   ``Here you have the court contemplating taking away a
constitutional right it created itself. The fact that is a real
prospect now has captured everyone's attention,'' he said.
   Only two ``decision days'' remain on the court's schedule _
Monday and Thursday.
   On the day the abortion ruling is announced, the National
Abortion Rights Action League will conduct an 11:30 a.m. news
conference to give its appraisal of the Webster decision.
   Planned Parenthood will host a similar affair at noon; the
Congress Pro-Life Leadership and National Right to Life Committee at
1:30; the American Life League at 2. The list goes on.
   A special edition of ``Washington Week in Review'' is planned for
public television.
   Many such organizations for weeks have sent representatives to
the court to harvest each day's decision crop _ a recent day's
single-file line stretched past 100.
   Messengers for the American Civil Liberties Union, the American
Bar Association, the National Organization for Women, the American
Life Lobby, congressional subcommittees and even one representing
columnist George Will share a peaceful coexistence.
   The abortion dispute officially has become the most closely
watched case of the 1980s. A record number _ 78 _ of
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs was filed by individuals and
organizations not part of the Missouri litigation.
   In a less formal, and likely less effective, form of lobbying,
hundreds of thousands of Americans wrote and telephoned the court to
express their views.
   In the weeks leading up to the April 26 argument session
conducted for the case, more than 20,000 letters addressed to the
justices arrived daily. The court's two switchboards were so flooded
with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.
   ``It's been a zoo,'' Ms. House said.

<HEAD>Soldiers Accused of Killing Unarmed Civilian Fined, Back on Duty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young British soldier accused
of killing an unarmed civilian at a border checkpoint has returned
to duty after being fined by the military, the British army said
Sunday.
   Pvt. David Jonathan Holden was 18 when Aiden McAnespie was shot
in the back in February 1988 as he walked past a British army
checkpoint near Aughnacloy, half a mile from the border of Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
   McAnespie, 23, was a worker for Sinn Fein, the legal political
wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to
drive the British out of the province. The British army said a heavy
machine gun slipped in Holden's wet hands after it had been cleaned
and went off by accident.
   An investigation by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's police force, concluded one of the three shots fired from
the gun bounced off the road and struck McAnespie in the back.
   But Roman Catholic leaders in the predominantly Protestant
province said McAnespie had been regularly harassed by the army.
   Holden was charged with manslaughter but the charge was dropped
in September for what the prosecuting lawyer said was a lack of
evidence.
   A military inquiry has since decided to fine Holden and return
him to his regiment and full duty, said an army spokesman, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   He would not say how large the fine was. He said Holden had been
held in civilian and military custody for six months while the case
was being decided.
   The Irish government launched a separate police investigation
into the shooting, saying a member of the Irish security forces saw
the incident from across the border. The result of the investigation
was never made public.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the main Roman Catholic party in Northern Ireland, criticized
the way the investigations were handled.
   He said he was surprised ``that the army can find evidence to
discipline him through a fine but that this evidence was not made
available to the director of public prosecutions in relation to the
manslaughter charge.''
   Also Sunday, the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed
responsibility for the fatal shooting of a Roman Catholic bartender
in the city of Lisburn.
   The Protestant paramilitary group made its claim in a statement
to Belfast news media.
   Police said at least three men took part in the attack Saturday
on Liam McKee, 36, smashing down the front door of his house with
sledgehammers and shooting him through a bedroom door as he
struggled to keep them out.
   McKee's mother and brother were in the house southwest of Belfast
at the time but were not injured, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years of political
and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.

   Police said they arrested 42 people and broke up a

``supermarket of heroin.''
   The operation supplied cocaine to the Sicilian Mafia in exchange
for heroin that was sold in Rome and exported to Canada, police said
Saturday.
   Authorities did not give further details about the Rome drug ring
but said it sold tens of millions of dollars of heroin.
   Police announced they arrested 32 people in Rome and 10 in the
Sicilian cities of Siracusa and Catania and charged them with drug
trafficking and racketeering. Three others named in arrest warrants
were being sought.

10-hour shooting spree in Oria, a town outside Brindisi, Italian

   Pope John Paul II has named Monsignor Georg
Sterzinsky bishop of Berlin, the Vatican announced.
   The opening was created in December after the pope appointed
Berlin Cardinal Joachim Meisner head of the archdiocese of Cologne,
one of the most influential church posts in Europe.
   Sterzinsky, 54, was vicar general of the apostolic administrator
of Erfurt-Meiningen in East Germany.
   The Vatican said Saturday it complied with a 1929 concordat under
which local clerics help select new bishops. The Berlin clerics
chose Sterzinsky from three candidates nominated by Rome, and the
pope approved their choice.
   Meisner's appointment in December ended a 15-month standoff
between the Vatican and Cologne clerics, who viewed Meisner as too
conservative. A few days before his appointment, the Vatican
declared that the pope had the right to name the Cologne prelate
even if the local church opposed the choice.

<TEXT>
   Scores of youths armed with sticks, stones and
metal rods stormed a village police station in the Soviet republic
of Kazakhstan, but authorities repelled the attack and arrested 51
people, Pravda said Sunday.
   At least four people have died since ethnic riots broke out June
17 in the oil-producing region of the Central Asian republic.
   Authorities have brought in hundreds of security troops and
declared a curfew to control unrest in the city of Novy Uzen, but
Pravda reported that disturbances have spread to at least five other
municipalities.
   In the town of Mangyshlak, ``a crowd of 150 people armed with
sticks, stones and metal rods attacked a village police station but
was dispersed by helicopters,'' the newspaper said. It did not
elaborate.
   The newspaper quoted Maj. V. Sivushov, an Interior Ministry
spokesman, as saying 51 people were arrested. It said the incident
had occurred in the past 24 hours, but it did not say exactly when.
   A gang of hooligans smashed windows in two trailers housing
workers in the village of Kulsary, then poured gasoline on the
trailers and set them on fire, Pravda said. It did not say whether
anyone was injured.
   The newspaper said ethnic violence had flared in at least five
villages near Novy Uzen, a city of 56,000 people about 800 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   Kazakhstan is the third Soviet Central Asian republic hit by
ethnic violence in the last two months. In the worst rioting, about
100 people died in the Fergana Valley region of Uzbekistan earlier
this month.
   Riots also have been reported in the republic of Tadzhikistan.
   The rioters in Novy Uzen are demanding authorities evict all
members of Caucasus ethnic groups from the city _ more than
one-third of the population. Native Kazakhs complain the Caucasian
settlers dominate oil industry jobs and receive preferential
treatment in housing and other benefits.
   Pravda said 100 ethnic Caucasians were evacuated from the town of
Yeraliev after asking local authorities to guarantee their safety.
   Since the curfew was imposed, the situation in Novy Uzen has
partially stabilized, Pravda said. ``The work of public transit is
being restored. All food shops, canteens and kindergartens are open
and half of the public services are working,'' the newspaper said.
   The town's Communist Party leadership on Saturday fired the Novy
Uzen party chief and replaced him with a prominent local engineer,
Pravda said. It did not elaborate.
   Violence has also been reported recently in the Central Asian
republic of Tadzhikistan, according to reports reaching Moscow over
the weekend.
   The republic's party daily, Kommunist Tadzhikistana, said about
2,000 Meskhi Turks who fled violence in Uzbekistan were attacked on
June 11 in a refugee camp by a mob of 1,000 people demanding they be
moved elsewhere.
   At least two people died and five were wounded when guards
protecting the refugees fired on the gang, the newspaper said.
   Following the attack, authorities began evacuating the Meskhi
Turks by air to central Russia, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   At dawn each day, two Afghans haul two
bags of hard-boiled eggs, sheep and calves liver nine miles to a
Kabul suburb.
   Basir Amiri and Ismail Kazami are responsible for feeding 80,000
Danish rainbow trout being bred in a swimming pool and eight canals
in a former tourist resort.
   The complex was closed a decade ago when Moslem guerrillas
launched their campaign to overthrow the pro-Soviet government.
   The war not only has left 1.3 million people dead and forced at
least 5 million into exile but also has created food shortages.
Animal breeding has nearly come to a standstill, poultry farms have
closed and fields of many farms have been barren for years.
   The fish-breeding project is one of several projects backed by
the United Nations in Afghanistan. The government took over the
resort and last year turned over parts of it to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
   ``It is a humble effort. We are trying to utilize whatever
facilities we have to provide more protein to the Afghans,'' said
Hari Dewan, chief of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
which oversees the breeding project.
   ``The Afghans are basically red-meat eaters, but we are trying to
tell them to eat fish, if and when available,'' Dewan said.
   In March 1988, the FAO flew 200,000 frozen fish eggs from Denmark
within 36 hours, hatched them in indoor wooden troughs at the resort
and transferred them to the canals that are fed by nearby Kargah
Lake. Eighty thousand have survived.
   ``The trout were doing very well, but soon there was a problem of
space,'' Dewan said. ``We asked the government to give us the unused
swimming pool.''
   There are now about 50,000 trout in the pool.
   The Afghans love meat, and all main dishes are supposed to have a
large portion. Even though meat is available in Kabul, home of 2.25
million people, the price is often too steep for most.
   The government has frozen the price of nan, the flat bread that
is the main staple of the Afghan diet, at about six afghanis, 10
cents at the official exchange rate.
   But the price of mutton has risen about 40 percent this year. A
pound of mutton costs about $6.70. An unskilled laborer in
Afghanistan earns about $60 a month.
   ``Now Afghans hardly get meat to eat. It is very expensive,''
said Syed Ahmed, who runs a downtown restaurant.
   ``I feel bad to ask my brothers (Afghans) for a high price, so I
sell only a very limited amount,'' he said.
   Dewan said 16 tons of rainbow trout will hit the market in a
couple of weeks.
   ``It will be a test case. We will follow up the project depending
on the success and response,'' he said.
   According to a U.N. report on Afghanistan, most Afghans are
malnourished. The average life expectancy is 41 years, and the
infant mortality rate is 200 per 1,000 children.
   ``If the project is successful, it will be good news,'' Dewan
said.

<HEAD>Venice Votes Whether to Split into Two Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents voted Sunday on whether they want
to turn Venice into two cities, cutting adrift the soggy section of
town that tourists love but locals are leaving.
   The nonbinding referendum proposes splitting Venice proper _ the
historic and romantic maze of canals and islands _ from Mestre, a
bedroom community across a bridge to the mainland.
   Residents of both communities were voting Sunday and Monday, and
Mestre residents outnumber Venetians 3-1. Results were to be
announced after the completion of voting.
   Ten years ago, a group of influential Venetians lobbied for a
similar referendum. That proposal was defeated, with more than 72
percent of the voters opposed to separation.
   This year's referendum was pressed by Mestre, which has been
steadily absorbing Venice's population. Lacking affordable housing,
young Venetians have been moving to the mainland.
   In 1951, Venice had 175,000 people while Mestre had about 50,000.
In 1987, Venice's population stood at 83,000 while Mestre had
250,000.
   Remaining Venetians, complaining of the scarcity of grocery
stores, go to Mestre to do their shopping. Venice's tourist
development has been virtually unchecked, with shop after shop
converted into sourenir stores.
   Mestre politicians say the growing community's needs are
different from those of aging, tourist-choked Venice and that
Mestre's identity is overwhelmed by Venice's fame.
   Sunday's referendum was consultative only. A vote in favor of
separation would have to be approved by the regional Veneto
government.
   The result will be announced after the completion of voting
Monday afternoon.
   Also voting in a consultative referendum was the seaside city of
Ostia, on whether to split from Rome, 17 miles inland.

<HEAD>Chinese Media Backs Party Purge of Zhao</HEAD>

   China moved Sunday to justify the ouster of the
head of the Communist Party and reinforce the supremacy of the party
in the face of ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   ``The Communist Party is the party to fight for the interests of
the people,'' the official People's Daily said in an editorial, one
day after party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was purged for
``supporting the turmoil'' of pro-democracy protests.
   The party ``decided on a series of resolute measures and finally
was victorious in the struggle,'' the daily said.
   The Party Central Committee on Saturday announced the dismissal
of Zhao and fellow moderate Hu Qili from their party posts and
appointed Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin the new head of the
47-million-member party.
   Jiang, 62, is expected to follow the party line of promoting
China's economic relations with the world while dealing harshly with
political dissent at home.
   The national media, now firmly controlled by hard-liners, offered
a drumbeat of support Sunday for the Central Committee's decisions.
   The nightly television news, expanded from 30 minutes to an hour,
was filled with statements from Chinese supporting Zhao's dismissal.
   Zhao, 69, was reportedly forced from power by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng after opposing their decision to impose
martial law on Beijing and use arms to crush the student
pro-democracy movement.
   ``I previously didn't understand Zhao Ziyang,'' said one of about
a dozen citizens interviewed on television, all who supported the
party policy. ``Now I understand the party is right.''
   Television also showed soldiers, factory workers, teachers, coal
miners and party officials from around the country talking about the
party meeting and nodding their assent to its stance on what it
calls a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   About 1,800 people have been reported arrested since the June 3-4
military crackdown in Beijing. The crackdown of the 7-week-old
movement prompted protests in more than a dozen cities.
   The state has demanded all student and worker activists turn
themselves in, and it has detained or questioned hundreds of
journalists, academics, professionals and government workers who
supported the drive for a freer China.
   There has been speculation that Zhao, who has not been seen in
public since May 19, would be put on trial for counterrevolutionary
activities.
   Jiang, the new general secretary, worked actively to open
Shanghai to foreign investment and rebuild its industrial base in
four years as mayor and party chief. He was also regarded as being a
hard-liner on dissent, and moved swiftly to arrest those who joined
in disturbances in China's largest city.
   While Jiang remained quiet, the official media continued to urge
all Chinese to learn from a June 9 speech by Deng.
   The 84-year-old Deng, in the speech to military commanders,
blamed counterrevolutionary agitators for taking advantage of the
student unrest to try to overthrow the Communist Party. He praised
the army for crushing the ``rebellion.''

<HEAD>NASA to Astronauts: Don't Risk Your Necks Until We Tell You To</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With no public announcement, NASA's director of
flight crew operations a year ago issued the first written order
prohibiting astronauts-in-training from taking part in ``risky
recreational activities.''
   ``High risk recreational activities are defined as those where
there exists exposure of major, or even fatal, injury,'' Donald R.
Puddy said in the order. ``Examples include, but are not limited to:
auto, boat, airplane or motorcycle racing; parachute jumping; and
snow skiing.''
   Astronauts, especially the early ones who had been fighter jocks,
often had boisterous habits that worried NASA, which wanted to keep
its highfliers safe until they could risk their necks officially.
   Last weekend, astronaut S. David Griggs, scheduled to be the
pilot on a shuttle mission in November, crashed and was killed in
Arkansas while practicing stunt flying for an air show. He was doing
``wing-over'' maneuvers in a vintage World War II single-engine
propeller plane.
   The investigation into the accident is not complete and NASA has
not determined whether Griggs' activities violated the rules, Puddy
said Friday. A replacement for Griggs, who was just beginning his
training for the flight, will be named next week.
   ``Essentially, the policy put in place in June 1988 is generally
worded,'' said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the Johnson Space Center
in Texas. ``It doesn't say, `Thou shalt not do this and this'; it
doesn't mention anything as specific as aerobatic flying or stunt
flying. It says, `Hey, guys, use your head. Don't do something that
could expose you to injury or death.'''
   William Klassen, regional director of the National Transportation
Safety Board in Kansas City, said of the Griggs incident: ``We have
no evidence of engine problems or problems with the aircraft. He was
in the process of performing aerobatics and the aircraft was
observed flying over the runway at an altitude of 75 to 100 feet
above ground level.''
   Griggs was the latest in a long line of astronauts whose appetite
for life in the fast lane extended beyond their duty hours.
   Gordon Cooper, one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, had a
disconcerting fondness for racing fast cars and was about to make
his professional driving debut at the Daytona International Speedway
in February 1969 when NASA ordered him to cancel.
   ``The people in flight crew operations felt it would be better if
Cooper didn't take any risk such as auto racing, especially since he
is part of the backup crew for the important Apollo 10 mission
scheduled to orbit the moon in May,'' the official announcement said.
   ``They waited until the last minute to shut me off and I don't
appreciate it,'' said Cooper. He never flew in space again.
   Astronauts often were in the news for their various sports
injuries. James Lovell, a four-time space flyer in the Gemini and
Apollo programs, fractured his arm and shoulder while skiing in
Kitzbuehl, Austria; and Walter Cunningham of Apollo 7, suffered a
compression fracture of the vertebrae in his neck while using a
trampoline.
   The daredevil cavorting of the early astronauts was chronicled in
``The Right Stuff'' by Tom Wolfe in 1979. But even the publicity
attending Wolfe's account failed to shame or tame the astronaut
corps.
   ``I can remember discussions about what was restricted and what
wasn't, but I think all those things were unwritten rules,'' said
Alan Bean, who walked on the moon on Apollo 12, then spent 59 days
in Skylab. ``People were aware they should try to minimize risks.
Really, we got more people injured playing softball than anything
else.''
   In fact, Puddy's order cautions against ``nominal risk
recreational activities ... where there exists exposure to injury.''
   Included: Organized competitive softball, basketball, volleyball,
or racquetball. Astronauts are prohibited from taking part in those
beginning eight months prior to launch.
   Puddy said he issued the order when he was new on the job so
there would be no ambiguity. To his knowledge, Puddy said, the
no-risk rules were never written before.
   Brian Duff, former head of NASA's division of public affairs,
remembers accompanying Neil Armstrong on a publicity tour to Latin
America, long before Armstrong was picked to be the first man on the
moon.
   One morning, in Peru, he heard someone offer Armstrong a chance
to go soaring in the Andes. ``I had to sit down and ask myself,
`Should I let him do it?''' Duff recalls. ``I figured he would
probably do it anyway, so I deliberately made sure I wasn't around
when he was picked up.''
   Astronauts didn't need to go off the reservation to do dangerous
things. Preparing for the Apollo 11 moon flight, Armstrong was
rehearsing the descent to the moon when the simulator, known as
``The Flying Bedstead'' tipped over and crashed to the ground.
   The space fliers' fondness for living dangerously extended to
their children as well. Duff recalls that the children of Pete
Conrad, the commander of Apollo 12, used to ride their bicycles off
the roof of their house in Texas into the swimming pool below.
   Griggs was the 17th astronaut to die since the manned space
program began. Twelve died in the line of duty, one in an auto
accident, two in private aircraft crashes, one of cancer after
leaving the space program and one of a heart attack.
   The list includes the five NASA astronauts in the Challenger
explosion of 1986, but not non-NASA payload specialists Gregory
Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe.
   Just eight days before the Apollo 14 moon flight in 1971, backup
flight commander Eugene A. Cernan survived a fiery helicopter crash
in the Indian River south of Cape Canaveral, Fla., and had to swim
for his life. Reports circulated, but were never in the public
record, that he had been chasing a manatee, a large aquatic mammal,
and got too close to the water. An investigating board said Cernan
exercised ``misjudgment in estimating altitude.''
   Fred Haise, one of the astronauts on Apollo 13, which was
crippled by an explosion on the way to the moon in 1970, crashed in
1973 while trying to land a World War II training plane at
Galveston, Texas. He was critically burned.
   The BT13 airplane was owned by the Confederate Air Force, an
organization of airplane buffs, to which other astronauts _
including moonwalker Donald K. Slayton _ belonged.
   Slayton, who once headed the astronaut office, said he had to
warn Cooper and Charles Conrad about their auto racing activities.
``I called them and said, `You guys ought not to be doing that;
you've got too much at risk.''
   But Bill O'Donnell, a retired NASA public affairs officer, said
he recalled rumors at the time that the two astronauts continued
their racing _ under assumed names.

   Deng Xiaoping is approaching his 85th birthday in
a role he once spurned, as a larger-than-life sage in the image of
Mao Tse-tung.
   ``Learn from the words of Comrade Deng'' is the exhortation being
heard around the country. Factory workers, schoolchildren, railroad
attendants, soldiers and artists are studying his statements, and,
according to official reports, are enlightened by his thoughts.
   China has just purged the head of the ruling Communist Party,
Zhao Ziyang, and elevated Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin to what
ostensibly is the most powerful job in the land.
   One day after his promotion, Jiang had yet to make a public
statement. It was still Deng, his picture next to or above that of
Jiang's on the front page of dailies, who was the fount of wisdom.
   Deng, who turns 85 on Aug. 22, has been China's ``senior'' or
``paramount'' leader for a decade. But it has only been in the past
several weeks, as he rallied the party behind his decision to use
arms to quell pro-democracy demonstrators, that he has approached
being a cult figure.
   The focus is a speech he delivered to military commanders June 9,
his last public appearance, in which he said students involved in
the protests were manipulated by ``counterrevolutionary'' forces
trying to overthrow the party and the socialist system. He praised
the army for its victory over the ``rebellion.''
   Deng also stressed that China must not retreat from its policies
of economic reform and opening to the outside world, but that
greater ideological education is needed to show the people that this
can only be done under the guidance of the Communist Party.
   National television and radio have devoted much time every day to
depicting groups avidly studying his words. The reported response
has bordered on adulation.
   Party members in northeastern Liaoning province, the local radio
said, praised Deng for his ``brilliant analysis of the source and
nature of this counterrevolutionary rebellion, thus enabling us to
understand the necessity, complexity and long duration of this
struggle.''
   In southern Guangdong, military officers read the speech with
``intense emotion.'' Soldiers in the northeastern province of Jinan
said Deng's ``acute insight and great boldness of vision ... have a
vital bearing on the life and death of the party and the country.''
   Party members in Guangxi, southern China said Deng ``is worthy of
being the party's helmsman. It is always Comrade Deng Xiaoping who
points the way to us at every critical moment.''
   Use of words like ``helmsman'' go back to the days of Mao
Tse-tung, when people sang ``sailing the seas depends on the
helmsman.'' The cult of Mao reached near-hysteric stages in his
final years, when every home had its portrait or bust of Mao, people
began each day reading from his red book of wisdom, and young Red
Guards wept at the sight of him.
   Deng was purged twice and suffered greatly under Mao's autocratic
rule from 1949 until his death 1976. Since rising to power in the
late 1970s, Deng has eschewed the cult of personality. There are no
Deng statues in China today, no Deng buttons on lapels.
   He has tried to avoid subjecting the nation to a repeat of Mao's
final years, when a sick and senile helmsman was manipulated by
court schemers. Deng has set an example for other aging
revolutionaries by retiring from most of his official posts. Today
his only public office is as chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
   But with the nation in turmoil, Deng, wittingly or not, has
allowed himself to be portrayed in near superhuman terms as a way of
unifying the party and reviving the flagging support of the masses.
   While much of the attention is centered on the June 9 speech, the
official dailies are also carrying front-page excerpts of his past
statements on sticking to the socialist road and battling
``bourgeois liberalization.''
   But general enthusiasm for the ``learn from Deng'' campaign may
be less than advertised.
   One hotel worker said his work unit was called together at 8:30
one morning for a 90-minute study session. They read from Deng's
speech for five minutes, then spent the rest of the time chatting
about how they spent their time during the martial law crackdown.

<HEAD>Papandreou Reported Stable After Heart, Kidney Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, hospitalized
for treatment of pneumonia, was in serious but stable condition on
Sunday after developing heart and kidney complications, officials
said.
   The 70-year-old politician, who underwent open-heart surgery in
September, was admitted to General State Hospital on Thursday with
pneumonia.
   Early Sunday, the hospital said Papandreou had developed heart
and kidney complications, and he was placed on a kidney dialysis
machine. A medical bulletin later said Papandreou's condition was
stable and that he felt better after three hours of treatment with
the machine.
   A team of heart specialists rushed to Athens from London. The
team included Magdi Yacoub, who performed the September heart
surgery. After examining Papandreou, the doctors announced he was
improving and that his heart was ``steady.''
   A son, former Education Minister George Papandreou, told
reporters at the hospital his father ``was in a position to make
decisions and negotiate.''
   The two-term premier, whose socialist party was defeated in
elections June 11, faces a Tuesday deadline to form a new
government. He received the mandate Friday from President Christos
Sartzetakis after conservatives, who finished first in the
balloting, were unable to forge a coalition.
   Papandreou's condition worsened Saturday night and his ex-wife,
Margaret, rushed to the hospital, where she was joined by their four
adult children. Mrs. Papandreou was divorced from her husband this
month.
   Papandreou's 35-year-old girlfriend, Dimitra Liani, also was at
the hospital.
   President Sartzetakis visited Papandreou for 40 minutes on
Saturday and told journalists as he departed that the premier was
alert. An hour later, Sartzetakis left for Madrid to lead a Greek
delegation at a European Economic Community summit.
   Sartzetakis is leading the delegation in Papandreou's stead.
   Throughout the night and early Sunday, hundreds of Papandreou
supporters blocked the entrance to the hospital, shouting slogans
and threatening Papandreou's political opponents as they arrived to
visit. Brief clashes broke out but were quickly stopped by police.
   A hospital announcement said that a team of doctors examined
Papandreou Saturday night and determined that heart and kidney
complications had set in but that he was apparently responding to
treatment for pneumonia.
   Hospital officials said doctors ruled out the possibility of
flying him to London for special treatment because he was too weak
to travel.
   Papandreou is heading a caretaker government, since no party
received a majority in elections to the 300-seat Parliament.
   Papandreou was to confer during the weekend with the leftist
Coalition of the Left and Progress about forming a government with
his socialist Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
   According to constitutional bylaws, Papandreou can be replaced by
the highest-ranking member of his outgoing Cabinet to carry on the
mandate. This would put Anastasios Peponis, former minister to the
premier's office, in charge of negotiations.
   If the socialists fail to form a coalition, it will fall to the
Coalition of the Left and Progress, the third-place finisher, to try
to form a coalition. New elections will be held if that party can't
form a coalition.

   The opposition Labor Party jumped to a 14-point
lead over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governing Conservative
Party among voters questioned in a public opinion poll published
Sunday.
   The poll in the Observer newspaper follows the trouncing of the
Conservatives by Labor in European Parliament elections. Labor won
its first national election victory since 1974 in the June 15 vote.
   The Observer-Harris poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday,
showed Labor with the support of 48 percent of those questioned and
the Conservatives with 34 percent.
   The environmental Green Party, which also scored well in the
European Parliament balloting, held the support of 8 percent, while
the centrist Social and Liberal Democrats fell to 6 percent.
   In a poll published the day of the European Parliament elections,
42 percent of those polled backed Labor, 38 percent supported the
Conservatives, 8 percent were for the Democrats and 5 percent for
the Greens.
   The Observer poll also reported 42 percent of those voters
questioned believe that Labor will win the next general election.
   The newspaper did not say how many voters were polled, or give a
margin of error.
   In the European elections, Labor won 45 of the 78 mainland
British constituencies while the Tories won 32, overturning the
45-32 advantage the Tories held in the 1984 Euro-election.

   Two major Scandinavian newspapers awarded their
``Freedom Prize'' to Fang Lizhi, the Chinese dissident who has taken
refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, it was announced Sunday.
   The choice ``is a way to express the significance of the present
struggle for democracy in China,'' Sweden's biggest newspaper,
Dagens Nyheter, and the Danish daily Politiken said in a statement.
   Fang, an astrophysicist, has been a ``source of inspiration'' for
the Chinese students' movement for democratic reforms, Dagens
Nyheter said.
   The prize ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 10 in the Danish
capital of Copenhagen.
   ``I'm delighted and will gladly receive the prize if possible,''
Fang told a prize committee official by telephone.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shixuan, escaped to the embassy this month
after the military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
The Chinese authorities have accused him of ``counterrevolutionary
crimes'' and issued a warrant for his arrest.
   The annual prize, which has a $12,120 award, was founded in 1982.
Earlier winners include Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
Czechoslovak playwright and dissident Vaclav Havel.
   Fang began criticizing the Chinese society in the early 1950s and
wrote letters to party leaders demanding basic human rights. His
prominent position as a leading scientist at first protected him
from political persecution, but later he was expelled from the
Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   Max Robinson wanted his death to serve as a
reminder to the black community that AIDS education is important,
the former ABC-TV anchorman's mother said.
   In her first public discussion of the illness that killed
Robinson last December, Doris Robinson Griffin said Saturday that
``people need to be reminded that AIDS victims are human beings.
They are somebody's brother, somebody's father, somebody's sister.
It could happen to anybody, not just homosexuals or drug users.''
   She spoke to a conference on acquired immune deficiency syndrom
held by the Urban League of Hampton Roads.
   Ms. Griffin said Robinson, who was 45 when he died, never told
her how he contracted the human immunodeficiency virus that can lead
to AIDS.
   ``He was very closed-mouthed,'' she said. ``We never talked about
it. We just supported him and loved him.''
   Ms. Griffin said she had rejected several previous invitations to
speak about AIDS ``because the loss was so fresh.''
   ``Only because he wanted his death to be helpful to people did I
decide that I would speak,'' she said.
   Robinson, who began his career at a Portsmouth television
station, became one of the nation's leading black broadcast
journalists, and was named Chicago anchorman for ABC's ``World News
Tonight'' in 1978.
   Ms. Griffin said Robinson tested positive for HIV when he entered
a hospital in 1986 to be treated for alcoholism.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual intercourse, or
sharing of contaminated needles by intravenous drug abusers.

<HEAD>Stephen Foster Manuscript For Sale For $225,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manuscript dealer is advertising for sale a
previously unknown manuscript of a piano waltz written by
19th-century composer Stephen Collins Foster.
   The handwritten music for ``Autumn Waltz'' is signed with
Foster's name and dedicated to ``Miss Thalia Bentel.''
   It is the first fresh composition by Foster to surface in 60
years, according to Dean Root, curator of the Stephen Foster
Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh. And it's the first Foster
manuscript to go on the market in about 30 years.
   Manuscript dealer Rosemary Bufano of Tuckahoe, N.Y., is asking
$225,000 for the manuscript, which she advertised in Sunday's
Pittsburgh Press. The sheet of music was found in a set of books
from the estate of Bentel's heirs. Root verified it last year as
Foster's work.
   Root said ``Autumn Waltz'' is not distinguished and won't rival
the Pittsburgh-born composer's ``Oh Susannah'' and ``My Old Kentucky
Home.''
   ``It's pleasant, simple, a little funny and a little quirky,''
Root said.
   ``It sounds like a song you'd hear at the ice skating rink. Very,
very cute,'' Bufano said. ``It's the kind of sweet little love hymn
you'd expect someone to give a girlfriend in the days before
Hallmark.''
   After Root verified the music for the Rochester, N.Y., antique
book dealer who owned it at the time, the Stephen Foster Memorial
offered to buy the set of books. But its offer was refused, and Root
said he could not increase it because the memorial has no
acquisition fund or endowment.
   Bufano won't say how much she paid for it. She said she decided
to begin her search for a buyer in Pittsburgh because of Foster's
ties to the city.
   Foster is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in the city's
Lawrenceville section. He died in 1864 at age 37 with only 38 cents
in his pockets and no copyright protection or royalty rights for his
heirs.

   Several people who work for China in the United
States say they have no plans to sever business ties with Beijing
although they're unsure what the future will hold.
   ``Our professional relationship continues in effect,'' said
Herbert Hansell of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, a law firm
headquartered in Cleveland and hired by China's embassy to do a
range of legal and lobbying work in the nation's capital.
   Like several others working for China, Hansell said there ``isn't
all that much activity'' these days with the Chinese government,
which is undergoing an internal shake-up in connection with a
pro-democracy uprising eventually put down by the army.
   Although Communist hard-liners purged party chief Zhao Ziyang,
their selection of his replacement over the weekend indicated that
the economic reforms championed by Zhao and other moderates will not
be abandoned.
   It is that pattern of economic change over the past decade that
has generated China's need for considerable professional
representation in the United States.
   Hansell's law firm alone was paid roughly $38,000 in the last six
months of 1988 for work that included contacting American officials
``to express the PRC's concerns and interests as well as to obtain
information'' on issues such as family planning practices, China's
sale of weapons to the Middle East and the export of U.S. satellites
for launch, according to Justice Department records.
   The firm called or visited people at the State Department and on
Capitol Hill, among others, records show.
   The department's latest filings show at least six law firms are
registered as working for China. The Foreign Agents Registration Act
requires anyone ``engaging in political activities for or on behalf
of foreign governments'' to disclose their the nature of the work
and the amount they are paid.
   At another law firm, the recent upheaval has delayed plans to
revive business, said Elliot Richardson, the former attorney general
who works for Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy.
   ``We were not actively doing anything lately and the prospect of
pursuing what we were doing has definitely been deferred,''
Richardson said, noting his plans to attend a recent trade
conference in Beijing were scrapped.
   Last year, Milbank, Tweed advised China on trade relations with
the United States and monitored the status of trade legislation in
Congress. But the firm did not receive any money from China during
the first six months of 1988.
   Michael Daniels, a lawyer with Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander
and Ferdon, said it would be ``premature to make any kind of''
decision about the firm's relationship with China's state-owned
corporation that handles textile imports and exports.
   ``We think the situation is extremely confused,'' he said.
Pointing to the Bush administration's plea for patience in dealing
with China, Daniels said his firm was in a holding pattern and would
not cut ties with the Chinese corporation.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and other members of Congress have
urged President Bush to take a tougher stand on China, blocking
trade and stopping new investments to protest human rights abuses.
   Bush has already suspended military sales to China and promised a
sympathetic review of visa applications for Chinese students who
fear returning to their native land.
   Mudge, Rose, which has represented the Chinese corporation since
1985, received about $35,000 for its work the following year,
records show.
   At Laxalt, Washington, Perito and Dubuc, a law firm headed by
former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., the staff has performed minor work
for Air China, which has permission to fly between Chinese cities
and New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago, said
Carroll Dubuc.
   ``We do limited work'' for Air China, he said. Among other
things, the firm filed the necessary papers to change the airline's
name from the Civil Aviation Authority of China to Air China. The
law firm reported getting paid $5,341 on March 6, 1989.
   Air China continues to fly between the United States and China,
according to Jian Min Hhai in the airline's New York office.
   The staff at Garvey, Schubert and Barer refused to discuss the
firm's work for the China Ocean Shipping Co. But U.S. records said
the firm performed legal work and monitored the Federal Maritime
Commission's rule-making authority. The firm was paid nearly $3,000
between September 1988 and January 1989 for the work.
   Several telephone calls to the press office at the Chinese
Embassy to inquire about the government's relationship with U.S.
agents were not answered.

   Thai authorities arrested two men
in the killing of 130 Vietnamese boat people in the South China Sea,
refugee officials said Sunday.
   The officials said the Thai suspects were arrested on a fishing
vessel in the southeastern Thai city of Songkhla on Friday and
authorities were looking for another suspect.
   On April 14, 131 refugees left Vietnam in a boat. It was
intercepted two days later by Thai pirates off the Trengganu coast,
about 240 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   The pirates were armed with shotguns, hammers and knives. They
looted the boat, locked passengers in the hold and cabin, and then
set the boat on fire, officials said.
   The pirates killed several refugees who managed to jump out, but
one 22-year-old man survived and was rescued later by another
Vietnamese refugee boat, they said. The survivor reached Malaysia to
relate the incident.
   No further details were available on the arrests.
   Pirates often plunder vessels that have carried thousands of
Vietnamese from the communist nation.

   Military forces began preparing
Sunday for a major operation to quell an armed revolt on the
northern island of Bougainville, the armed forces chief said.
   Joint Forces Commander Col. Lima Dotaona said troops would be
deployed to restore order to Bougainville, where rebels have battled
government forces for seven months and forced the closing of a large
copper mine.
   The rebels are led by a 35-year-old surveyor, Francis Ona, who
vowed last year to close the Bougainville Copper mine and demanded a
referendum on seccession and nearly $10 billion in compensation for
environmental damage allegedly caused by the mine.
   ``If he decides to come out we are prepared to let him, but it
has to be on our terms,'' said Dotaona of Ona. ``Our aim is simple _
we are going to restore law and order.''
   He said troops would begin moving into the bush Monday morning to
begin what was expected to be a protracted operation against the
rebels.
   ``It's a dangerous operation and you can expect casualties,'' he
said. ``Once the security forces are in there ... if there is armed
resistance they will respond in an appropriate manner.''
   In an address to the nation on radio and television Friday, Prime
Minister Rabbie Namaliu said the government could not allow a
``criminal minority'' to threaten the unity and economic stability
of the nation.
   Ona and his Bougainville Republican Army closed the mine May 15
and have since defied all attempts at conciliation, repeatedly
ambushing mine workers and soldiers sent to restore order.
   Prior to its closing, the mine contributed 20 percent of Papua
New Guinea's total revenue.
   Three soldiers have died and about 20 other members of the
security forces and numerous civilians have been wounded in the
unrest.
   Tensions have been high on Bougainville because local landowners
objected to profits being made from the island's copper mine, which
ranks among the world's 10 biggest open-cut copper mines.
   Australia's biggest mining company, CRA Ltd., jointly operates
the mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland.
   Papua New Guinea, with a 3.5 million mainly Melanesian
population, is just north of Australia. It gained independence from
Australia in 1975.

<TEXT>
   Christmas came to this eastern Nebraska
community six months early Sunday at a church where worshipers
celebrated with carols, cookies and a pageant but no Santa Claus.
   The Rev. Craig Schultz said Trinity Lutheran Church decided to
celebrate Christmas again June 25 so that its true message could be
heard without the distractions that usually accompany the holiday.
   Two trees with lights and garlands adorned the altar of the
church about 30 miles northeast of Omaha. Six wreaths with red
velvet bows surrounded candles.
   ``Christmas is not only for Christmastime. It's for all year
round,'' said Clara Druhe, a longtime member of the nearly
1,800-member congregation who described herself as ``past 70.''
   ``It should always be Christmas in our hearts,'' she said.
   Schultz said the service was a chance to focus on the birth of
Jesus Christ. ``The reason for Christmas is a 365-day-a-year
reason,'' he said. ``Around Dec. 25, it gets caught up in the
presents.''
   Children dressed as shepherds re-enacted the story of Jesus'
birth in a pageant complete with a crying baby. A choir led
worshipers in the mostly filled 600-seat church in songs such as
``Joy to the World.''
   Ellen Lund said her family has been marking Christmas on the 25th
of each month with candles or music and was excited when the church
decided to remember the holiday in midyear.
   ``I think it's so sad when we pack Christmas up and put it away
for a year,'' said Mrs. Lund, 37.
   In the church lobby, her 5-year-old daughter, Rachel, and other
children munched on cookies shaped like stars and bells.
   Katherine Ruder said she thought the Christmas message was more
meaningful ``without all the hype of worrying about Christmas gifts
and decorations.''
   In his sermon, Schultz told worshipers he wanted them to remember
more than the historical account of Jesus' birth.
   ``Christmas is a blast of fresh air in a polluted environment,''
he said. ``We need to hear the angels saying to us today ... `To you
is born a savior.'''

<HEAD>Election Held In Bangladesh Region Torn By Insurgency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHAGRACHARI, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its first attempt at
grass-roots democracy, Bangladesh held district council elections
Sunday in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a remote region of primeval
forests and straw huts where a bush war has simmered and
periodically flared for 14 years.
   The candidates, the voters and the soldiers who patrol the area
concede the elections probably will not end the insurgency by
Buddhist tribal rebels who seek to expel Bengali Moslem settlers who
arrived in the past decade.
   The rebels _ who belong to the Shanti Bahini, or peace force _
tried to frighten their fellow tribesmen away from the polls with
death threats and by burning at least a score of villages in the
last two months.
   There were no reports Sunday of any killings on election day, but
the government said at least 12 potential voters were killed in the
past two months and thousands more had fled to neighboring India or
into nearby jungles.
   More than 4,000 people have died since the insurrection started
in 1974 in this region of 5,200 square miles that starts 130 miles
southeast of Dhaka and stretches along the borders with India and
Burma.
   Election results, which were not expected before Monday, are
largely immaterial, since the ethnic makeup of the three district
councils was predetermined by the government and weighted with a
two-thirds majority favoring the tribes over the settlers.
   For instance, Bengalis ran against fellow Bengalis, Chakma
tribespeople ran against Chakmas, Tripura tribespeople ran against
Tripuras.
   The elections were conducted on a non-party basis, and a dozen
candidates who talked with reporters were unable to enunciate any
platform other than they would work on a ``democratic'' basis to
decide local affairs, such as controlling new settlements, levying
local taxes and hiring local police.
   The Chakmas, Tripuras and at least 11 other tribes made up more
than 90 percent of the Chittagong Hills' population 40 years ago.
Diluted by an influx of Bengali settlers in the past decade, they
now comprise only 60 percent by government estimates.
   Many voters had no idea how to mark their ballots, strips of
paper printed with symbols such as fish, deer, teakettles and
bicycles to represent each of the 240 candidates running for the
three 31-member district councils.
   But just about everyone except the Shanti Bahini seemed to agree
the elections were a step in the right direction in this nation,
which has never changed presidents via the ballot box since its
war-won independence in 1971.
   Bangladesh, formerly east Pakistan, has had nine presidents since
the break with west Pakistan. Each one was installed through
military intervention, usually a coup or assassination.
   The incumbent, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, achieved power through a
bloodless coup in 1982. Four years later he was declared the winner
of an election that his opponents and foreign observers said was
clearly fraudulent.
   Ershad, who has governed Bangladesh longer than anyone else, has
shown increasing sensitivity to international opinion, especially
since a devastating cycle of cyclones, floods and droughts prompts
him to seek millions of dollars in foreign aid each year for this
overpopulated nation of 110 milion people.
   With an annual per capita income of $160, Bangladesh is one of
the world's poorest countries.
   Although the national Parliament is elected by ballot, major
opposition parties usualy boycott the elections because they refuse
to recognize Ershad. District councils have always been appointed by
the government in the past.
   ``There is no alternative to the elections,'' said Samiran Dewan
Chakma, 33, who runs a construction company in Khagrachari and was
elected unopposed to be chairman of the Khagrachari District
Council. ``After the election we will have political and cultural
guarantees for the life of our people.''
   Like many hills residents, he uses the name of his tribe as a
surname.
   Although he and several military officials predicted high voter
turnouts, there were signs the guerrillas' threats had taken a toll.
   In the hamlet of Baradum, all 10 houses stood deserted even
though they were barely 30 yards from an army camp set up to provide
protection. Lt. Col. Mohammad Sadiq Rumi said the families living in
the houses fled a month ago after tribal rebels told them not to
vote.
   In Naniarchar, about 30 miles southeast of Khagrachari, hundreds
of Chakma voters fled in panic when about 25 rifle shots were heard
a couple of miles away.

   Amur and Flurry, two white tigers
obtained from a Chicago zoo, have made their first public appearance
in Sweden.
   Large crowds turned out at Eskilstuna Zoo on Saturday to view
Amur, 6, and Flurry, 3, who had been in quarantine since arriving
from Chicago in February.
   The tigers have mated at the zoo and hopes are high that Flurry
is pregnant, Lasse Karlsson, head of the Eskilstuna Zoo, told the TT

   The white tiger, which has black stripes, is nearly extinct, and
zoos around the world have started a breeding project to try to save
them.
   Amur and Flurry, the only white tigers in a European zoo, are
descended from a white male tiger captured in 1951, TT said.

   President Najib appointed the brother
of the man he ousted as president to serve as first deputy prime
minister, officials said Sunday.
   Mahmoud Baryalai, 45, is the brother of former President Babrak
Karmal, whom Najib ousted two years ago. Diplomatic sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the appointment of Baryalai
indicated Najib was consolidating his power.
   ``Our doors are open to anyone who wants to join the national
reconciliation plan,'' Foreign Minstry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani
told reporters.
   Najib has offered the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas a role in the
government, but the rebels have rejected the overtures and vow to
topple his Marxist regime.
   In another development, the government said Sunday it instructed
its mission in New Delhi to issue a visa to a U.S. diplomat to
negotiate the release of American photographer Tony O'Brien.
   O'Brien was arrested by Afghan troops on June 14 in Wardak
province while he was traveling with Moslem rebels.
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul weeks before Soviet
troops completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan in February.
Washington and Kabul have no formal diplomatic ties and the United
States is one of the main suppliers of the rebels.
   ``I would like to assure the family members of Mr. O'Brien and
the American people that he is in good health in Kabul,'' Amani told
reporters.
   He said the United States requested the visa.
   The government accused O'Brien, who was on assignment for
Time-Life Inc., of being in the country without a visa and in the
company of armed guerrillas.
   The appointment of Baryalai makes him the No. 2 official behind
Prime Minister Ali Kishtmand in the 27-member Council of Ministers.
   Baryalai was a member of the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan but was disgraced, imprisoned and kept under house
arrest in Kabul after his brother was ousted in December 1986.
   ``To establish peace in Afghanistan, our door is open to all who
want to join us,'' Amani said.
   Diplomatic sources said the inclusion of Baryalai is broadening
Najib's support. ``At least what it seems to be on the surface is
that he is further consolidating his position,'' said one Asian
diplomat.

   Rapidly growing populations threaten social
turbulence, endangering the political stability of many nations,
according to a new analysis by a private group.
   West Africa's Mauritania was rated the most potentially unstable
nation in the world in the analysis released Sunday by the
Population Crisis Committee, which advocates birth control.
   Japan finished at the other end of the scale, the most stable
nation.
   And the United States fell in the ``moderate'' category, losing
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this
country's ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.
   ``Rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharp
ethnic divisions, places enormous strains on political
institutions,'' observed the study, compiled by Sharon L. Camp,
Marshall Green and Patricia G. Barnett.
   Many nations seem to be striving to develop democracy. ``Whether
these fragile new democracies survive or not will depend partly on
the intensity of population pressures and the strains they add to
the problems of governance,'' said Camp.
   Green, a retired ambassador, observed that ``not surprisingly the
two most deeply troubled areas of the globe are Africa and the
Middle East, with the world's highest growth rates.''
   The new analysis, published in the form of a wall chart
containing a world map of population pressures and growth rates, was
compiled by establishing statistical ratings of a variety of factors
and totaling the results.
   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the age
structure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence or
absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major
population factors considered.
   In addition, the study took into account changes in government
over the last 30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties,
ethnic or religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or
frustration of youth in a country.
   Mauritania, situated astride the Sahara desert, led the list for
instability with a 95 score out of a possible 100. It also ranked
high in the separate population pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of
100.
   Rounding out the five most unstable nations were Ethiopia,
scoring 87; Zaire, 83; and Burundi and the Sudan, 81 each.
   All five have been through several governments and all but Zaire
scored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflicts
underway in several of these countries. And all five also ranked
high in the study of population pressures.
   On the 100-point instability scale, Japan accumulated only 13
points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures
study.
   The United States, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in the
instability analysis.
   Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government
changes, political and civil rights.
   In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, while
Japan had 1 point the United States scored 10 out of a possible 20.
   And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt the
U.S., which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared to 9
points for Japan.
   Countries falling in between Japan and the United States were
Norway, 18; Switzerland, 20; Italy, Denmark and Australia, 21 each;
Sweden and Belgium, 22 each; West Germany, 23; Venezuela, 24; Costa
Rica, 25; Jamaica, 28; Netherlands, 29; and Greece, Canada and
Botswana, 30 each.
   Tied with the United States at a rating of 31 were Spain and
France.
   In the report the committee, which advocates family planning,
concluded that ``it is clear from trends widely evident in the world
that rapid growth of a country's population, along with its
maldistribution, will impose great strains on existing political,
social and economic structures and on relations between nations.''
   Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship between
population pressures and political stability, the group concluded.
It said that only a handful of governments with rapid population
growth have maintained stable governments with good records on civil
and political rights, notably Botswana, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Gambia
and Venezuela.
   China, where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended
in military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it in
the ``high'' category for instability.
   That score may be too low in light of recent events, the
committee said in an addendum issued with the report.

   The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on
why some White House documents on the Iran-Contra affair were not
turned over to Congress does not warrant a reopening of the overall
inquiry, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Sunday.
   ``There is no basis at this time, in my judgment, for a
resumption of the investigation or for the creation of a new
investigation,'' Mitchell said.
   The Maine Democrat had asked the Senate panel to examine why
congressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosed
White House memos when copies surfaced during the trial of former
national security aide Oliver North.
   In a 51-page report Friday, the intelligence panel said the White
House sometimes handled documents in chaotic and haphazard manner
when Congress sought them for its Iran-Contra hearings two years
ago. But the committee said there was no evidence of a calculated
cover-up by the Reagan administration.
   Among those documents was a Feb. 19, 1985 memo to former
President Reagan from then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane.
   The memo recommended that Reagan write Honduran President Roberto
Suazo to reaffirm U.S. support for Contra rebels in Nicaragua and
pledge U.S. help in defending Honduras if Nicaraguan troops crossed
its border.
   Located in an informal ``heads of state'' file in a box of papers
at Reagan's presidential library in California, the document
suggested a ``quid pro quo'' arrangement with Honduras that has been
denied by President Bush. At the time, Congress had banned direct
U.S. aid to the Contras.
   ``Obviously, there are loose ends,'' Mitchell said Sunday in an
interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``Not every single question has been answered and every one may
not be answered,'' said Mitchell, who served on the special
Iran-Contra investigating committee. ``But there comes a question of
balance in terms of whether one should or should not reopen the
investigation.''
   Mitchell said more about Reagan's role in the funneling of
proceeds from arms sales to Iran to the Contras will likely surface
during the upcoming trials of John Poindexter, who succeeded
McFarlane as national security adviser, and former Air Force Gen.
Richard Secord.

   Batfans are not going to believe this, but Stephen
Batman has an assistant named Robin and life is getting so crazed
since the huge success of a certain film that he's thinking of
getting his batphone unlisted.
   ``Our family hasn't received many crank calls since the TV series
in the '60s,'' Batman said Saturday. ``But now I expect I'll have to
unlist my phone. We'll wait and see.''
   The Dallas securities dealer may be thinking of changing his
phone number since the release of the new ``Batman'' movie, but he
would not change his name.
   The 33-year-old is from Dodge City, Kan., not Gotham City. He
says his grandfather did a genealogical study of the unusual family
name, which originated in England, and found about 300 Batmans _ or
should that be Batmen _ in the United States.
   Batman said he has some similarities with the comic book and
cinema hero, including having dark hair and being the same height
and build.
   ``My administrative assistant's name is Robin _ Robin Campbell,''
he said. ``I make a lot of speeches and presentations around the
country and no one forgets my name. I get to say, `I'm Batman and
this is my assistant, Robin.' ''
   And the real Mrs. Batman is named Vicki, bringing to mind Bruce
Wayne's girlfriend in the new movie, Vicki Vale.
   ``I take a lot of kidding,'' Batman said. ``I have a 3-year-old
batson, my newborn baby is a batbaby, I have a batdog, and everybody
at work says I drive a batmobile.''
   Batman said he was a grade-schooler when the television series
came out and his own popularity rocketed as the program became a
hit, although he found it a bit slapstick.
   The movie starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson draws high
marks from Batman, who was among the first in Dallas to see the show.
   ``I think it's very good,'' he said. ``And I think it will do
wonders for my own career.''
   So Batman says he intends to keep a sense of humor about his
accidental celebrity _ and he does a good job.

<HEAD>Mob Riots Over Blasphemous Sandals; Police Kill One, Wound 50</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas and rifles Sunday
on Moslems who ransacked a shoe store to protest sandals they
considered blasphemous, and news reports said at least one person
was killed and 50 wounded.
   A witness said police charged the mob with steel-tipped bamboo
sticks. Police in Tongi, about 20 miles north of Dhaka, confirmed
they opened fire but refused to give details.
   Similar clashes occurred Friday in Dhaka and Mymensingh, 70 miles
to the north. At least 30 people were hurt in those demonstrations.
   Officials said Moslems attacked shops owned by the Canada-based
Bata Shoe Co. because they considered a design on the slippers
blasphemous. The logo resembles the Arab characters for Allah.
   Bangladesh was also the scene of violence earlier this year
surrounding Salman Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which
many Moslems considered insulting to Islam.
   Rushdie, a British author, went into hiding Feb. 14 after Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared he had blasphemed Islam and
ordered him killed.
   Five Bata executives, including local managing director George
Klass of Canada, were ordered to appear before a magistrate on July
5 to answer charges they offended Moslem sentiments with the shoes.
   Klass said Sunday he was aware of ``some commotion'' near the
Bata factory and the shoe store in Tongi but had no details.
   United News of Bangladesh, a privately owned news agency, said
one person was killed and at least 50 wounded during the clash in
Tongi.
   A reporter for Sangram, a Bengali-language independent newspaper,
also said one person was killed but that at least 200 people were
injured, some by gunfire but most when police charged the crowd with
steel-tipped staves.
   The demonstrators then threw rocks and broke windows of nearly
100 vehicles that had been stopped by the demonstration on the busy
Tongi-Dhaka highway, according to the Sangram reporter, Salahuddin
Babar, who was at the scene.
   The shoes are manufactured by Bata in Bangladesh. Protesters say
a stylized drawing of three bells on the inner sole of the sandal
resembles Allah in the Arab script.
   The problem was compounded by the fact that Moslems consider the
sole of the foot a symbol of disrespect.
   Bata has issued a public apology, saying the design's resemblance
to the name Allah is unintentional. It said the design was provided
by a Bangladeshi Moslem.
   About 90 percent of Bangladesh's population is Moslem. The
government banned sales of the shoe last week and confiscated
existing stocks.
   Reporters for two Dhaka newspapers, Ittefaq and the New Nation,
said police fired about 70 rifle rounds and about 35 tear gas shells
at the Tongi protesters.
   They said the Tongi demonstration was organized by the Islamic
Action Committee, a coalition of several small fundamentalist
parties.
   The group called a 24-hour general strike beginning at dawn
Monday in Tongi, Bangladesh's main industrial town.

   An Associated Press photograph of a lone
man defying a column of tanks on Beijing's Tiananman Square won a
``Photo of the Year'' award on Sunday given by a jury of Italian
editors and photographers.
   The Chia Sardinia prize usually rewards Italian journalists, but
the jury made an exception for Jeff Widener's photo.
   Widener, a 32-year-old American photographer based in Bangkok,
was awarded the special prize for what the jury called the
``symbolic photo of the year.''
   ``This shot is certainly the most significant document of the
fight by students and workers on Tiananman Square defending human
rights,'' the jury said. ``This photo also documents how in our
times, values and responsibilities of the individual are an
invincible force: a man, a young man, can stop _ albeit for a short
time _ the march of a column of tanks.'
   Widener, who was awarded $1,000 and a plaque, has covered
Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India. Last year he won an AP staff
award for a photo essay on Afghani refugees in Pakistan.

<HEAD>Erratic Winds Again Force Postponement of Nuclear Weapon Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERCURY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major underground nuclear weapon test was
postponed for a second day Sunday because of erratic winds at the
Nevada Test Site.
   The test, code named Amarillo, had been scheduled for Saturday
morning, then postponed until noon after a series of delays caused
by shifting winds.
   ``We had the same problem as Saturday, an erratic wind pattern,''
Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said Sunday afternoon.
Scientists want to conduct the test in calm or steady winds so that
if any radioactive gas accidentally escaped from the site it could
easily be tracked.
   Boyer said a weather briefing will be held Monday afternoon and
the test would not be conducted before Tuesday at the earliest.
   Officials planned to detonate a nuclear device packing an
explosive punch equivalent to up to 150,000 tons of TNT at the site
105 miles northwest of Las Vegas. A similar test took place Thursday
without incident.
   Both weapons were classified as having a range of between 20 and
150 kilotons, the upper limit allowed under existing treaties with
the Soviet Union.
   The weekend blast was to be the seventh announced test of the
year at the site where the nation's nuclear weapons are detonated
underground.

   The industry association estimates that Americans spend nearly $4

   For people who prefer fish to Fido, the convention featured
displays of designer aquariums, such as a headboard with a 25-gallon
fish tank or a coffee table aquarium.
   Also on display: pet videos; a flea trap that uses a light bulb

   The Legislature doesn't know it yet, but
Louisiana now has an official state possum song, courtesy of the
Arcadia Possum Festival.
   Seven people entered Saturday's possum sing-off _ the main event
of the seventh annual celebration of a slow, ugly animal that never
got its fair share of fur.
   The winner was Bobbie Jean Ellis, who bested entries such as
``Glory, Glory, Possum-luia'' and ``Possum Rock'' with her gospel
ballad, ``You've Got a Friend in a Possum.''
   It celebrates the opossum as the critter is most often seen:
   ``Poor fast fuzzy, he got killed.
   ``They tell me he died with a Goodyear tattoo
   ``Now how would you like for that to have been you?''
   Wayne Dring, a newspaper editor, and some of his drinking buddies
in this north Louisiana town dreamed up the festival while swapping
stories about road kills and other cultural relics.
   They formed Possums Unlimited _ a take-off on the hunters'
conservation group called Ducks Unlimited _ and organized the
festival.
   It hasn't gotten real big yet, but it has left its mark on the
town that previously has been known only as the spot where federal
agents killed outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in 1934.
   To echo a tombstone-style marker on the outskirts of town where
Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed, a gravestone was erected in the
center of town sporting the inscription, ``In memory of all departed
possums.''
   Many attractions at the possum festival are more-or-less standard
fare: arm wrestling, a domino tournament, a golden girls pageant, a
weed arrangement contest featuring roadside wildflowers.
   But the main event is always something different, and this year
it was the song contest. Last year, townsfolk competed in a possum
funeral preach-off. The year before, a man was tried for
intentionally hitting an opossum with his car.
   ``We wrote a story that said the man intentionally ran over a
marsupial. Local folks read that and didn't know what he did,'' said
Dring.

<HEAD>Hungary's Party Reformers Determined To Push Through Democratic Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist reformers, apparently
strengthened after a crisis meeting of the policy-setting Central
Committee, seem determined to push through democratic policies to
bolster the party in next year's elections.
   On Sunday, the state-run MTI news agency reported that one of the
most influential of dozens of independent political groups, the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, proclaimed itself a political party.
   The promotion on Saturday of economic reformer Rezsoe Nyers to
communist party chairman and the formation of a four-man presidium
dominated by advocates of democratic change indicated the growing
strength of party reformers.
   Nyers, Minister of State Imre Pozsgay and premier Miklos Nemeth,
all well-known reformers, will now run the party along with general
secretary Karoly Grosz. The power of Grosz, party chief for 13
months, has been severely curbed.
   The four will lead the party on a provisional basis until a
crucial party Congress set for Oct. 7, when communists will choose
who will lead the party as Hungary prepares for its first free and
competitive elections next year.
   ``It was a maintaining operation, ensuring the party to hold on
and preventing it from falling apart before the Oct. 7 Congress,'' a
Western diplomat said.
   The choice of a leader at the Congress is considered crucial to
the party's attempts to hold power when the elections are held.
   The independent daily Mai Nap on Sunday quoted an unidentified
party official as saying: ``This was a conscious compromise in which
everybody knew the rules of the game. Previously, compromises were
made in secret ... but at the Congress we'll speak openly.''
   Increasingly open conflicts between reformers and conservatives
left Grosz little middle ground. Several party reform groups called
for his ouster ahead of the two-day Central Committee meeting.
   His inclusion in the new leadership suggested the reformers, who
are popular in the country at large, had been forced to strike a
balance with disgruntled conservatives who are still powerful in the
party.
   The first act of the new leadership was to revamp the nine-man
party Politburo, expanding its membership to 21 and renaming it the
Political Management Committee.
   The new Politburo contained all nine members of the old body but
added reformers such as Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, influential
historian Maria Ormos and Csongrad county party boss Pal Vastagh.
   The reformers believe that only their more democratic policies
can give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force from next
year's elections and then forming a coalition government with the
strongest of some 30 democratic opposition groups.
   A public opinion poll last month conducted by two leading
sociologists showed that only 36.5 percent of those queried would
vote for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' (communist) Party if free
elections were be held within one month.
   According to the survey, the ruling communists, together with the
social democrats, would muster just about 50 percent, enough to form
a leftist coalition Cabinet.
   Others support the independent groups such as the Hungarian
Democratic Forum.
   Earlier this month, Zoltan Biro, a member of the 15-man
presidium, told a conference the Forum would call for elections, now
expected in June 1990, to be moved up.
   It has become ``increasingly clear'' that the communists are
unable to lead Hungary out of its current economic and social crisis
alone, MTI quoted him as saying.

<HEAD>Alfred Jarry's `Ubu' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's shouting can become today's snores.
   A case in point is the Lincoln Center Theater's production of
``Ubu,'' an adaptation of Alfred Jarry's ``Ubu Roi,'' which opened
Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater.
   The play with its scatalogical language, incessant cruelty,
smutty jokes and haphazard dramatic structure caused a major dust-up
when it was first presented in Paris in 1896. A shocked bourgeois
fled, but the avant-garde embraced it. Through the years, the play
has been championed by such diverse theater people as Peter Brook
and Lynne Meadow and such cultural institutions as the Living
Theater and the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
   But the new Lincoln Center production won't win ``Ubu'' many new
fans. Theatergoers at a recent preview performance appeared more
bored than scandalized. Most of them gamely waited out director
Larry Sloan's 85-minute production, which at least has a sense of
style if not substance.
   Although it's still possible to shock an audience today, ``Ubu''
doesn't. It seems almost quaint _ and inevitable _ in its defiance
of authority. The story is cartoonish, even childish, but then the
play was written when Jarry was a teen-ager. It concerns Pere Ubu,
an egotistical tyrant who murders the king of Poland and then takes
over the country, slaughtering its noblemen, lawmakers and
businessmen in his quest for more power.
   Ubu is sort of a dung-heap Macbeth but without the wisdom
Shakespeare's king gains from his downfall. Jarry's title character
flees at the end of the play, learning nothing from his excesses.
Neither does the audience, but that may be Jarry's point.
   Sloan, who adapted the play with Doug Wright, has added the
character of Ubu's Conscience, present in another Jarry play about
Ubu, to this production. But it's a voice the king repeatedly
ignores and finally silences forever.
   Ubu's wife resembles a dance hall floozy, while a dozen or so
other actors play an assortment of kings, queens, nobles, lawyers,
soldiers and even a bear.
   It's hard to judge the acting in such a comic-strip atmosphere,
but Oliver Platt is terrific in the title role. He looks like Porky
Pig's evil twin, a porcine bully harassing the weak but running away
from the strong. He makes sympathy for the character out of the
question, something Jarry probably would agree with completely.
   Jodie Markell is equally unpleasant as Ubu's wife and Barnabas
Miller is dead on target as the whining nerd of a prince who
challenges Ubu.
   In one novel bit of casting, playwright and sometime-actor
Christopher Durang, author of ``Sister Mary Ignatius ...,'' plays
Ubu's Conscience, but the only person Durang appears to be
impersonating is himself.
   The set by Douglas Stein is a huge white-tiled room with a
walkway above the thrust stage and a bright red backdrop to comment
on the bloody action.
   Lincoln Center should be applauded for attempting ``Ubu,'' a work
rarely seen in mainstream theater. They have given it the best
possible production, but the play doesn't support their efforts.

   Two Vassar College students say they're serious
about their new club, Future Housewives of America, and hope to deal
with the rights and responsibilities of women who choose to stay
close to the hearth.
   Regina Peters and Jennifer Harriton also plan to offer a few more
practical sidelights, like Tupperware parties, a dating service and
cookbooks.
   Peters and Harriton, both 21, said they founded their club in
response to the Poughkeepsie, N.Y., school's radical feminist
faction, which the women said was too vocal in its opposition to
traditional values. They plan to seek official school recognition
for the group this fall.
   The last straw, the women said, was the campus women's center,
which they found ``disgustingly sloppy.'' The upstart future
housewives decided they'd make a statement by showing up one day
with vacuums and disinfectant in hand.
   ``The center was a pigsty and that seemed wrong because at the
very least the place where women gather should be pleasant,''
Harriton said.
   ``Our mottos are: `Coming out of the closet ... with a mop in
your hand,' and `Together we stand united by Lysol,''' Harriton said.
   The Vassar seniors, both of whom describe themselves as
feminists, said some people have dismissed their organization as a
hoax. But they take it seriously.
   The founders of the 15-member club may be interested in
Tupperware and matchmaking, but they said the club would also
address more sobering issues.
   ``It's time we learn not to tolerate things like wife-beating,
violence against children and drugs,'' said Harriton, an American
culture major.
   ``To bring the family back is an important means of bringing more
harmony back into society,'' Peters added in a telephone interview
from her home in Pembroke.
   Ellen Convisser, president of the National Organization for
Women's Boston chapter, said her group supports every woman's right
to choose whatever path she prefers. But she stressed that whether
women are inside or out of the home should not be linked with the
incidence of domestic violence.
   Even if by staying home women could in some way eliminate
domestic violence, the fact remains, she said, that ``only 6 percent
of the population can afford to have one partner stay at home.''
   Harriton said social pressures today are such that, regardless of
their financial status, women feel they can't stay at home with
their children without being stigmatized.
   ``We want to promote the art of homemaking so people realize it's
OK not to want to run out and become a lawyer or a doctor,''
Harriton said in a telephone interview from her family's summer home
on New York's Long Island.
   Anne Constantinople, a psychology professor, said women who value
certain aspects of feminism but are put off by a radical approach
might welcome the Future Housewives' perspective.
   She said she suspected the group's organizers might be spoofing
themselves to some degree. But, she noted, as many as 80 percent of
Vassar's graduates would work in the home at some point in the
future.
   Dixie Sheridan, vice president for campus relations, said that
without official recognition, the club is ``a larky idea dreamed up
on a spring afternoon.''
   But Harriton and Peters said they plan to seek recognition this
fall through the Vassar Student Association and already had lined up
a professor to speak on ``The Impact of Tupperware on U.S. Society.''

   Fourteen drug traffickers were hanged in
northeastern Iran Sunday and 50,000 addicts will be sent to
hard-labor camps, Iranian news reports said.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said 40,000 other addicts will be cared for by the prisons welfare
system.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Cyprus, said the 14 convicts were
hanged in prison in the northeastern city of Mashhad in Khorasan
province. Some were accused of smuggling arms and committing
``unvirtuous acts,'' a euphemism for prostitution.
   Sunday's hangings brought to 757 the number of drug-related
executions reported since December, when Parliament passed a law
mandating death for possession of even small quantities of narcotics.
   There are an estimated 2 million addicts and pushers in Iran.
   The human rights group Amnesty International has said the law is
to cover up the execution of political prisoners.

<HEAD>County DA in Massachusetts To Seek Stronger Charges Against Abortion
Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban Boston prosecutor says he will seek to
charge hundreds of anti-abortion demonstrations with a violation of
the state's Civil Rights Act instead of merely with disorderly
conduct.
   Norfolk County District Attorney William Delahunt said the new
charges would represent the first time in Massachusetts and probably
in the nation that interfering with a woman's right to an abortion
would be interpreted as a civil rights violation.
   He said he would drop disorderly conduct charges Monday and file
the civil rights charges, which would have to be considered later by
a grand jury.
   Civil rights violations can bring a jail term of up to a year and
a fine of up to $1,000. Disorderly conduct is just a misdemeanor and
rarely brings more than a relatively small fine.
   Delahunt said he hoped the prospect of stricter penalties will
serve as a deterrent to anti-abortion demonstrators.
   ``We maintain a woman has a right to have an abortion,'' he said
Saturday. ``To be intimidated or coerced ... amounts to a violation
of that right.''
   Pro-life activists, who have staged demonstrations outside
abortion clinics around the state and particularly in Brookline
during the past year, said the possibility of being faced with a
civil rights violation wouldn't deter protesters. Norfolk County
includes Brookline and other suburbs south of Boston.
   ``People feel so strongly about this that they will do whatever
it costs to save lives,'' said Denise Duda, of Mashpee, who has been
arrested along with her husband, George, in at least two
anti-abortion demonstrations. ``I think it will be harder to prove a
violation of civil rights.''
   Delahunt said there were current charges against about 360 people
arrested in anti-abortion demonstrations.
   He said he was basing his actions on a recent Supreme Judicial
Court ruling that limited the application of disorderly conduct laws
in demonstrations.
   The April 4 ruling, involving a protest at Falmouth's Otis Air
Force Base in 1986, said a demonstrator involved in a ``legitimate''
political protest could not be considered to have committed a
criminal act under the disorderly conduct statute.
   ``Proceeding against hundreds of demonstrators on idle and
disorderly conduct charges was not effective in the past,'' Delahunt
said. ``Given their level of commitment, it's not effective for the
future.''

   Masked Palestinians wielding hatchets and knives
ambushed an Israeli patrol in the Gaza Strip on Sunday and the
troops opened fire, killing one attacker.
   Also Sunday, the bodies of two Palestians suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities were found. Other clashes in
the occupied lands left seventeen Palestinians wounded and an
Israeli soldier injured, reports said. The army confirmed eight
wounded.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin met with justice minister Dan
Meridor on Sunday to discuss expansion of legal measures the army
can employ in the occupied territories, Israel television said.
   Rabin seeks to extend the current six-month norm of detention
without trial and wants to simplify procedures leading to
deportation of Palestinian activists, Israeli news reports said.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, the body of 21-year-old Nidal
Salhab was found Sunday, his head smashed with a heavy object, the
army and Palestinian reporters said.
   An Arab reporter said Salhab was killed because he was suspected
of collaborating with Israeli authorities. He said masked men led
Salhab out of his house Friday as he was shouting: ``I will return
(to my people), I will stop collaborating.''
   The army said the case was under investigation.
   The body of another Arab was found in Qatana near Jerusalem, the
army said, and Israel television reported the man was suspected of
collaborating with the Israelis. He was not identified.
   At least 67 alleged collaborators are among the 535 Palestinian
victims of the 18-month anti-Israeli uprising. Twenty-three Israelis
have also died.
   An Israeli soldier was injured in the head by a rock in the West
Bank city of Hebron and troops then forced merchants on the street
to shut their shops, Arab reports said.
   In the Gaza city of Khan Yunis, soldiers on patrol were attacked
by masked assailants with hatchets and knives, an army spokesman
said. The spokesman said the troops opened fire, killing 28-year-old
Youssuf Abdel Karim Farara.
   Arab reports said two other Palestinian attackers were wounded.
   Two assailants were captured, the army spokesman said.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli judge ordered seven Jewish settlers held
an additional three days on suspicion of involvement in the shooting
death of a Palestinian youth during a hike near the West Bank
village of Bani Zeit.
   Also Sunday, police ordered ballistic tests of Uzi submachine
guns held by Jewish settlers in the Hebron area as part of an
investigation into the shooting death of a Palestinian in March, the
radio said.
   Meanwhile, an official of the Save the Children Federation denied
reports that one of the group's workers, Chris George, was refusing
to cooperate with Israeli authorities investigating his kidnapping
last week.
   Israel's displeasure with George, 35, co-director of the
federation in the occupied territories, stems from his refusal to
give the army an account of his 30-hour captivity in the Gaza Strip,
three Israeli newspapers said.
   The Maariv daily said George, who was abducted Thursday and
released the following day, may be asked to leave for allegedly
helping his abductors compose a letter demanding freedom for seven
jailed Palestinian activists.
   A military analyst for the Yediot Ahronot daily said officials
understood George may have written the letter under duress.
   Neal Keny, regional director for Save the Children, said in a
telephone interview that George was debriefed three times by
soldiers since his captivity and in the presence of U.S. Embassy
officials.
   ``These allegations are outrageous and without basis. Chris is
completely cooperating with the investigation,'' Keny said. George
was away for the weekend and could not be reached for comment.

   Prince Rainier, who this week celebrates 40 years
as ruler of the tiny principality of Monaco, said in an interview
published Sunday that he is in no hurry to turn over the throne to
his 31-year-old son, Prince Albert.
   ``We are asking ourselves at the moment when he will take over
alone,'' the prince said. ``He knows that I am in no more of a hurry
to step down than I am desirous of holding the reins at any cost.
... My children have become my team.''
   He added that his daughters, Princess Caroline and Princess
Stephanie, have continued the cultural work begun by their mother,
the late Princess Grace.
   Monaco has been an independent principality for centuries.
   Rainier has ruled his 29,000 subjects as a constitutional
monarch, expanding the wealth of the principality and its fame as a
luxury tourist resort of mild climate and magnificent scenery.

   Hundreds of demonstrators from at least 10
countries demonstrated outside the world's largest bullring Sunday
to call for an end to the sport, police said.
   Spanish demonstrators at Las Ventas bullring were joined by
others from France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway,
Greece, West Germany and Venezuela.
   Protesters at the demonstration, which drew an estimated 1,000
people, carried banners bearing slogans condemning the wounding and
killing of bulls during the fights. Some shouted ``assassins'' at
fans.
   No incidents of violence were reported, police said.
   The demonstration was organized by the Animal Liberation
Association, which in December began a campaign to ban bullfighting.
   But bullfighting and animal sacrifice in religious festivals are
centuries-old traditions in Spain and more people than ever are
attending the events. In 1988, 23 million people attended bullfights
in Spain, 3 million more than in 1987.
   The capitals of 49 of Spain's 52 provinces have permament
bullrings, and during the summer months portable rings are set up in
thousands of towns and villages for their annual fiestas. Last year,
the number of major fights rose 11 percent over 1987 to 566, the
highest number in the past decade.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea's official news media reported some
200,000 people attended an anti-American rally in Pyongyang Sunday
and speakers called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Korea.
   In another report the state-run media said more than 100,000
North Koreans lined Pyongyang streets to welcome PLO chief Yasser
who previously visited Pakistan and China.
   Choe Mun Son, chief of the the Pyongyang committee of the ruling
Workers (communist) Party, addressed the rally.
   The official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Toyko,
reported Choe said: ``Now that the Soviet Union has taken the
initiative in disarmament, the East-West situation is showing signs
of detente and foreign troops are withdrawing from other regions of
the world, the United States must withdraw its troops and nuclear
weapons from South Korea.''
   The agency said the rally marked ``June 25, the day of struggle
against U.S. imperialism.''
   On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea,
starting a war that ended with an armistice on July 27, 1953.
   The United States has some 43,000 military personnel stationed in
South Korea under a mutual defense pact. North Korea claims they are
blocking a peaceful reunification of the country, divided since the
end of World War II in 1945.
   Choe told the rally the United States had started the Korean War
_ ``a most cruel and brutal, homicidal war.''
   ``Today, South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal
in the Far East, a most dangerous hotbed of nuclear war in the world
due to U.S. imperialist moves toward nuclear war,'' Choe said,
according to the Korean Central News Agency - KCNA.
   The agency reported anti-American demonstrations were held
Saturday throughout North Korea.
   KCNA said Arafat was greeted at the airport by Vice President Li
Jong Ok and other officials. It said the airport was decorated with
portraits of Arafat and President Kim Il Sung.
   Earlier Sunday, Arafat's plane made a brief stop at the Beijing
airport and the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman was met
by Yang Fuchang, assistant to the foreign minister.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported Yang conveyed the
greetings of China's communist leaders.
   The report referred to Arafat as president of the state of
Palestine. China has recognized a Palestinian government in exile.
   Arafat flew to Beijing from Pakistan, where he met with
government leaders Saturday in Islamabad and offered to mediate a
political solution to the civil war in neighboring Afghanistan.

   President Bush went golfing
Sunday with visiting Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but
proclaimed his guest a heavy favorite and insisted he was playing
only in the interest of international relations.
   ``I don't play golf,'' said Bush. ``I'm doing this just for good
will between Australia and the United States.''
   Bush and Hawke flew by helicopter together from the president's
Camp David retreat in the Maryland mountains to get in their round
of golf on a muggy afternoon at the Air Force base where Air Force
One is kept.
   Ridiculing his own golfing prowess, Bush also joked that he
didn't want to show up Hawke because he is hoping to get an
invitation to visit Australia.
   Hawke gets an official White House greeting on Tuesday with
military ceremonies and a state dinner.
   Bush waved off reporters' attempts to question him about two
recent oil spills in Delaware and Rhode Island and about
U.S.-Australian relations.
   ``This is a photo-op, or a sports-op,'' said Bush, referring to
his informal practice of not taking questions during photo-taking
sessions.
   The president teamed up with House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., while Hawke was paired with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Michel is known as one of the best golfers in Congress and when
Bush tossed three golf balls to decide the pairings and won Michel
as a teammate, Baker quipped, ``The fix is on.''
   ``The fix is on already,'' agreed Hawke.
   Notwithstanding Bush's initial effort to minimize his game, the
president outdrove the other members of the foursome on the first
two holes. The two pairs were tied after two holes when reporters
were escorted off the course.
   The foursome finished the 18 holes in about three and one-half
hours. The president, asked about the outcome, said only, ``very
close, very close.''
   Hawke presented his hosts with gift putters and golf shirts.

   Sikh extremists with automatic rifles
opened fire Sunday on Hindus exercising in a park in northern Punjab
state, killing 23 and wounding 27, according to police.
   They said the gunmen also set off two bombs, killing two
policemen.
   The attack occurred in Nehru Park in the town of Moga, 60 miles
south of Amritsar.
   Police said the victims belonged to the National Self-Reliance
Group, which follows a strict regimen of early morning exercises.
The group is an affiliate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a
right-wing political organization that wants to make Hinduism
India's state religion.
   Sikh separatists demanding that Punjab be made a self-governing
Sikh homeland began a campaign of violence in 1982. Sikh extremists
have been blamed for the deaths of at least 900 people this year,
with most of the victims killed in Punjab.
   The separatists say they are discriminated against culturally and
economically by India's Hindu-dominated government.
   Police said they did not know how many gunmen took part in
Sunday's attack. The victims ranged in age from 18 to 50, according
to the police.
   The bodies were scattered across the grass, their khaki shorts
and white vests soaked with blood.
   Press Trust of India said Home Minister Buta Singh, a Sikh, flew
to Moga to assess the situation.
   Authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in Moga and Gov.
Sidhharth S. Ray ordered police to ``capture the terrorists
responsible for the massacre, dead or alive, within a week,'' United
News of India reported.
   It quoted Ray as saying ``the perpetrators of this ghastly crime
are neither Hindus nor Sikhs, but animals hired by vested
interests.''
   He said the ``vested interests'' were hired from ``across our
border to create chaos, confusion and division in our sacred land.''
   Ray did not name any country but India accuses predominantly
Moslem Pakistan of harboring and aiding Sikh extremists. Pakistan
has denied the allegation.
   About 88 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindu. Sikhs
make up only 2 percent of the population but are in a slight
majority in Punjab.
   Sikhism is an offshoot of the Hindu religion. It was founded in
northern India about 500 years ago and is based on belief in one god
and rejects idolatry and the caste system.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico produced showers and
thunderstorms Sunday over parts of Texas, and showers and
thunderstorms developed over the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Rain also fell along sections of the Atlantic Coast.
   The tropical depression was drifting slowly northward, producing
tides up to 2 to 3 feet above normal along parts of the upper Texas
coast and the coast of Louisiana. Showers and thunderstorms spread
to south-central and southeastern Texas.
   The highest sustained wind in the depression was around 35 mph,
with strengthening possible by midday Monday. If maximum sustained
wind hit 39 mph, it would be reclassified a tropical storm.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along a warm front in the
upper Mississippi Valley, extending across eastern Minnesota,
northeastern Iowa and western Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed over Florida, and along a
stationary front curving through the Atlantic Coast. A few showers
and thunderstorms also developed along a frontal system curving
through the lower Great Lakes region and northern Ohio Valley.
   Elsewhere, a few showers spread over the northern Rockies and the
northern high Plains.
   Rainfall reported during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT were all
less than an inch.
   Clouds and rain kept temperatures only in the 40s across parts of
Montana, while the southern and eastern sections of the state
enjoyed sunshine and readings in the 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Great Falls, Mont., to 100 at Tucson, Ariz. Sunday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 30 at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The forecast for Monday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from central and eastern Texas to Florida and Georgia,
and from Minnesota and Iowa to the upper Ohio Valley and the Great
Lakes; and widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over the
central high Plains.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted from North Dakota to upper
Michigan, and along much of the Pacific Coast; in the lower 90s in
much of Kansas, Oklahoma, the lower and middle Mississippi Valley,
the lower Ohio Valley and the Southeast, and from the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas through much of New Mexico and Arizona to the
valleys and deserts of southern and central California; and above
100 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   Syrian gunners shelled Christian ports
north of the city Sunday to maintain their blockade, and police said
a kidnapped Sunni Moslem civil servant was released after four days
in captivity.
   The gunners, deployed in the Moslem sector of the Lebanese
capital, shelled the ports of Jounieh and Byblos with rounds of
Soviet-designed 130mm mortars. The ports have become the Christians'
only link with the outside world.
   Aoun's gunners opened up with 155mm howitzers on the seaside
boulevard of west Beirut where several Syrian batteries are
entrenched.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   The Syrians have harassed the besieged Christian enclave since
the latest round in the 14-year-old civil war began March 8.
   Fighting between Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
20,000 soldiers and the 40,000-strong Syrian troops began when Aoun
blockaded illegal militia-run ports because he said they cost his
government $100 million yearly in lost revenues.
   Syrian troops, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, responded by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   By police count, 373 people have been killed and 1,460 wounded in
the 14 weeks of fighting. Several Arab league calls for a
comprehensive cease-fire have been undermined.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker has reiterated a U.S. call
for the Lebanese to show restraint to avert further bloodshed,
Moslem officials said Sunday.
   Baker reportedly made his appeal in a letter sent to acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet vying for power
with a rival Christian government, officials at Hoss' office said.
   The existence of the letter could not be confirmed Sunday and it
was not known whether Baker sent a similar document to Aoun.
   Police said the abducted civil servant, Raja Bsat, who works at
the Ministry of Economy, was freed late Saturday. They did not
identify his abductors or give other details.
   A previously unknown group, calling itself Father of the Poor,
took responsibility for Bsat's abduction in Syrian-policed west
Beirut on Wednesday to protest a bread shortage.
   The latest fighting has led to power rationing and shortages of
food, fuel and hospital supplies on both sides of divided Beirut.
   Also Sunday, pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalists protested Saudi
Arabia's restrictions on the number of Moslems allowed to visit the
holy shrines of Mecca and Medina during the annual pilgrimage season.
   In Moslem west Beirut, about 100 members of Hezbollah, or Party
of God, staged a demonstration outside Hoss' home, shouting ``death
to (King) Fahd'' of Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudi government last year introduced a quota of 1,000
pilgrims for every 1 million people from each Islamic nation until
it can expand facilities in the holy cities.
   Some 2 million Moslems usually converge on Mecca and Medina
during the pilgrimage, which Moslems are required to make at least
once. The pilgrimage season climaxes in mid-July.

<HEAD>Survivor Of Auschwitz Slain Over Swastika</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old survivor of a Nazi death camp was
bludgeoned and stabbed to death in a boarding house by a man he'd
accused of scrawling a swastika on his door, police said.
   ``The guy might have stabbed him, but the war still killed him,''
said the victim's son, Lenny Kowalski, 38. ``It was the insignia
that did it.''
   Max Kowalski's body was found Saturday in the room of Ruben
Martinez Zucarino, 36, who was charged with second-degree murder,
said police Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   The victim, known to his friends as ``The Mayor of Brighton
Beach,'' lived with his wife in Manhattan, but spent his days in a
rented room at the Brooklyn boarding house fixing old televisions
and radios as a hobby.
   The younger Kowalski said he was visiting with his father in the
workshop Saturday morning when he noticed the swastika and a skull
and crossbones scrawled in blue felt-tip pen on the door.
   ``I said, `Who do you think could have done it?''' said the son.
``He said he'd had some words with the guy next door over him not
cleaning up the kitchen earlier this week.''
   Max Kowalski then quietly washed the marks from the door, said
his son.
   The younger Kowalski complained to the landlady, Tuey Chin, who
said that when she asked Zucarino about the graffiti he was holding
a marker of the same blue color in his hands. But he told her he
knew nothing about the drawings.
   A short time later, Max Kowalski went to Zucarino's apartment,
where he confronted him about the swastika, police said.
   A fight ensued. Zucarino stabbed Kowalski repeatedly with a
scissors and a fork and smashed a religious statue over his head,
killing him, police said.
   Kowalski, a Polish Jew whose family died at the Auschwitz
concentration camp, came to the United States in 1949 and worked as
a carpenter. He and his wife, also a Holocaust survivor, raised two
sons.

   Nearly 670,000 people turned out for gay pride parades from coast
to coast Sunday to mark the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall riot
in New York City, considered the start of the homosexual rights
movement.
   AIDS was a major theme in marches in New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, Minneapolis, West Hollywood, Calif., Birmingham, Ala.,
and Lansing, Mich.
   In San Francisco, a cheering crowd estimated at 300,000 people
turned out for the 19th annual Lesbian-Gay Freedom Parade.
   Paraders were led by ``Dykes on Bikes,'' a women's motorcycle
contingent clad in everything from nothing to black-lace stockings
and leather corsets.
   The parade wound through San Francisco's predominantly gay Castro
District to the Civic Center for a rally and entertainment.
   In New York City, a record 150,000 people marched in the annual
Lesbian and Gay Pride March, which marked the 20th anniversary of
the Stonewall riot, organizers said. Thousands of cheering
spectators lined sidewalks.
   Participants mourned the loss of friends to acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``I have to be here for all those who aren't,'' said marcher Joe
Polito. ``This isn't an issue of being gay any more. This is an
issue of human rights.''
   Polito's feelings were echoed by many marchers, who represented
groups from the nationally known AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
(ACT UP) to the small contingent of Armenian Lesbians.
   One marcher carried a banner citing the parade's honorary grand
marshal, Edward F. Murphy, ``The Original Stonewaller.'' Murphy, a
longtime gay activist, died earlier this year at 63.
   The Stonewall riot occurred on June 27, 1969, when homosexuals
battled police conducting a raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich
Village. Several participants in the riot marched together.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and other city officials also marched.
   The festivities were stopped briefly for a moment of silence for
AIDS victims. As marchers stood quietly, skywriting planes spelled
out ``We remember'' over Manhattan.
   An anti-gay group of about three dozen people heckled the
marchers from behind a double police barricade, waving signs and
shouting, ``Perverts on parade!''
   Marchers mocked the protesters by blowing kisses as they walked
past. One man, wearing a striped dress and a towering bouffant wig,
shouted over, ``We love you!'' while Lee Ann Betz held a sign that
read ``Jesus was gay.''
   In Chicago, Mayor Richard M. Daley climbed into a glistening aqua
1956 Thunderbird to help kick off the windy city's 20th annual Gay
and Lesbian Pride Parade.
   ``I think the parade means a lot to the gay and lesbian
community, and it means a lot to Chicago,'' Daley said. ``It shows a
community spirit.''
   About 90,000 people were expected during the two-mile parade that
was to end with a rally.
   Daley said an ordinance to protect homosexuals' rights and other
minorities was enacted by the City Council earlier this year with
his support. He said the ordinance is helping deal with ``young
punks who come through bashing the gay and lesbian community.''
   In West Hollywood, Calif., more than 200,000 people gathered for
the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration.
   The parade began with the release of thousands of pink balloons
inscribed with the words ``I Love You'' as a tribute to AIDS
patients.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley waved to the crowd as he rode in a
vintage car. Other groups included a color guard of gay veterans and
a marching band from San Diego. Parents of homosexuals also marched,
with a banner reading: ``Our son is gay and that's OK.''
   ``It's exhilarating,'' said Bill Lake, 38, a uniformed Navy
Vietnam vet. ``We not only demand all the rights of heterosexuals,
but we helped defend them.''
   An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people turned out in Minneapolis for
a parade and rally.
   In Lansing, about 2,500 people rallied on the steps of the
Michigan Capitol, carrying signs that read ``2-4-6-8, how do you
know your secretary's straight?'' and ``How dare you assume I'm
heterosexual.''
   About 200 people attended a lesbian and gay parade and a rally in
Birmingham, Ala.
   In Louisville, Ky., on Saturday about 300 people took part in the
city's third annual gay and lesbian March for Justice.
   At a rally following the parade, they called for protection
against discrimination in housing, employment and public
accommodation, increased AIDS spending and the right to be open
about their relationshps.

<HEAD>India Delays Nepal-Bound Fuel at Border Amid Trade, Transit Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRGUNJ, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian checkpoint near this border city
on Sunday blocked 110 tanker trucks carrying fuel to Nepal, hit by
acute shortages caused by a three-month-old trade and transit
dispute between two countries.
   The 3,300-gallon tankers carrying gasoline, kereosene and diesel
oil from Singapore were lined up at the checkpoint at Raxaul in the
eastern Indian state of Bihar.
   Shyam Bihar Rai, the driver of one Indian-registered tanker
truck, said the convoy's documents were cleared by Calcutta port
customs in eastern India, ``yet these people (Indian customs
officials) at Raxaul are not allowing us to cross the border to
enter Nepal.''
   Indian customs officials say each truck would be allowed to carry
only 10.6 gallons of fuel in its own fuel tank to reach its
destination in Nepal. One official said this was a precaution
against possible smuggling.
   But the drivers said they needed more than that in their fuel
tanks to make the return journey to Calcutta.
   India and Nepal have been embroiled in a dispute since March 23,
when their trade and transit treaties expired. The Indian government
has closed 13 of the 15 trade points along its 1,000-mile border
with landlocked Nepal.
   One of those still open is Raxaul, connected by a small wooden
bridge with Birgunj, 75 miles south of Katmandu.
   A senior Nepalese officer said the Indian move to stop the
imports from Singapore was intended to further pressure his country.
   ``It was a surprising move. They even stopped releasing the cargo
imported by Nepal from a third country,'' Zonal (administrative)
Commissioner Tek Bahadur Thapa told reporters. ``It seems the action
has been taken to create more hardships for the Nepalese.''
   India traditionally has been a supplier of petroleum products to
Nepal, but after the trade and transit agreements expired, the
Indian oil corporation stopped handling petroleum products for Nepal.
   The resulting shortages have led to fuel rationing in Nepal. A
car owner is allowed to buy only 2.6 gallons a week.
   Nepal has imported some petroleum products through neighboring
Tibet and airlifted some from Bangladesh.

<HEAD>Norway Visit Better Late Than Never, Nobel Winner Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov came to Norway Sunday, 14
years after the Soviet human rights activist won the Nobel Peace
Prize but was not allowed to travel there to accept it.
   ``Better late than never,'' said Sakharov, who is on a tour of
Western Europe. ``I should have been here in 1975, but I was delayed
by a few years.''
   Soviet authorities denied him permission in 1975 to travel to
Oslo to receive that year's Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegian
Nobel Committee. His wife, Yelena Bonner, accepted it on his behalf.
   Sakharov, 68, spoke briefly with reporters upon arrival at an
Oslo airport from London. He and his wife were invited to Norway by
the Nobel Committee and other organizations.
   ``It's a very happy moment for us,'' said Jakop Sverdrup, the
Norwegian Nobel Committee's permanent secretary. ``He is 14 years
too late but we are glad he finally made it.''
   During Sakharov's six-day visit he is scheduled to meet with
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, Foreign Minister Thorvald
Stoltenberg and Soviet Embassy officials.
   The nuclear physicist, who helped develop Soviet nuclear weapons,
also will visit research institutes in Oslo and the Michelsen
Institute for Science and Intellectual Freedom in Bergen.
   ``My wife was Norway's guest a few years ago and what she told me
of the visit made me anxious to visit,'' said Sakharov, speaking
Russian to a Norwegian interpreter.
   The couple made an earlier stop in the Netherlands. They leave
Norway for Switzerland on July 1.
   Sakharov was elected to the newly formed Congress of the People's
Deputies by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in April, three years
after he was freed from internal exile in the city of Gorky. He had
been sent there as punishment for his dissident activities,
including criticism of the 10-year Soviet military intervention in
Afghanistan that began in 1979.

<HEAD>Survey Says Another Slight Drop In Nation's Gas Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices across the nation dropped for
the second time in four weeks, according to a survey of retailers
released Sunday.
   But an analyst who conducts the poll said new federal regulations
will slow or stop the trend.
   The bimonthly Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations
concluded that average prices for all grades of gasoline and all
types of service went down about a third of a penny to 117.61 cents,
survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   Prices dropped twice as much earlier this month, a June 9 survey
concluded. The survey released Sunday covered a two-week period
which ended Friday.
   Lundberg said the price dropped because refiners, terminal
operators and importers had stored an extra supply to meet the
challenge of new federal Environmental Protection Agency
requirements.
   The EPA recently instituted new volatility standards for
gasoline. The idea is to have refiners make cleaner-burning gasoline
during summer months, when sunlight cooks exhaust fumes into smog.
   Refiners had extra gasoline on hand in case they failed to meet
the new regulations and had to refine additional batches. But with
successful compliance, refiners found they had reserves available,
creating a surplus which lowered prices.
   Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce, and the toughest
standards are being imposed in July and August, which also happens
to be the peak holiday demand time for gasoline, Lundberg said.
   In addition to the federal standards, some states have adopted
even stricter rules, and refiners have begun referring to ``summer
gasoline'' and ``winter gasoline,'' Lundberg said.
   ``This price drop could be the last for a while,'' said Lundberg,
``The rules are even tighter for July 1 than June 1, and it makes
gasoline more costly to make.''
   According to the survey, average prices per gallon at
self-service stations were: regular unleaded, 107.79 cents; premium
unleaded 123.22 cents; and regular leaded 107.24 cents.
   At full service stations, average prices were: regular unleaded,
132.93 cents; premium unleaded, 144.64 cents; regular leaded, 130.45
cents.
   All the grades of gasoline fell slightly from the previous
survey, Lundberg said.

<HEAD>Police Prevent Anti-government Rally and Detain 16; Steep Tobacco
Price Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 16 people Sunday and
prevented a banned independence group from rallying to protest the
expected presidential candidacy of Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, an opposition spokesman said.
   Also Sunday, authorities announced consumers were to pay an
average of 83 percent more for tobacco products beginning Monday,
the state-run news agency PAP reported. Price hikes in the past have
sparked labor unrest.
   Police drove a car through the crowd gathered in Lublin, 100
miles southeast of Warsaw, to force protesters to disperse. They
arrested members of the Confederation for an Independent Poland,
including its leader Leszek Moczulski, said Zygmunt Lenyk, the
group's spokesman.
   Protesters shouted ``Jaruzelski must go,'' as they marched to the
downtown Communist Party headquarters, where they burned a copy of a
local party newspaper that supported the Polish leader's candidacy.
   The presidency was created under an accord reached between the
government and opposition in April. The accord led to partially free
elections earlier this month and to legalization of the trade union
after a seven-year ban.
   Solidarity won 99 of 100 seats in the newly created Senate and
161 seats _ all the places open to the opposition _ in the lower
house.
   The National Assembly will meet in early July to elect the new
president who in turn will choose a new prime minister. Because the
Communist Party and its allies have a majority, the presidency was
widely expected to go to Jaruzelski.
   Though he helped broker the democratic reforms, Poles are wary of
Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law in Dec. 1981 to crush
Solidarity. During the martial law thousands of opposition activists
were imprisoned or lost their jobs.
   The confederation vowed to hold rallies nationwide to oppose
Jaruzelski's nomination.
   Solidarity-supported lawmakers postponed making a decision at
their first meeting Friday.
   Citing increased production costs, the state-run tobacco company
Interbac raised the price for a package of its cheapest Polish
cigarettes from the equivalent of 10 cents to 19 cents.
   In the week since Poland held the second round of elections,
authorities have raised prices of sugar, gasoline, alcohol and items
such as refrigerators and washing machines by 40 to 70 percent.
   Inflation this year is officially projected at 60 percent but
unofficially is running at more than 100 percent.
   In a statement, a union umbrella group warned that ``the latest
price rises and rumors of others soon threaten an outburst of public
anger,'' the Polish news agency, PAP reported Sunday.

   The results are in from the first
human-powered submarine races: the U.S. Naval Academy won for
overall performance, and California Polytechnic State University
took top speed honors, organizers said Sunday.
   The subs were ``wet'' designs that fill up with water and require
racers to wear scuba gear. Racers said the biggest challenge was
maintaining a steady pace and not breathing too quickly, which could
lead to light-headedness or blackout due to oxygen deficiency.
   The awards were presented after a second day of stormy weather
forced cancellation of a nine-sub race around a 1-kilometer loop
course.
   ``They went out there and had trouble maneuvering the subs,''
said race spokeswoman Deb Cronin. ``The judges decided to scrub
today's racing and give out the awards based on previous races.''
   The overall performance award, given to the sub from the Naval
Academy in Annapolis Md., for high marks in speed, innovation and
design, carried a $5,000 prize.
   The ``Subversion'' entry from California Polytechnic in San Luis
Obispo earned the top speed award, beating the Naval Academy sub by
eight seconds in a 100-yard time trial.

   Leaders of the 12-nation European Economic
Community meet Monday for an epic battle with familiar lineups:
Margaret Thatcher vs. the rest of Europe.
   But at this two-day summit the British prime minister for the
first time confronts her allies looking like something of a loser _
trounced in this month's European Parliament elections and presiding
in Britain over 8.3 percent annual inflation and 14 percent interest
rates.
   In London, a poll published Sunday in the Observer newspaper
indicated her Conservatives trail the opposition Labor Party by 14
points. It said 42 percent of those polled believe Labor will win
the next general election.
   Critics, including some within her own Conservative Party, think
Mrs. Thatcher is cornered.
   They argue that if she continues blocking EEC proposals for a
single European currency and a ``social charter'' on workers' rights
and welfare, Britain will find itself sidelined.
   ``There is nothing whatever the United Kingdom can do to stop
this,'' said Lord Cockfield, whom Mrs. Thatcher removed last year as
one of Britain's two representatives at EEC headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
   ``All it can do is to leave itself sitting lamentably by the
wayside .... We need to take a more honest and humbler view of our
circumstances. Perhaps, after all, we need Europe more than Europe
needs us,'' he said in a speech last week.
   Mrs. Thatcher believes the social charter smacks of socialism and
the monetary union infringes on British sovereignty. She shows no
sign of changing her mind at the Madrid summit.
   Mrs. Thatcher met Sunday evening with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers, a possible ally in the monetary dispute. A British official
said later, ``They have a lot of common ground. ... Both sides want
a pragmatic approach to the issue and to get an agreed resolution''
at the summit.
   But he said Mrs. Thatcher remained adamant that Britain would not
be pulled into any process that would lead inevitably to a single
central bank and one currency for the 12 nations. The official spoke
with the condition of anonymity.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein saw some hope. He
said Sunday it appeared British officials ``are not being as
hard-line as they were before.'' Lutz Stavenhagen, a senior aide to
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said ``I see possibilities that
we'll come to a common position.''
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said he will press the
other leaders to make sweeping changes in monetary policies that
would lead to a single currency and central bank.
   ``We're not trying to exclude anyone,'' Gonzalez said in an
interview published in Madrid's El Pais newspaper. ``But neither
should anyone have the right to hold back the desire of those who
want to advance toward a monetary union. This message should be
understood.''
   In a signal last week that they will force Mrs. Thatcher's hand,
foreign ministers Roland Dumas of France and Hans-Dietrich Genscher
of West Germany declared they want ``a decisive political impulse to
be given in Madrid in favor of economic union.''
   On the social charter, Genscher said the EEC must go further than
the single market of 320 million people to be created when trade
barriers are dismantled in 1992.
   ``Workers in the 12 states must feel at home in this Europe,'' he
said.
   The EEC proposals encapsulate what Mrs. Thatcher dismisses as
grandiose and impractical moves toward some kind of United States of
Europe.
   She says that a proposal to harmonize welfare levels would mean
Britain and West Germany, the two big net contributors to the
community budget, would subsidize the poorest members: Spain,
Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
   On closer monetary cooperation, Mrs. Thatcher is showing some
signs of flexibility. She does not rule out Britain joining the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links
the main European currencies.
   But she opposes a central European banking system and the common
currency.
   The labor and economic proposals would need unanimous approval at
a special EEC conference. But Britain cannot stop the other member
countries from at least calling such a conference or giving broad
approval to the social charter.
   Even at home, Euro-bashing no long appears to be a vote-getter
for Mrs. Thatcher.
   A Gallup poll in mid-May showed that 55 percent of 1,274 Britons
questioned said the EEC is ``a good thing,'' compared with 21
percent in 1980.
   In elections for the European Parliament this month, Labor handed
Mrs. Thatcher her first defeat in a national ballot, overturning the
Conservatives' 45-32 majority of British seats in the Strasbourg
assembly.
   ``The British people may lack enthusiasm for integration, but her
kind of chauvinism is plainly passing out of fashion,'' wrote
columnist Peter Jenkins in The Independent newspaper. ``She heads
for ... Madrid denied a popular mandate for waging further war.''

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement
killed a marine major, a policeman and an ice cream vendor in
separate attacks, officials reported Sunday.
   The guerrillas also wounded a policeman and an army colonel in
the four weekend attacks, officials said. They gave these accounts:
   Policeman Marco Leon, 30, and another officer were on patrol in a
Lima industrial zone Saturday when they were ambushed by guerrillas
who killed Leon and wounded his companion.
   Marine Maj. Maximiliano Abarca was critically wounded in a gun
battle with guerrillas in the central highlands and died while being
evacuated by helicopter to Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   Saturday morning a Lima street vendor selling ice cream was
fatally shot. Police did not give the motive but blamed the killing
on Shining Path rebels.
   On Sunday an army colonel was wounded by gunmen as he left his
home in Lima.
   The Shining Path movement emerged in May 1980 and since then the
government says more than 14,000 people have been killed in violence
related to the insurgency.

   Hundreds of Chinese and American students, singing
``We Shall Overcome,'' honored fallen protesters in Beijing at a
memorial service and rally Sunday.
   Emerging from the somber service into bright sunlight, the
students linked hands in a large circle around a memorial to the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   They then moved forward to touch the abstract sculpture in
symbolic unity with Chinese students who flocked last month to touch
a replica of the Statue of Liberty in Tienanmen Square.
   Students also rallied in Indianapolis, where about 300 people
gathered to show their anger over the June 3-4 government crackdown
on pro-Democracy supporters in their homeland.
   The Chinese government has said 200 or 300 people were killed,
both soldiers and civilians. However, Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence sources have said the toll could be as high as 3,000,
most of them civilians.
   ``By killing those who are asking for human rights, the
government (of China) has placed itself in a hopeless position,
against all mankind,'' Zhen Gu, 30, a graduate student from
Shanghai, told the Boston assembly.
   ``It is precisely in the hopelessness of the tyranny that lies
the hope for democracy in China,'' he said.
   In poems and readings at Boston University's Marsh Chapel,
students repeatedly compared the democracy movement in China with
the civil rights movement in the United States.
   They also recalled the long suppression and recent electoral
triumph of the Solidarity trade union in Poland as they sought to
cast events in China in an optimistic light.
   After the service, the students took buses to Boston's City Hall
Plaza, where the mood turned from solemnity to anger. The crowd,
estimated by police at over 1,000, chanted slogans, waved placards
and circulated petitions calling for international condemnation of
the Chinese army's bloody attack on student demonstrators.
   In Indianapolis, students from universities throughout Indiana
carried banners and shouted ``Down with killing, down with Deng
Xiaoping'' as they marched around the federal courthouse in
sweltering heat.
   Motorists honked their support and passers-by stopped jogging to
join the three-block march from the Statehouse to the federal
courthouse, where the students heard messages of support from
representatives of Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., and Rep. Frank
McCloskey, D-Ind.
   ``You will be welcomed in our country,'' Lugar spokesman Keith
Luse told the demonstrators. ``You represent the best and the
brightest in your country. China's loss will be our gain.''

   An air ambulance carrying five people
crashed moments after takeoff from Pelee Island in Lake Erie,
killing three people, a Canadian police official said Sunday.
   Searchers found the body of pilot Frederick Allen Lewis, 36, of
Greenwood, Novia Scotia, who was killed in the crash late Saturday,
said Constable Wayne O'Brien of the Ontario Provincial Police. Two
passengers died in the wreck.
   Search boats rescued a man and a woman shortly after the plane
crashed about 200 yards west of the Canadian island, said O'Brien.
   Margaret Fraser of Pelee Island was being flown to a hospital in
Windsor, Ontario, for treatment of a broken ankle when the
twin-engine Navajo Chieftan owned by Southwest Air Ltd. of Windsor
crashed, O'Brien said.
   Ms. Fraser was pulled from the plane by co-pilot Peter Marshall,
42, of Windsor and the two were picked up by local boaters, said
O'Brien. They were taken to Metro Hospital in Windsor.
   Marshall was treated for minor burns and released. Ms. Fraser was
listed in satisfactory condition at the hospital.
   The other dead were identified as Ms. Fraser's husband, Ken
Fraser, 62, and ambulance attendant Charles Russell Ransom, 28, of
Harrow in southwestern Ontario.
   Coast Guard divers, boats and a helicopter from Detroit and
Marblehead joined with Canadian police and rescuers from the island
in the search during the night, Attaway said. The Coast Guard pulled
out of the search after Ontario police divers took over the
operation Sunday.
   O'Brien said there is no town or village on Pelee Island, whose
population of about 250 increases to about 1,000 in the summer. The
island lies about 13 miles north of Marblehead, across Sandusky Bay
from Sandusky, and 15 miles south of the Canadian mainland.

   Baseball legend Pete Rose gained a reprieve
Sunday from a judge who blocked baseball's commissioner from holding
a hearing that could have banned the Cincinnati Reds manager from
the game for gambling.
   Common Pleas Judge Norbert Nadel, deciding Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti has ``pre-judged'' Rose, granted Rose a temporary
restraining order that put Monday's hearing on hold until at least
July 6.
   ``Giamatti could not be impartial,'' the judge said.
   Nadel said no action may be taken against Rose for two weeks. The
judge said he will consider on July 6 a motion for a preliminary
injunction that would put the case on hold while Nadel decides
whether he or Giamatti should decide Rose's fate.
   The judge said he though Rose's career would be irreparably
harmed if Monday's hearing were held. Nadel found that baseball and
the public interest would not be hurt if the hearing were not held
Monday.
   Rose could be suspended for a year if Giamatti determines he bet
on major-league games. He could be banned for life if he is found to
have wagered on Reds' games.
   Rose was not in the packed courtroom for the decision; he was at
nearby Riverfront Stadium for Sunday's game against Los Angeles.
   In a pre-game interview with radio station WLW, Rose said he was
very happy with the ruling.
   ``I think they proved (Giamatti) already made up his mind,'' Rose
said. ``It just wasn't going to be a fair hearing, in my eyes. It
was obvious he believed my accusers.''
   ``I think we got justice,'' said Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz.
   Giamatti, the former president of Yale University, issued a
statement saying: ``I regret the judge's decision. I have absolutely
no prejudgment or prejudice regarding Pete Rose. We will contest
this matter tooth and nail.''
   Louis Hoynes, who presented baseball's case against Rose, said:
``It's an erroneous ruling. It's a problem, a serious mistake.''
   The unprecedented decision came two days after a hearing in which
baseball special investigator John Dowd revealed that he has
evidence that Rose bet on major-league games, including Reds games,
in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   On Sunday, Nadel, after reading a letter that Giamatti wrote in
behalf of Rose's chief accuser, Ronald Peters, said, ``It appears to
this court that the commissioner has pre-judged Peter Edward Rose.''
   The judge got the case after Rose's lawyers sued June 19,
asserting Rose had been denied a fair investigation by Dowd. They
also said Giamatti had already decided that Rose is guilty, and they
asked that the court _ not Giamatti _ determine whether the manager
bet on baseball.
   The first step in the case was Rose's request to halt his hearing
with Giamatti.
   Over the years, Charles O. Finley, Ted Turner and other team
owners had gone to court to challenge the broad powers given to
baseball's commissioners, but none had succeeded. Nadel admitted
Friday that allowing a court to intervene would be going into
``previously uncharted waters.''
   Joseph Tomain, a University of Cincinnati law professor, said he
believed Nadel went further than necessary in finding in favor of
Rose.
   ``I think he went further than he had to go,'' Tomain said. ``I
understood him to say on his last point that Giamatti was prejudiced
... and that really should have been the issue at the preliminary
hearing'' in two weeks.
   Tomain said Nadel could simply have said there was evidence that
Rose would not have received a fair hearing and issued a restraining
order to allow for a cooling-off period.
   Fans en route to the Reds' game remained solid in their support
for Rose.
   ``I'm glad about what the judge did,'' said Dougie Fresh of
Cincinnati. ``Giamatti has made up his mind, there's no question. I
think they should leave the man alone.''
   He said his opinion of Rose has not changed, despite allegations
that Rose bet on his own team.
   Bo Hussey of Charlotte, N.C., said he was pleased with Nadel's
ruling because ``they haven't proven anything. He's an innocent man
until proven otherwise.''

<HEAD>Former Mistress of Prime Minister Appears on Television</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 40-year-old former geisha, whose identity had been
withheld, appeared on television Sunday and said she was paid by
Prime Minister Sousuke Uno to be his mistress in 1985.
   Mitsuko Nakanishi said Uno was high-handed with her. She was
shown in an interview with the Tokyo Broadcasting System at a temple
in Kagoshima prefecture in southwestern Japan.
   ``I think a person who does not understand the weak could not
conduct good politics,'' she said.
   Ms. Nakanishi said she had not expected her story, first
published in a weekly magazine, would generate so much interest. The
report in the magazine, Sunday Mainichi, did not name her.
   ``I just wanted to tell the facts,'' Ms. Nakanishi said.
   After the story appeared, opposition parties and some womens'
groups demanded an explanation from Uno. They said they were
concerned the reports might damage Japan's reputation abroad.
   Uno has refused to talk publically about the alleged affair,
saying it is a private matter.
   Uno was the head of research committee of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in 1985 when Ms. Nakanishi said she became his
mistress. She said a contract was signed with her geisha house and a
small ceremony was observed.
   She said in the interview that under the contract Uno paid the
equivalent of $14,280 to the house and later gave her $7,140. That
was in addition to monthly payments of $2,100 over four months, Ms.
Nakanishi said.
   Uno became foreign minister in 1987 and on June 2 was chosen
prime minister after a long search for a politician with a clean
image to help the Liberal Democrats overcome a widespread
influence-peddling scandal.
   In the interview, Ms. Nakanishi said she kept her silence when
Uno became foreign minister but was indignant when he emerged as
prime minister.
   When the interviewer asked whether keeping silent about relations
with customers was a rule among geishas, Ms. Nakanishi said she was
``not a criminal'' for disclosing her relationship with Uno.
   ``There should be no discrimination by job. ... Even the geisha
pays taxes,'' she said. ``Mr. Uno is a public figure.''
   Ms. Nakanishi said she was no longer a geisha, although she did
not specify her current job except to say that she worked for a
company.
   The interviewer said Ms. Nakanishi had gone to the temple for
purification rites and had been advised by a priest to tell her
story on television.
   The earlier story involved a break with the usual Japanese
practice of not releasing information abouat the private lives of
politicians. Some editors have said they believe the public's
attitude toward the country's leaders is becoming stricter.
   Contrary to some beliefs, geisha are not prostitutes but highly
trained entertainers. Most work in traditional restaurants where
guests are primarily male. Some become the mistresses of favored
patrons.
   In the late 1970s geisha numbered about 17,000, but their number
is believed to have dwindled.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hong Kong official left for Hanoi Sunday for
talks with Vietnamese officials on the possible forced repatriation
of Vietnamese boat people from this British colony.
   Secretary for Security John Barnes and the British colony's
political adviser, Richard Clift, were to begin two days of
negotiations in Hanoi on Monday.
   Barnes said last week after returning from the Geneva conference
on Indochinese refugees that Hong Kong's aim ``is to get all
Vietnamese out of Hong Kong, both refugees and non-refugees ... by
resettlement, by repatriation, whichever.''
   He said he was encouraged by Vietnam's expressed willingness at
Geneva to hold bilateral talks with any participating countries.
   At the 60-nation Geneva talks, Hong Kong and Britain argued for
forced repatriation but were opposed by the United States and the
Soviet Union. Vietnam has said it will take back only refugees
returning on their own accord.
   So far, only 143 Vietnamese have returned home from Hong Kong.
   More than 44,000 Vietnamese are now in Hong Kong and officials
say most are not refugees from political persecution but illegal
immigrants seeking better economic conditions.

<HEAD>White Knight May Rescue Prime Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he cut his buyout offer for Prime Computer
Inc. at the eleventh hour, takeover specialist Bennett S. LeBow was
driving a hard bargain. Maybe too hard.
   On Friday, J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., the nation's oldest venture
capital firm, rode into battle as a ``white knight'' friendly to
Prime's management in a deal valued at about $1.25 billion.
   Would Whitney have jumped in if LeBow hadn't cut his price?
   ``I don't know,'' said Don E. Ackerman, a general partner in the
New York City firm. ``He dropped his offer at about the same time we
were coming to grips with a decision, so we never had to think about
it.''
   Wall Street professionals had fewer doubts.
   ``By playing cute, LeBow blew it,'' one arbitrager said flatly,
speaking anonymously.
   Whitney announced an agreement with Prime's board of directors to
buy the company for cash and securities.
   The $1.25 billion value placed on the package by Wall Street
analysts was roughly the same price that LeBow had initially offered
last November, but at least $120 million more than the revised offer
he made June 1.
   Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for MAI Basic Four Inc., the Tustin,
Calif., computer firm that LeBow heads, said Friday that LeBow would
not comment on the Whitney deal.
   Before LeBow cut his $20-per-share offer, Prime had solicited
more than 50 companies, including Whitney, for a higher offer. When
no one came forward in April or May, it appeared MAI Basic had the
deal sewn up.
   Then, LeBow dropped his price to $19.50 in cash for about 75
percent of Prime's shares and a package of bonds and preferred stock
for the remainder. Analysts valued that offer at about $18 a share,
or $1.13 billion, and Prime immediately postponed its annual meeting
from June 14 to July 26 to try again to get a better price.
   Some analysts say LeBow was justified in cutting his price,
because Prime's earnings forecasts had dropped in the first half of
1989 as the computer industry slumped and the costs of the takeover
battle mounted.
   ``The value of the company went down,'' said Barry F. Willman,
who follows Prime for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York.
   On Thursday, shortly after Prime indicated it had found a white
knight, LeBow announced that he would raise his price. But as of
Friday evening, he had not said how much more he would offer.
   Boosted by the Whitney announcement and the possibility of a
bidding war, Prime stock shot up $3.12{ to close at $19 a share
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. MAI's stock dropped 12{ cents
to $6.25.
   The merger would be the largest single investment ever for
Whitney, a private New York firm founded in 1946 by wealthy
industrialist John Hay Whitney.
   Prime, based in suburban Natick, makes minicomputers and is the
second-largest producer of computer aided design and manufacturing
systems, surpassed only by International Business Machines Corp. It
has 11,200 employees and had sales of $1.6 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Jury Selection To Begin In Hotel Queen's Tax Evasion Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hotel queen Leona Helmsley is due in federal
court Monday to face charges that she evaded taxes by billing
personal luxuries _ including a marble dance floor for her mansion _
as business expenses.
   She'll face the charges without her 80-year-old billionaire
husband, Harry, who has been found incompetent to stand trial
because of memory and reasoning problems caused by several slight
strokes. Two former aides are also on trial.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 68, and her husband were indicted in April 1988 on
charges that they evaded personal income taxes by allegedly
disguising about $4 million in renovations to their Greenwich,
Conn., mansion.
   Jury selection begins Monday, with opening arguments expected
July 5.
   Joseph Brodsky, lawyer for Helmsley aide Frank Turco, has been
given permission to hand potential jurors a questionnaire asking
their incomes and attitudes toward the wealthy, the New York Post
reported Sunday.
   Brodsky said he wants to know if the potential jurors are
``biased against rich people.''
   ``Or whether they've seen Mrs. Helmsley's ads in the newspapers
and they think she's an ogre,'' he said.
   The couple head a $5 billion real estate and hotel empire.
   Mrs. Helmsley is portrayed in advertisements as the ``Queen of
the Helmsley Hotels.'' The ad campaign calls the luxury Helmsley
Palace in Manhattan, directly behind St. Patrick's Cathedral, ``the
only palace in the world where the queen stands guard.'' But some
disaffected former employees have accused her of being demanding to
the point of being abusive.
   The other defendants, Turco and Joseph V. Licari, are charged
with helping create false invoices to make it appear that the costly
renovations on the $8 million, 28-room mansion were tax-deductible
improvements on business properties.
   Among the renovations cited in the indictment was a marble dance
floor installed above a swimming pool; a breakfast room; an
indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $370,000 in landscaping; and
an assortment of furniture and paintings.
   The indictment said a $45,000 silver clock in the shape of the
Helmsley Building _ a gift for Harry Helmsley _ was billed to and
paid by their Park Lane Hotel. Four jade art objects worth half a
million dollars were paid for by four hotels as furniture purchases,
the indictment said.
   It's not the first tax case Mrs. Helmsley has been involved in.
   Several years ago there were reports that she failed to pay more
than $38,000 in sales tax for jewelry at Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.
   She was never charged, and was given immunity for her cooperation
with authorities and her testimony in cases against merchants of
expensive luxury items, including jewelry. Stores were accused of
shipping empty boxes to addresses out of state so customers could
take goods with them but avoid paying state and city sales taxes.
   The tax evasion case comes to trial after a lengthy pretrial
period during which defense lawyers filed numerous motions to
overturn the 47-count indictment or remove one or both of the
Helmsleys from the case.
   One bid to throw out the indictment went to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which in April rejected the motion that alleged prosecutorial
misconduct for alleged grand jury leaks to the news media.
   Last fall, the Helmsleys' lawyer, Gerald Feffer, claimed that the
false invoices were used by Turco and Licari ``to enable them to
steal blindly from the Helmsleys. That's crucial to our defense.''
   Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge John Walker found Harry
Helmsley unable to assist in his own defense because of the
stroke-related problems. The ruling did not dismiss the charges
against Helmsley but indefinitely delayed his trial.
   The judge noted that medical experts believed Helmsley's mental
deterioration would continue and said it was unlikely he would be
tried.

<HEAD>Bidder To Lorenzo: Let Expert Decide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago options trader Joseph Ritchie has challenged
Eastern Airlines Chairman Frank Lorenzo to let an independent expert
decide whose rebuilding plan for the strike-hobbled carrier is
better.
   ``I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is, and I
respectfully request Mr. Lorenzo do the same,'' Ritchie said in a
telephone interview over the weekend from his Chicago home.
   Ritchie said his union-backed plan could still save Eastern,
while he considers Lorenzo's rebuilding plan to be ``a disguised
liquidation.''
   ``My plan has an immediate ramp-up with all the workers coming
back motivated,'' Ritchie said Saturday.
   Lorenzo's plan, which calls for the sale of $1.8 billion in
Eastern assets to reduce the airline to about two-thirds its
pre-strike size, goes against industry opinion and even Lorenzo's
own past philosophy because it shrinks instead of enlarges the
airline, Ritchie said.
   Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, rejected Ritchie's bid
for Eastern earlier this month, but the bankruptcy court gave
Ritchie permission to continue pursuing his bid while Lorenzo seeks
approval for his rebuilding plan from Eastern's creditors.
   Ritchie is the latest in a series of would-be Eastern buyers, and
Lorenzo last week called the effort to sell the carrier intact ``a
joke'' promoted by the unions to keep members from crossing picket
lines in the 3{-month-old strike.
   Ritchie said he had been keeping his ongoing efforts private, but
Lorenzo's comments prompted him to challenge the chairman publicly.
   ``If it's a joke, I would be happy to let a neutral third party
set us straight,'' Ritchie said. ``If I didn't believe this can
work, I wouldn't be spending all this time and money.''
   Ritchie said, though, that Lorenzo wouldn't willingly allow an
independent party assess Ritchie's plan.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Saturday that Ritchie's plan
had already been studied by an independent party: the bankruptcy
court examiner and his analyst.
   ``The Ritchie plan is a colossal joke. Entering into a charade
... by submitting it again to another third party just prolongs the
agony of false hope for the striking unions and their members,''
Matell said. He called Eastern's own plan clearly in the best
interests of all parties involved.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who has had jurisdiction
over Eastern since the company filed March 9 for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization, has declined union requests to appoint a
trustee to take over management of Eastern from Lorenzo.
   The unions took heart last week from a request by U.S. Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., that Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner look
into the Eastern situation, while other House members set an
aviation subcommittee hearing on Eastern for Thursday.
   Ritchie said, though, that Eastern is nearing the point of no
return because of management's steady asset sales. Eastern has
announced nearly $900 million in sales, either approved or pending
approval in court.
   ``By the time the truth comes out, it might be too late,''
Ritchie said. ``If he's allowed to continue selling off assets, he's
going to make it untenable for anybody.''
   Ritchie declined to give details of his bid, but he said Lorenzo
wants a price far in excess of what he believes Eastern is worth and
that would leave Eastern in a nearly impossible cash position.
   Ritchie reportedly has been improving his earlier bid by coming
up with more cash up front. According to the reports, he would offer
about $100 million cash, with substantial union concessions starting
with $250 million in the first six months. Other backing would come
through debt and equity financing.
   ``Our offer is very substantially above what we believe to be the
value of the company,'' Ritchie said.

<HEAD>UAW Dissidents Put a Spin on Their Convention Losses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerry Tucker stood before his troops in a
ballroom at the Jolly Roger Motel, rallying them to keep up their
dissent after a week of losing fights on the United Auto Workers
union convention floor.
   The 300 or so New Directions movement members were licking their
wounds as the week-long convention here wound down. But they said
UAW members should stay tuned _ the dissident group had things
planned.
   ``When we leave Anaheim, we will be intact and growing in the UAW
across the country,'' Tucker said last week.
   The next time New Directions members confront the union's
leadership publicly may not come until next spring, when the union
holds its bargaining convention to set policies for negotiations
with the Big Three automakers in the summer of 1990. The UAW's
contracts with the companies expire Sept. 14, 1990.
   New Directions claims proportionately more members in the
rank-and-file than were among the 2,100 delegates at the triennial
convention.
   ``We've gotten here by coming up through the shop floor,'' Tucker
said, ``They have come down from unreachable Solidarity House (the
UAW headquarters) and have imposed directions on us.''
   Tucker's words came in the aftermath of defeat.
   New Directions lost attempts at the convention to alter the
makeup of more than a dozen of the hundreds of convention
delegations, claiming some delegates won illegal local elections.
There is a chance that the movement will go to the Labor Department
to seek new elections.
   The dissidents suffered their second setback when the convention
turned back an effort to change the method of electing top national
officers. Officers currently are elected by a vote of convention
delegates; New Directions wanted it changed to a unionwide
referendum of rank-and-file members that the group said would
provide more democracy in the union.
   New Directions also attempted to limit the use of
labor-management joint programs in factories, saying it eroded the
traditional role of a union. That failed, too.
   Tucker himself also suffered a big loss. Roy Wyse was elected UAW
director from Region 5, thwarting a re-election bid by Tucker to the
same seat.
   At the time, Wyse said the defeats signaled ``the beginning of
the end for the New Directions movement.''
   Later, Tucker said: ``I think Brother Wyse will soon find that
New Directions is reaching an acceleration that will worry the
administration down the road until these very people are traded in.''
   UAW President Owen Bieber and his Administration Caucus denied
all of New Directions' charges, but acknowledged they made an impact
on the convention.
   ``This group was perhaps better organized that (dissident) groups
of the past,'' Bieber said.
   Just after Tucker lost his re-election bid, Bieber suggested that
some of the New Directions arguments have little substance.
   ``I think a lot of that rhetoric out there was designed to
promote people's political futures,'' the union president said.
   But Tucker and his backers rejected that suggestion, saying their
issues are serious and will be around a long time.
   ``When you look at joint programs, look at the most modern,''
said New Directions member Ed Tweed of Local 5960 in Lake Orion,
Mich. ``At all of these (plants), there's nothing but New
Directions.''
   In each of the New Directions issues that came up on the floor,
the organization had the support of no more than 20 percent of the
delegates.
   Nevertheless, New Directions members were undaunted.
   ``They didn't intimidate us,'' Tweed said. ``We fought for what
we said we would.
   ``We're out here to plant seeds, he added. ``Next time, we're
going to harvest them.''

   The Bush Administration will ask Congress to allow
automakers more flexibility in meeting pollution standards, a
federal official said.
   The president's air pollution control bill will propose
eliminating a requirement that nearly every passenger car meet the
same pollution limits, said Richard Wilson, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Mobile Sources.
   Wilson said ``emissions averaging'' would allow automakers to
make low-polluting cars that would offset other vehicles that fail
to meet federal pollution standards.
   The provision will be included in Bush's proposed Clean Air Act,
which will be submitted to Congress within the next two weeks, the
Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.
   Auto industry officials declined to comment on the Bush plan,
which is similar to proposals they have made in the past.
   William Noack, a General Motors Corp. spokesman in Washington,
said the company's policy is not to comment on legislation it has
not reviewed. However, he said ``We favor those systems which allow
for flexibility in market-based incentives,'' when asked for general
comment on emissions averaging.
   Environmentalists oppose any such plan.
   ``We are not enthusiastic about the idea,'' said David Hawkins,
senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``We
don't like the idea of being able to sell dirty cars in one location
in return for a manufacturer being able to sell cleaner cars in
another location.''

<HEAD>Mexico Needs Foreign Debt Agreement For Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico wants to hold out for the maximum
reduction in its towering foreign debt in talks with banks but at
the same time needs an agreement soon to be able to promote economic
growth and stability.
   For Mexico, what is at stake in the negotiations under way in New
York goes beyond how much the country can save in payments on its
$107.4 billion foreign debt, the second highest in the developing
world after Brazil's.
   If banks balk at what Mexico considers a good agreement, the
government's alternatives are to accept less favorable terms or
suspend payments to try to force more concessions, something
considered a last resort.
   Mexico went into the talks seeking a 55 percent reduction in the
prinicipal it owes commercial banks and has come down to 45 percent,
sources close to the talks say. The committee representing more than
500 creditor banks has offered 22 percent and is moving toward 30
percent.
   ``It's not a matter of being able to pay, it's being able to
grow,'' said Jonathan Heath of MACRO Asesoria Economica, a
consulting firm.
   The government wants to reduce the payments from 7 percent to 2
percent of the gross domestic product.
   During the six years after the end of the oil boom in 1982, the
country averaged virtually no economic growth. Workers' salaries buy
only half as much as they did. Since he took office Dec. 1,
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has emphasized renegotiation of
the foreign debt as an important part, but not the entire solution,
to the economic crisis.
   In a recent interview with executives and members of The
Associated Press, Salinas said negotiations were going more slowly
than he would have liked. He said they were likely to take weeks and
perhaps even months more.
   ``There's not much time because the social demands are there. At
the same time it's a very complicated negotiation,'' he said.
   If Mexico reaches its goals on reduction of principal, fresh
funds and other results of the negotiations, the nation hopes to
save about $7 billion a year on interest and principal payments.
Without an agreement, it would spend an estimated $16 billion this
year.
   More than as a source for financing projects, the government is
counting on the agreement to stimulate the private investment needed
to shake the economy out of stagnation. Its target is 6 percent
growth by 1994.
   To reduce capital flight during the prolonged negotiations, the
government has held interest rates high. Even so, some analysts say,
some money has trickled out.
   When it became apparent that its July target for an agreement
wouldn't be met, an 18-month-old anti-inflation agreement with
labor, the private sector and farmers was renewed early to calm
anxiety. It includes a continuation of the one-peso-a-day
devaluation rate through March 1990.
   A favorable agreement would help protect the currency against
further devaluation, reduce the need for government borrowing and
thereby free up the credit for others, and relieve pressure on
interest rates, cutting expenses for both the government and private
borrowers, economists said.
   With only moderate relief from the banks, there is greater risk
of renewed inflation, devaluation, big deficits and other problems
that would thwart growth, said Abel Beltran-del-Rio, director of
CIEMEX-Wefa, economic consultants in Philadelphia.
   Banks argue that too liberal an agreement would pose serious
financial trouble for some of them.
   Mexico is breaking ground for a line of Third World debtor
countries seeking to renegotiate. Each one is certain to want better
terms.
   Of the estimated $70 billion of Mexico's debt in foreign
commercial banks, $38 billion is being renegotiated in the talks.
   While no one is saying a suspension of payments is imminent, the
government has the political groundwork prepared. Labor, farm and
even some government-aligned business leaders have said they would
support Salinas if a moratorium is needed.
   Some private economists also support a strong stand.
   ``A rapid, bad solution worries me more than a solution that
takes longer but that is solid,'' said Manuel Sanchez, director of
the Center for Economic Analysis and Research, a private think tank.
   ``The country cannot continue making sacrifices and the advances
in the stability program cannot be interrupted.''
   If it suspends payments, the government would be able to use the
money it spends on debt service. But the savings could be exceeded
by a spree of dollar-buying by investors.
   Mexico has been considered an exemplary debtor. It's kept up with
service payments and, in addition to the anti-inflation program, the
government has begun restructuring the economy, weaning it from
dependence on state-owned companies, subsidies and protectionism.
   Salinas has complied on the political front, attacking the
corruption and drug trafficking so strongly criticized in the United
States. The Bush administration has responded as Mexico hoped, by
pressuring the banks to give Mexico more economic relief, sources
close to the talks say.

   Wildcat coal strikes around the nation
that have left some tempers flaring cooled over the weekend, and
police are hoping they stay that way.
   ``Everybody's pretty tired,'' said state police Sgt. C.R.
Smithers of the Beckley detachment, based in the heart of coal
country. ``We've all been working pretty hard to keep up with this.''
   The strikes, which enter their third week Monday, began in West
Virginia on June 12 as union miners walked off the job to express
sympathy with other United Mine Workers members striking Pittston
Coal Group Inc. As of Sunday, about 43,000 miners in nine states
remained off the job.
   In addition to West Virginia, wildcat strikes are being staged in
Illinois, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia
and Tennessee.
   About 350 strikers in Missouri announced they would return to
work Monday.
   On Sunday, officials at Citizens Gas and Coke Utility in
Indianapolis said they will respond to the strike by cutting coke
production by about one third, beginning Monday.
   Spokesman Steve Scott said Indianapolis-area foundaries will be
affected, but said the cutbacks will not affect the company's
220,000 residential gas customers.
   Scott said the cutbacks will extend the utility's reserves from
one month to about 50 days. Citizens Gas' primary coal supply comes
from West Virginia; other Indiana utlities have reported adequate
coal reserves.
   The UMW has offered no explanation for the wildcat walkouts,
which coal producers say violate the union's national contract, and
it doesn't officially recognize them. But miners who walked off the
job in Appalachia and the Midwest say they're striking in sympathy
with the Pittston strikers.
   That strike, which began April 5 in Virginia and West Virginia
and spread to Kentucky on June 19, has idled 1,900 workers. The UMW
struck Pittston when contract negotiations stalled over wage and
benefit disputes; the miners had worked for 14 months without a
contract.
   Several coal companies have gone to court in at least three
states in an effort to force the miners back to work. Lester Weist,
spokesman for UMW Local 5179 in Oakland City, Ind., said Sunday
those legal efforts could end up prolonging the strike in Indiana,
where all 1,750 union miners have been out since June 16.
   ``If there is anything they can do to strengthen the resolve of
the strikers, that's it,'' Weist said.
   Another UMW official in Indiana, however, said he hopes the
miners will be back on the job later this week.
   ``We've encouraged them to return to work daily, so we'll just
have to wait and see,'' said Roger Myers, an executive board member
for UMW District 11.
   Scattered incidents of violence have been reported during the
strikes. In Alabama and West Virginia, shootings were reported last
week, with a West Virginia teen-ager grazed by a bullet. However,
police reported relative calm throughout the coal fields this
weekend.
   Smithers said authorities have been trying to prevent incidents
such as the one in which Jamie Blankenship, 19, suffered a minor
head wound Thursday at a non-union mine in the southern West
Virginia coal fields. Authorities say they don't know who fired the
shot.
   But the trooper said it's hard to prevent such violence in a
region where strikes often have turned bloody.
   ``It can certainly get a lot worse,'' Smithers said.
   The end of the walkouts apparently hinges on the outcome of the
UMW's negotiations with Pittston, and the company and the union
currently aren't at the bargaining table.
   Federal mediators were called in earlier, but the union dropped
out of those negotiations June 7, and Pittston later declared an
impasse and implemented its own contract.
   UMW President Richard Trumka this weekend blasted Pittston for
the failure in negotiations.
   ``The Pittston Coal Co., over a 17-month period, has been
absolutely intransigent,'' he said. ``They've rebuffed every offer.''
   Company officials have called the union's demands unrealistic.
