   Walter Dunfey, co-founder and former director of
Dunfey Hotels, died Sunday at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was
57.
   Dunfey, a Rye, N.H., resident, died about 4 p.m. from
complications related to an aneurysm he suffered Aug. 3.
   Dunfey helped build Dunfey Hotels business into an international
corporation, which was later sold and is now known as Omni Hotels.
In December 1987, he and four of his brothers formed the Dunfey
Brothers Capital Group, a venture capital and investment company.
   Dunfey also was involved heavily in Democratic politics, both at
the state and national levels. He was a member of the Democratic
National Committee's Business Council, as well as its Convention
Site Selection Committee.
   In 1960, then-Sen. John Kennedy began his presidential campaign
from Dunfey's office in the Carpenter Hotel in Manchester, N.H.

   Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle
far out in the Atlantic whipped up huge waves this weekend, sweeping
beachgoers out to sea and capsizing boats from Maine to New York.
   At least six people were reported missing and three people
apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the sea
swells, undertow and waves that have reached 15 feet in height, even
on rivers.
   Though hundreds of miles from land, the spinning arms of
Gabrielle were still sending waves banging against the seaboard.
   Late Sunday, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 mph and it was
downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 miles
south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane
Center in Florida said.
   ``People shouldn't be out there,'' said Jarred Randall, a
Narragansett, R.I., police sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from
the water Saturday night. ``It's just so majestic and inviting, but
it isn't safe.''
   Gabrielle has been churning out in the Atlantic since Aug. 31.
Its vastness and power has prompted comparisons with last year's
Hurricane Gilbert, which became the ``storm of century'' and
devastated Jamaica.
   ``The occasional rogue wave can come along, higher than the
others. It's kind of neat to look at the surf and people don't
realize there is personal danger when you're looking at 15-foot
waves,'' said Coast Guard Quartermaster 1st Class David Jersey in
Boston.
   Jeff Waldstreicher, a meteorologist at the National Weather
Service office in Boston, said that the waves and undertow were
fierce up and down the coast.
   ``You have these strong, 100-plus mile an hour winds that
generate all these waves and long after the waves have crested you
have all this energy, moving the water from east to west,''
Waldstreicher said.
   In the meantime, the wild water was causing havoc.
   Dorothy Daggett, 19, of Cushing, Maine, apparently slipped and
fell into the surf while walking Saturday night along the rocky
shore in the mid-coastal fishing village of Tenants Harbor with her
brother and cousin, said Quartermaster 1st Class Robert Ream in
Southwest Harbor, Maine.
   The two men went into the water after her and were also quickly
swept away from the shore. They were picked up by a fishing boat.
   The Coast Guard searched for Ms. Daggett but she was still
missing Sunday.
   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in trouble
off the coast of New Hampshire on Sunday. At the time, the chopper
was on its way to Salisbury Beach in Massachusetts to search for a
middle-aged swimmer reported missing by a lobsterman who said he saw
the man disappear into the water, Jersey said. No one was found,
Jersey said.
   And north of Boston, an Ipswich police patrol boat searched for a
25-year-old man who vanished in the rough waters of the Ipswich
River north of Cape Ann.
   Richard Troudt was with two other men and a baby sailing in an
18-foot motor boat Saturday when the vessel capsized, the Coast
Guard said. The other two men and the child were rescued by a
passing vessel.
   In New York, divers searched the Atlantic for a 37-year-old man
missing after a houseboat capsized two miles out from the Breezy
Point section of the New York City borough of Queens.
   A 58-year-old woman apparently drowned when the houseboat
capsized about 2 a.m. Sunday. Her body was recovered.
   Two fishermen in their 30s were swept off a New York City jetty
Saturday afternoon by a large wave. Searchers could not find the men.
   In New Jersey, a man in his mid-50s died after being pulled
unconscious from heavy surf Sunday morning at Barnegat Light, said
Long Beach Township Patrolman Joseph Paolino. A woman of about the
same age who was pulled out with him was revived and was under
intensive care at a hospital.
   A man drowned at Normandy Beach, but no other details were
available, Dover Township police said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was located near latitude 39.0
north, longitude 62.0 west, or about 350 miles south-southwest of
Sable Island, Nova Scotia.
   Gabrielle is the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season. Systems become named tropical storms when their winds hit 39
mph and are termed hurricanes at 74 mph.

<HEAD>Report Says Proposed Funding Cut Could Leave Reactor's Future in
Doubt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department wants to curtail
development of a nuclear reactor to power weapons for a space-based
missile shield or for manned bases on the moon, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times in its Monday editions quoted federal
officials as saying that the department wants to stop spending on
the reactor because of rising budget pressure and opposition from
private groups and Congress.
   The Energy Department now provides most of the funding for the
4.2-ton reactor, known as the SP-100, which is meant to generate 100
kilowatts of electricity and to fit in the space shuttle, the
newspaper said.
   One Pentagon official told the Times the proposed cut would leave
the reactor program ``severely crippled.''
   But other officials who were not identified by the newspaper said
the proposed cut could be a ploy to get other federal agencies to
increase their financial support.
   This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the Energy Department is
paying $56 million to support the reactor's development while the
space agency is paying $10 million and the Pentagon another $10
million.
   The SP-100 program began in 1983. A government audit last year
found the program seriously flawed and in danger of failing.
   On the moon, the reactor could be used to power a manned base
through the lunar night. In space, it could be used to power
anti-missile arms in orbit around the earth.
   It has drawn criticism from Congress for its potential military
uses.
   Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., recently introduced
legislation calling for an international ban on putting reactors in
orbit and for limiting their use to deep space missions.

<TEXT>
   To some parents, ``choice'' means deciding not
only which school their child will attend but also at what age to
start them.
   Take Tracy Hill.
   By the time daughter Jessica was ready to turn 6, Mrs. Hill had
twice tinkered with Jessica's birth date to meet enrollment cutoff
dates, and the entire family was confused about when to hold her
birthday party. Mrs. Hill knows she broke the law and asked that her
real name not be used.
   ``We celebrated Jessica's third and fourth birthdays on Sept.
8,'' Mrs. Hill said with a chuckle. Jessica's real birthday is Oct.
8.
   Her mother explained that she had wanted her daughter, when she
was 2{, to attend a private, bilingual preschool with her playmates.
But the program required that children be 3 years old by Sept. 15 to
be admitted.
   This year, Mrs. Hill faced another problem.
   She wanted to enroll Jessica in a neighborhood public school
kindergarten. But the District of Columbia school system says any
child who turns 6 by Dec. 31 must be placed in first grade the
preceeding September or be labeled as a slow learner.
   ``When I saw what the first-graders were doing, I didn't want to
see a girl who has always loved school be put in a negative
environment'' where she would be forced into reading, math and other
competitive academic work before she was ready, her mother said.
   So Mrs. Hill restored Jessica's real birth date and entered her
in the kindergarten of a private, $6,000-a-year school.
   ``Schools are more concerned about statistics,'' exclaimed Willa
Hennigan, another frustrated mother who tried to enroll her son in a
public pre-kindergarten program in the District when he was 5 but
was told he must enter kindergarten or the school's computer would
``list him as an at-risk child.''
   ``I think each parent ought to determine what's best for her
child,'' said Mrs. Hennigan, who teaches a fifth-grade class for
gifted and talented students in suburban Virginia.
   At least where public schools are concerned, the age at which a
child begins his education is becoming as controversial as
``parental choice'' _ a centerpiece of President Bush's education
initiatives that would let parents decide which public school their
child would attend.
   Some educators are convinced that youngsters will be more
successful in school if they are 5 starting kindergarten. Others
scoff at the notion of arbitrary age limits and favor flexible
curricula for various maturity levels.
   ``We agree there is a problem in that young children are not
succeeding in kindergarten and first grade as they should, but the
problem is with the curriculum and the strategy in the way children
are asked to learn what is inappropriate with their age group,''
said Barbara Willer of the National Association for the Education of
Young Children.
   Susan Dranitzke, an educational consultant who advises parents on
their children's school readiness, said, ``Kindergarten is more like
first grade used to be. At this point, the way public kindergartens
are, it's probably better to have them older.''
   To be eligible for public school kindergartens, 23 states now
require children to be 5 years old by Sept. 2. Ten years ago, most
states allowed youngsters to begin kindergarten if their fifth
birthday would fall as late as November, December or January.
   Complicating the situation for parents in five states are laws
requiring that their children attend kindergarten. Those states are
Arkansas, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina and West Virginia.
   The District of Columbia, and the adjacent Maryland counties of
Prince Georges and Montgomery, have held to the Dec. 31 kindergarten
eligibility date. In Virginia, the cutoff has been moved to Sept.
30, but children with later birthdays can be tested to determine if
they are emotionally, physically and intellectually ready for
kindergarten.
   David Elkind, professor of child study at Tufts University in
Medford, Mass., and the author of ``The Hurried Child,'' said
raising the entry age of children is merely ``a policy solution to a
people problem and policy solutions to people problems never work.
The need is for flexible programs in kindergarten and first grades.''
   ``Raising the age is not going to do anything, except raise the
curriculum,'' he explained. ``We need to recognize what children are
like at that stage and then match the curriculum to the child.''
   Indiana's new school entry age law kicks in this year with a
September cutoff date that moves up to June 1 by the 1992-93 school
year.
   ``We are not letting our kids grow up. We are pushing them and I
don't know why,'' said Rep. Esther Wilson, a third-grade teacher and
state legislator who wrote and pushed through Indiana's law after
nearly six years of work.
   ``With this bill, I predict the dropout rate is going to be down
because the majority of our boys and girls will be socially and
emotionally ready for school,'' said Wilson.
   Tom Schultz, project director for early childhood education at
the National Associaton of State Boards of Education, said raising
the entry age results in ``a problem of equity in terms of what the
experiences will be during that extra year out of school.''
   By merely raising the entry age, Schultz said, ``A group of kids
who would have gone to kindergarten will sit in a preschool, at home
or at day care another year. Parents vary in their ability to pay
for and provide stimulus.
   ``We need to help teachers find ways to deal with student
diversity,'' he said.
   One solution, Schultz said, would be to allow children to enter
school the month they become 5. The problem with that, he added, is
that ``it would be difficult for teachers to adjust to new kids
continually arriving.''
   Another idea is ``cooperative learning,'' which places a child in
a group of youngsters with abilities similar to his own. Assignments
are given to the groups so that youngsters can teach each other as
they work together.
   Susan Sweitzer of the Gesell Institute, a private educational
organization in New Haven, Conn., said 15-18 percent of more than
16,000 school districts around the nation use Gesell's procedures to
assess young children's readiness to learn.
   When these procedures are properly used, she said, school systems
can determine which approach is suited to the needs of a particular
child, either the traditional ``lock-step'' grade system or
alternative programs that insert a transitional year for children to
mature before or after first grade.
   ``I used to feel pretty strongly that the cutoff date should be
Sept. 1 or Aug. 31 but I have really grown to an opinion of
encouraging districts to create options from which parents can
choose, so it doesn't really matter when the cutoff date is,'' Ms.
Sweitzer said.
   Regardless of when a child is enrolled in kindergarten, all
states require that, by a certain age, children must be in first
grade. In no state, however, is that ``required'' date set so early
that parents do not have the freedom to delay their youngster's
entry into kindergarten, said Ms. Weller of the National Association
for the Education of Young Children.

<TEXT>
   Former House Speaker Jim Wright is
backing Pete Geren, but a TV doctor is counting on heavyweight
endorsements of his own to put a Republican congressman in the seat
Wright occupied 34 years.
   With little campaign time and few policy differences to
distinguish themselves, Democrat Geren and political newcomer Dr.
Bob Lanier are touting endorsements and their backgrounds to sway
voters in Tuesday's runoff election.
   Just getting the vote out is a challenge. Only a fifth of the
district's voters went to the polls in Aug. 12's special election to
fill Wright's unexpired term.
   Wright resigned June 30 after a House ethics investigation turned
up 69 instances of alleged rules violations.
   Still, he was greeted as a vanquished hero upon his return to
Fort Worth and remains popular in the district.
   Geren, 37, has started using radio spots by Wright and has
brought the former congressman with him on campaign appearances.
Geren, a former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, also has that Texas
Democrat's endorsement.
   ``Jim Wright is proud of his years of service to this community,
but he recognizes that his seat is going to someone new, and he's
been very careful not to interject himself in any way that would
suggest that he's trying to control things,'' Geren said.
   Lanier, host of the nationally syndicated television show ``60
Second Housecall,'' is relieved Wright hasn't done more for Geren.
   ``We initially feared it quite a bit. We thought it would make a
major difference,'' said Lanier, a pediatric allergist. ``But it
hasn't been quite as much as we anticipated.''
   The 44-year-old Lanier has some of his own big guns: endorsements
from President Bush and former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry.
   The candidates have similar stands on major issues.
   Both oppose abortion but would not make it illegal, want better
health care funding for the elderly and support strong measures
against illegal drugs.
   Lanier has tried to make residency an issue, claiming Geren
doesn't live in the district. He accuses the lawyer, who comes from
a wealthy family, of being out of touch with voters.
   Geren counters that Lanier hasn't voted in recent elections and
lacks experience in public office.
   Lanier garnered 39 percent of the vote and Geren 32 percent in
the special election that trimmed the field from eight candidates.
   Lanier said he is ``swimming upstream'' as the Republican
candidate, but believes Fort Worth might be ready for change. Since
1980, voters here have helped elect Ronald Reagan, Bush and GOP Sen.
Phil Gramm. Texas is represented by nine Republicans and 20
Democrats in Congress.
   Democrats are hoping for a voter backlash against the Republicans
for what happened to Wright.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram recently endorsed Geren, as have
state educators, senior citizens and labor officials.
   The local police association has endorsed Lanier.
   The election is one of two being held Tuesday to choose
successors to congressmen who resigned amid ethics problems. In
California, voters will decide among eight candidates for the seat
of former Democratic House Whip Tony Coelho, who resigned in
mid-June as questions were raised about his financial dealings.

<TEXT>
   The people who run the Miss America
Pageant are faced with a dilemma: proving Miss America has brains
and maintaining a television audience.
   ``The pageant has to continue to be an entertainment vehicle,''
said director Leonard Horn. ``If it turned into a two-hour
documentary, nobody would tune in.''
   The 69-year-old pageant, which airs nationally on NBC-TV
Saturday, will still capture loyal audiences with dazzling evening
gowns, the 10 finalists' talent performances and the ever-popular _
albeit ever-controversial _ swimsuit competition.
   But since he took over the pageant last year, Horn has aimed to
show off the intelligence of the beauty queens. Last year, he showed
clips of contestants' interviews with the judges, and the 10
finalists were asked thought-provoking questions on live television.
   This year, Horn has gone one step further. Each of the 51
contestants has submitted an essay outlining what issues she might
want to take a stand on during her year as Miss America 1990. The
winner will have the opportunity to use her reign as a soap box to
promote her cause, he said.
   ``Many of the essays deal with the environment, health issues,
child abuse, poverty _ all the issues we read about every day,''
Horn said. ``I was impressed with their seriousness and concern.''
   The judging process also has been revised to give more credit to
the contestants' interviews with a preliminary panel of judges.
   Interviews will count for 30 percent of the final night's
competition. Talent will weigh 40 percent, and evening gown and
swimsuit each will count for 15 percent. Swimsuits have never
counted for so little.
   Less emphasis on body and more on brains represents a far cry
from the ``bathing beauty'' pageant started by Atlantic City
businessmen. It was originally held the weekend after Labor Day as a
public relations gimmick to prolong the summer season.
   ``We're trying to close the gap between what some people perceive
this program to be and the reality we know it is,'' Horn said.
   He said that the ambitions of many contestants speak for
themselves.
   For instance, five contestants aspire to be attorneys; others
want to be a doctor, a medical researcher and a pharmacist. More
than a dozen see their future on stage.
   Miss America 1989, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson, is a Stanford
University student who plays classical violin and hopes to attend
law school.
   This year's celebrity judges include developer Donald Trump,
entertainer Merv Griffin, TV psychologist Joyce Brothers, actresses
Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen, baseball great Mike Schmidt and
journalist Claudia Cohen.
   Co-hosts are Gary Collins and Miss America 1971 Phyllis George.
   The new Miss America will receive a $35,000 scholarship and fees
from personal appearances. More than $5 million in cash and tuition
is available through the Miss America program to the thousands of
young women who enter local contests each year.
   The theme of this year's national pageant is ``A Moment in Time''
and will feature performer Clint Holmes. The two-hour program starts
at 10 p.m. EDT on Saturday.

<HEAD>Desert Tortoise Threatens Virtual Halt to Las Vegas Development</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-rolling developers betting on a housing
construction boom in the Las Vegas Valley have been stopped in their
tracks by the designation of a turtle as an endangered species.
   The federal listing of the desert tortoise _ Nevada's official
state reptile _ prohibits disruption of the animal's habitat. That
has already blocked off-road races, and threatens cattle grazing on
some federal land and some military activity.
   ``The potential impact on Las Vegas could be horrendous,'' said
Paul Selzer, a Palm Springs, Calif., lawyer hired by local officials
to draw up and sell the federal government on a plan to save the
tortoises while allowing development. ``It's now a crime to move the
tortoises from your building site and it's a crime to hurt them in
any way.''
   Selzer set up a refuge for an endangered lizard in the Coachella
Valley near Palm Springs that has become a model for settling
conflicts over endangered species.
   The Aug. 4 listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was
brought about by biologists' concerns that a respiratory disease is
killing off thousands of the burrowing tortoises, which live up to
80 years. The emergency designation means all the protections of the
Endangered Species Act immediately went into effect for eight
months, pending further decisions.
   It affects desert areas in Nevada, California and Utah.
   But only in Las Vegas _ where a recent study estimated that
73,000 new residences will be needed in the next four years just to
house new workers for the casino industry _ is the impact so severe
and so immediate. An estimated 3,000 people move into the area every
month.
   ``If you have ungraded land that has tortoises on it, it
basically stops you dead,'' said Jim Ley, a Clark County
administrator. ``There won't be any impact for six to nine months
because of the projects already under construction. But after that,
you'll see a definite lull.''
   Most casino construction will be unaffected, because it is done
mostly on previously developed or already graded property, but
outlying housing projects, shopping centers, golf courses and other
developments will be put on hold.
   Affected most is Summa Corp., empire of the late Howard Hughes,
which is developing 25,000 acres west of town into a community to
house 250,000 people.
   Summa already has spent $60 million putting in a freeway
interchange, a four-lane highway and utilities, and had planned to
offer housing tracts to developers later this year.
   But only about 350 acres have been graded and the rest of the
tract will be in limbo pending resolution of the tortoise problem.
   ``I really don't have any reason to be optimistic about it
because of the bureaucratic process involved,'' said Summa president
John Goolsby.
   Summa joined several other homebuilders, the city of Las Vegas
and Clark County in filing suit last month in federal court in
Washington claiming there is little evidence of the tortoise
respiratory disease in southern Nevada and that the regulation
should be confined to areas affected by the ailment.
   A federal judge refused to act. His decision will be appealed but
local officials and developers say they are resigned to the
endangered species designation.
   ``They're fighting the method of the listing so they can win some
time on this thing,'' Ley said.
   Developers are not the only ones affected.
   The huge Nellis Air Force Base bombing range and the Nevada Test
Site _ where nuclear weapons are tested _ are also inside the
designated area. Although federal law allows exemptions in cases of
national security, some operations could be affected.
   Two weekend off-road races in the Mojave desert in California
were canceled by the Bureau of Land Management, and ranchers face
revocation of grazing rights on bureau land that is tortoise habitat.
   City and county officials have drawn up ordinances to charge
developers a $250-an-acre ``tortoise fee'' that will bring in up to
$1 million a year to preserve tortoise habitat.
   But Selzer said even if the Fish and Wildlife Service buys that
plan, it will be at least a year before any new development on
tortoise land is allowed.
   ``We've got to do an environmental impact report and we've got to
get cooperation from everybody,'' he said. ``All of that takes
time.''

   Voters on Saturday handed Gov. Gaston
Caperton an overwhelming defeat on three constitutional amendments
he said were necessary to complete his reorganization of state
government.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, only one of the amendments
garnered as much as 19 percent support.
   One of the amendments would have eliminated three statewide
elected offices _ secretary of state, treasurer and agriculture
commissioner _ and placed their duties under the governor's control.
   ``The people of West Virginia have scored a great victory at the
polls today,'' said Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an opponent of
the amendments.
   The second amendment would have given the governor greater
authority over the state primary and secondary education system. The
third would have given cities and counties the ability to merge or
choose new forms of government.
   Caperton, who took office in January, said the voters rejected
the proposals because the administration failed to fully explain
them.
   ``I believe the defeat of these amendments was due in part to the
inability to get our true message about these complex and
complicated amendments across,'' he said in a statement.
   Caperton had said the elimination of the three offices would save
the state about $3 million annually.
   Thirty percent of the 828,000 registered voters participated in
the election. Clear weather with temperatures in the 80s and college
football games apparently proved too attractive to the bulk of the
state's voters.
   The constitutional officers amendment was defeated 217,582, or 89
percent, to 28,095, or 11 percent. The education amendment was
beaten 217,727, or 88 percent, to 29,670, or 12 percent. The
city-county amendment was rejected 199,507, or 81 percent, to
46,573, or 19 percent.
   ``Folks have not been fooled,'' said Agriculture Coimissioner
Cleve Benedict. ``The voters have seen through the high-powered
media and see they like to run state government themselves and I
think that's the way it ought to be.''
   In addition to Hechler, Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict
also opposed the measure. The third officeholder whose job would
have been eliminated, Treasurer Thomas Loehr, supported Caperton's
plan.
   Meeting in special session earlier this year, the Legislature
gave Caperton the most extraordinary powers since the state was
created in 1863 to reorganize 150 executive offices under seven
Cabinet secretaries.
   Lawmakers also heeded his call for the three constitutional
amendments, which he said was needed to complete that reorganization.
   Opponents said the vote was a referendum on the administration,
which also had the Legislature adopt the largest tax increase in
state history.
   In a debate last Thursday, Loehr predicted defeat for the
amendments.
   ``I think they're all in trouble,'' said Loehr, who was appointed
by Caperton in July. ``People are fed up with government and that's
a shame. This was a good opportunity to restructure our state
government in a very positive way.''
   Several state legislators have been indicted or resigned in
recent months, and the former treasurer and attorney general
resigned recently.
   Respondents to a telephone survey conducted in August indicated
residents would approve the amendment to allow the city-county
government merger, while saying they probably won't change the way
education is administered in the state nor would they abolish the
elected offices.

<HEAD>Nobel Laureate Fitted With Pacemaker, But May Have Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALCUTTA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors implanted a pacemaker in Mother
Teresa to steady her heartbeat, but they feared she might be
developing pneumonia, a hospital source said Sunday.
   Doctors at Woodlands Nursing Home gave the 79-year-old Roman
Catholic nun a temporary pacemaker Saturday night after her
heartbeak became irregular, said the hospital source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   While the pacemaker corrected her heart problem, he said, Mother
Teresa had a high fever and was not responding to antibiotics.
   ``The fever is causing the doctors more concern right now than
her heart. Her fever is very high and she has not been responding
adequately to antibiotics. They think she might have pneumonia,''
the source said.
   He said the frail, soft-spoken nun was conscious but heavily
sedated.
   Meanwhile, Dr. Vincenzo Bilotta, Mother Teresa's longtime
cardiologist in Rome, said he was preparing to travel to Calcutta.
   ``I'm going to comfort her and also, if I can, to do something,
though I am sure that my colleagues in Calcutta are doing everything
they possibly can,'' Bilotta said in a telephone interview.
   He said he had asked the Italian Foreign Ministry for help in
expediting preparations for the trip but was unsure exactly when he
would leave for India.
   Mother Teresa, whose devotion to the destitute and dying earned
her the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, became ill Sept. 3. She was admitted
to the hospital's intensive care unit Tuesday with a high fever and
irregular heartbeat. She suffered a heart attack Friday.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa received several honors for her
work with the poor in this eastern Indian city, including the Nobel
and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. Civilian
award that was bestowed on her in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan.
   Bilotti said Mother Teresa had similar ailments in the past, due
in part to her refusal to rest.
   Mother Teresa, who gave up a comfortable life as a convent
teacher to live and work among Calcutta's poor, founded the
Missionaries of Charity in an abandoned run-down hostel donated by
city officials. The order, recognized by the Vatican in 1965, now
has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.
   Despite heart problems and failing eyesight in recent years, she
traveled widely and vigorously spoke out against abortion.
   ``Mother being the person she is has never wanted to stop and
not, unfortunately, she is ill,'' Bilotti said.

   Four Idaho National Guard crew members were
reported missing Saturday after their helicopter failed to return
from a routine training flight.
   The crew left Gowen Field, adjacent to Boise Municipal Airport,
at about 5 p.m. Saturday and were due to return by 6:30 p.m., said
1st Lt. Michael Gollaher, Gowen Field deputy public affairs officer.
   Four aircraft searched for the missing crew and helicopter
Saturday night before the search was called off at midnight.
Gollaher said the search would resume early today.
   The pilot and crew were considered experienced, and are assigned
to the 183rd Aviation Attack Helicopter Battalion. The missing
helicopter is a UH-1H ``Huey,'' a Vietnam-era aircraft about 20
years old.
   Gollaher said there is no history of unusual mechanical problems
with the missing aircraft. The names of the crew members were not
released.

   A Scandinavian Airlines System plane
returning from Greece lost part of its tail while landing at
Stockholm's international airport, but no one was hurt, an SAS
spokesman said Sunday.
   The MD-82, a modernized DC-9, was arriving at Arlanda airport
from Athens with 156 passengers aboard when the incident occurred
Saturday night.
   Spokesman Knut Lovstuhagen said in an interview that the plane
lost its tail cone, which plays a minor role in the plane's
aerodynamics and which is released during emergency evacuations.
   The cause of the mishap was being investigated.
   Lovstuhagen said the passengers, mostly Swedish tourists,
probably did not even notice the loss of the cone, since it is
placed outside the pressurized cabin and does not affect
maneuverability.

   The government removed 2,500 Vietnamese boat
people from an outlying island Sunday after a riot and an outbreak
of cholera and moved them to an island that once served as a leper
colony, officials reported.
   Five boats were used to move the boat people from Tai A Chau
island to nearby Heiling Chau island. Another 2,000 Vietnamese
living in tents on Tai A Chau will be evacuated to Heiling Chau on
Monday, the officials said.
   Late last month, a dispute over the distribution of rice touched
off a riot on Tai A Chau during which 1,000 Vietnamese hurled stones
at police, who fired tear gas to quell the disturbance.
   Shortly after the violence, police detected the first case of
cholera on the island. The disease has so far stricken 21
Vietnamese, officials said.
   Officials said Tai A Chau will be used as a detention center
again once it has been cleaned up and huts are built there. They
said Heiling Chau's former use as a leper colony presented no health
risk to the boat people.
   The government began to putting boat people on Tai A Chau in June
in an emergency measure to cope with increasing arrivals. Boat
people usually stay there two weeks before being innocuated and
moved to other detention centers, but the first three cholera
victims had stayed on the island for a month.

   The United States and Pakistan are
backing a guerrilla government-in-exile as the only alternative to
Communist rule in Afghanistan. But six months after it was formed,
the rebel Cabinet is feuding openly and has yet to move onto Afghan
soil.
   The guerrillas, many headquartered in the Pakistani frontier city
of Peshawar, predicted the Marxists wouldn't last more than a few
weeks after Soviet combat forces withdrew from Afghanistan in
February.
   But the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which
continues to recieve massive Soviet aid, has held its ground.
   The Communists are defending Kabul, the capital, and other key
Afghan cities. The insurgents, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy
warriors,'' still control much of the countryside.
   But to the dismay of their sponsors, some rebel groups have
engaged in bitter internal disputes.
   The Afghan Interim Government was formed Feb. 24 in Islamabad by
an alliance of seven mujahedeen groups based in Pakistan, the
temporary home of some 3 million Afghan refugees.
   Assuming the Communists' imminent defeat, the interim government
was meant as a transitional administration to oversee the
establishment of an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   The interim government pledged to move inside Afghanistan and
hold elections for a parliament within 6 months in ``liberated
areas'' and in refugee camps in Pakistan. The parliament was to
draft an Islamic constitution and vote on whether to replace the
interim government.
   None of that has happened.
   The rebels fought in March to the suburbs of Jalalabad,
Afghanistan's third-largest city just 40 miles from the Pakistan
border. But they stalled under withering artillery fire and aerial
bombardment.
   Then in July, the traditional enmity between two of the most
powerful rebel groups led to a massacre in northern Afghanistan.
   Guerrillas of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami group allegedly
ambushed and murdered 32 commanders of the more liberal
Jamiat-i-Islami party. There are unconfirmed reports of hundreds
more dead in subsequent clashes between the two groups.
   The United States expressed its disappointment. ``The recently
reported internecine fighting is discouraging, since resistance
unity and cooperation is of paramount importance,'' said Peter
Thomsen, the U.S. special envoy to the rebel government.
   Naim Majrooh, an Afghan intellectual living in Peshawar, said the
tension isn't based on ideology.
   ``It's a moral struggle among the ranks, a physical struggle
among the parties and an ego struggle among the (mujahedeen)
leaders,'' Majrooh said.
   Most observers believe the parties of the rebel government are
united only in their hatred of the Kabul government of President
Najib.
   Fundamentalist parties want to replace the Communists with a
strict Islamic order while others favor a more liberal regime. Some
want to fight for a total military victory, while others are
prepared to talk peace. Several parties are based primarily on
personal loyalties.
   The rebel government does not include the Iran-based alliance of
eight mujahedeen groups, called The Council of Islamic Coalition of
Afghanistan. The coalition is predominantly Shiite Moslem, while the
Pakistan-based rebels are mainly Sunnis.
   Shiites were estimated to make up about 17 percent of
Afghanistan's pre-war population of 15 million. The Pakistan-based
rebels claim the Shiites have demanded a disproportionately large
representation in the government.
   Thomsen said on a recent visit to Pakistan that the Iran-based
guerrillas remain ``essential'' if the rebel government is to
represent a broad sampling of Afghans.
   The fighting between the Hezb-i-Islami and Jamiat-i-Islami
parties has widened the rifts within the guerrilla government itself.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, the moderate president, has publicly
called the leader of the Hezb-i-Islami, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a
``killer'' who is ``destroying Afghanistan.''
   Hekmatyar, who serves as foreign minister, has suspended his role
in the government for its failure to hold elections.
   Pakistan is anxious to see an end to the war, which broke out
after the Communists seized power in Kabul in a 1978 military coup.
Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to replace one Communist
government with another, then sent in more than 100,000 Red Army
soldiers to help fight the insurgents.
   Moscow finally withdrew its troops between May 15, 1988, and Feb.
15, 1989, after managing only to fight the mujahedeen to a stalemate.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, in a recent interview
with The Associated Press, indicated she shares the U.S. view that
the rebel government, with all its problems, is still the only
alternative to what both countries view as an illegitimate
government in Kabul.
   ``It would make us much happier if accusations and
counter-accusations did not take place. But we feel that in the
given context, the Afghan Interim Government is the best framework
there is for a political settlement in the country,'' Ms. Bhutto
said.
   Mujahedeen leaders have attributed their recent military problems
to a lack of U.S.-supplied weapons and a change from guerrilla
tactics to conventional warfare.
   ``We haven't received any new weapons for eight months,'' said
Masoud Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islami group.
   Thomsen insists Washington still stands firmly behind the
mujahedeen despite the anti-American sentiments of some of the
fundamentalist Moslem rebel leaders, notably Hekmatyar.

   ``When Chernenko died, everybody said, `Oh my
God, what does this mean for world peace'?'' says Bill Strauss.
``But when I heard the news, I said, `Oh my God, what rhymes with
Gorbachev?''
   Strauss was worried because he is director and chief lyricist for
the Capitol Steps, a singing troupe of Washington-bred political
satirists who have been lampooning public figures in song and verse
for nearly eight years.
   ``We pick up the paper every morning and look not at the
importance of major world events but whether they're funny and
whether any of them rhyme,'' says Elaina Newport, the group's
producer and co-lyricist.
   Strauss panicked at the challenge when Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev assumed power in March 1985. After all, his predecessors
were a rhymer's dream. ``Andropov was `bombs drop off.' Chernenko
rhymed with ``Commie pinko,'' he said.
   But Gorbachev?
   Strauss finally borrowed the tune from Jim Croce's ``Bad, Bad
Leroy Brown'' and introduced ``Gorby Gorbachev, the hottest Red
since Andropov ... the world's first yuppie Slav ... the coolest
dude since Ustinov.''
   It all started as a lark in 1981, when six members of the staff
of Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., put together some impromptu musical
entertainment for an office Christmas party.
   Since then, the cast of the Capitol Steps has expanded to 15
members, including understudies, and all are current or former
congressional aides. They have given close to 1,000 performances,
written about 350 songs and produced eight albums and tapes.
   One of their latest recordings includes such Bush-era hits as
``Stand By Your Dan,'' ``Thank God I'm a Contra Boy'' and ``Fifty
Ways to Hide New Taxes.''
   Their humor knows know partisan bounds. They don't care whether
the toes they step on belong to Democrats or Republicans. The only
difference, says Strauss, is that ``Republicans don't know when to
laugh and Democrats don't know when to stop.''
   At first, the Capitol Steps performed free. Now they play an
average of 25 engagements around the country each month, charging
$5,000 to $11,000 per show. They've entertained at White House and
Capitol Hill parties and on several network television shows, and
are weekend regulars at Chelsea's, a trendy Georgetown restaurant.
   Last Wednesday night, they taped their first TV special at
Anton's nightclub in downtown Washington before a celebrity audience
that included outgoing Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and members
of Congress. Koop faced the cameras and warned that the show ``could
be extraordinarily dangerous to your health: The Capitol Steps will
split your sides.''
   The TV special was produced by WETA, the Washington public
television station, for local broadcast starting Sept. 13 and
subsequent airing by other public TV stations.
   The Capitol Steps group is a favorite of President Bush, who
invited them to perform at three of his Christmas parties as vice
president. He also joined in good-naturedly when the Steppers sang
``Try to Remember'' at Bush's Pearl Harbor Day party last December.
   The song, recalling Bush's campaign goof over the date of the
Japanese bombing, began: ``Try to remember that date in September,
the day Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. ...''
   The only three founding members remaining in the Capitol Steps
recalled Bush's performance.
   ``He sang it by himself, and I use the word `sang' loosely,''
said Ms. Newport, a former legislative assistant to Percy and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   ``He sings kinda gentler,'' said Strauss, former staff director
of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee. ``A thousand points
of notes,'' said Jim Aidala, a pesticides expert at the
Congressional Research Service.
   Barbara Bush ``wagged her finger at us but laughed and sang
along'' when the Steppers performed a satirized version of ``Silver
Bells'' at the Bush family's last Christmas party in the vice
presidential mansion, Ms. Newport said. It went this way:
   ``Silver hair!
   ``Silver hair!
   ``Barbara will shine in the White House
   ``Hair so white
   ``It glows at night
   ``Helping to light George's way.''
   After Gary Hart's womanizing ruined his political career, Strauss
said, the Democrats seem to have gotten somewhat dull. The funniest
thing the Steppers could find to celebrate former House Speaker Jim
Wright in song was:
   ``You could have bagged a bimbo like Jessica Hahn
   ``But, no, you got in trouble AND you kept your trousers on!''
   Strauss said the Steps were ``terrified'' that Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis would win election as a ``coolly competent
president.'' For a while, they promoted a ``Duke and Fluke'' ticket
of Dukakis and Dan Quayle.
   They sighed with happy relief when Quayle, their richest source
of comedy material, was elected vice president.
   ``I'd like to see a tremendous number of overseas trips being
given to Quayle, and lots of speeches,'' said Strauss. ``I hope he
just keeps being himself.''

<TEXT>
   Discontent over the economy and the
environment has caused many Norwegians to shift party loyalties,
signaling danger for socialist Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
in Monday's national elections.
   ``There is tremendous migration of voters from party to party,
the likes of which we have never seen in Norway,'' said Per Arne
Hestetun of the polling company Norsk Gallup A-S.
   In an August poll of 7,038 people by Gallup, voters listed as
their main concerns the pollution of Norway's unique fjords, a
record unemployment rate of 5 percent, and care for the aged.
   Many voters feel the prime minister, of the socialist Labor
Party, has not worked hard enough to clean up Norway's environment.
They also say they have yet to feel the benefits of her economic
austerity program.
   Ironically, Mrs. Brundtland is known abroad as a champion of
conservation. She is chairman of the U.N. World Commission on
Environment and Development, and foreign economists have praised her
for turning around an economy sinking deeply into debt.
   About 3.2 million Norwegians in this Scandinavian nation of 4.2
million are eligible to vote Monday for the 165-seat parliament or
Storting, which has been expanded from 157 seats.
   The elections come after a weekend suspension of campaigning to
mourn 55 people, mostly Norwegians, who died Friday in a plane crash
off Denmark.
   Analysts predict no clear majority will emerge in Monday's
voting. A large block of undecided voters, up to 20 percent, could
swing the outcome.
   A poll published Saturday in Oslo's Aftenposten newspaper
predicted that Mrs. Brundtland's Labor Party will sink from 40.5
percent of the vote in the 1985 election to 33.7 percent. Her party
has governed with a parliamentary minority of 71 seats and
issue-by-issue support from other smaller parties.
   The poll also said the Conservatives, the leading opposition
party, will drop from the 30.4 percent of the vote they garnered in
1985 to 20 percent. It gave the right-wing Party of Progress 16
percent and the rest of the votes to a variety of small parties.
   Based on the poll, Aftenposten predicted 86 non-socialist seats
and 79 socialist seats in the new parliament.
   The telephone poll of 1,215 voters was conducted Sept. 4-7 by the
Bergen survey institute Opinion A-S for Aftenposten. The margin of
error was 2.2 to 2.8 percent.
   Pollster Hestetun said he believed `Mrs. Brundtland will resign,
maybe not on the eve of the election but shortly afterwards and that
a non-socialist coalition will take over.''
   Mrs. Brundtland appeared to be recovering some lost support
Sunday, analysts said. Her non-socialist opponents retained an
apparent majority, they said, but it was possible deep rifts would
prevent them from forming a working alliance.
   Mrs. Brundtland, 50, a doctor and U.S-trained specialist in
public health, became prime minister of a minority government for
the second time when a Conservative-led coalition resigned in 1986.
   She has said a poor showing in Monday's vote will not
automatically force her to step down, since an alternative to a
Labor government remains unclear.
   Conservative Party leader Jan P. Syse, 58, is the most likely
alternative to Mrs. Brundtland. His party is allied with three
smaller non-socialist parties.
   Syse has said Labor is ducking responsibility by blaming his
party, and that ``socialism is bankrupt.'' But his party and its
allies have failed to find reach final accord on a candidate for
prime minister or a common platform.
   Christian Democratic chairman Kjell Magne Bondevik, a junior
member of the non-socialist alliance, has put himself forward as a
compromise choice with some public support.
   The wild card in Monday's election is Carl I. Hagen of the
right-wing Party of Progress, who is challenging the underpinnings
of the welfare state by urging sharp tax cuts and privatization of
state-owned industries and services.
   Hagen has been shunned by the other parties for a decade.
Distaste for him could unify the other non-socialist parties enough
to overcome their differences and exclude him from government,
analysts said.
   Mrs. Brundtland has been accused of ignoring the goals of a
government commission that drafted a 1987 environmental plan called
``Our Common Future.'' She has rejected the criticism as unfair
politicking by her rivals.
   The international Organization of Economic Development and
Cooperation has credited Mrs. Brundtland for the austerity diet she
imposed on the economy, which had grown fat on North Sea oil wealth
and then crashed with a price collapse in 1986.
   Despite her political leanings, Mrs. Brundtland imposed wage
restrictions and other fiscal restraint that halved inflation in two
years to under 5 percent and turned the foreign debt into a surplus.
   However, unemployment and bankruptcies have hit record levels,
giving a hollow ring to Labor's motto of ``Employment for All.''

<HEAD>Spokesman: Nixon Planning Trip to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon is
making plans to visit China alone and meet with its leaders despite
his earlier cancellation of a group trip, said his spokesman.
   Political unrest forced him to put off his visit this fall with
six friends, among them William E. Simon, former treasury secretary
in Nixon's administration, spokesman John Taylor said last week.
   Simon heads an investor group that owns several banks in Hawaii
and is interested in acquiring a stake in a Chinese bank, said Roy
Doumani, Simon's partner. Taylor stressed in an interview from his
office in Woodcliff Lake that Nixon had no business relationship
with Simon.
   Taylor said Nixon had been invited by China's government, and
that the State Department knew about the former president's plans.
No date has been set for the trip.
   Nixon, who lives in Upper Saddle River, has visited the People's
Republic of China five times. His first visit, in 1972, was the
first by a U.S. president and opened the door to normal diplomatic
relations.
   The following year, China and the United States opened diplomatic
offices on each other's soil after a break during the Vietnam War.
   Nixon's representatives and Chinese officials are arranging the
details of a sixth visit, though Taylor did not rule out a future
group trip.
   ``The purpose of the solo trip would be to have extensive
discussions with the top leaders of China,'' Taylor said, noting
that the former president has done the same on every trip to China.
   ``He's not doing it at the behest'' of U.S. officials, said the
spokesman. ``He is of course in touch with the U.S. government about
his plans, and they have communicated to him their views on his
plans.''
   Taylor refused to discuss why Nixon was going to speak to China's
leaders.
   ``These things are matters of very sensitive discussions,'' he
said. ``I really don't see the value of acquainting The Associated
Press with all the details.''
   If Nixon does go on his solo trip, he will be accompanied only by
a lone bodyguard. He gave up Secret Service protection in 1985.

<HEAD>``Question is Whether Marijuana Should be Included In the War on
Drugs''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just across the street from the building where
drug war director William Bennett sits at his desk in a two-story
suite, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
carries on its own quest from a small, warren-like office.
   NORML, which opened its first storefront office in a run-down
section of Washington in 1970, is emerging as one of the most vocal
critics of President Bush's anti-drug campaign.
   ``The simple question is whether marijuana should be included in
the war on drugs,'' NORML's incoming national director, Donald
Fiedler, told reporters at a National Press Club press conference
following Bennett's outline of the Bush plan this past week.
   ``If it is,'' he said, ``the price of a drug-free America is an
America that can no longer be free.''
   NORML wants legalization of marijuana but supports continued
prohibition of cocaine. Although it has had its ups and downs,
Fiedler said he believes harsh attempts to penalize the nation's
millions of marijuana smokers eventually will bolster NORML's
diminished strength.
   ``When Bush went after the ACLU, it helped their membership, when
the recent Supreme Court decision on abortion came out, it helped
NOW, and we fully expect the Bennett drug war plan will help
NORML,'' said Fiedler, a lawyer from Omaha, Neb.
   In its early days, NORML gained attention by defending youngsters
facing years in prison for lighting up. Its efforts helped spark
decriminalization moves in many state legislatures.
   As the marijuana laws changed, NORML's $25-a-year membership roll
shrank from a high of 20,000 people in 1978 to about 5,000 now.
   To support its annual budget of $250,000, the organization now
holds seminars for criminal defense lawyers. In an article published
in 1986, Washington Monthly said a third of NORML's budget came from
such conferences, which it claimed were ``geared toward helping
lawyers defend mid-level mobsters.'' Some members told the magazine
that the drug defense seminars had caused dissension within the
organization.
   Asked about the article, Doug McVay, activist coordinator for
NORML, said: ``The lawyers who are interested in this issue tend to
do drug defense work. Nowadays, however, if you are doing criminal
defense work in general, more and more of it is drug defense. It's
unfortunate, but it's the case.''
   From its initial location in a seedy area of Washington that has
since blossomed out in high-price hotels, NORML has moved to an
office building it shares with such tenants as the International
Joint Commission, a governmental body concerned with U.S.-Canadian
affairs, not with the kind of joints marijuana smokers talk about.
   The drug war office is on the top two floors of a building across
the street.
   ``They can peek in our windows and we can peek in theirs,'' said
Carole Moore, who, like a number of NORML activists, is also a
member of the Libertarian Party. Jim Turney of Richmond, Va., former
national chairman of the Libertarians, is treasurer of NORML.
   The Libertarians' contention that the government should interfere
as little as possible with individual rights meshes with NORML's
stance on marijuana, although the two organizations differ on some
other issues.
   Joining Fiedler at Wednesday's news conference were Gatewood
Galbraith of Lexington, Ky., and Jack Herer of Help Eliminate
Marijuana Prohibition, both advocates of hemp, the marijuana plant,
as a cash crop. Herer showed a 1942 Agriculture Department movie
extolling hemp's value to the war effort as a source of rope for
battleships and parachutes.
   They all wore jackets and ties and Galbraith puffed on a cigar as
he waited for the conference to start.
   In the audience were Ms. Moore, wearing an ``I Smoke Pot''
button, and Dana Deal, one of the originators of a New York-based
coalition of marijuana activists, wearing a psychedelic T-shirt with
the words, ``Boycott White Powder. Bring Back Herb.''
   Deal is part of NORML but said he would like the group to be more
activist.
   ``What it really is is some young lawyers and they feel more
comfortable dealing with other professionals,'' he said. ``They
don't like demonstrations because every time you have a
demonstration, somebody smokes pot. They don't want to advocate pot.
They want to advocate legalization. We advocate pot.''
   In an interview in his office, Fiedler said: ``At the smoke-ins,
some people do smoke pot, some demonstrate. NORML has spoken at
smoke-ins, but to my knowledge NORML has never sponsored a smoke-in.
We will come and speak at them, but as to sponsoring them, no.''
   The incoming director said he thinks the link with the
Libertarians ``is a natural liaison because the Libertarian Party
believes that we have the right to shape our own destiny and the
government doesn't have the right to jump in and tell us what we
should and should not do.''
   Turney, in a telephone interview from Richmond, said, ``Members
of NORML, leaders of NORML, are becoming more and more Libertarian
in their outlook.''
   They part company on some things, however. The Libertarian favor
repeal of all laws prohibiting drug use, while NORML seeks only to
legalize marijuana. The Libertarians also oppose taxation, while
NORML accepts taxation of marijuana as part of the legalization
process.
   ``We'll fight to legalize it with the tax and then fight to take
the tax off,'' said Ms. Moore.

<HEAD>Burglaries Alleged in Secret Project for Surviving Nuclear War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal contractor who reported problems in
the so-called ``Doomsday Project,'' a top-secret program designed to
keep the government running after a nuclear war, asserts in a sealed
lawsuit that the Federal Emergency Management Agency burglarized his
offices.
   The alleged break-ins occurred after the contractor, retired Army
major Fred Westerman, rejected a demand by FEMA to turn over all his
corporate records to a business competitor, according to the suit
filed in federal court.
   Westerman was kicked out of the secret program less than two
months after he refused to surrender the documents, which he still
has.
   An Army counterintelligence officer for 20 years, Westerman
started telling superiors about security and management problems in
the Continuity of Government program in 1986, according to
government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   COG is the nation's contingency plan for reconstituting the
government in the event of a nuclear attack. While almost all
details are secret, it is known to involve mobile communications
networks, supply depots and a system of underground bunkers.
   The program was dubbed the ``Doomsday Project'' in a recent U.S.
News &amp; World Report article. The magazine reported that the
Pentagon, the Justice Department and the House Armed Services
Committee all are conducting investigations into security and
performance problems in the program.
   FEMA and the Justice Department both refuse to discuss the COG
program or Westerman's lawsuit. In addition, the government obtained
a gag order to prevent the contractor from discussing his case.
   Westerman and his lawyer, Frank Mroz, both declined to comment
when asked about the suit.
   Under a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers, Westerman's
small company provided security and other services to FEMA for
portions of the COG program in five states.
   He reported that alarm and security systems at highly classified
locations were faulty and that his employees were exposed to
dangerous chemicals that had leaked from containers at several
facilities, according to the sources. Westerman also reported that
water had seeped onto high-voltage electrical lines in one area and
that engine parts were falling off emergency vehicles parked at
several facilities, the sources said.
   In one instance, Westerman reported that the government removed
an alarm system and installed a new one that provided less security
than the one it replaced, said the sources.
   Westerman frequently was pressured by his superiors not to make
any complaints at all, the sources added.
   On Nov. 20, 1987, representatives from FEMA, the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Maryland company of Brogan Associates Inc. came to
Westerman's offices, according to copies of the lawsuit obtained by
The Associated Press from sources other than parties in the case.
   FEMA employee Robert Lorenz and Army Corps officer Gerald Boggs
demanded that Westerman turn over all his corporate documents,
communications, records, invoices and checkbooks to Brogan president
Arthur Hutchins, the suit says.
   Boggs told Westerman then and in subsequent weeks that if he
refused to turn over the documents, he would not be awarded a new
five-year contract, according to the lawsuit.
   Lorenz, a specialist in FEMA's operations security division,
threatened to put Westerman's company out of business, according to
the lawsuit.
   The meeting ended with Westerman in possession of his corporate
records.
   FEMA, Brogan's company and the Corps of Engineers then ``did
unlawfully ... break into Corporate Headquarters'' of Westerman's
company, Systems Evaluation Inc., Westerman alleges in the suit.
   Westerman, according to several sources, says that the first of
at least four burglaries occurred within 48 hours of his Nov. 20
meeting and that the others occurred over the next three months.
   Four weeks after the meeting, Boggs told Westerman that
negotiations for the new five-year contract were being terminated
``due to all the things that ... (had) taken place,'' the suit says.
   Last month, U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson placed a gag
order on Westerman which prohibited him from discussing his case
with anyone, even members of Congress. Westerman subsequently
withdrew his suit and refiled it in federal court in Alexandria, Va.
   Government searches of premises ordinarily require a search
warrant signed by judges, and law enforcement agencies such as the
FBI ordinarily are the agencies that execute them. Under a national
security directive, the attorney general can approve a surreptitious
entry for intelligence purposes targeting a foreign power or an
agent of a foreign power.
   Westerman suspects FEMA placed him under surveillance and tapped
his telephones, according to another suit he filed against the
federal agency.
   That suit invoked the Freedom of Information Act in demanding
that FEMA turn over any records gathered as the result of
``surveillance ... telephone taps ... or any other electronic
listening device.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Albert Bryan dismissed that case Sept.
1 at a hearing where government lawyers refused to confirm or deny
that the agency had any such records pertaining to Westerman.
   In dismissing it, Bryan relied on a secret declaration the
government filed with the judge and which Westerman and his attorney
were not permitted to see.
   After being pushed out of the program in January 1988, Westerman
went to the FBI, the inspector general's office at FEMA and the
Justice Department to detail ``irregularities'' in COG, according to
an affidavit he filed with the U.S. Court of Claims.
   The affidavit does not elaborate on the irregularities.
   In June, the U.S. attorney's office informed Westerman that he
himself had become the target of a criminal investigation in
connection with his work for COG.
   The criminal inquiry has frozen Westerman's case in claims court,
where he is seeking to recover $500,000. Even though he is no longer
doing work for the government, he is locked into paying long-term
leases for office space and equipment that he would have used in his
work for COG.
   The FEMA public affairs office refused to comment on the suit.
The public affairs office at the Army Corps of Engineers referred
questions to the Army judge advocate general's office, which said
the Justice Department would handle any inquiries. Justice
Department lawyer Alan Ferber, who is defending the government in
the lawsuit, referred questions to spokeswoman Amy Brown, who
declined to comment.
   Brogan president Arthur Hutchins has not returned telephone calls
for the past month, and a lawyer representing the company did not
respond to calls the past week.

   The Duchess of York says she was a naughty child at
school and at home, singling out a mathematics teacher for
particular mischief, but described her own little girl as a
``smiley, easy'' baby.
   Asked by the British Broadcasting Corp. interviewer Saturday to
comment on a school report that described her as ``slapdash,
stubborn and headstrong,'' the duchess replied: ``I always tried to
do things and not get caught. I put dye in the lavatory cistern and
put glue on the teacher's chair, because it was maths _ and I didn't
like maths.''
   ``Maths'' is the British way of saying ``math,'' while a lavatory
cistern is a toilet tank.
   ``To begin with I was a bit of a tomboy, but when I finished up
at school, I did work quite hard and I was becoming more responsible
by the minute,'' said the 29-year-old wife of Prince Andrew, Queen
Elizabeth II's second son.
   The duchess, who has learned to fly airplanes and helicopters,
has written a children's book about a helicopter name Budgie.
   She said her own daughter, 1-year-old Princess Beatrice, enjoyed
the pictures, but ``when I showed it to her, she did her normal
trick and tore it up and threw it in the dustbin.''
   ``She thinks it's a great book because she loves the pretty
pictures and it all lands in the dustbin.''
   She said Beatrice was a ``placid, happy little girl. She has got
everything she needs and she has got devoted parents who see her as
much as they possibly can.
   ``And surely that's the answer for every child. Everybody says
they can't get over what a smiley, easy baby she is.''

   Lee Haney of the United States flexed his
massive muscles to win his sixth-consecutive Mr. Olympia
body-building title, a feat previously accomplished only by actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   The 29-year-old from Atlanta beat fellow Americans Lee Labrada,
who finished second, and Vince Taylor, who finished third, in the
contest at this popular resort city on Italy's Adriatic coast.
   Haney, who is 5 feet 9 and weighs 240 pounds, flexed his muscles
as he went through the routines of still and free poses before a
crowd of about 1,000.
   Many of the spectators, including young women who paid up to $350
for a seat, shouted ``Go! Go!'' and ``More! More!'' as Haney
performed on stage.
   The body builders were judged by an international jury on the
basis of the mass and tone of their muscles.

   Irish flutist James Galway says getting
along without his flutes is an ``absolute, total nuisance.''
   His five gold flutes _ three of which were diamond studded _ were
taken in July from a Lucerne, Switzerland, train station. They
flutes are valued at about $30,000 each.
   ``It's an absolute, total nuisance,'' Galway told The Tennessean
in a telephone interview. ``What do they do with them? They're so
individual. I'm just hoping someone stole them and kept them rather
than throwing them in a river somewhere.''
   Galway said he will be playing two flutes he borrowed from his
Japanese flutemakers when he appears later this week with the
Nashville Symphony Orchestra. His new custom-made flutes are
expected to be ready by December.
   Though he is best known for his classical recordings, Galway's
1978 venture into pop music was successful as well _ ``Annie's
Song'' sold a half million copies in the British Isles alone.

   It took a Vietnam veteran to correct Miguel
Nunez Jr.'s technique as point man Pvt. Marcus Taylor on the Vietnam
television series ``Tour of Duty.''
   ``I was keeping my rifle pointed in the same direction,'' Nunez
said Saturday at a fund-raising benefit for a local Vietnam veterans
group. ``This guy who was a point man in Vietnam told me you always
point the rifle in the same direction your eyes are moving. That way
you're aimed in the right direction the moment you spot the enemy.''
   That and other information are some of the survival tidbits Nunez
and other cast members pick up while attending Vietnam veterans
events like the one held at an Albany hotel for the Rensselaer
County Vietnam Memorial Committee.
   The committee enlisted the help of six of the show's eight main
cast members to help raise $250,000 for the memorial, which will
include a statue and a wall listing the names of the 42 servicemen
and one news photographer from Rensselaer County who died during the
War.
   ``It's extra special just meeting these guys,'' said Jim Davey, a
Vietnam vet and president of the memorial committee. ``The
camaraderie they have reminds me of the camaraderie we had in
Vietnam.''
   The CBS show is currently filming episodes in California for its
third season.
   During the three-hour reception, which attracted about 400
veterans and their families, the actors signed autographs and posed
for pictures. Nunez, along with Tony Becker, Ramon Franco, Dan
Gauthier, John Dye and Stan Foster, were constantly praised for
their portrayals of the young Army grunts fighting an unpopular war.
   ``I think it touches home with a lot of people,'' Foster said.
``Then again it's television and we can only do so much.''
   ``Some of it's Hollywood, but they have to have it,'' said Robert
Scott, one of the veterans who attended the reception. ``They try to
get the feeling across.''

   AIDS is so prevalent on this resort island
that Chamber of Commerce officials worry the disease may turn away
the tourists the economy relies on and change this into a place to
die.
   Monroe County, which includes Key West, has an AIDS rate even
higher than New York City and San Francisco. Most county residents
live on the Florida Keys, the chain of islands anchored by Key West.
   The deadly disease has spurred compassion among many residents of
Key West, a city with a highly visible gay population. Though no
reliable statistics exist, some social workers say many AIDS
patients from other cities are aware of this and are coming to Key
West for treatment and to die.
   That compassion could overwhelm the local health-care system and
stifle tourism, Key West's primary industry, officials say.
   ``If this is a great place to die, then it's not a great place to
have your winter vacation,'' said Jaye Harkow, a social worker who
moved to Key West a year ago to counsel AIDS patients.
   And that worries Greater Key West Chamber of Commerce officials.
   ``The impact on this community could be tremendous if we have
AIDS patients come into Key West for their last days,'' said John
Parks Jr., chamber president. ``We don't want to advertise that this
is a place for AIDS patients to come.''
   ``If the negative gets out that there are a large number of AIDS
cases in the Key West area, then people have the fear of not coming
to Key West,'' he said. ``This can be an explosive situation to the
community.''
   Monroe County had 121 cases AIDS per 100,000 people in 1988,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. San
Francisco had a rate of 102 cases per 100,000 from August 1988 to
July 1989, New York City had 63, and the greater Miami area had 45.
   Since the county first started keeping records of AIDS cases in
1982, 217 people have been diagnosed with the disease in the Keys,
said Dave Nolan, who handles statistics for the Monroe Public Health
Unit. That number does not include those who were diagnosed
elsewhere and then moved to Key West. Of the 217 diagnosed, 132 have
died.
   AIDS has put the county's only public hospital, Florida Keys
Memorial, in a financial bind.
   By the end of September, administrator Donald Mayer expects the
hospital to be stuck with at least $1 million in AIDS patients'
unpaid bills. That's a third of the hospital's unpaid bills, Mayer
said.
   ``AIDS is a big chunk of our financial problems,'' Mayer said.
``But we will continue to provide the care.''
   Businessman Bill Conkle has several friends fighting the disease.
   ``There are so few people here, that you're bound to know a few
of the people who have been affected,'' he said.

<HEAD>``No Other Way,'' Reilly Says of Cleaner Auto Fuel Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   EPA Administrator William Reilly on Sunday
defended the administration's plan to require cleaner-burning
alternatives to gasoline in the worst-polluted cities, saying
``there is no other way'' to curb smog.
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Reilly also said
alternative fuels can compete economically with gasoline.
Alternative automotive fuels such as methanol, ethanol and natural
gas a linchpin of the Bush administration's clean air plan.
   The environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee will hold a hearing on the plan Tuesday.
   The petroleum industry contends the alternative-fuels proposal
would put its members at an unfair disadvantage against the makers
of the other fuels. Methanol, for instance, is derived from natural
gas or coal.
   The petroleum industry says cleaner-burning gasoline can be
developed and should be allowed.
   The automobile industry contends it may not be able to develop
the technology to meet the proposed 1995 deadline for supplying half
a million alternative-fuel cars to the nine dirtiest cities by 1995.
   Reilly said, however: ``The fact is the automobile remains about
half, a little less than half, of the problem even though we've made
great gains since the early 1970s in cleaning up pollution from
automobile tailpipes. ...
   ``We've got to go back in and do better, and the major
opportunity we have is alternative fuels.''
   Reilly also said ``it's not at all clear'' that alternative fuels
would cost more.
   The president's Council of Economic Advisors has been unable to
come up with a precise estimate of the cost differential for the
alternative fuels because of the distant deadlines, Reilly said.
   ``But we are reasonably confident that the range of cost is
likely to be close,'' he said. ``We don't see a significantly
increased expense for some of the alternative fuels.''
   Reilly said the administration is ``open to the kinds of fuels
that are used ... provided they get the pollution reductions that we
need, but for many cities in the country we see no other way to get
there than to change the fuel mix.''
   Discussing the proposal in general, Reilly said the chief issue
will be the $14 billion to $19 billion cost and who pays it.
   ``The whole question of imposing the kinds of expense that it's
going to take to clean up the air ... obviously is going to entail a
great debate: how those costs are borne; what segments of society;
in some cases with respect to acid rain, what regions?'' he said.

   So confident is Coleman Young of breezing through
Tuesday's non-partisan mayoral primary that the normally combative
dean of U.S. black mayors is taking the high road or no road against
his 12 opponents.
   He won't fight them, and he rarely faces them.
   Thus the big question in the primary in the nation's
sixth-largest city is who will finish second and face Young in the
Nov. 7 runoff. At 71, Young seeks an unprecedented fifth four-year
term.
   Accountant Tom Barrow, 40, whom Young easily defeated in 1985, is
working hard to overtake John Conyers, 60, a 13-term congressman
whose name recognition alone may carry him into the runoff. Farther
back in the pack are City Council President Erma Henderson and
businessman Charles Costa.
   A poll released Aug. 27 by WJBK-TV found 38 percent of 413
respondents supported Young, 12 percent Conyers and 9 percent
Barrow. Henderson had 4.4 percent and Costa 1.5 percent, with 30
percent undecided. The margin of error was 4.8 points.
   Only Conyers is given much of a chance against Young in November.
   Young, despite taking a beating in the news media for most of his
current term, seems to have all the advantages. Among them:
   _A reported $5 million in campaign funds.
   _A 15-year incumbency and a record of accomplishment to go with
it. He kept a promise from his first campaign to bring affirmative
action to an overwhelmingly white police department, which now is 52
percent black and 20 percent female; he expanded City Airport and
Cobo Convention Center, and he has helped Detroit banks pledge more
than $2 billion in loans to city residents.
   _Support from the city's most influential unions, leaders of its
largest black churches, most of the city's state representatives,
and the Michigan Chronicle, the state's largest black newspaper.
Conyers and Barrow also are black, as are two-thirds of Detroit's 1
million people.
   Conyers' political service consists of a quarter-century in
Congress, and he has a national reputation, though his last-minute
candidacy just before a filing deadline didn't help much.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has endorsed Conyers. So did The Detroit
Free Press, which had supported Young's four previous election bids
but denounced his ``lack of leadership'' the past four years. The
newspaper said Conyers ``would provide Detroit its best assurance of
a full debate and a real choice in November.''
   Barrow practically never stopped campaigning since he lost to
Young 61 percent to 39 percent in 1985. A nephew of boxer Joe Louis,
Barrow has no experience in office, and some observers feel he has
dues to pay in the rough-and-tumble world of Detroit politics before
he can expect to be mayor.
   Barrow's greatest accomplishment was leading last year's
opposition to Young's third effort to bring casino gambling to
Detroit. His door-to-door politicking also has given him more
visibility, and The Detroit News endorsed him as more conservative
than Young and Conyers.
   One matter that put Young into the headlines a few months ago _
the disclosure that he had fathered a child by a former city
administrator _ hasn't been much of a campaign issue.
   Young's greatest problem might be the perception that he's been
around too long. The need for a change has been the central theme of
Conyers' and Barrow's campaigns; they have accused the mayor of
neglecting neighborhoods at the expense of downtown development and
not doing enough about drug abuse among police officers, though
Young did get a judge to approve drug testing for patrolmen.
   ``There's something called the ABC vote _ Anybody But Coleman,''
said Wilbur Rich, an associate professor of political science at
Wayne State University who wrote a biography of Young.
   But that may not help Young's foe in the runoff, Rich said.
``Those people who have an ax to grind will show up for the primary,
but don't look for them in November.''
   Should Conyers finish second Tuesday, Rich looks for a bloody
campaign for the runoff, focusing on issues including drugs, crime
and neighborhood services.
   ``Conyers is not a guy Young can knock out easily. Conyers has a
lot of national visibility. But if it gets down to the cliche,
sound-bite kind of stuff, Young will be in his element,'' Rich said.
   Young's campaigning appears designed to keep him clear of
multicandidate events, where he might be forced or tempted to answer
one of his challengers. He says he's avoided such appearances to
give his challengers a chance to present their proposals.
   Young briefly encountered Conyers at a Labor Day parade. Young
walked a block of the parade route, then hopped in his limousine and
rode to the reviewing stand. That brought knocks from Conyers and
Barrow about Young's stamina.
   Instead, Young has campaigned as The Mayor. During the last week
in August, he announced a new $33 million soft drink bottling plant
that will employ 300, an $86 million bond sale and the construction
of 500 housing units with $30 million in state money.
   In November, Rich said, ``The winner can't be just as good as
Coleman; they'll have to prove they are better than Coleman.''

<HEAD>China Issues 40 Slogans For 40th Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has issued 40 slogans to mark the 40th
anniversary of its Communist revolution, including one celebrating
the recent suppression of the student pro-democracy movement.
   The slogans, compiled by the Communist Party and published Sunday
by the official Xinhua News Agency, are a mixture of self-praise for
the nation's accomplishments and admonishments to do better in such
areas as corruption and education.
   Since the revolution 40 years ago, China has made heavy use of
slogans in newspapers and on billboards and signs to express policy
and exhort people to follow it.
   One slogan, opening with declarations hailing the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and
its ``great achievements'' in modernization, calls on people to
``warmly hail the successful quelling of the turmoil and the
counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   China claims the bloody June 3-4 military crackdown on students
and their supporters in Beijing was necessary because demands for
democratic reform had become a counterrevolutionary rebellion
attempting to overthrow the government.
   Another slogan calls on people to ``salute the People's
Liberation Army men, police and armed police who have performed
remarkable feats in the struggle to defend the People's Republic.''
   Chinese also are urged to retain loyalty to socialism and the
Communist Party, and to ``firmly fight against bourgeois
liberalization,'' or attraction to Western ideas and political
systems.
   They are told to support economic reforms and an open-door policy
while fulfilling the task of ``straightening out the economic
order'' _ a reference to the current policy of reasserting central
controls and halting new reforms in the wake of inflation and other
economic woes.
   One new slogan calls for self-reliance, hard work and building up
the country through thrift and hard work.
   Another repeats Mao Tse-tung's 1956 promise of free expression,
``Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought
contend,'' that was followed in 1957 by a crackdown on those who
spoke out against the party.
   The phrase is again suspect because many intellectuals who spoke
out for democratic reform earlier in the year have been arrested or
publicly condemned since the June crackdown.
   Chinese are urged to ``build an honest and clean government (and)
punish and eliminate corruption,'' a major issue during the spring
demonstrations.
   They are also told to ``maintain the sovereignty of the country
and national dignity and firmly oppose any foreign interference in
China's internal affairs,'' an apparent reference to Western
condemnation of the violence used to suppress the student protests.
   On Oct. 1, China marks the 40th anniversary since Mao Tse-tung,
standing on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, declared the founding of the
People's Republic of China.

<TEXT>
   Charles Sanders Peirce, an irritable
genius who invented the ``I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it'' philosophy
called pragmatism, was born 150 years ago Sunday. Yet the
appreciation of his wide-ranging mind has only begun, say scholars
who gathered to study his work.
   ``There's a tremendous story to be told,'' said Professor Kenneth
Ketner of Texas Tech University, co-host of the Charles Sanders
Peirce Sesquicentennial International Congress that wound up this
weekend at Harvard University, Peirce's alma mater. ``We're talking
about one of the great geniuses of all time.''
   A prolific writer, inspired scientist and daring philospher,
Peirce didn't stop at pragmatism. He also thought up semiotics,
devised modern symbolic logic _ the mathematical system that
underpins the computer _ and determined, long before this
mechanistic age, that treating people like machines won't work.
   Peirce delved into the history of science, astronomy, physics and
metaphysics. Evolution, psychology and the reality of God all
entertained his roving mind.
   It helps to have a dictionary handy when considering Peirce.
Pragmatism, for example, is the philosophy that determines the
meaning and truth of ideas and tests their validity by their
practical results. In other words, it ties ideas to action. ``Let us
not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our
hearts,'' he wrote.
   Semiotics is a general theory about signs and symbols and how
they relate to communication.
   Peirce knew how hard he was to understand. He once confided to
his friend, promoter and fellow pragmatist, William James, that he
felt like ``a snarl of twine.''
   In college courses, James usually gets the credit for pragmatism;
Peirce is just a footnote. But Ketner says that even James referred
to his chum as the founder of the philosophy James made famous.
   Ketner was among more than 400 scholars from a dozen countries,
including China, Japan, West Germany and Brazil, who attended the
Harvard congress.
   ``Peirce for a long time was undervalued as the greatest American
philosopher,'' said Umberto Eco, the best-selling Italian novelist
who teaches philosophy at the University of Bologna. He ranks Peirce
among the two or three greatest thinkers of his time.
   ``He was American-born but he was a universal mind,'' said Eco,
who like all Peirce fans correctly pronounces the name ``purse.''
   Harvard was more than Peirce's alma mater. He grew up there.
   The son of the famed Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce, he
was raised in a house in Harvard Yard, where he began to study logic
and reasoning at age 12 and was trained in math and science by the
time he entered Harvard at 16.
   The younger Peirce made his living as a mathematical physicist
for the government and was well-known in his day for his scientific
ventures. He devised a way to chart the shape of the Earth and
pioneered the use of light waves to measure lengths. He tried to
measure the Milky Way, went around the world gauging gravity and
explored zoology.
   While he was little known by the public, he was elected to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of
Sciences and the London Mathematical Society.
   Overbearing but overly sensitive, his difficult personality was
forgiven by friends like James. But his efforts to enter academia
failed badly. He was fired from a part-time job teaching logic at
Johns Hopkins University when it was discovered he was living with a
woman while not yet divorced from his first wife.
   Peirce's only outlets then were such publications as The Nation
and obscure scientific journals. But he wrote down his ideas daily,
and after his death at age 75 in 1914 on a farm in Milford, Penn.,
his widow gave his papers to Harvard. The first collection of
Peirce's philosophical writings was published in the 1930s. More is
in the offing, and even now scholars continue to come up with new
intellectual gems.
   Enthusiasm worldwide for Peirce can be attributed to curiosity
about America and American thought, his ideas' ready applicability
to modern technology and contemporary philosophy, and the universal
context in which he worked, said Israel Scheffler, a Harvard
professor of philosophy and education.
   ``The substance of Peirce's thoughts have not been fully
plumbed,'' Scheffler said.

<HEAD>Action Against Mormon Indian Leader Ignites Navajo Concern</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Mormon church who abruptly
excommunicated the only American Indian ever appointed to the church
hierarchy are busy trying to blunt the impact of his stormy exit and
questions he raised.
   George P. Lee, the first Mormon high official in 46 years to be
erased from membership rolls, is heading to the mountains alone for
a month or more of fasting and meditation about his future outside
the church, which he claims is polluted from the top by pride and
racial prejudice.
   ``It's the way of my people,'' Lee, a Navajo and son of a
medicine man, said a week after losing his official standing Sept. 1
as a role model for more than 40,000 Navajo Mormons.
   Two Mormon officials convened a hastily scheduled meeting Friday
with local church leaders at Window Rock, Ariz., headquarters of the
Navajo reservation. A similar session was arranged Saturday in
Shiprock, N.M.
   Navajo sources who attended Friday's meeting characterized the
session as an effort by the church to isolate Lee and his beliefs
from his people.
   ``Generally they said it was not the church's fault and that it
was due to George ...,'' said one Navajo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``They are trying to nip it in the bud, but at the end we
were all somewhat confused.''
   Lee said in an interview he had no intention of recruiting his
own following and discouraged disillusioned church members from
leaving the faith.
   But he did not retreat from his characterization of Mormon
leaders as vain men bent on dislodging Indians from what Lee sees as
their rightful place in Mormon theology.
   Lee's abrupt departure is seen by many Navajo Mormons as a
validation of his claim that the church leadership under President
Ezra Taft Benson is quietly moving to dislodge Indian members from
their heritage.
   Mormons believe Indians are descendants of ancient peoples who
sailed to the Americas and whose history is detailed in the Book of
Mormon. The volume's title page says it is written to the Lamanites,
or Indians, ``who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to
Jew and Gentile.''
   Lee says Benson's predecessor, Spencer W. Kimball, taught that
Indians are literal descendants of Israel, while non-Indian Mormons
are gentiles ``adopted'' into the House of Israel when they embrace
the faith.
   Church spokesman Bruce Olsen said it was not his place to define
current Mormon doctrine, but sources at the Window Rock meeting said
Elder H. Burke Peterson attempted to do so by arguing that the blood
of non-Indian Mormons is transformed, making them literal
descendants of Israel.
   ``He (Peterson) said that those who are being baptized into the
church, their blood physically changes to that of the House of
Israel,'' said one source who demanded anonymity. ``This kind of
confirms what Elder Lee was saying.''
   Lee contends the belief that all Mormons are literal descendants
of Israel reflects an attitude of white supremacy among Mormon
leaders who have systematically cut Indian programs at church-owned
Brigham Young University and elsewhere.
   Lee, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy since 1975, was
excommunicated for ``apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member
of the church'' following an hour-long meeting with Benson, his
counselors in the governing First Presidency, and the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, an advisory body that supervises the Seventy.
   Members of the three panels are known as general authorities in
the 6.7 million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   At the meeting, Lee read a 23-page letter detailing his concerns.
Then, within minutes, two officials told him to turn over all church
property, including a credit card and a signed pass with which
faithful Mormons gain entry to their temples.
   ``It was just absolutely cold,'' said Lee, 46, a father of seven
who is without pension or immediate job prospect.
   A request to interview a member of the Twelve was declined. As a
matter of policy, church officials do not divulge details of
disciplinary actions.

<TEXT>
   A philosophy professor says in a published article
that the Soviet system continues to exploit workers and waste
resources, and suffers from a ``tyranny of authoritarian
bureaucracy.''
   In another interview published Sunday, an economist attacks
socialist principles. The two articles carry glasnost, the openness
policy of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, further than most in the
state-controlled press by questioning the ability of communism to
solve society's basic problems.
   The philosophy professor, Mikhail Kapustin, rips into the
governing system in a 25-page article in the August issue of the
literary magazine called October.
   The monthly raised eyebrows earlier this year by reprinting a
novel criticizing Vladimir I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state.
   Kapustin assailed a 1989 dictionary on communism that outlines
the ``historic advantages of socialism.''
   ``The advantages of socialism are not historic or real, but
purely theoretical, conjectural,'' Kapustin wrote. ``They are an
ideological mirage in a social, economic and legal desert.''
   The interview with economist Rair Simonyan appeared in the latest
issue of Ogonyok magazine, released Sunday.
   Simoyan said socialism alienated workers and hampered competition
needed for free development of the individual, one of the ideology's
stated goals.
   Gorbachev and other leaders have repeatedly said communism and
socialism are basically sound theories properly put into effect by
Lenin but distorted by his successor, dictator Josef Stalin.
   As recently as Saturday night, Gorbachev said in a television
speech that his perestroika, or restructuring program, was aimed at
``socialist renewal of society.'' He said perestroika had ``returned
to this great country a feeling of dignity (and) gave the Soviet man
a sense of freedom.''
   However, the philosophy professor wrote in his article _ entitled
``What's Coming'' _ that because of Stalin, ``the working people
once again found themselves where they had been before the
revolution: in conditions of hopeless labor and oppression in
serfdom and slavery.''
   He indicated that the problems persist even under Gorbachev,
saying ``despite glasnost, we still continue to live in customary
stale darkness'' that keeps people engaged in ``theoretical
optimism.''
   Kapustin says socialism's goal of organizing production for the
well-being of the people ``has for 70 years been retreating further
and further.'' He adds tht ``cumbersome, economically unjustified
construction projects ... and huge ecologically criminal projects''
have been undertaken instead.
   Another stated goal of socialism was to eliminate exploitation of
workers, but Kapustin said ``they are exploited in any case.''
   In his interview with Ogonyok, Simonyan agreed. ``Those who work
well are exploited by those who work poorly. Honest workers are
exploited by those who live off unearned income. Those who work in
industries are exploited by officials of the
administrative-bureaucratic apparatus. Generally speaking, a worker
is exploited by the state,'' he said.
   Kapustin recommended abandoning the communist tenet that
capitalism will inevitably decay.
   He said communism was supposed to foster the rule of reason, but
in fact it has produced ``no reason, just an accumulation of the
same mistakes.''
   The working class, he said, was supposed to be in charge but
instead, ``the tyranny of czarism, aristocracy and bourgeoisie was
replaced by another tyranny, of authoritarian bureaucracy.''
   Stalin and his successors ``brought our society to a spiritual
and moral degradation, where the ruling elite has turned out to be
made of the least worthy material,'' Kapustin said.

<HEAD>Your Tax Dollars At Work: Brochure Tells How To Bloat Mice To Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Instead of using poison to rid their homes of
mice, Hennepin County residents are being asked to call in the
killer potatoes.
   That's right. Put out a bowl of mashed potato powder near a dish
of water, and it's supposed to bloat the varmints to death.
   That's just one of the chemical-free suggestions the county has
in a four-page, trash-can-shaped brochure it began giving out last
week at its household hazardous waste collection sites, set up to
encourage people not to put their leftover household chemicals and
such in the trash.
   The ideas in the brochure _ a cross between Mother Earth News and
Hints from Heloise _ were gleaned from several sources and include
buying hints and disposal tips.
   The county printed 30,000 copies of the brochure for residents
who want natural alternatives to toxic remedies for common household
pests.
   If the problem is flies and a swatter is too much work, the
brochure says to try a plate of egg yolk, molasses and finely ground
black pepper.
   Ants? Try tansy, one of several herbs that repel the crawlers.
   At least one county commissioner thought some of the ideas
sounded a little farfetched.
   ``I'm skeptical about whether some of this stuff works,'' said
Commissioner Randy Johnson, though he said he has used some of the
brochure's stain-removing tips.
   Don Seeberger, a county planner whose job is to keep hazardous
wastes out of people's garbage, says more than half of the hints
were tested at the homes of staff members before publication.
   But Seeberger got mixed reports on the allegedly killer potatoes.
   ``We have a secretary here who tried it and told us that it did
work,'' he said. ``We have another guy who told us it didn't work.''

   In the state's largest cocaine seizure ever, state
police seized 1,100 pounds of cocaine being shipped in a
semi-trailer truck, according to a report published Sunday.
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver confirmed on Saturday that
cocaine had been seized and at least two people had been arrested,
but wouldn't give details of the incident. State police said only
that a large quantity of drugs had been seized and details would be
divulged at a news conference Monday.
   The Denver Post, quoting law enforcement sources who would not

Friday afternoon from a semi-trailer truck headed eastbound on
Interstate 70 near Grand Junction. Two men aboard the truck, age 19
and 20, were arrested, the Post said.
   Colorado's record cocaine seizure had been 738 pounds confiscated
at the Jefferson County Airport in May 1988 in a Drug Enforcement
Administration sting.

<HEAD>Exxon Contractor Estimates Cleanup Costs At $2 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exxon's prime contractor on cleaning up
the nation's worst oil spill estimates the petroleum giant will end
up spending $2 billion on the job, nearly twice as much as estimated
in July.
   VECO Inc. President Pete Leathard said the $2 billion figure
should include all oil spill-related costs except major lawsuits,
which could take years to settle and could push the final tally
higher.
   ``We've paid more than $1 billion ... but we're not speculating
on (future) costs or lawsuits,'' said Don Cornett, an Exxon
spokesman.
   By the end of June, Exxon's costs for the cleanup had been
estimated at $1.28 billon.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling
almost 11 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince
William Sound. Since then, the oil has spread hundreds of miles.
   Exxon has said it will stop the cleanup work Friday because of
worsening weather and shorter days.
   Exxon had made no commitment to send workers back to the area
next spring, will have to finish the cleanup next spring or pay the
government to do the job, EPA Administrator William Reilly said
Sunday in Washington. ``The job isn't done,'' he said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
   VECO and its subcontractors are expected to spend more than $700
million of Exxon's money on the cleanup, Leathard said in an
interview in Sunday's editions of The Anchorage Times.
   On its own, Exxon has handled many of ``the big-dollar items,''
including the rental of many vessels longer than 100 feet, he added.
   The cost of scientific studies, open-water oil pickup and the
numerous damage claims against the company also will combine to
drive final costs to about $2 billion, he said.
   Leathard said the $700 million in VECO expenditures were about
evenly divided beween labor, boat rentals and materials. At the peak
of the cleanup, VECO and its subcontractors employed about 7,500
workers and leased 2,000 vessels, he said.
   Hundreds of companies in more than 30 states and a half-dozen
foreign countries were tapped by VECO for material and equipment.
   At one point, VECO, which handled about 90 percent of the
shoreline work for Exxon, was spending about $5 million a day on
payroll, boat leases, materials and equipment, he said.
   Through the end of August, VECO had paid $123 million in wages to
Alaska employees, he said. Norcon, a VECO subsidiary, paid an
additional $69 million. In all, about $460 million of the $700
million spent by VECO was pumped into the Alaska economy, Leathard
said.
   ``Exxon has done what the said they would do ... and they have
given us all the money we needed,'' Leathard said.

   The city will begin steering its money to banks
committed to serving minority neighborhoods' credit needs, Mayor
Raymond Flynn has announced.
   The move comes less than two weeks after a federal report said
white Boston neighborhoods have gotten more mortgage loans than
black neighborhoods.
   Flynn said Saturday he will sign an executive order establishing
a ``linked deposit'' program requiring the city treasurer to
evaluate banks on such factors as home mortgages, small-business
loans and other services.
   ``We don't see this as a panacea,'' Treasurer Lee Jackson said.
``But on the other hand, we think it's important we put our money
where our mouth is and do what we can to encourage positive
investment behavior.''
   The mayor also said he will establish a Community Banking
Commission to monitor lending practices of Boston banks and
recommend ways to improve services to city neighborhoods.
   Boston city deposits range from $50 million to $350 million at
any given time and are split among 20 banks and money-market funds.
Banks bid for deposits.
   In its recent report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said
that between 1982 and 1987, the largely white areas of Boston
received 24 percent more mortgage loans than black neighborhoods.
The study urged bankers to reach out to minority consumers.
   A Boston community group issued a similar study a month ago.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. House Banking Committee said Friday it will
hold a hearing Sept. 29 in Boston in response to the Federal Reserve
study.
   Also on Friday, the Massachusetts Bankers Association offered a
series of proposals to ease inequities in money services between
black and white neighborhoods statewide.
   The proposals include setting up a Minority Business Investment
Center to encourage expansion of minority-owned companies, and
changing mortgage lending practices to increase minority access to
financial institutions.

   The Washington Monument was closed for about
half an hour Sunday when five Cuban nationals handcuffed themselves
to part of the building as part of a demonstration.
   Four men and a woman linked together by a chain handcuffed
themselves to a railing at the 400-foot level of the Washington
Monument, said U.S. Park Police officer John Nawrot.
   They left voluntarily and agreed to be questioned when police
reached the scene, he said.
   The demonstrators, who identified themselves in a press release
as members of 30th of November, were led away by police in a paddy
wagon and were taken in for questioning, but will not be charged,
Nawrot said.
   The release claims that the group was protesting the ``massacre''
of hundreds of young Cubans by Fidel Castro 17 years ago and
continued human rights violations in the communist country.

<HEAD>Workers To Remove Rock Lodged In Hull Of Exxon Valdez</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reilly-Exxon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Repair work begins Monday on the tanker Exxon
Valdez, which caused the nation's worst oil spill when its hull was
ripped open on a reef, and one of the first objectives is removing
big chunks of the reef.
   One rock ``about the size of a Volkswagen Bug'' and another rock
estimated to weigh about 6,000 pounds are still wedged in torn
sections of the tanker's hull, said Dick Vortmann, president of
National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.
   Both rocks are from Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound,
where the ruptured tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude
oil in March.
   NASSCO Vice President Fred Hallet said more than 300 workers are
expected to cut away and replace about 3,200 tons of steel. The
damaged area represents more 75 percent of the tanker's bottom.
   Twelve of the ship's 25 compartments need repairs.
   The tanker underwent temporary repairs in a remote lagoon in
Prince William Sound before being towed to San Diego. During the
voyage, large sheets of hull plating came loose and dragged below
the ship, and had to be cut loose before the Valdez could be towed
through shallow water to the shipyard.
   Reporters were allowed to examine the tanker's hull Saturday as
workers prepared for the nine-month, $25 million repair job.
   The Valdez is sitting 5 feet off the ground in dry dock on dozens
of concrete pylons. The ship was built by NASSCO in the same dry
dock and launched in 1986.
   The largest visible damage was to a 300-by-80-foot section of the
starboard side, an area of scraped and twisted metal and gaping
holes.
   In some of the now-open compartments, large, twisted beams and
broken pipe were smashed together.
   ``It's amazing,'' said Wayne Butterfield, NASSCO repair manager.
   Also touring the tanker was Jean Michel Cousteau, executive vice
president of the Cousteau Society, who was in San Diego for an
underwater film festival.
   ``It is far more than I had believed,'' Cousteau said. ``I can
understand now why there was a real concern about the ship
capsizing.''

   Gov. Evan Bayh has signed another veto _
nixing his own official autograph.
   With the stroke of a pen, the governor has written off as a loss
the signature affixed to thousands of documents during the first
eight months of his administration.
   In its place, Bayh has penned a new signature that shuns modern
efficiency in favor of old-time legibility.
   ``I started seeing these documents coming back to me with my
signature on them and I looked at them and thought to myself, `Boy,
that's not a very good example of penmanship,''' Bayh said Friday.
   ``So I took the initiative myself and insisted I'm going to take
my time and write a nice, legible signature rather than this scrawl
I hurriedly put down before,'' he said.
   The governor acknowledged his autograph had consisted of ``an `E'
and an elongated squiggle'' followed by a ``B'' and two loops, one
descending and one ascending.
   The new autograph with the full eight letters, each more or less
readable, has replaced the old one on the machine used to affix
Bayh's signature to thousands of documents he doesn't have time to
sign himself.
   Bayh said a penmanship teacher had written to him suggesting he
take more care in signing his name. And he admitted feeling a little
sheepish about the reaction from some people he gave autographs,
like a high school graduate at a commencement Bayh spoke at this
spring.
   ``This one young guy was the first up to me, and I proceeded to
give him my quick signature,'' said Bayh. ``He looked at it and
said, `Come on, what's that?'''

   After shooting 1,013 weddings,
photographer Bob Shanklin got married himself and found love at
first lighthouse.
   While honeymooning in New England two years ago, Shanklin, now
64, and his new bride, Sandra, 50, took their first pictures of
lighthouses. Now they are about a quarter of the way toward their
goal of photographing every one of an estimated 850 lighthouses
nationwide, many of them in various states of disrepair.
   ``I think it's kind of the romance of the sea,'' Mrs. Shanklin
said.
   ``I think it's a symbol of security,'' her husband said.
   Shanklin gave up a measure of security in putting aside a studio
and then a commercial photography business to sell photos as art.
   ``For years, I shot what everyone wanted me to shoot, and I got
to the point where I couldn't stand to take pictures of people any
more,'' Shanklin said. ``I almost pulled out of (photography) and
then decided I'd start shooting what my heart told me to shoot.''
   Shanklin met his wife, a seascape artist, at an art show. They
now make a living selling their photographs at shows and to
publications. Although they photograph other subjects, the
lighthouses have sold best, particularly in this year of the 200th
anniversary of the U.S. Lighthouse Service.

<HEAD>Republican Congressman Accuses CIA of Bungling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA and Pakistani intelligence have bungled
the war in Afghanistan, threatening to turn what appeared to be a
victory by anti-Communist guerrillas into a triumph for the
Soviet-backed government there, a U.S. congressman charged Sunday.
   ``The CIA has secretly pursued a wrongheaded Afghan policy for
years,'' the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism and
Unconventional Warfare, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, charged in a
2,600-word article in the editorial section of the Washington Post.
   The most recent blunder, he wrote, was to shut off the supply of
U.S. arms while pressuring Afghan guerrillas into launching an
assault on the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border.
   At the same time, the Soviet Union continued massive arms
supplies to its client in Kabul, enabling that government to
withstand the assault.
   The siege of Jalalabad has turned into a stalemate that threatens
to stall the entire resistance movement.
   The key mistake by the Central Intelligence Agency and the State
Department was to give control U.S. arms shipments to the guerrillas
to Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence, that nation's equivalent
of the CIA, McCollum wrote.
   ``Why the CIA gave ISI its proxy was easier to understand in the
beginning,'' as the United States began to arm the Moslem
guerrillas, or mujahedeen, after the 1979 Soviet invasion, McCollum
wrote.
   ``Our intelligence community had little faith in the mujahedeen's
ability to drive out the Soviets; for a relatively small sum we
could blacken Moscow's eye and get our own back for Vietnam,'' he
wrote.
   But the policy allowed generals around the late Pakistani
strongman, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, to bolster an Islamic fundamentalist
whom McCollum compared to Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi. The policy
slighted tribal leaders who had greater support in Afghanistan.
   In 1976, ISI recruited Gulbadin Hekmatyar, who was then a
``firebrand fundamentalist student leader at Kabul University'' and
who now heads Hezb-i-Islami, one of seven Afghan resistance parties
based in Peshawar, Pakistan, the congressman wrote.
   Hekmatyar was censured by the leaders of the six other parties
this summer after guerrillas under his control ambushed and killed
32 lieutenants of the leading Afghan resistance fighter, Ahmed Shah
Massoud, who belongs to another party.
   That highly publicized action fit a pattern, McCollum said.
   Rather than establishing direct ties to the Afghan resistance,
the CIA channelled the aid through Pakistani intelligence, which in
turn handed over the lion's share to Hekmatyar, McCollum wrote.
   ``After the Soviet invasion, as millions of Afghan families took
refuge in Pakistan and their men took up arms, Hekmatyar's party
received the majority of weapons, money and other support from
Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence,'' McCollum wrote.
   ``And for the next nine years, roughly half of all weapons --
provided by America, Europe or the Saudi government -- went to
Hekmatyar,'' he said.
   Compared to more effective Afghan resistance leaders, such as
Massoud, ``Hekmatyar has attracted a very small group of competent
commanders and a somewhat larger collection of rural bandits and
would-be warlords,'' the congressman wrote.
   ``They are choked with supplies but low on competence and zeal --
apart from raiding other parties,'' he said.
   The CIA and ISI made an additional mistake after the withdrawal
of Soviet forces last February by overruling resistance leaders who
favored a gradual wearing down of the regime, and instead ordered an
assault on Jalalabad.
   The siege of Jalalabad has resulted in a stalemate, in large part
because CIA ``tacticians were so certain they were right that they
turned off the arms supply. For the last eight months, virtually
nothing has reached the mujahedeen,'' the congressman wrote.

<HEAD>Senate Turning to Military Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate takes an initial step this week
toward fashioning a military spending bill in the first test of
President Bush's defense program since the August recess.
   The Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense votes Tuesday
on the president's package that stresses big-ticket strategic items
such as Star Wars, the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetman
nuclear missiles.
   Last month, the full Senate largely endorsed the president's plan
in passing a $305 billion defense authorization bill _ $295 billion
for the Pentagon and $10 billion for the Department of Energy. The
Appropriations subcommittee is expected to do the same.
   The Senate version of the authorization bill trimmed the
president's $4.9 billion fiscal 1990 request for the Star Wars
antimissile shield by $400 million and made a modest cut of $300
million in the $4.7 billion earmarked for the B-2 bomber.
   The Senate also left intact Bush's request of $1.1 billion for
the rail-garrison, multiple-warhead MX and $100 million for the
single-warhead Midgetman.
   While the Appropriations subcommittee crafts its blueprint, the
House is expected to select its conferees who will thrash out a
defense authorization bill with the Senate.
   The House version of authorization legislation ``pretty well
shredded George Bush's strategic programs,'' Armed Services Chairman
Les Aspin, D-Wis., said after the chamber vote.
   The House bill slashed $1.8 billion from the president's Star
Wars request; limited production of the B-2 bomber, the bat-winged
aircraft designed to evade Soviet radar; cut $502 million from the
MX budget and eliminated all funds for the Midgetman.
   The House restored money for conventional programs Bush sought to
kill, including the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, and the Marine Corps'
V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane.
   The House later approved a spending bill that largely mirrors
what the authorization plan does. The appropriations bill also
slashed $2 billion from classified programs that include the
advanced tactical fighter and the advanced cruise missile.
   In other congressional action this week:
   _The full Senate on Tuesday considers Bush's choice of Donald P.
Gregg as ambassador to South Korea, a nomination dogged by charges
Gregg lied about playing a role in the Iran-Contra affair. Gregg has
repeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in Oliver North's
secret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels while serving as
national security adviser to then-Vice President George Bush. Three
Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee joined nine
Republicans in recommending approval. The panel's vote was 12-7 to
send the nomination to the Senate floor.
   _The Senate takes up an $11.9 billion transportation spending
bill for fiscal 1990 that includes a provision permanently
prohibiting cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights. The
current ban on smoking aboard flights lasting two hours or less is
scheduled to expire in April.
   _The House on Tuesday considers a statute to ban flag burning in
response to the Supreme Court ruling this spring that said the
practice was constitutional. That decision raised the ire of
lawmakers and the Bush administration, which has pushed for a
constitutional amendment rather than a statute.
   _Disputes are expected this week as the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee on Tuesday takes up Bush's plan to rid
cities of smog, control poisonous chemicals and stop acid rain.
Issues expected to cause disagreement include anti-pollution
requirements for cars, who foots the bill for acid rain cleanup and
how thoroughly the government should clamp down on toxic substances.
   In a speech Thursday, Bush said the House bill is ``totally
unacceptable'' and ``contains unneeded programs costing nearly $20
billion from 1990 to 1994, holding our defense budget hostage to
projects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategic
modernization.''
   In light of the major disparity between the House and Senate
bills, and the president's complaints, a conference bill is not
expected to be hammered out until after Oct. 1, the start of the
fiscal year.
   Lawmakers and congressional aides have indicated that after a
contentious session, the tenuous MX-Midgetman missile compromise
will likely survive while the spending level for Star Wars may be
around $3.5 billion, less than the $4 billion spent on the program
in fiscal 1989.
   There were few predictions on the eventual fate of the B-2 bomber.
   Both the House and the Senate restored money for the V-22 Osprey
despite Bush's cancellation plans, a healthy harbinger for the
tilt-rotor aircraft. The F-14D, however, faces an uphill fight.
   The Senate endorsed the president's decision to kill the carrier
aircraft manufactured by Grumman Aerospace Corp., of New York. The
House earmarked $1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years.
   The F-14D's cause may have been helped by recent reports of
problems for the advanced tactical fighter, which is considered the
late 1990s replacement for the F-14D and the Air Force's F-15.
   Last week during a confirmation hearing, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned the
six-month slip in the ATF and why some Air Force programs are having
difficulty in the latter stages of development.

<HEAD>Showdown Over Old-Growth Logging Could Come This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The showdown over logging of the ancient
forests of the Northwest could come as early as this week when House
and Senate negotiators consider legislation imposing an uneasy truce
in the bitter battle between environmentalists and the timber
industry.
   Both sides have mounted intense lobbying campaigns aimed at the
20 or so lawmakers who will consider the interior appropriations
bill for the coming fiscal year.
   Attached to the Senate-passed version of the spending bill is an
amendment offered by Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Brock Adams,
D-Wash., that has outraged environmentalists and has the reluctant
support of the industry.
   National environmental groups have made defeat of the amendment
one of their top legislative priorities this year and
conservationists from around the country have been prowling the
halls of Congress over the past week buttonholing members and their
top aides.
   Two loaded logging trucks from the Northwest will roll onto
Capitol Hill on Monday for an industry-sponsored rally. More than
150 people, including loggers and millworkers from 22 Oregon and
Washington communities, will spearhead the industry lobbying drive
this week.
   At stake is the future of the cathedral-like forests on federal
lands in Washington state, Oregon and northern California. The
stands of old-growth trees, some up to 1,000 years old, provide
prime habitat for the northern spotted owl and timber for mills that
serve as the sole source of income for residents of dozens of small
communities.
   ``The Hatfield-Adams rider will kill spotted owls as sure as a
drunken logger with a shotgun,'' said Andy Kerr, conservation
director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.
   Mark Rey, executive director of the newly-formed American Forest
Resource Alliance, said the fate of small, independent timber
operations was on the line and if environmentalists have their way
the forests will be closed to logging creating an economic
catastrophe for the one-mill towns.
   ``We are on record supporting the legislation reluctantly and we
hope it passes,'' said Rey, adding the that the amendment provided
only a short-term fix and that the battle will continue as the Fish
and Wildlife Service decides whether to list the owl as a threatened
species.
   Environmentalists are especially incensed over provisions in the
amendment they say would limit their access to the federal courts
where they have won a string of legal victories, including
injunctions that at one point tied up almost half the timber sales
planned in the federal forests this year.
   The legislation would bar federal courts from enjoining or
overturning any timber sales planned in the federal forests of the
Northwest over the next 11 months known to contain spotted owls.
   In addition, the legislation would require that environmentalists
release more than half of the timber currently enjoined from sale.
   If the environmentalists do not agree to release the timber, the
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management would be allowed to
proceed with the sales despite the injunctions.
   The legislation would also allow for the sale of 10 billion board
feet of timber through the end of fiscal 1990 and the protection of
blocks of ``significant'' stands of old growth through a policy
known as ``minimum fragmentation.''
   The entire Northwest congressional delegation supports the
legislation, but there is formidable opposition elsewhere.

<HEAD>Military Says 20 Rebels Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Army troops and rebels clashed in a
southern town, and 20 rebels and one soldier were killed, the
military reported Sunday.
   Also Sunday, a rebel leader claimed opponents of American bases
in the Philippines are targets of an assassination plot hatched by
supporters of President Corazon Aquino and the U.S. government.
   Army headquarters in Manila said soldiers and civilian militiamen
were on patrol when they encountered more than 100 New People's Army
rebels in Tulunan town in North Cotabato, 600 miles southeast of the
capital.
   The soldiers, backed by artillery fire and air strikes, battled
the rebels for three hours, the report said. A soldier and at least
20 rebels were killed in the firefight, it said. It did not say when
the battle was fought.
   Rebels have been fighting for 20 years to install a Marxist
government.
   Rebel leader Antonio Zumel, spokesman of the communist National
Democratic Front, claimed an alleged assassination plot would be put
into action before the start of official talks between the
Philippine and U.S. governments on the future of American military
facilities in the Philippines.
   ``The plot involves the neutralization and, even worse, the
assassination of leading personalities from the NDF and the legal
movement who are opposed to the U.S. bases,'' Zumel said in a
statement.
   ``The elimination of certain key cadres of the CPP's (Communist
Party of the Philippines) National Urban Commission and United Front
Commission will then be blamed on the so-called warring factions
within the CPP and NDF,'' he added.
   No comment was available from the presidential office and U.S.
Embassy, which are closed on Sundays.
   Several groups, including the communist underground, have pressed
for the dismantling of six U.S. facilities, which they view as an
infringement on Philippine sovereignty.
   The future of the bases is to be a major topic during Mrs.
Aquino's visit to the United States in November. The bases' lease
expires in 1991, and any extension must be approved by two-thirds of
the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the facilities is strong.

   A spectacular four-alarm blaze destroyed an old
lumber yard building near the waterfront, shooting flames 60 feet in
the air that were visible from some areas across Puget Sound.
   One firefighter died and two others were treated for heat
exhaustion.
   There was no immediate determination of cause or estimate of
damage in the intense, smoky fire that destroyed the former
Blackstock Lumber Co. building late Saturday.
   But Fire Chief Claude Harris noted that the building had been
vacant about a month and said the fire was ``suspicious in nature.''
He said vagrants had set fires in nearby buildings but added that
more investigation was needed to determine if the blaze had been set.
   The body of a 32-year-old lieutenant, a veteran of nine years on
the force, was found beneath debris early Sunday, nearly an hour
after he was reported missing, said Fire Lt. Preston Bhang.
   The cause of death was not immediately determined. The man had
been wearing ``all of his protective gear ... and breathing
equipment,'' Bhang said.
   Two other firefighters were taken to Harborview Medical Center
for treatment of heat exhaustion, Bhang said.

<HEAD>Weather Service Speeding Up Delivery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Weather Service is hoping to
deliver a blizzard of weather news to clients with completion of its
new satellite-based weather-wire later this year.
   The system that channels weather data and forecasts to news media
and others across the nation is being speeded up by several hundred
percent, reports Michael Sikorski of the weather service.
   Indeed, the satellite service is already running in many areas,
although Sikorski admitted some stumbles have occurred in making the
changeover from the slow-speed service first established in the
1960s.
   Little known to the public, the weather wire allows the National
Weather Service to send information directly to about 1,500
newspapers, news services, radio and television stations and public
safety agencies across the country.
   But the Teletype network's relatively low speed of about seven
letters per second results in a cluttered wire with the increasing
amounts of data being collected and reported.
   In addition, the rising price of telephone lines had cost agency
nearly half its clients in recent years, officials said.
   The new satellite system should reduce the cost to $100-$115 a
month per client, Sikorski said, cutting the price of the service to
as much as one-third of the past level for many subscribers by
replacing the telephone lines with small satellite dishes.
   It also allows faster movement of data, with the report speeding
up to print about 480 letters per second.
   Satellite service is already available across the 48 contiguous
states and is now being extended to Alaska and Hawaii, said Sikorski.
   Problems have occurred in some areas, he confirmed, because of
delays in delivery of satellite receiving equipment to subscribers.
   In Oklahoma, for example, a contract for wire-delivery of the
service expired in July, before all subscribers had satellite dishes
installed, Sikorski said. He said service should be restored within
two weeks to affected subscribers in that state.
   In addition, said Sikorski, the new system's high speed will
allow subscribers access to weather data from across the nation. The
older wire provided data for the state and area of a subscriber, but
not the national detail that will now be available.
   In general each state has one forecast office responsible for
issuing reports and warnings and developing forecasts for that
state, he said. That information is then sent to a satellite, and
comes back down to clients subscribing to the service.
   Subscribers will have a terminal allowing them to read all of the
state and national reports, or to code out the ones they do not
want, explained Sikorski. Thus, he said, each subscriber will select
its own service.
   Contel ASC of McLean, Va., is the contractor operating the new
system for the weather service, which is part of the Commerce
Department. Contel's contract to operate the wire is valued at $12
million over a decade.
   The weather service offices will continue to have a separate
satellite data system for internal service within the agency. That
is known as AFOS, which stands for Automated Field Operations and
Services.
   Before establishment of the weather wire a quarter-century or so
ago the weather service distributed its information on local
telegraphic systems in metropolitan areas, or simply via telephone
or telegraph to interested persons and news media.
   It also provides information directly to the public via NOAA
Weather Radio, a network of low-power radio stations blanketing most
of the nation that deliver local forecasts and warnings to listeners
with special radio receivers.

   The Colombian government will extradite
three more reputed cocaine traffickers wanted in the United States
on charges of money- laundering and drug smuggling, an official said
Sunday.
   The announcement came after a weekend of army raids on ranches
believed owned by the country's top two drug barons. Soldiers seized
property including cattle, tropical birds and swimming pools, the
army and the El Espectador daily said.
   In Medellin, the nation's second-largest city, a series of
attacks linked to drug cartels continued. A bomb damaged a liquor
factory, hooded assailants set a city garbage truck on fire, and
police defused a bomb at a branch of a government-run savings bank.
No injuries were reported.
   In western Colombia, assailants killed a foreman and set fire to
the ranch of a government official who wanted the confiscated rural
property of drug traffickers distributed to peasants.
   A National Drug Council official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press the government has signed
extradition orders for three imprisoned Colombians.
   The three were identified as Ana Helena Rodriguez, 37, jailed in
Bogota and accused of drug trafficking; Bernardo Londono Quintana,
47, jailed in Bogota for allegedly laundering money; and Alberto
Orlandez Gamboa, 37, jailed in Medellin, also for alleged laundering.
   It was not known if the three were notified. Once notified, they
have five days to appeal the extradition order.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, charged with laundering millions of
dollars of cocaine money for the Medellin Cartel, was extradited to
the United States last week after losing his appeal.
   An army officer in Medellin, asking not to be identified for
security reasons, said the properties seized over the weekend are
believed to belong to two of the most wanted drug bosses: Pablo
Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. They are believed to be the No.
1 and No. 2 men in the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   ``We are going to keep the seizures up,'' the army officer said.
   Last month, after assassins working for the traffickers killed
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading presidential candidate and an
outspoken foe of drug cartels, President Virgilio Barco assumed
emergency powers and ordered seizures of bank accounts and property
thought to be tied to the drug trade.
   Since then, the army and police have made public numerous
confiscated documents showing the purported multimillion-dollar,
multinational holdings of Colombia's most notorious drug barons, all
currently in hiding.
   Colombia supplies about 80 percent of the cocaine reaching the
United States.
   Drug terrorists have retaliated with incessant attacks on
property belonging to the government and the Colombian
establishment, especially in Medellin, where their cartel is based.
   The Supreme Court is stil debating whether Barco's emergency
powers are constitutional. If they decide they are not, the
government might have to return confiscated property.
   Soldiers who raided a ranch Saturday in Puerto Boyaca, 95 miles
north of Bogota in the notorious Magdalena Medio cocaine-lab zone,
found fenceposts marked GRG, presumably for Rodriguez Gacha, El
Espectador said.
   The main ranch house contained walls of Italian marble, the
report said.
   Colombia has offered a reward of $250,000 for information leading
to the arrest of Escobar or Rodriguez Gacha, who also head the
United States' list of Colombians wanted for extradition on
drug-trafficking charges.
   Soldiers also raided a nearby ranch they believe may have been
used for paramilitary training for the Medellin cartel's ``hit
squads.''
   At the ranch, registered under the name of Henry Perez, the army
found a cockfighting ring with electric clocks and betting
paraphernalia and a corral for raising the fighting birds, El
Espectador said.
   The paper said the 14th Brigade's list of property confiscated in
the Magdalena Medio, including ranches registered to Escobar and
Rodriguez Gacha, included 600 head of cattle, 200 exotic tropical
birds, 80 fighting cocks, Olympic-size swimming pools, show horses,
pedigreed dogs, electronic alarm systems and a ``GRG'' branding iron.
   On Saturday, the Colombian press told of army raids in Pacho, a
town in a cocaine lab zone northeast of Bogota, that netted 49
vehicles, including two bulletproof Mercedes Benz sedans that
allegedly belonged to Rodriguez Gacha.
   The army also reportedly found a computer floppy disk showing
Rodriguez Gacha owned 374 radio-equipped cars, trucks and vans worth
millions of dollars.
   Last week, Barco's administration, using the anti-narcotics
emergency powers, removed the elected mayors of Puerto Boyaca and
Pacho and replaced them with military officers. But he reversed
himself soon afterward when Colombian lawmakers complained his
action was unconstitutional.

   Mourners on Sunday buried
victims of election violence near Cape Town, and activists prepared
a mass march to protest alleged police shootings and reported deaths
of 29 civilians.
   Regional Police Commissioner Phillipus Fourie was quoted Sunday
as saying he will lead his officers to stop the march planned for
Sept. 17, and an anti-apartheid clergyman said he expects police
will use violence to disperse demonstrators.
   ``It will be solid evidence of what they have done on (election)
night. Because if they would do this in the light of day ... then
God knows how they behave in the dead of night in our townships when
there is nobody to protect our people,'' said Rev. Allan Boesak,
leader of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Evette Otto, a teen-ager who was five months pregnant when she
was killed Wednesday in Kalksteenfontein township, was buried Sunday
in her home town of West Riebeeck, 180 miles northwest of Cape Town.
Her mother told a news conference Friday that Evette, 16, was
standing on the street talking to friends when a uniformed officer
shot her through the chest.
   Funerals of those killed in the violence, which began during
general elections Wednesday, are scheduled throughout the week.
Activists have asked the nation to wear black armbands and light
candles for an hour a night.
   Marchers want to protest the deaths of 29 people activists say
were killed in election violence, most by police. Activists said 200
people were hurt when white riot squad officers marched through
townships, shooting and whipping bystanders as well as
stone-throwers. Those throwing stones were protesting the elections,
which exclude South Africa's 28 million black majority.
   Police say only 15 people were killed and have not acknowledged
responsibility for any deaths.
   Cape Town doctors on Friday reported treating children as young
as 4 years old for gunshot wounds. Attorney General Essa Moosa on
Friday said 29 people were killed, including a 12-year-old boy. An
ambulanceman has reported taking the body of a 6-year-old girl to a
mortuary.
   Police have reported using pistol fire, birdshot, buckshot,
rubber bullets and tear gas. They reported a handful of injuries,
none of them children.
   Boesak said the issue of the killings unfortunately has turned
into ``a numbers game'' since Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
called Boesak and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu liars for their
death toll reports. The clergymen have called for Vlok to be fired.
   Zach de Beer, a leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
was quoted Sunday as saying, ``It is clear we are dealing with human
tragedy of a major scale. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that
the dismissal of Mr. Vlok would be a gesture of value at a time like
this.''
   Cape Town Mayor Gordon Oliver said Sunday he will help lead the
mass march to start from St. George's Cathedral, Tutu's church in
Cape Town.
   Oliver, sworn in as mayor Friday, said he told the police
commissioner that ``he did not seem to be aware of what his men were
doing _ the fact that they assaulted people with glee and obvious
enjoyment.''
   Fourie was quoted by the Sunday Star of Johannesburg as saying he
would lead his officers in stopping the march. It is illegal to
march within 200 yards of Parliament, and St. George's Cathedral is
just a block away from the building.

   A girl who saved a tourist from drowning in
Hawaii and a California youth who disarmed a fellow student holding
70 people hostage will receive the 1988 Young American Medals for
Bravery, the Justice Department said Sunday.
   Angela Marie Campanoli, now 12, dove into rough waters near her
home in Maui last Oct. 5 to save a Japanese woman who was being
swept out to sea. She held the woman's head above water until help
arrived, the department said.
   Ruben Ortega, 19, of Alhambra, Calif., disarmed a student who
brought an assault rifle into an English class at San Gabriel High
School on April 26, 1988 and held 70 students hostage for a half
hour.
   Ruben, who was one of the hostages, risked his life by grabbing
the rifle and the gunman, wrestling him to the ground.
   The youth and other students held the gunmen to the ground until
police arrived.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said that the two youths would
be given the awards by President Bush at a date to be announced
later by the White House.
   Thornburgh said an 18-year-old Boston high school senior who
warned fellow students of the dangers of drugs and AIDS and a
17-year-old New Jersey youth who worked with disabled Boy Scouts
will be given the 1988 Young American Medals for Service.
   Freddy Torres, 18, of Boston, will be cited for his work urging
young people to avoid drugs warning them of the dangers of AIDS.
   John Philip Donovan, 18, of River Vale, N.J., was junior
assistant scout master for a Boy Scout troop with learning and
physically disabled scouts. He also was the only youth member of a
local civic-pride organization and raised $6,500 for a Muscular
Dystrophy fund-raiser.
   The recipients of the awards, who are chosen for acts of bravery
or service during the previous year, were selected by FBI Director
William Sessions, Drug Enforcement Administration head John C. Lawn,
Stanley E. Morris, director of the U.S. Marshals Service and David
Runkel, Thornburgh's press secretary.
   The awards were begun in 1950 under an act of Congress that
requires the president to personally present them to the recipients.

<HEAD>Search Continues for Victims of Air Crash, Cause of Disaster</HEAD>

   Aviation authorities Sunday prepared
an underwater salvage operation to hoist a Norwegian charter plane
that crashed off Denmark's west coast, killing all 55 people aboard.
   Experts said metal fatigue in the aging aircraft was a likely
cause of the Scandinavia's worst air disaster.
   The twin-engine Convair turboprop plane was en route from Oslo,
Norway, to Hamburg, West Germany when it plunged into the North Sea
18 miles from the Danish fishing port of Hirtshals on Friday. Most
passengers were Norwegian employees of a shipping line who had won a
company lottery to attend a ship christening in West Germany.
   Later Friday, 31 bodies were pulled from the sea.
   A Norwegian-Danish joint commission took over the search for
wreckage and missing victims Sunday, a duty officer at the Karup
Airbase rescue center said.
   It sent a Norwegian salvage vessel that was expected to reach the
crash site late Sunday.
   Aided by mini-subs, sonar and underwater cameras, aviation
officials hope to locate and raise the plane's fuselage, wings and
engines and find the remaining 24 victims. During the weekend,
trawlers retrieved scattered debris from the plane, including
personal belongings of the passengers.
   Officials in Denmark and Norway dismissed media speculation that
sabotage or accidental weapons fire from naval vessels downed the
plane.
   Danish navy Rear Adm. Hans Garde said on Denmark's public
television that none of the NATO vessels taking part in a big sea
exercise in the area at the time of the crash had fired guns or
missiles.
   Tommy Jensen of the Denmark's air disaster commission said, ``So
far, there is nothing on the bodies or wreckage indicating the crash
was caused by an explosion.''
   Rolf Grimsrud of Norway's Civil Aviation Board said parts o the
plane might have ripped away when cabin pressure dropped to zero at
cruising altitute. He said metal fatigue may be to blame, he said.
   Partnair, the Norwegian charter company which owns the plane,
announced it was grounding its two remaining Convair CV-580s.
   Steinar Skauen, Partnair's technical chief, said the Convair
underwent a complete overhaul in May 1986 by the Kelona Frightcraft
company in British Columbia, Canada. He said Kelona technicians had
checked out the plane only a week before the disaster.
   The U.S. manufacturer, General Dynamics, made the CV-580 model in
1960 by adding two turboprop engines to the Convair CV-340.

<HEAD>Poet Named To Head Ukrainian Grass-roots Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ukrainian poet and political activist Ivan Drach
was elected Sunday to lead a new grass-roots group fighting for
greater sovereignty for the Soviet republic, a spokesman for a human
rights group said.
   Anatoly Dotsenko, a spokesman in Moscow for the Ukrainian
Helsinki Group that monitors human rights, said Sergei I. Konev, a
parliament member, was chosen as a deputy to Drach.
   The group, initially called the Ukrainian Popular Movement for
Perestroika, was renamed ``Rukh,'' Ukrainian for movement, on the
final day of a three-day meeting held in the republic's capital,
Kiev.
   Drach, a well-known activist in the Ukraine, failed to win a seat
in the the Congress of People's Deputies in spring elections.
   On Saturday, Konev and another speaker at the meeting called for
the removal of conservative Politburo member and Ukrainian Communist
Party chief Vladimir Shcherbitsky.
   Konev called on the grass-roots group ``to express its lack of
confidence in the government of the Ukraine headed by
Shcherbitsky,'' Dotsenko said.
   Shcherbitsky, 71, is the oldest of 12 men on the policy-making
Politburo and is considered one of the most conservative.
   Some Ukrainians blame him for covering up the radiation damage
from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, for restraining the
local press and for arrests and harrassment of dissidents.
Thirty-one people died and hundreds were hospitalized in the
Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986.
   Other speakers Saturday called for creation of a sovereign, free
Ukraine with a multiparty system.
   State television showed the meeting hall decorated with the
blue-and-yellow flags of the independent Ukraine. A Ukrainian
People's Republic was declared following the 1917 Russian
Revolution, but was overthrown the next year.

   Mother Teresa's condition improved Sunday
after the Nobel laureate received a pacemaker to steady her
heartbeat and heavy doses of antibiotics to fight a fever, doctors
said.
   A statement issued by Woodlands Nursing Home said the 79-year-old
Roman Catholic nun known for her work with the poor was ``bright and
cheerful, had eaten with a good appetite and had a comfortable sleep
(Sunday) afternoon.''
   K.P. Mukherjee, the secretary of Woodlands Nursing Home, said
Mother Teresa still is in intensive care but ``responded well to the
treatment'' after a temporary pacemaker was fitted late Saturday.
   ``Her condition has improved further and she does not have
pneumonia,'' Mukherjee said. Earlier Sunday, a hospital source said
doctors feared Mother Teresa might be developing pneumonia.
   The hospital statement said Mother Teresa's blood platelet count
dropped Saturday, causing some anxiety among doctors, but was normal
by Sunday evening. Platelets are disc-shaped constituents of blood
that help it to clot.
   Pope John Paul II gave Mother Teresa a special blessing and sent
her a telegram with ``assurances of his prayers and spiritual
participation'' in her suffering, the Vatican said Sunday.
   Mother Teresa's longtime cardiologist in Rome, Dr. Vincenzo
Bilotta, is expected to arrive in Calcutta Monday, said Sister
Shanti of the Missionaries of Charity.
   Mother Teresa has suffered similar ailments in the past, due in
part to her refusal to rest, Bilotta said.
   Press Trust of India reported that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
also plans to visit Mother Teresa on Monday.
   Her order of 3,000 nuns, devoted to the destitute and dying, on
Sunday observed what they call ``Inspiration Day,'' the anniversary
of the day in 1948 that Mother Teresa was inspired to set up her
Missionaries of Charity, Sister Shanti said. The order, recognized
by the Vatican in 1965, now has nuns working in 87 countries.
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her good
works, became ill Sept. 3.
   She was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit last
Tuesday with a high fever and irregular heartbeat. She suffered a
heart attack Friday.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa received several honors for her
work with the poor in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, including
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian award,
from President Reagan in 1985.
   Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable life as a convent teacher to
live and work among Calcutta's poor.
   Despite heart problems and failing eyesight in recent years, she
traveled widely and vigorously spoke out against abortion.

   The parliament of Iran on Sunday condemned
nearly 190 U.S. congressmen for endorsing Iranian resistance groups
and declared their moves will unleash unspecified ``consequences.''
   Official Tehran radio quoted Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi as
saying that ``U.S. leaders will take the wish of overthrowing the
Islamic Republic to their graves.''
   The U.S. lawmakers requested that the United States support
Iranian resistance groups.
   In a vitriolic speech to the parliament, or Majlis, Karrubi
described the statement as ``stupid.'' He said it demonstrated the
``failure to realize the depth and dignity of the Islamic
revolution,'' the radio reported.
   The U.S. congressmen's proposal was also condemned by the entire
270-member Majlis, which released a statement telling the U.S.
leadership that ``the responsibility for the consequences of such
acts lie with the signatories to this letter,'' said the report
report, which was monitored in Cyprus.
   In their letter addressed to Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, 121 Democrats and 65 Republicans last week warned the Bush
administration against ``continuing to speculate and hope for the
miraculous emergence of moderates from within the present ruling
clique'' in Iran.
   Instead, the Congressmen asked the administration to work with
its allies to impose an arms and economic boycott on Iran and to
actively support Iranian resistance groups.
   The request came after Bush adopted a conciliatory tone toward
the new Iranian government that took power in Iran following the
June death of supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Bush has sent messages to newly elected President Hashemi
Rafsanjani saying Iran could end its international isolation by
releasing the eight U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian militants in
Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani met Sunday with a delegation of Hezbollah, or Party of
God, the pro-Iranian umbrella group for Lebanese Shiite Moslem
factions believed to hold the Americans and eight other Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said
Rafsanjani ``reiterated Iran's support for the Moslem people of
Lebanon, especially Hezbollah.''
   However, there were no details about the meeting.
   Rafsanjani, 55, is seen as the leader of a pragmatic camp within
the Iranian leadership, whose first priority is to rebuild Iran's
economy, devastated in its eight-year war with Iraq. Both side
agreed to a cease-fire last year.

   Cold air pushed across the Rockies onto the Plains on Sunday,
keeping daytime temperatures as low as the 30s and spreading snow
and rain, and thunderstorms were scattered across parts of the East.
   The unseasonably cool weather was caused by a large high pressure
area centered over central Alberta.
   Billings, Mont., had a record low of 33, and both Boise, Idaho,
and Yakima, Wash., tied their records of 36.
   Early afternoon temperatures were only in the 30s and 40s Sunday
over the northern Rockies and northern high Plains.
   The cold air along with an upper air disturbance over southern
Saskatchewan produced low clouds and light rain across the northern
Plains and Nebraska.
   Snow fell across sections of Montana, with 3 inches overnight at
Fairfield and an inch at Lewiston.
   From 3 to 6 inches of snow was expected to accumulate during the
night over the Big Horn Mountains west of Sheridan, Wyo.
   By contrast, hot, humid weather covered much of the Atlantic
Coast states and the Southeast with temperatures in the 90s into New
England. Burlington, Vt., tied its record at 90 degrees.
   Thunderstorms with locally heavy rain were scattered over central
and southeast Texas. Mexia got 3.91 inches of rain Sunday morning.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered ahead of a cold front from the
lower Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee Valley and the central
Appalachians to western New York state. Leland, Miss., received 3.31
inches of rain during the morning.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Cody, Wyo., to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif. Sunday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 23 at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from northern New England across the middle Atlantic Coast and much
of the Appalachians into the Tennessee Valley. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast from the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley to the central Plains and Oklahoma into Colorado.
Showers were forecast from the upper Mississippi Valley across the
northern Plains into Wyoming. Snow was forecast over the mountains
of Wyoming and the Black Hills of South Dakota. Scattered
thunderstorms were forecast over Florida.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted over northern Wyoming and western
South Dakota; in the 50s and 60s from Idaho across the central
Rockies, much of the northern and central Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes; in the 90s from the
southern Atlantic Coast and Florida across the Gulf Coast region
into southern and eastern Texas, as well as over interior valleys of
California; between 100 and 110 over the desert Southwest; and in
the 70s and 80s across much of the rest of the nation.

   Syrians and their allies attacked three
gateways into the besieged Christian region north of Beirut Sunday,
and Christian Gen. Michel Aoun charged the United States is allowing
Syria to annex Lebanon.
   Police said four people were killed and 17 wounded in overnight
artillery duels and daytime battles on Beirut's dividing Green Line
and the mountain towns of Souk el-Gharb and Ein el-Tuffaha.
   That raised the casualty toll since the current round of
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war erupted March 8 to at least 837
killed and 2,491 wounded.
   Along the Lebanese border, the Israeli army commanders reported
Arab guerrillas shot and fatally wounded an Israeli soldier in an
overnight clash that also left one of the attackers dead.
   George Habash's Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility for the attack, saying Israeli
troops ``suffered heavy casualties'' but giving no figures.
   Police said Syrian guns opened up before dawn on ships trying to
run a six-month blockade of the Christian enclave, apparently
suspecting the vessels were carring arms and supplies from Iraq,
Aoun's main backer and Syria's Arab arch-rival.
   Aoun's gunners responded with 155mm howitzer barrages against
Syrian artillery batteries along the seaside Ein Mreisseh boulevard
in Moslem west Beirut.
   Syrian and Christian forces traded tank and gunfire at Souk
el-Gharb and Ein el-Tuffaha in the central mountains all day, police
reported.
   The two abandoned summer resorts have key road junctions leading
to the Christian region from the central mountains.
   Police said Syrian artillery and rocket batteries in hills above
Ein el-Tuffaha were pounding the nearby town of Bekfaya Sunday night
at a rate of 10 shells a minute.
   In Beirut, the Syrians and Christians clashed in running gun
battles behind heavy artillery barrages across the main crossing
point between the Christian enclave and Moslem west Beirut.
   Police said several buildings were ablaze as the thunder of
exploding shells resounded across the city. Radio stations urged the
remaining population to seek refuge in basements and bomb shelters.
   More than 1.3 million of Beirut's 1.5 million population have
fled the capital to safer areas because of the fighting.
   Beirut newspapers quoted Aoun as saying that President Bush's
administration is doing nothing to curb Syria's actions in Lebanon.
   ``America practices the policy of bowing to Syria's influence in
Lebanon ... and is giving Syria the opportunity to annex Lebanon,''
Aoun declared. ``We ask the United States not to support Syria's
occupation of Lebanon.''
   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general has vowed to chase out
of Lebanon the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in mainly Moslem
sectors since a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun says
Syria has betrayed the mandate by siding with the Moslems against
Christians in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Aoun repeatedly has accused the Americans of selling out to
Syria. Christian leaders charge Washington is afraid any action
against Syria could harm eight Americans held hostage by
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem groups.
   Syria is Iran's main ally and has pledged to help free the
Americans, who are among 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   Aoun was quoted as saying: ``America does not have enough courage
to confront terrorism.
   ``It's certain that Americans will become the target for
increased attacks all over the world because the American government
is making concessions to the terrorists.''
   Aoun described the U.S. Embassy in Christian east Beirut as an
``espionage network,'' but offered to guarantee the security of the
30 diplomats evacuated from the fortified embassy compound Wednesday.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler blamed the
evacuation on Aoun's reported threats to take 20 Americans hostage.
   Aoun has denied the allegations and called on Washington to send
back its diplomats. It is the first time the Americans have closed
their Beirut embassy since the civil war erupted.
   The clash on the border with Israel is the third in 10 days
pitting guerrillas from Lebanon against Israeli forces or their
Lebanese Christian militia allies.
   Israel radio said the firefight involved its elite Givati Brigade
and occurred a mile inside Lebanon near the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria and annexed.
   Israeli Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled said the guerrillas were laying
explosives when they were spotted by a routine patrol. The
guerrillas then opened fire, he said.
   But a military communique said troops ``spotted a terrorist
squad'' in the mountainous area shortly after nightfall and promptly
opened fire.

<TEXT>
   A former nurse's aide is slated to go
on trial Monday on charges she suffocated five female nursing home
patients in a bizarre pact with her lesbian lover.
   Gwendolyn Graham, 25, is charged with five counts of murder and
one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths at the Alpine
Manor Nursing Home in Walker, a Grand Rapids suburb, during the
first half of 1987.
   The defense argues that no killings ever occurred.
   The trial before Kent County Chief Circuit Judge Roman Snow was
to begin with jury selection. However, both the prosecution and
defense are seeking a change in the location of the trial because of
late publicity about the case.
   On Thursday, Graham's alleged accomplice and former live-in
companion, former nurse's aide Catherine Wood, pleaded guilty to one
count each of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Two counts of first-degree murder against Wood were dropped in
exchange for her testimony against Graham.
   Wood, 27, who could be sentenced to life in prison, said during
the hearing that she and Graham discussed killing up to 20 patients
during their overnight shifts at the nursing home.
   Wood testified in April that Graham chose victims whose poor
physical condition would leave no signs of a struggle, and that
Graham used a washcloth to suffocate them.
   The Grand Rapids woman said Graham told her killing the patients
helped her relieve tension. Wood said she agreed to go along with
the slayings, sometimes acting as a lookout, because she it would
bind them as lovers.
   ``She was always happy when one of them died,'' Wood testified,
adding that Graham tried or plotted to kill at least five other
patients, but was foiled when some fought back.
   Wood said Graham took a souvenir from each victim _ including
earrings and handkerchiefs _ and that the two had planned to spell
M-U-R-D-E-R with the victims' initials. The plan failed because some
targeted victims struggled too much, she testified. She said the
souvenirs apparently were thrown away.
   Graham's attorney, James Piazza, said he believes Wood is a
pathological liar and made up the story to get even with Graham for
leaving her for another woman. Graham left Michigan for her hometown
of Tyler, Texas, after the two split up in July 1987.
   Police began investigating late last year after Wood's ex-husband
told them she had confessed.
   The deaths of the five patients 60 to 97 years old between Jan.
18 and April 7, 1987, were originally listed as natural, and no
autopsies were performed.
   Three of the alleged victims were cremated. The two other bodies
were exhumed, but autopsies revealed no evidence of suffocation.

<HEAD>Bodies Of Three Kidnapped Students and Professor Found</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of a university professor who
led a teachers' strike and three kidnapped students were found
Sunday in a canyon near San Carlos University, police reported.
   They said an anonymous telephone caller told authorities where
the bodies could be found. Notes attached to the bodies referred to
the destruction of the leadership of the student organization to
which the victims belonged.
   The victims, all of whom had been kidnapped within the past three
weeks, were identified as professor Carlos Humberto Cabrera Rivera,
48, who was abducted Saturday; Carlos Chuta Camey, a 35-year-old law
student kidnapped Friday, and Victor Rodriguez Jaramilla, 38, a
political science student, and his wife, 33-year-old psychology
student Silvia Maria Azurdia de Rodriguez, abducted Aug. 23.
   Police said all had been shot repeatedly.
   No individual or group has asserted responsibility for the
kidnappings and slayings, and police said they have no suspects.
   The government has accused right-wing extremists of carrying out
a number of bombings in recent weeks.
   Cabrera Rivera was the president of a teacher's union that went
on strike for 81 days demanding more money. The government refused
their demands and the teachers returned to work Aug. 21 without
winning a pay increase.
   Unsigned notes found with each of the four bodies said: ``Today
with the decomposition of the AEU (a university student
organization) leadership, we are obligated to take radical measures
against all those leaders who have lined their pockets with our
money and handed over our group to extreme sectors connected to
repression. ... We will search for others who have falsified and
produced a roadblock in the rehabilitation of the student movement.''
   The three slain students, all from San Carlos University, were
active in the student organization.
   Five other San Carlos University students have disappeared in
recent weeks and it is believed they also were kidnapped.
   Two bombs exploded Saturday night in Guatemala City but there
were no casualties, according to police.
   They said one bomb damaged 13 shops in the commercial Santa
Calara II area in the southern part of the capital. The second bomb
was thrown at the Hotel Camino Real and exploded harmlessly on the
front lawn.
   The explosions brought to 28 the number of bombings in Guatemala
City since July 19. The bombs have killed two people and wounded 20.
   No organization has claimed responsibility for the attacks and
conservative political leaders have denied government claims that
the bombing were carried out by right-wing militants.

<HEAD>Polish Cabinet Nominees Questioned on Economic Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Finance Ministry nominee said Sunday
the economy can improve despite soaring inflation and a demoralized
workers. He spoke after lawmakers grilled candidates for the Soviet
bloc's first Cabinet not led by communists.
   A parliamentary committee confirmed economist Leszek Balcerowicz
in the combined post of deputy prime minister and finance minister,
after he outlined a plan to revise tax, wage and trade policies.
   Asked later on national television whether Poles could expect to
live better under the new Solidarity-led government, Balcerowicz
replied, ``There is a real chance.''
   He said, however,``Our economic point of departure is extremely
difficult. Therefore, I feel that no responsible person should be
going around making easy promises.''
   The Labor Ministry nominee, Jacek Kuron, also was approved in a
daylong session of the welfare committee, but Andrzej Kosiniak, the
Peasant Party candidate for the Health Ministry, was rejected.
   Two other nominees for farm policy and rural affairs ministries
failed to win approval during a first day of hearings on Friday.
   But the committee's opinion is not binding. The Sejm, the
powerful lower house of parliament, makes the final decision.
   Hearings on nominees for the Foreign Trade Ministry and chairman
of the national bank were scheduled for Monday, television news said.
   The Cabinet proposed by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the
East bloc's first non-communist leader in more than four decades,
gives half of the 24 council seats to Solidarity.
   The communists have just four, although the party keeps the
strategic ministries of defense and the interior.
   The remaining seats are distributed among the Peasants and the
Democratic Party, which helped put Mazowiecki _ a top aide to
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa _ in office by breaking their
traditional alliance with the Communists.
   Parliament is to vote on the new government Tuesday, when
Mazowiecki is expected to outline his government's program.
   The Solidarity government faces triple-digit inflation, a $39
billion debt, and workers demoralized by long lines and poor quality
goods.
   The economic program outlined by Balcerowicz calls for
restructuring the tax system, implementing wage controls,
liberalizing foreign trade rules, and unifying the exchange rates.
   Balcerowicz told the parliamentary committee he left the
Communist Party after the military crackdown on the Solidarity trade
union in December 1981. He said he now belongs to the Warsaw chapter
of the Solidarity Citizens Committee.
   Solidarity was legalized after an April agreement with the
government, and won a sweeping victory in June parliamentary
elections, taking 161 seats in the 460-seat Sejm and 99 seats in the
new 100-seat Senate.
   Kuron, a veteran opposition activist, told the committee wages
should be set by the market, but that a minimum wage should be set
to protect workers. He said, however, the first task of the new
government was to stop inflation, which is thought to have reached
40 percent in August alone.
   He said the transition to a market economy and measures to
control inflation could lead to a drop in purchasing power, but that
the government would not abandon the disadvantaged.
   Economic journalist Aleksander Paszynski, the Solidarity
candidate for the building ministry, was approved by the local
government committee.

<HEAD>State Spied on Civil Rights Worker Before His Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three civil rights workers killed in
1964 was spied on three months before his death by a state
commission formed to maintain segregation, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission in March 1964 received a
report on the activities of Michael Schwerner and his wife, Rita, in
Meridian, said The Clarion-Ledger, which obtained commission
documents.
   The commission circulated a description and the license number of
a vehicle used by the Schwerners and other Congress of Racial
Equality workers, the newspaper said.
   Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney were killed June 21,
1964, near Philadelphia, Miss. Their deaths and the subsquent
federal investigation were the basis for the film ``Mississippi
Burning.''
   The three, who were reported missing, were found buried in an
earthen dam on Aug. 4, 1964.
   The state never prosecuted the case, but a federal court
convicted seven Ku Klux Klan members of conspiring to deprive the
three of their civil rights. Another Klan member pleaded guilty,
eight were acquitted and the cases against three ended in a
mistrial. Most of the 19 men prosecuted are alive.
   State Attorney General Mike Moore has asked the FBI to help him
research the case to determine whether to bring state charges now.
   Schwerner's widow, Seattle attorney Rita Schwerner Bender, said
she was unaware of the surveillance. ``I didn't know they were
spying on me,'' she said.
   ``There was clearly a governmental investigation in an effort to
discredit the civil rights workers and participation in the
movement,'' Bender said. ``Now it would appear that there was
organized Mississippi state governmental misconduct.''
   The surveillance may have encouraged the slayings, University of
Mississippi history professor David Sansing said in Oxford.
   ``Those murders could have been prevented,'' Sansing said.
``Instead of being prevented, the power structure was in a way
encouraging them by this surveillance.
   ``They may not have said, `Go kill them,' but they sure made it
easy,'' he said.
   Former commission Director Erle Johnston of Forest said the
agency spied on the Schwerners but denied it had any connection with
the slayings.
   ``We had no knowledge of what happened,'' Johnston said. ``We
didn't have any involvement.
   ``The role of the commission in the murders was just making
reports,'' he said. ``We had no part in the arrests or prosecution.
We put down what we saw.''
   The commission was created by the 1956 Legislature to help
preserve segregation. It went out of business in 1973 after Gov.
Bill Waller vetoed funding.
   The main body of the commission's records remains sealed in a
state Department of Archives and History vault in Jackson on orders
of the 1977 Legislature. U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr.
ruled July 27 that those records should be made public, but they
remain sealed pending appeals.

   A missing 5-year-old girl spent the
night in a locked school bus after she apparently got on the wrong
bus and didn't know when to get off.
   Kathy Chao was tired and hungry, but otherwise unharmed, when
found Saturday, 22 hours after she disappeared, according to police
Detective Joe Sledge.
   Kathy, who speaks Laotian and very little English, told her
parents she sat far in back of the bus and waited for the driver to
call her name. But he never did.
   ``She said she looked everywhere for her bus stop, but she didn't
see it,'' said her father, Kao Nai Saechao. ``She said she was
afraid to get off.''
   The girl was found by two men who heard her crying inside a
fenced bus yard after she jumped off the bus through a rear
emergency door, said one of the men, contractor Chris Neary.
   Kathy's family celebrated her return Saturday with a Taoist
religious feast.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Sexual Attacker For $5.86 Million in Lottery Winnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman is suing the man convicted of
sexually attacking her, demanding the $5.86 million he won last year
in the California Lottery.
   Raymond Wilson, 20, a fast-food worker from Los Angeles, has
admitted he attacked Becky Rasnick, 28, while she jogged near her
home on Jan. 21. Police arrested him at his Santa Monica apartment
on Feb. 10.
   Wilson pleaded guilty to attempted rape on June 12, but insists
he never meant to rape or harm Mrs. Rasnick. On Aug. 10, Ventura
Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath sentenced him to five years'
probation, although the prosecutor had asked for up to six years in
prison.
   McGrath ordered Wilson to get therapy as a condition of
probation, to register with the state as a sex offender and to serve
one year in jail.
   Mrs. Rasnick and her husband, Ben, were outraged by the short
sentence, especially after Wilson used the proceeds from the lottery
he won last Oct. 12 to hire an expensive defense attorney and
psychologist.
   The Rasnicks are seeking $234,400 a year from Wilson's winnings.
They say they would use most of the money to fight abortion and
pornography.
   A smaller amount would be used to pay for Mrs. Rasnick's
continuing therapy, and reimburse her lost earnings as a church
teacher, the couple said.
   A victory for the Rasnicks would devastate Wilson, said his
lawyer, James Farley of Ventura.
   It ``could totally wipe out everything Ray has, leaving him
broke'' and unable to pay for the therapy he needs, he said.
   According to court records, Wilson was sexually abused by a male
baby sitter when he was 4 or 5 years old and has been obsessed with
sex since.
   ``I feel sorry for them both,'' Farley said of Rasnick and
Wilson. ``They both have their burdens to tote around.''

   Britain on Sunday deported an Iranian who spent
nine years in a British prison for participating in a bombing
attempt, the government said.
   Kourosh Fouladi, a former doorman at the Iranian Embassy in
London, was arrested in 1980 after a bungled car bombing attempt. He
was convicted in 1982 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   On Sunday, he was taken to Heathrow Airport and put on a flight
to Tehran, the Home Office said.
   In Tehran, officials said Britain's release of Fouladi was linked
to the plight of British businessman Roger Cooper, who was accused
of spying in Iran, where he has been imprisoned without trial since
1985.
   But a Foreign Office spokesman said, ``In no way is this linked.
He is simply being released because, with remission, he has served
his time.
   ``If the Iranians plan to let Roger Cooper go that would be
extremely welcome, but there is no indication that they have such
plans.''
   In response to a previous Iranian statement linking the two
cases, Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave said in April
there was no provision in British law for exchanging Fouladi for
Cooper.

   Maverick Soviet politician Boris N. Yeltsin said
Sunday that his country faces continuing economic and social decline
and can learn from American democracy while changing its political
system.
   ``We're having an economic crisis, a financial crisis, a
political crisis, the living standard is falling,'' Yeltsin said at
a news conference Sunday.
   Yeltsin arrived Saturday to begin his first visit to the United
States, a two-week tour that includes stops throughout the country.
   ``We have to take what is positive from Soviet experience and
what has been positive in the experience of the other socialist
countries, positive from America's more than 200 years of democratic
experience _ and on the basis of that create a new model of
socialism,'' Yeltsin said earlier through a translator on CBS News'
``Face the Nation.''
   ``We do need a new model of socialism, yes,'' he said. ``We have
to stop being so dogmatic as we were before.''
   ``The whole society is in a crisis and such extraordinary
measures of an economic or financial nature are obviously necessary
since the standard recently not only has not risen but has actually
fallen,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, 58, lost his position as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev. But this year he was overwhelmingly
elected to the Soviet Congress, where he is an outspoken member of a
radical bloc.
   Gorbachev, he said, ``missed some opportunities to accelerate
perestroika,'' or political and economic restructuring.
   ``Naturally, there has started a movement from below in the form
of strikes indicating dissatisfation with the national leadership,
including with Mr. Gorbachev,'' Yeltsin said during the television
program.
   ``If the situation gets worse, and I think it is going to, his
popularity and authority will doubtless continue to decline.''
   However, Yeltsin said he believes Gorbachev ``did a lot about the
democratization of the country'' and that he ``will indeed retain
his position as leader.''
   He added: ``I would like him to remain the leader of the country
and I think that's the way it's going to be _ for the time being.''
   He also said he does not reject the idea of creating a new,
multiparty system in the Soviet Union.
   ``But this question has got to be discussed by the population
first, and when the public opinion has matured to that point, then
we can decide that issue.''
   Through an intermediary, Yeltsin sent word earlier this year to
the Leigh Bureau, a speakers agency based in Princeton, N.J., that
he was interested in coming to the United States. He has said he
will donate his fees to a Soviet fund to fight AIDS.
   Appearances have already been announced in New York,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Dallas,
Miami and Washington, although final details of the schedule were
not set.
   Yeltsin said he circled the Statue of Liberty in a helicopter
earlier Sunday and he felt ``twice as free'' as before. He said his
first 24 hours in the United States had changed his idea of America.
   ``Americans are in no way aggressive or badly behaved _ in fact,
they are very polite and optimistic, lively, well-intentioned and
know how to live and know how to work,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, who said he hopes to meet with President Bush during his
trip, says he would like to discuss with the president how the
United States ``could participate in measures to rescue
perestroika.''
   But he said he has received no indication from the White House
about the possibility of such a meeting.

   Police escorted non-union
construction workers back to work at a paper mill Sunday as
residents prayed for an end to the turmoil that erupted into a
violent labor protest.
   Pro-union protesters Saturday stormed a housing camp for
non-union workers at the Boise Cascade paper mill in this town of
6,500 residents on the Canadian border, setting trailers on fire and
overturning vehicles.
   About 45 law enforcement officers used tear gas to disperse the
crowd estimated at 400. Five people were injured, and 32 people were
arrested, authorities said. Boise spokesman Andrew Drysdale
estimated damage at $1.3 million.
   ``Yesterday was a sad day for us in International Falls,'' the
Rev. Robert A. Kitchen told his congregation at the Faith United
Church of Christ. ``It was a day of desperation, of anger, of
hopelessness, perhaps.''
   Kitchen, describing the labor unrest as ``an open wound that we
know has ripped our community apart,'' prayed that the community
pull together and denounce the violence.
   About 370 non-union workers riding buses escorted by police
returned to the plant Sunday morning to work on a $535 million
expansion project, Drysdale said. Crews had been told not to report
to work Saturday following the protest.
   The violence stemmed from Boise Cascade's decision to hire
non-union general contractor BE&amp;K of Birmingham, Ala., to expand its
International Falls mill, a move that sparked a wildcat strike by
union members in July.
   Union officials have not sanctioned the strike and say they have
tried to dissuade protesters from violence or mass demonstrations.
   ``We had planned a rally here on the state Capitol steps next
Saturday, and urged them to come to that rally,'' Bill Peterson,
head of the Minnesota Building Trades Council, said in St. Paul.
   ``My attempts were to stop any other rally. We think any rally at
International Falls ought not be held because we were sure that,
tensions running as high as they were, there could be some
problems,'' Peterson said.
   Drysdale said union workers should not blame BE&amp;K and its
subcontractors for being out of work.
   ``Eighteen of the first 20 contracts on this project went to
union contractors,'' Drysdale said Sunday. ``But they wanted it all.
We gave them a tremendous amount of work on this project.
   ``This is not a case of us excluding the unions. We tried to
include them.''
   Iron Range Building Trades Council President Brad Skarich of
Virginia, Minn., could not be reached for comment on Drysdale's
statements. He did not immediately return messages left on an
answering machine.
   The 32 people arrested were being held at the Koochiching County
Jail pending court appearances this week on charges of criminal
damage to property and contempt of court.
   Law enforcement officers remained on alert Saturday night in case
of renewed violence but none was reported, said Sheriff William
Elliott.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich, acting on a request by local law enforcement
officials, put National Guardsmen on alert, but did not send them
into the city. Perpich took the guard off alert status Sunday
afternoon.
   Elliott and Boise Cascade officials had been critical of the
decision not to send National Guardsmen to International Falls.
Because of its remote location, Elliott said it could be difficult
to get adequate help from other law enforcement agencies.
   Perpich and state law enforcement officials Sunday said there
reports of possible trouble, but Perpich said the state could not
send in the Guard simply in anticipation of trouble. He said there
was no reason to send the troops after the violence had ended.
   The governor said evidence including videotapes made by state
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agents would be sent to the U.S.
attorney's office for possible federal charges.

   The death toll in last week's crash
landing of a jetliner in the Amazon jungle increased to 12 Sunday,
when a 2-year-old boy died from injuries sustained in the accident,
a hospital spokesman said.
   Bruno Metazo had been in a coma since he arrived at the hospital
on Thursday, according to Luis Candido of the Albert Einstein
Hospital in Sao Paulo, 270 miles southwest of Rio.
   On Sept. 3, the Varig airlines jet with 54 people on board made
an emergency landing in the Amazon rain forest. Nine passengers died
when the plane crashed through the jungle and two died aboard air
force evacution planes.
   Two passengers remained in critical condition Sunday, including
3-year-old Bruna Lorena Coimbra Costa, doctors said.
   The Boeing 737-200 vanished while on the last leg of a regularly
scheduled flight between Sao Paulo and Belem, 2,000 miles northwest
of Rio at the mouth of the Amazon river.
   Air force planes located the jetliner Tuesday after four
survivors walked to a remote ranch and radioed for help.

<HEAD>Former President Nails Anti-Drug Campaign for Alcoholism Omission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VAIL, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ford criticized the Bush
administration for omitting alcohol abuse from its anti-drug
campaign and attacked the Reagan years for continuing the nation's
serious economic woes.
   ``I basically endorse President Bush's drug strategy,'' Ford said
Saturday while speaking to the 19th annual Vail Symposium.
   However, the former president called alcohol abuse more damaging
to society than cocaine and other drugs.
   Ford said four times more people were killed in 1987 in
alcohol-related traffic accidents than accidents involving drugs. He
said alcohol abuse had cost society $120 billion, compared with $60
billion from drug abuse.
   The Bush administration's campaign against drugs focuses on
anti-drug education for youth, but ``the drug problem is an equally
serious challenge'' among adults, Ford said.
   Former first lady Betty Ford several years ago underwent
treatment for alcoholism and addiction to prescription drugs.
   Ford, who owns a home in Vail, also lambasted the Reagan
administration and Congress for failing to adequately reduce the
federal budget.
   ``Over the last seven or eight years, both the White House and
Congress have done a very inadequate job of managing the budget,''
Ford said.
   He called ``inexcusable'' the annual $180 billion budget deficit
during the Reagan administration years. And he termed
``unacceptable'' the current projected deficit of $110 billion to
$150 billion.

<HEAD>Generic Drug Companies on Campaign to Rebuild Confidence</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf to CORRECT spelling of Dyazide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal swirling around some generic drug
companies is forcing the industry to regroup and is refueling a
long-running rivalry between makers who emphasize brandname
medicines and their competitors who sell only lower-priced clones.
   Disclosures of fraud and corruption within the industry and at
the Food and Drug Administration, and admissions that brandname
products were substituted for generic drugs in sampling tests, have
shaken confidence within the industry.
   ``We have to rebuild confidence'' in generic drugs, said Jay
Molishever, a spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry
Association, a trade group representing generic drug makers.
   Generics are used to fill about a third of all prescriptions.
   The largest of the generic drug makers under scrutiny, Bolar
Pharmaceuticals of Copiague, N.Y., has begun a public relations
drive in the wake of the FDA's move to take the company's generic
version of the widely prescribed, high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide
off the market.
   The company has hired a public relations firm and is sending
letters to physicians, pharmacists and customers trying to bolster
confidence in its product, said a company official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   The FDA has said that while it does not consider Bolar's drug to
be unsafe, it questions whether the drug was manufactured under
specifications approved by the agency.
   In a mailing to physicians earlier this month, Bolar said the
generic drug industry ``has become the victim of irresponsible and
unsubstantiated charges.''
   Bolar employees also stepped into the fray, taking out a
full-page advertisement in The New York Times and another in Newsday
earlier this month to defend the company's management as
``reputable, honest and caring.''
   The employees also said they were ``outraged'' at U.S. Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee that has been investigating the generic drug industry,
``for creating a climate of fear and distrust'' within the industry
``because of the fraudulent deeds of a few.''
   Analysts said last week it was too early to tell whether Bolar's
sales have been affected by the FDA's action against its
largest-selling drug. Analysts say Bolar's generic Dyazide accounts
for more than half of the company's earnings.
   Bolar's drug is the only generic version left on the market since
Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., withdrew
its generic Dyzaide from the market after admitting it had
substituted the brandname drug for its own in tests to win FDA
approval.
   Kaiser Permanente, the Oakland, Calif.-based health-maintenance
organization, has pulled Bolar's drug from its pharmacy shelves.
   However, the major drugstore chains, including the American
Association of Retired Persons pharmacies, are continuing to supply
the product, said Hemant K. Shah, a Warren, N.J., analyst who
follows the generic drug industry.
   Brandname companies have long questioned whether generic drugs
work as well as the name-brand products. But as generics gained
public acceptance and began taking a greater share of the business
from the brandname market, many of these companies have gotten into
the generic business themselves, often making generic versions of
their own products after the patents expire.
   Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham, which makes Dyazide, is doing its
own public relations with a letter to physicians and pharmacists
informing them of the developments in the generic drug investigation
and reminding them that their brandname product was not affected.
   The investigation ``certainly reaffirms the necessity for
dispensing your Dyazide prescriptions with the branded product,''
the letter said.
   ``This was to clarify confusion,'' said Jeremy Heymsfeld, a
spokesman for SmithKline.

<HEAD>File on IRA Suspects Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An intelligence file containing
photographs, names and addresses of nine IRA suspects is missing
from a British army base in northern Ireland, Press Association
reported Sunday.
   The British domestic news agency said army chiefs feared the
confidential file might have been obtained by Protestant extremists,
who used another security document to select and kill a Roman
Catholic man.
   Police are questioning several men in the slaying of Loughlin
Maginn, 38, who was killed last month by gunmen who smashed their
way into his home at Rathfriland, County Down.
   A Protestant group, the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters,
asserted responsibility for the killing and said Maginn was slain
because he was a member of the Irish Republican Army. To support its
claim, it produced a stolen security file that indicated Maginn was
a suspected IRA member or supporter.
   Maginn's family firmly denied he was a member of the outlawed
IRA, a predominantly Roman Catholic organization that is fighting to
unite Northern Ireland, a British province, with the mainly Catholic
Irish Republic. Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2 in Northern
Ireland.
   In the new case of missing documents, the confidential file
disappeared from the Ballykinlar army camp in County Down, according
to Press Association.
   It said the file vanished last week after it was returned by an
army officer who had taken it out to study intelligence information
on IRA suspects. Press Association did not give the source of its
information.

   Striking telephone workers were removed by security

New England Telephone Co. during a commencement address Sunday.
   About 100 members of the two striking unions, the Communication
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical

Wentworth Institute of Technology, said Myles Calvey, business agent
of IBEW Local 2222 in Quincy.
   Police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said the protesters were
cooperative, and there were no arrests.
   Calvey said a total of nearly 300 union members picketed outside
the ceremony but did not try to prevent students or their parents
from entering.
   Wentworth campus police and New England Telephone officials
declined to comment on the protest.
   About 62,000 telephone workers in New York and New England have
been on strike since Aug. 6, when their contract with NYNEX, the
corporate parent of New England Telephone, expired.

   A Romanian ship collided with a Bulgarian
tugboat and sank in the Danube River Sunday, leaving 151 people
missing, Romania's official Agerpres news agency reported.
   A British newspaper said many of the passengers aboard were
Western tourists.
   The collision occurred upstream of the port city of Galati, about
125 miles northeast of the Romanian capital of Bucharest, the report
said. The ship sank ``in conditions of poor visibility,'' it said.
   A total of 169 passengers were aboard the Romanian ship. Only 18
of them and the ship's 13 crew members had been rescued, Agerpres
said. It did not give the nationality of the passengers.
   The Bulgarian state BTA news agency said the Romanian cruiser
Mogosoaia collided with the Bulgarian ship Peter Karaminchev, which
was tugging a convoy of loaded barges.
   ``After the alarm was sounded by the Bulgarian ship, its crew and
the crew of the ships in the proximity ran to help,'' BTA said.
   It said there were no reports of casualties aboard the tug.
   There was no report on what caused the boats to collide.
   In London, an early edition of The Independent newspaper said
apart from the 13 crew, most of the 169 passengers aboard the
Mogosoaia ``were almost certainly Western tourists.'' The newspaper
report from Vienna quoted Danube shipping officials in the Austrian
capital.
   Pleasure cruises on the Danube are one of Romania's few sources
of hard currency, it said.
   Agerpres said rescue operations were continuing and a government
commission was established to investigate the accident.
   The Independent said blamed Agerpress for ``sparse details'' of
the sinking, which only began to emerge 10 hours afterward. It said
the Bulgarian BTA news agency ``was no more informative.''

   A young man died in a well, along with a

apparently overcome by gas fumes, a coroner said.
   Kenneth Cox, about 24; his 27-year-old brother, Curtis; and
Curtis Cox's wife, Jamie Lee, 25, died Saturday while trying to
clean out an open well 15 to 20 miles northwest of this northeastern
Kentucky town, Elliott County Coroner Carl Eldridge said.
   The three had just detonated an explosive inside the 2-foot-wide,
12-foot-deep well when Kenneth Cox apparently fell in, Eldridge said.
   ``His brother Curtis went in to assist him and both were
apparently overcome with some noxious fumes _ some type of gas,
possibly methane,'' Eldridge said. ``Then Jamie went in to assist
them and was overcome ...''
   Family members found the three in the well, Eldridge said. He
said tests were being done to determine what kind of gas was in the
well.

<HEAD>773 Couples Celebrate 50 Years of Marriage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After living through romance and reality, falling
in love and then making it work, 773 couples gathered Sunday to
celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss at Holy Name Roman Catholic
Cathedral.
   The theme was the more the merrier, as about 2,000 children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren packed into the nearby
Cathedral School auditorium to watch the Mass celebrated by Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin via closed-circuit television.
   ``Sometimes you feel like it isn't worth it, sure,'' said Samuel
Smith, of the city's South Side who will be married for 50 years in
November. ``But you say you're together for better or worse and deal
with it.''
   Marsha Ross, a volunteer for Marriage Encounters for Family
Ministries, said the ceremony had special significance for the
couples.
   ``For the cardinal to be the main celebrant is an extremely
powerful moment for most of these couples,'' she said.
   But the main focus of the Mass, celebrated for the past 12 years,
was to balance some of the negative press about marriage and
divorce, Ms. Ross added.
   ``This balances that with a real vision of the commitment that
you see 773 times 50 years represents,'' Ms. Ross said. ``I mean its
a very powerful witness to ... well, marriage.''
   Catherine and Joseph Bergthold, from the city's South Side, were
married Sept. 9, 1949, and now have 10 children, 25 grandchildren
and seven great-grandchildren. They say the secret to a successful
marriage is to concentrate on family, togetherness and working
together to solve problems.
   ``It certainly keeps you together,'' Mrs. Bergthold said. ``The
key is to get mad (with each other) and get over it.''
   Florence and Charlie Lesperance, married on June 24 more than 50
years ago, say their advice for future and present marriages is
having a give-and-take relationship.
   ``You just have to go 50-50,'' Mrs. Lesperance said. ``You win
and he wins. You give in once in a while and he gives in once in a
while.''
   Jill and Bruno Wicker seemed to sum up their feelings for many
couples.
   ``I hope the next 50 are as nice as the first 50,'' Mrs. Wicker
said.

<HEAD>Becker Defeats Lendl in 110-Degree Heat for First U.S. Open Win</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wimbledon champion Boris Becker won his first
U.S. Open tennis tournament Sunday by defeating top-ranked Ivan
Lendl in a struggle that lasted nearly four hours as temperatures
climbed to 110 degrees.
   Frequently icing his legs and eating fruit during breaks, the
second seed from West Germany took his fourth Grand Slam title 7-6,
1-6, 6-3, 7-6. He won his third Wimbledon crown in July.
   ``This is much more exhausting,'' Becker said, comparing the Open
to Wimbledon. ``It's even more exhausting than the French Open, with
the heat, the planes and the spectators.''
   The 21-year-old Becker's double success won't be enough to lift
him past Lendl in the computer rankings, but his strong serve and
improved court command were enough to outlast the three-time Open
champion in the three-hour, 51-minute battle.
   Becker's win gave West Germany a sweep of the singles
championships at Wimbledon and the Open. Steffi Graf also won both.
   Becker's Open win earned him $300,000. Lendl, 29, a Czech who now
lives in Greenwich, Conn., earned $150,000.
   In the women's doubles championship finals, Martina Navratilova
and Hana Mandlikova beat Pam Shriver and Mary Jo Fernandez 5-7, 6-4,
6-4. Navratilova and Mandlikova split $104,000. Shriver and
Fernandez divided $52,000.

<TEXT>
   Eighty-six percent of Americans agree with
President Bush that illegal drugs are the biggest problem facing the
nation, according to an ABC News poll released Sunday.
   Of the 758 people interviewed from Thursday through Saturday, 86
percent said drugs are a bigger problem than the federal budget
deficit, unemployment, AIDS, the crime rate and the threat of
nuclear war.
   Two years ago, the public thought the budget deficit and
unemployment were bigger problems than drugs, the network said.
   The poll found that more than a third of those interviewed have a
friend addicted to illegal drugs, one in five said drugs have caused
problems in their family and the same number said drugs are a
problem at work or school.
   Seventy-three percent said they approved of Bush's call last week
for more money to local law enforcement agencies and 69 percent
supported his plan to use the U.S. military to fight drugs at the
request of foreign countries.
   However, only 37 percent said they supported raising taxes to
wage the war against drugs.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   On Saturday, Newsweek released a poll which found that 52 percent
of Americans believe the anti-drug program announced by Bush
proposes spending too little money for such a huge problem.
   The Newsweek poll found that 73 percent would support raising
federal taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages and 65 percent
said they would support a 1 percent surtax on corporate income taxes
to pay for an anti-drug program.
   The Newsweek poll by the Gallup Organization was based on
interviews with 609 adults Thursday and Friday and also had a margin
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

   Retail gasoline prices dropped 1.37 cents
nationwide over the past two weeks but wholesale prices rose
slightly, signaling a possible pump price increase this fall, an
industry analyst said Sunday.
   The average retail price for all gasoline grades at full- and
self-service pumps was 109.07 cents per gallon for the Aug. 25-Sept.
9 period, said Trilby Lundberg, director of the Lundberg Survey of
12,000 gasoline stations.
   Wholesale prices rose by .33 cents as wholesalers' inventories,
stockpiled after spring's Valdez oil spill, returned closer to
normal levels, Ms. Lundberg said.
   Intense competition has dissuaded retailers from passing along
the price increase to consumers, but that could change, Ms. Lundberg
said.
   ``It now appears that gasoline retailers' operating margins are
being squeezed and that more of them may soon pass along the
increases in the way of higher street prices,'' she said.
   The average retail gasoline price has dropped 9.33 cents since it
peaked May 19, Ms. Lundberg said.
   Over the two-week period ending Sept. 8, the average price of a
gallon of gasoline at a self-service pump dropped from 99.42 cents
to 97.89 cents for regular unleaded, 116.03 cents to 114.96 cents
for premium unleaded, and 98.91 cents to 97.18 cents for regular
leaded.
   At full-service pumps, the average price for a gallon of gasoline
fell from 128.19 cents to 126.73 cents for regular unleaded, 140.47
cents to 139.16 cents for premium unleaded, and 127.76 cents to
126.66 cents for regular leaded.

   The rust-brown car crossed from
Hungary to Austria at midnight as hundreds of Austrians cheered and
whistled their greetings to the first of thousands of East German
refugees to pour into this border town.
   Its male driver, along with another man and two women, grinned
broadly at the Austrian border booth and waved, transfixed in the
glare of TV camera lights, and then moved on.
   Minutes later, 12 men poured out of three Hungarian taxis, some
of them yelling, ``We're free! We're free! It's unbelievable!''
Others popped champagne or yelled greetings to the crowd.
   ``It's wonderful, it's terrific,'' others shouted to Western
reporters amid the honking horns.
   One group of youths, just before crossing the opened red and
white border barriers, held up a sign saying ``Give it up Erich'' _
a reference to the East German communist leader, Erich Honecker.
   The Austrians met the new refugees early Monday with open arms.
The refugees were taking part in the largest mass emigration of East
Germans to West Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to
stem the flow across the border.
   Some of the Austrians offered to feed or shelter those wanting to
rest before continuing their journey. One woman stood by the side of
the road with a hand-lettered sign offering room and board for a
refugee family with children.
   Red Cross helpers in Nickelsdorf, 50 miles southeast of Vienna,
busied themselves with handing out steaming cups of tea, crackers,
maps _ and advice _ to the East Germans. Many of the refugees said
they planned to drive directly to the West German border, 400 miles
to the north, where tent communities were awating them.
   At the Nickelsdorf crossing,Austrian customs agents told
reporters they counted 450 cars carrying about 1,200 people in the
first three hours.
   One veteran Red Cross volunteer told reporters the nighttime
influx of refugees from Hungary reminded him of the thousands of
Hungarians who fled over the same border in 1956, after Soviet tanks
crushed the Soviet bloc's bloodiest revolt.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader says Papal Attitude should not Halt Ecumenism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish leader on Sunday criticized Pope John Paul
II's attitudes toward Judaism and Israel and urged Jewish people
worldwide to press ecumenical efforts on lower levels of the Roman
Catholic Church.
   Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of Italian Jewish
Communities, said the best progress in Jewish-Catholic relations
could be made with the national bishops' conferences.
   ``They have autonomy to work within their own countries, and in
many nations, they are often one step ahead of the Vatican,'' she
told a meeting of the European Jewish Congress.
   The congress met in London as a dispute brews between the
international Jewish community and the Roman Catholic Church over a
convent built at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. At
least 2.5 million Jews died there during World War II.
   A 1987 accord between Jewish and Catholic representatives
stipulated the convent should be moved by Feb. 22, but the deadline
passed and the convent remained. The Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, has termed the accord ``offensive.''
   The Polish-born pope has not taken a firm public stand on the
dispute.
   Before becoming pope in 1979, John Paul was the archbishop of
Krakow, in the archdiocese where Auschwitz lies.
   Mrs. Zevi, a signatory of the convent accord, said that in recent
apostolic letters about World War II the pope spoke harshly of the
Nazi genocide of Jews and affirmed that hatred of Judaism conflicted
with Christian tenets.
   But acknowledgement of horrors of the past and warnings about the
way the Gospel is taught ``are not reflected in the pope's theology
and politics as far as Jews and Judaism are concerned,'' she said.
   The apostolic letters and the Auschwitz convent controversy ``are
symptomatic of a pattern aimed to revise the history of the
Holocaust and the role of the church during that terrible period,''
Mrs. Zevi said.
   ``He is seeking to `Christianize' the Holocaust by means of
churches and convents in the extermination camps, he has proclaimed
the sainthood of Edith Stein, a Jewish nun, and continues to keep
the state of Israel in a diplomatic limbo,'' Mrs. Zevi said.
   But she said the Catholic-Jewish dialogue that has grown since
the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, ``is more important than any
individual pope, and we must ensure that it continues.''
   In 1965, the Vatican Council issued the document ``Nostra
Aetate'' (``In Our Times''), which officially rescinded the
accusation that the Jews killed Christ. It is considered a turning
point in Catholic-Jewish relations.

   Thousands of people waving
blue-and-white Nicaraguan flags marched through the streets of this
cattle town Sunday in the first campaign rally by the opposition for
the February elections.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, presidential candidate of the
National Opposition Union, in a 10-minute speech spoke of her four
children, divided along pro- and anti-Sandinista lines, and urged
the people to pray for peace.
   Her running mate, vice presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy of
the Liberal Independent Party, drew cheers as he criticized the
amount of money the governing Sandinistas spend on the armed forces
and the presence of Soviet-bloc advisers in Nicaragua.
   ``What do the people want?'' Godoy asked.
   ``For the (Sandinista) Front to leave!'' the crowd shouted back.
   ``And for Cuba to leave, and for the Soviets to leave, and for
(North) Korea to leave,'' Godoy responded to rounds of applause.
   An estimated 6,000 people attended the rally of the 14-party
opposition coalition.
   Four U.N. observers and one representative from the Organization
of American States also were at the rally in this town 85 miles east
of Managua, the capital.
   Mrs. Chamorro, a director of the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
drew cheers when she spoke of her husband, La Prensa publisher Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, who was assassinated in Managua in 1978. His
murder led to the revolt, spearheaded by the Sandinistas, that
ousted the conservative regime of President Anastasio Somoza in July
1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro said ``the first inheritance'' from her husband was
``to be a Chamorro, even though they may want to take it away from
me.'' She referred to reports the government-controlled news media
have been told to use only her maident name of Barrios.
   A native of the town of Rivas in southwestern Nicaragua, the
59-year-old presidential nominee reminisced about her childhood when
her parents went to buy cattle in Juigalpa, the main town in
Chontales province.
   Rep. Bill Grant, D-Fla., one of four congressmen visiting
Managua, told a news conference if the Feb. 25 balloting is free and
fair ``there will be an improvement in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations no
matter who wins.''
   But ``if the Nicaraguan government, for whatever excuse, decides
to postpone or cancel the elections, I'm confident that the U.S.
Congress will increase its support to the Contras in the future,''
he added. Nicaraguan rebels fighting the Sandinistas are known as
Contras.
   Grant also said that at a meeting Sunday, President Daniel Ortega
promised to ``revise'' the case of two U.S. fishing boats and their
crews seized last month on charges of fishing illegaly in Nicaraguan
waters. Grant did not give any details.
   The fishing vessels Pete's Dream and Pescardora and their eight
crewmen have been held in the Carribbean port of Bluefields since
Aug. 28.
   Grant and Republican Reps. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, Mickey
Edwards of Oklahoma and Elton Gallegly of California arrived in
Nicaragua Saturday as part of a tour of Central America and left for
Washington Sunday.

   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Enrico Lorenzo, mayor of the central Luzon town of San Isidro,
was wounded when attackers in another car fired on his vehicle as it
drove along a bridge in Manila's Santa Mesa district, according to

   A Navy helicopter crashed off the California coast Sunday,
leaving three people missing, and the wreckage of a National Guard
chopper that went down in Idaho, killing three, was found in a
remote mountain area.
   Three of the six people aboard the Navy UH-1N ``Huey'' were
pulled from the Pacific Ocean, and one man survived the crash of the
Idaho Army National Guard UH-1H ``Huey,'' which had been missing
since Saturday evening, officials said.
   It was not known what caused either crash.
   The Navy helicopter that plunged into the sea around 11:30 a.m.
PDT had taken off from the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu and
was circling in case other aircraft taking part in a military
exercise experienced problems, said Marine Capt. Chris Gillette.
   A lookout aboard the Peleliu saw the Huey go down about three
miles from the ship, and sounded the alarm, Gillette said from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., a Marine base 18 miles northeast of the crash
site.
   The ship dispatched a motorboat, which picked up three crewmen,
and helicopters to search for the missing crew members.
   The three who were rescued were taken to Balboa Navy Hospital in
San Diego, Gillette said. One victim was in serious but stable
condition with a head injury; the other two received minor injuries.
   Gillette said the search for the missing would continue through
the night.
   None of the people aboard the helicopter was identified, but all
were Navy personnel, the Marines said.
   The Peleliu, based in Long Beach, Calif., was one of six Navy
ships taking part in ``Kernel Usher 89-3,'' a nine-day exercise
involving more than 15,000 Navy and Marine personnel, said Marine
1st Lt. Patrick Givens.
   In Idaho, Guard search helicopters found the helicopter's
wreckage 25 miles southeast of Boise near Danskin Peak at 9:02 a.m.
MDT, said Maj. Jim Ball. A rescue unit was dispatched.
   Sgt. Gary L. Scheer, 29, of Boise, who suffered broken bones and
internal injuries, was in serious condition at St. Alphonsus
Regional Medical Center, Ball said.
   Killed were the pilots _ Chief Warrant Officer 4 James R. Bollar,
39, of McCall and Chief Warrant Officer 4 Dickie C. Hill, 46, of
Boise _ and Sgt. Charles L. Hansen, 28, of Boise, the crew chief.
   The Huey, a Vietnam-era aircraft about 20 years old, left Gowen
Field in Boise around 5 p.m. Saturday on a training mission, and had
been due to return by 6:30 p.m.
   When the aircraft did not turn up, Guard helicopters were
dispatched to search a 200-square-mile area west of the South Fork
of the Boise River.
   Search efforts were called off at midnight Saturday and resumed
at sunrise Sunday.
   The accident will investigated by the U.S. Army Aviation Safety
Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., Ball said.

   A father and two sons died early Sunday
when their apartment was engulfed by fire in this suburb northwest
of Portland, a fire official said. Three other family members
escaped.
   The bodies of Roy Hopkins, 30, and his sons Brian, 8, and Jason,
7, were found huddled together in one of the apartment's two
bedrooms, said Tualatin Valley Fire and Fire and Rescue spokesman
Jim Washburn.
   A third son, 4-year-old Thomas; Roy Hopkins' mother, Lois
Elizabeth McCullagh, 53; and her 56-year-old husband, John, escaped
through a ground-floor bedroom window. Lois McCullagh was in fair
condition at St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center, where she was
being treated for smoke inhalation and a broken ankle.
   ``If they had gone through the apartment, rather than out the
window, I think we'd be looking at six people dead, rather than just
three,'' said Washburn.
   Noise from the fire, which broke out around 5:30 a.m., woke up
John McCullagh, Washburn said. McCullagh forced his wife and
grandson out the window, then climbed out after them.
   The cause of the fire was not known.

<HEAD>Sir Christopher Chancellor, Former Head of Reuters, Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Christopher Chancellor, who spent 29 years with
Reuters and was general manager of the news agency from 1944 to
1959, died at Wincanton in southwest England, Reuters reported. He
was 85.
   The agency said he had been hospitalized and died Saturday but it
did not give the cause of death.
   An obituary in Monday's Times of London said Chancellor had a
gift of getting along with people of all countries, was an
outstanding negotiator and capable of great single-mindedness. The
Daily Telegraph called him the greatest single influence on the
development of Reuters after World War II.
   ``It was largely thanks to Chancellor that Reuters had survived
the war intact, despite the loss for several years of the greatest
part of its world market,'' the Telegraph said.
   Chancellor, born March 29, 1904, was the son of Sir John
Chancellor, a colonial administrator, and was educated at Eton and
Trinity College, Cambridge. He joined Reuters in 1930 and 18 months
later was sent to the Far East as general manager and chief
correspondent.
   Based in Shanghai from 1931 to 1939, he kept the agency's China
service operating after the Japanese invasion in 1932.
   In London during World War II, Chancellor worked with William
Moloney and William Haley in reorganizing Reuters' news and business
operations. He took sole charge after Haley left to run the British
Broadasting Corp. in 1943 and Moloney retired in 1944.
   ``Chancellor gave Reuters a position as a world news agency which
Britain's diminished role after the end of the Second World War did
not make it easy to sustain,'' The Times of London said.
   Chancellor, knighted in 1951, left Reuters for the Odhams
publishing group and was chairman of the now defunct Daily Herald.
   From 1962 to his retirement in 1969 he was chairman of the
Bowater Paper Corp. and its associated companies.
   Survivors include his wife, two sons and two daughters. Funeral
arrangements have not been announced.

   Walter Dunfey, co-founder and former director of
Dunfey Hotels and a leader in New Hampshire's Democratic Party, died
Sunday at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 57.
   Dunfey, of Rye, N.H., died from complications related to an
aneurysm he suffered Aug. 3, the company said in statement.
   Dunfey helped build his Dunfey Hotels business into an
international corporation, which was later sold and is now known as
Omni Hotels. In December 1987, he and four of his brothers formed
the Dunfey Brothers Capital Group, a venture capital and investment
company.
   Dunfey also was involved heavily in democratic politics, both at
the state and national levels. He was a member of the Democratic
National Committee's Business Council, as well as its Convention
Site Selection Committee.
   Dunfey also served on the Democratic National Committee's Hunt
Commission, which examined the presidential primary system, and was
instrumental in preserving New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary status.
   In 1960, then Sen. John Kennedy began his presidential campaign
from Dunfey's office in the Carpenter Hotel in Manchester, N.H.
   ``He never asked for anything from anybody, but he was first one
that people _ candidates, politicians _ asked for help,'' said Paul
McEachern, a former gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire and
close friend of Dunfey.
   Dunfey also was involved with many charities. He was founder of
the American-Ireland Fund's New Hampshire chapter, and also served
as national director and treasurer for the organization that
promotes Irish culture and a peaceful end to the violence in
Northern Ireland.
   Dunfey is survived by his wife, Barbara Reynolds Dunfey, a
daughter, two sons, six brothers, three sisters and six
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Conservative Retiree Is Still Typical AT&amp;T Shareholder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Financially conservative retirees still make up
the biggest block of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
shareholders, but those who have bought stock since the Bell System
breakup tend to be younger and more interested in growth, the
company says in a new survey.
   AT&amp;T is the most widely held stock in the nation at 2.6 million
shareholders, a legacy of the days before 1984 when it was the
world's largest company. Its status as a regulated monopoly made it
a conservative investment, known as the ``widows and orphans stock.''
   The 1984 breakup left AT&amp;T smaller and more exposed to
competition, but the survey seems to indicate that shareholders have
not fully caught up with the 5-year-old change.
   The survey showed that shareholders still place a high priority
on dividends, which have been stuck at $1.20 a year since the
breakup. The new AT&amp;T has been reinvesting profits for future growth
instead of distributing them as higher dividends.
   AT&amp;T's survey of 1,712 shareholders, the first since 1983, was
provided to The Associated Press for publication Monday. The survey
excluded current employees, who account for about 5 percent of the
direct shareowners.
   Among the findings of the survey, which was conducted in May and
June:
   _Seventy percent of shareholders are 50 or older, 37 percent are
65 are older, and 46 percent are retired.
   _The percentage of shareholders who are younger than 50 is up
sharply, to 28 percent in 1989 from 15 percent in 1983.
   _Shareholders still rate security of the investment as their top
reason for owning AT&amp;T stock, as they did in 1983. But growth
potential has moved up into second place, edging out dividend income
as a priority for shareholders. Also, more shareholders cited profit
opportunities than did so in 1983.
   _Seventy-six percent of shareholders bought their shares before
the 1984 breakup, and 40 percent bought their initial stock when
they were employees of AT&amp;T or the old Bell System.
   In the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, AT&amp;T shareholders
received shares in the new AT&amp;T as well as in each of the seven
regional companies that provide local phone service: Nynex Corp.,
Bell Atlantic Corp., BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, U S
West Inc., Southwestern Bell Corp. and Ameritech.
   The new AT&amp;T provides long-distance service and sells
communications equipment and computers. It doesn't provide local
phone service.

   White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley
said Sunday that the United States needs to develop a supercomputer
network or face erosion of its ``historical leadership'' in the
field.
   Bromley made the assessment in releasing a report by the White
House Office of Science and Technology that proposes a five-year,
$1.9 billion program to promote advanced computing capabilities,
including the creation of a fiber-optic network linking the nation's
supercomputers.
   ``High-performance computing is a vital and strategic technology,
exerting strong leverage on the rest of the computer industry and
other cutting-edge areas,'' said Bromley, director of OSTP.
   However, he said that in recent years ``U.S. leadership and
diversity in the supercomputer industry itself has declined
dramatically. ... We cannot afford to cede our historical leadership
in high-performance computing and in its applications.''
   ``A future national high-speed computer network could have the
kind of catalytic effect on our society, industries and universities
that the telephone system has had during the 20th century,'' Bromley
said.
   The program envisions establishment of a National Research and
Education Network which would transmit data between supercomputers
at speeds up to 3 gigabits _ 3 billion bits _ per second, or 2,000
times faster than current computer networks.
   ``This tremendous challenge is within the grasp of the United
States in the next 10 years,'' the report said.
   The proposed program also would involve increased federal support
for research and development work on high-performance computer
equipment, software and training.
   Federal spending needed to implement the program would grow from
an estimated $151 million in the first year up to $597 million in
the fifth year, for a total of $1.917 billion.
   The OSTP report noted that it is ``designed for agency-level
planning purposes and does not represent the administration's
approval or support of any program not included in the president's
budget requests.''
   Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., ranking Republican on the
House Science subcommittee on science, research and technology, said
Friday he was hopeful that money to launch the program could be
provided in the fiscal 1991 budget.
   ``It's an absolute must,'' he said. ``It shows that we're
concentrating on the future rather than dwelling on the past. A key
test will be how it's incorporated into the budget plan. It's a
great idea _ let's provide the funding for it.''
   Boehlert added that ``I really think (President) Bush is tuned in
and he's going to be a strong advocate'' of the high-performance
computing effort.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Goldsmith's Bid to Block State Review of BAT Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has denied Sir James
Goldsmith's attempt to block Washington state insurance regulators
from reviewing his bid to buy B.A.T. Industries PLC, the parent of
Farmer's Group Inc., citing constitutional protections.
   Judge Robert Bryan on Friday rejected Goldsmith's request for a
preliminary injunction, thereby refusing to strike down Washington's
right to approve or deny the transaction.
   Washington is one of nine states in which Goldsmith has filed
federal lawsuits attempting to prevent state regulatory reviews of
the proposed hostile takeover.
   Farmers, a Los Angeles-based insurance company, has insurance
operations in all nine states. Goldsmith wants to buy its British
parent for about $22 billion through his Hoylake Investments Ltd.
   With Friday's ruling, federal judges in Texas and Washington have
rejected Goldsmith's attempt to avoid state review. Hearings in the
other seven states are pending.
   In a news release, Hoylake said the decision would be appealed.
   ``Subjecting a wholly foreign securities transaction to state
regulatory review clearly exceeds the constitutional limitation on
state authority,'' the company said.
   Ed Southon, Washington deputy insurance commissioner, said his
office was pleased with the judge's decision. A hearing on Hoylake's
bid is scheduled for Oct. 10, and Southon said he expects a ruling
from the state insurance commissioner to be issued before Oct. 28.

<HEAD>China Expected To Resume Talks Aimed At Membership, GAAT Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUERGENSTOCK, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is expected to resume
efforts soon to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
GATT's director-general said.
   Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland said that officials from China,
whose application for GATT membership was temporarily shelved after
the bloody crackdown on student-led protests in June, plan to hold
discussions with GATT members about reviving talks on membership.
   ``Some days from now, there will be extensive informal
consultations in Geneva with Chinese authorities to see where things
stand,'' Dunkel said in an interview Saturday with The Associated
Press. He declined to elaborate.
   A 46-member GATT group set up to examine Beijing's bid put off
further meetings indefinitely after the crackdown because many
delegates felt the political turmoil precluded progress on practical
issues.
   China applied in 1986 to join GATT, a 96-nation market-oriented
group whose members pledge to bring their policies in line with its
free-trade rules. GATT has its headquarters in Geneva.
   Dunkel said he also expected the Soviet Union to apply for
membership at some point as part of its effort to move toward a more
market-oriented economy.
   ``But this isn't something for tomorrow,'' he said.
   He added, however, that since the current round of GATT world
trade talks began in 1986, Soviet trade authorities have been kept
informed of the progress of the negotiations.
   Every change in Soviet trade legislation since then ``has been
made in such a way that it will facilitate the entry of the U.S.S.R.
into GATT,'' Dunkel said.
   Dunkel was interviewed while attending a conference of the Swiss
Commodities, Futures and Options Association.

<TEXT>
   After years of mellow marketing, Outside magazine
is about to undertake an ambitious public relations assault to try
to raise its profile and nearly double its circulation.
   But the publisher of the 13-year-old adventure magazine says he
needs to walk the fine line between attracting the armchair
adventure crowd and not losing its base of rock-climbers in cutoffs.
   ``We want to make editorial changes that drive the product
upscale,'' said Larry Burke, whose brash entrepreneurship pushed the
magazine through various formats since 1976.
   ``In the '60s and '70s, the Baby Boomers were going out with 60
pounds of gear on their backs in a pack, and now those same people
are more likely to want to go hiking _ yes, maybe with a baby in the
backpack _ from hut to hut in the Sierras or in Europe.''
   The magazine, a winner in 1984 for general excellence and again
in 1987 for essays and criticism in the National Magazine Awards,
takes its readers on first-person adventures and exploits that would
knock the fedora off cinematic pretender Indiana Jones.
   It also is known for its inspired writing and offbeat subject
matter.
   Woody Allen, the English poet John Donne and algebraic
formulation were once called upon by writer David Quammen to cast
light upon the forces that incite Chinook salmon to struggle
mightily and then die in the noble act of procreation.
   Quammen has also written about homosexual behavior among bedbugs
and the proper method for preparing and serving the Guam fruit bat
as supper _ including swallowing the fur. It was Quammen who brought
the 1987 award.
   Freelance writer Donald R. Katz, another contributor, has written
about coon-dog racing, NASA's research on vomiting in space and the
sport of ferret-legging, which involves the ``tying of a
competitor's trousers at the ankles and the subsequent insertion
into those trousers of a couple of peculiarly vicious fur-coated
foot-long carnivores called ferrets.''
   ``Outside pays you in sensitivity to your writing, in freedom of
subject matter and in gorgeous presentation,'' said Katz, noting the
relatively low monetary payment for articles. ``It is considered a
place where you can have fun writing.''
   Burke, 47, pulled the magazine's pieces together gradually. In
1976, he hired a small staff and hid expenses from his family
business, an advertising display company, to finance the magazine,
then called ``Mariah'' after the wind. But at the same time, another
adventure magazine was being bankrolled by $2 million in profits
from Rolling Stone magazine.
   That magazine, called ``Outside,'' began to falter with an
overbudgeted staff and undersold advertising, and the two combined
in 1978 under Burke, who now controls the magazine.
   Circulation stands at 300,000, compared to about 90,000 for
``Mariah,'' with annual profits nearing $2.3 million.
   The magazine is familiar to most hard-core outdoors enthusiasts,
but Burke wants to make ``Outside'' a household word among the less
adventurous, too.
   He recently hired additional advertising staff and a public
relations firm to target slightly older, more affluent readers.
   Burke's also developing his idea for a Camp Outside, an adventure
vacation camp for children and adults.
   Like a true adventurist, Burke relishes the heights of the
challenge before him.
   ``We are undermarketed,'' he said, ``and while that might depress
some people, I look at it as a great opportunity.''

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle to Give American Express Gift Certificates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Trump Shuttle, the Northeast airline owned by
developer Donald J. Trump, said Sunday it plans to give its weekday
passengers $25 American Express Co. gift certificates for use in
restaurants as part of a two-week promotion.
   The ``Be My Guest'' certificates may be used at any restaurant
accepting the American Express card, Trump Shuttle officials said.
The promotion runs Sept. 11-22, excluding Sept. 16 and 17.
   Shuttle passengers will receive one certificate when they board
the hourly flights, which connect Washington and Boston with New
York, Trump officials said in a statement. The certificates are
valid through Dec. 31.
   Trump Shuttle is locked in a fierce competition for market share
with a similar shuttle run by Pan Am Corp. Both compete in terms of
service and amenities, not price, for their passengers, most of whom
are business people traveling on expense accounts.

   Individual incomes in Latin America dropped
overall last year and will drop further, the Inter-American
Development Bank said Sunday in a report that shows regional growth
at less than 1 percent in 1988.
   According to the bank, 1988 per capita income was lower in 12 of
25 Latin American countries, including three of the most populous
and heavily indebted: Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
   The bank did not provide dollar figures in its report, but World
Bank statistics for 1987 show that the average Argentine earned the
equivalent of $2,370, the average Brazilian $2,020 and the average
Mexican $1,820.
   The comparable U.S. income was $18,430 in 1987, the most recent
year for which the World Bank figures are available.
   The Inter-American bank said the 1988 drop was the greatest in
Panama _ 18.8 percent _ followed by Nicaragua and Peru with 11.1
percent each.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions against both
Panama and Nicaragua. Peru's problems worsened last year after a
surge in growth during 1986 and 1987.
   In one country, Bolivia, the average income appeared static in
1988.
   The other 12 countries showed increases, with the best record in
Chile. The World Bank put income there at $1,310 in 1987. The IADB
reported an increase of 5.6 percent last year.
   ``Once more it was a very bad year for Latin America,'' bank
President Enrique V. Iglesias said. ``The overall growth was a very
disappointing figure.''
   Iglesias plans to release the report formally at a news
conference Thursday.
   The report said the area's total income grew by 0.6 percent.
Since the population grows much faster _ over 2 percent a year _
that translated into an average decline of 1.5 percent for
individuals.
   Iglesias said this year's total income figure would be worse,
only a little over zero overall. That could mean a 2 percent drop
for the average Latin American.
   He called the increase of inflation the top negative development
of 1988. The International Monetary Fund has reported that prices in
Brazil, which accounts for one-third of the area's production, rose
at an annual rate of 854 percent in April compared with a year
earlier.
   ``The overall upsurge of inflation in 1988 reached 100 percent,
weighted by population,'' Iglesias said.
   He added that the rise in prices affects the political as well as
the economic situation.
   His bank, owned by 44 governments, is a major source of loans to
raise living standards in countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean. It authorized $1.16 billion in new lending last year. The
United States is the largest shareholder.
   Willy Van Ryckeghem, head of the bank's country studies division,
said there was encouraging news from the region. He said exports
from Latin America last year grew twice as fast as world trade as a
whole.
   He also pointed out that for the first time in recent years there
was a reduction in the area's foreign debt. He attributed that drop
largely to ``debt-equity swaps.'' In such deals, Latin American
debtors who owe debts to foreigners _ usually foreign banks _ in
dollars or other hard currencies are allowed to pay in their own
currency. The creditor then uses the money to buy property or
business in that country.
   The report estimated foreign debt of the 25 countries at $426
billion in 1988, down from $441 billion the year before.

   Leaders of a House subcommittee told a federal
judge who will sentence former officials of two generic drug
manufacturers that the companies have not cooperated fully with the
panel and have misled investigators.
   In a letter to U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove in Baltimore,
U.S. Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, and Thomas Bliley, R-Va., the
panel's ranking Republican, said the companies' cooperation has been
``grudging and limited.''
   The letter was released Sunday by the congressmen.
   Ashok Patel, former senior vice president of Par Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Dilip Shah, former president of
Quad Pharmaceutical Inc., an Indianapolis-based subsidiary of Par,
pleaded guilty to bribing Food and Drug Administration chemists to
win approval for generic drug applications.
   The congressmen, whose panel initiated an inquiry into the
generic drug industry that has resulted in charges against three FDA
employees and action to take dozens of generic drugs off the market,
told the judge the problems within the two companies are
``widespread.''
   ``Wholesale management changes will be needed to eradicate the
corporate cultures that helped lead to the charges before you,''
Dingell and Bliley told the judge.
   Current and former officials of the two companies, including
Ashok and Patel, were subpoenaed to testify before the subcommittee
Monday.
   FDA officials also were scheduled to testify about recent
inspections at the plants of 11 generic drug companies being
investigated by the agency.

<HEAD>Mazada Says It Will Increase Use Of Foreign Semiconductors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp., the Japanese carmaker, said
Sunday it would increase its use of non-Japanese semiconductors
sevenfold to $8.9 million a year by 1992 compared with the 1988
level.
   The company said it planned to use $2.7 million worth of foreign
semiconductors in its cars this year.
   To achieve its goal, Mazda said it plans to establish a Foreign
Semiconductor Procurement Promotion Committee incorporating the
company's electronic component suppliers through whom the parts will
be purchased.
   Under a policy of expanding the use of foreign control parts in
its cars, Mazda said it uses foreign electronic control units in the
air bag system of its MX-5 Miata two-seat sports car and in the
air-bag control system of its MPV minivan, B-Series pickup truck and
four-wheel-drive 323 models.
   Nearly 100 percent of the semiconductors in these systems are
foreign-made, coming from such U.S. companies as Motorola Inc.,
Intel Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp., Mazda said in a press
release issued from Detroit.
