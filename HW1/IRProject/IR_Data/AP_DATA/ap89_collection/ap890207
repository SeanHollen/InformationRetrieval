<HEAD>Jazz Pianist Dave Brubeck Has Successful Heart Surgery</HEAD>

   Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck underwent
successful triple-bypass heart surgery Tuesday at Yale-New Haven
Hospital, officials said.
   Brubeck, 68, underwent 4{ hours of surgery and was listed in
critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit, hospital
spokeswoman Cathy Zaorski said.
   Doctors had been watching Brubeck's problems with clogged
arteries for about eight years, but decided only recently that he
should undergo surgery, Brubeck's manager Russell Gloyd said.
   Brubeck, who lives in Wilton, plans to resume limited travel and
performances in a couple of months, Gloyd said.
   Zaorski said Brubeck would remain in the hospital for a week to
10 days.
   Gloyd said he was unsure when Brubeck would be able to perform
again.
   ``We're looking at that right now. It's all going to depend on
his recovery. We're hoping that within two to three months he can
begin a limited performance schedule.''

   A bus driver yelled ``I have no brakes''
moments before a city bus slid off a winding stretch of road and
plunged down a 60-foot cliff, killing 19 people and injuring 22,
authorities said.
   The accident Monday occurred about four miles from downtown on a
curved, steep portion of road on the outskirts of this Baja
California resort, fire department officials said.
   Of the 22 injured treated at local hospitals, several were said
to be in critical condition, said Miroslava Cuellar, a spokeswoman
for the city of Ensenada.
   The bus, operated by the Rojo y Blanco line, had not had a
mechanical inspection in five years and had no insurance as required
by state law, Cuellar said.
   ``It is well-known that there is corruption between the transport
companies and state transit officials,'' she said. ``Considering
that these vehicles are allowed to operate without inspections and
without insurance and that drivers are paid not a salary but by the
number of passengers they can cram into their buses, it is clear
there is corruption.''
   The bus driver and 13 passengers died in the accident. Five more
passengers died at hospitals on Monday and Tuesday, Chavez said.
   A spokesman for the fire department, Jose Luis Chavez, said bus
driver Enrique Hernandez de Jesus apparently lost control of the
vehicle while trying to negotiate the curve.
   One surviving passenger reportedly told investigators that the
bus driver said, ``Hang on tight, I have no brakes,'' moments before
the bus slid over the cliff.
   Chavez said he hoped the tragedy would bring an investigation of
bus transit practices in Ensenada. He said some of the buses were so
unworthy that they were no better than ``coffins on wheels.''
   A woman who lives about 200 yards from the accident scene said
she ran to see what happened after hearing a tremendous crash.
   ``It was a horror scene,'' said Leticia Perez de la Rosa.
``People were screaming, begging for help and I started to cry.''
   A mass funeral service is planned Wednesday for the dead, said
Ramon Moreno, owner of a funeral home that is handling the
arrangements.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Says U.S. Should Mediate Peace Talks With Mozambique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should act as a
mediator between South Africa and Mozambique in a bid to resolve
Mozambique's 12-year civil war, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said
Tuesday.
   Botha said at a news briefing that the talks should include the
governments of South Africa and Mozambique, with the United States
mediating and the Soviet Union welcome to participate.
   He did not say if the talks should include rebels of the
Mozambique National Resistance, who have been waging a guerrilla war
since 1977 in a bid to undermine the country's Marxist government.
   South Africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s, but says it
halted assistance in 1984 under the terms of a mutual non-aggression
pact with Mozambique.
   Mozambique has accused South Africa of continuing to aid the
rebels, a charge South Africa denies. South African President P.W.
Botha visited Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano in September
and relations have improved during the past year, although
Mozambican officials still contend on occasion that South Africa
continues to support the guerrillas.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have ravaged
Mozambique's economy with hit-and-run attacks on civilian and
military targets.
   Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and an
estimated 6 million of its 15 million people need food aid.
   The United States is the leading donor of aid to Mozambique,
which has increased ties with Western nations in recent years
although most of its weapons come from the Soviet Union.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that (the Mozambique) war will
have to stop,'' Botha said. ``I have no illusions about what is
ahead of us, but I know it can be done.''
   He said he envisioned negotiations similar to last year's talks
on southern Africa involving Cuba, Angola, South Africa and U.S.
mediators. More than a dozen rounds of negotiations culminated in
December with an agreement for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 troops
from Angola and for South Africa to grant independence to Namibia,
or South-West Africa.
   Botha said today that the southern Africa agreement appears on
track. Cuba already has withdrawn more than 3,000 soldiers from
Angola, although it was not required to reach that figure until
April 1.
   South Africa is to begin implementing Namibian independence on
April 1, leading to U.N.-supervised elections Nov. 1.
   The Angolan rebel movement UNITA was not included in the peace
talks and has vowed to continue the 13-year-old war until it has a
power-sharing agreement with Angola's Marxist government.
   It is not clear how the Mozambique National Resistance would
respond to any regional peace agreement in which it did not
participate.

   Jury deliberations began Tuesday in the murder
trial of Billy Glaze, who was depicted by the prosecution as a
pathological killer still savoring the ``ghoulish'' murders of three
American Indian women.
   ``He hated women and he particularly hated Indian women,''
prosecutor Pete Connors told the jury of eight women and four men in
his closing argument. ``He had a fury in his gut. He wanted to hurt
them and hurt them badly and he wanted to kill them and to have them
die in anguish.''
   ``Mr. Glaze had hellish fantasies that he couldn't keep to
himself and he acted on them,'' Connors said.
   Defense attorney Michael Colich decried the lack of physical
evidence in the case and attacked the credibility of prosecution
witnesses. The witnesses placed Glaze at the scenes of two slayings
and in the presence of the three victims before their deaths.
   The jury, which got the case Tuesday afternoon after 11 days of
testimony, retired for the night and was to resume deliberations
Wednesday.
   Glaze, 45, a drifter who pretended he was an American Indian,
went on trial Jan. 23 on six counts of first-degree murder in the
sexual mutilation and slayings of Kathleen Bullman, 19, Angeline
Whitebird-Sweet, 27, and Angela Green, 26, in 1986 and 1987 in
Minneapolis.
   Colich, who called only four witnesses compared with 70 brought
by the prosecution, characterized Glaze as a non-violent drifter who
called attention to himself by saying despicable things about women.
He said police were not thorough in their investigation of other
suspects because of public pressure to solve the serial killings.
   ``Not one piece of evidence points to Billy Glaze, but because he
has a bad mouth and because he left town they think he did it,''
Colich said. ``They (police and prosecutors) are going to get that
man if it's the last thing they do.''
   Connors told the jury that Glaze killed the three women in
similar fashion, leaving their nude bodies in places where they
could easily be found. The identical way in which the bodies were
sexually mutilated proved that a pathological killer was responsible
for the deaths, Connors said.
   ``He killed these women in an unbelievably ghoulish fashion and
he's sitting in jail enjoying it,'' Connors said.
   The prosecutor reminded the jury of testimony from former prison
acquaintances of Glaze who said he admitted to the killings. He also
displayed a note written by Glaze that said, ``I killed them. I was
mad at them.''

   Singer Sandi Patti was chosen a finalist
Tuesday as the Gospel Music Association's artist of the year and No.
1 female vocalist.
   Amy Grant, whose music has crossed over to the pop charts, joins
her as a finalist in both categories.
   Other finalists for artist of the year, the top award, are the
brother-sister duet Bebe and Cece Winans, Carman and Steve Green.
   Joining Patti and Grant as finalists for No. 1 female vocalist
are Cece Winans, Margaret Becker and Twila Paris.
   Larnelle Harris, male vocalist of the year in 1988, leads the
finalists for the 1989 honor. Others are Bebe Winans, Carman, Green
and Wayne Watson.
   Winners of the 20th annual awards will be announced during a gala
at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center April 13 during Gospel Music
Week.
   Patti, of Anderson, Ind., has been voted top female vocalist for
seven straight years. She has been voted Christian music's No. 1
artist five times, including the past two years.
   Since 1984, she has won four Grammy awards.
   Last month she performed as part of the inauguration ceremonies
for President Bush.
   Harris, like Miss Patti, has won four Grammy awards. He also is
known for his performances at Billy Graham crusades.
   Grant, of Nashville, joined with ex-Chicago lead singer Peter
Cetera on a No. 1 pop hit, ``Next Time I Fall,'' in 1986. Her
``Unguarded'' and ``Age to Age'' gospel-pop albums have sold more
than 1 million copies apiece.
   Finalists and winners are chosen by the singers, musicians,
songwriters and others in the Nashville-based gospel association,
which has 3,000 members.
   The awards are called the Dove Awards in honor of the bird that
appeared in the biblical account of the baptism of Jesus.
   Harris, of Louisville, Ky., was male vocalist of the year in 1986
and 1983 in addition to last year.

   The second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said Tuesday night he now opposes the nomination
of John Tower to be secretary of defense and added that more FBI
investigation may delay the confirmation vote until after next
week's Senate recess.
   Although he hasn't ``counted noses,'' Sen. James Exon of Nebraska
said in an interview there are other committee members who feel as
he does. Exon said he had been troubled by allegations about the
former Texas senator's drinking and dealings with women, as well as
his financial involvement, but he made up his mind Tuesday.
   Exon said his decision came in the evening after an FBI report
that had been promised was further delayed because of a new,
unspecified allegation. Exon said he was also angry at how the White
House handled what was supposed to have been the final FBI report.
   ``I really came to that decision tonight after, or about, the
time that the FBI report was delayed and after the shenanigans of
today,'' Exon said. ``I can tell you we're not going to vote on this
until we get what looks like the final report.''
   Exon said he was concerned with the ``perception'' that Tower
``has not recovered from what obviously was a drinking problem at
one time,'' and about potential conflicts of interest stemming from
Tower's dealings with defense contractors.
   According to Wednesday's editions of The New York Times,
President Bush called Tower on Tuesday evening to discuss the
allegations against him. Also, the Times reported that the
allegations had to do with Tower's financial dealings.
   Because of the latest allegations since the FBI first
investigated Tower, a report from the agency isn't expected for
several days, Exon and others said. Congress is taking a week's
recess next week. If the panel votes to approve Tower, that
recommendation would then go to the full Senate.
   Exon wouldn't tell The Associated Press whether Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the panel's chairman, is opposed to the nomination, although
both CBS and the Times said he was. Nunn was neither at home nor his
office when the AP tried to reach him.
   At a news conference, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking
Republican on the committee, said White House counsel C. Boyden Gray
told him of the new charge but he was ``not advised'' of the
specifics.
   Nunn's office issued a statement saying: ``The FBI report has not
been delivered to the committee. ... I am informed it has not been
completed.''
   Earlier, Nunn said he had lingering concerns about allegations
against Tower, but GOP senators said a preliminary FBI report
provides no grounds to disqualify Tower.
   Warner said he was briefed by the White House and, in turn,
briefed the GOP members of the committee about the latest FBI
inquiry into the allegations.
   Warner said the preliminary report ``provides, at the judgment of
White House counsel, no basis on which senators could find the
factual situation that would amount to any disqualification.''
   Exon said, however, he never received the report on which the
Republicans were briefed. He then said he found out the report was
not finished.
   The committee last Thursday put off a vote on whether to
recommend full Senate confirmation and asked the FBI to review the
allegations.
   At the White House, Bush met with Nunn and Warner for about 45
minutes _ a meeting requested by the committee chairman, according
to Warner. The Tower nomination was among the topics discussed,
Warner said.
   In the meeting with Nunn, Bush reiterated his support for Tower.
   ``The president told him Tower was an excellent nominee and hoped
there'd be a vote soon,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``He (Nunn) did not speak out against it or ask that it
be withdrawn.''
   Warner said he has asked that Nunn be briefed by the White House
and the full committee assemble to see the written FBI report when
it is finished.
   But Nunn expressed irritation at not being informed about the
briefing to Warner. ``Obviously, there have been some unofficial
briefings going on that I as chairman of the committee have not been
part of,'' he said.
   Nunn said he won't be satisfied with an oral report. ``I like to
read the answers and reflect on them. You have to put the whole
picture together and make your conclusions from it.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., emerging from a luncheon meeting of
Democratic senators, said Nunn had told senators that cooperation
inside the panel was ``breaking down on partisan lines.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services
committee, said all the charges ``that I know of were without
substance.''
   ``We can't have an open-ended situation where we're going to wait
until all the allegations are in. We have to have a vote,'' he said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is not a member of the committee,
said there was an impression among GOP senators that ``there may be
an underlying attempt to delay the nomination.''
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who attended the briefing with
Warner, said: ``There has been no substantiation of the major charge
which prompted the new investigation.''
   ``Republicans think it's time to vote,'' Cohen added.
   But Nunn said all allegations have to be considered, saying the
committee would look foolish if more charges surfaced after a
cursory review of the charges.
   Warner, as he emerged from a meeting with Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., and GOP members of the panel, said he expects the
panel to vote after it reviews the report. He did not provide a
specific time.
   ``It is my expectation the committee will find, as I have found,
that the evidence in part one, two, three, four and now part five,
which will be made available, does not provide a basis for any
disqualification,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Women Sue Doctor For Impregnating Them, Then Aborting Fetuses
^Eds: Note contents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor is being sued by two former
patients who say he took them out socially and impregnated them,
then performed unwanted abortions on them, including one whose fetus
was in its eighth month.
   Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger of Anderson sued Dr. Pravin D.
Thakkar, an obstetrician-gynecologist, in Madison Circuit Court last
week. Kathy Collins of Madison County filed her claim against the
doctor Nov. 4.
   Hertzinger claims she became Thakkar's patient in October 1982.
On her first visit to his office in nearby Frankton, about 30 miles
northeast of Indianapolis, Thakkar suggested they see each other
socially and Hertzinger accepted, according to the complaint.
   Hertzinger claims she became pregnant with Thakkar's child in
February 1983. Thakkar is accused of administering drugs to
Hertzinger the following Oct. 28 and causing her to deliver the
eight-month-old fetus in his home. He told her the baby was
stillborn and he had taken care of it, the complaint says.
   However, Hertzinger said Tuesday that she was conscious during
part of the procedure and heard a baby's cry.
   ``I was very much conscious at the time that I heard my baby
cry,'' she told WISH-TV in Indianapolis. ``There were many times of
unconsciousness but this was a time that I was very conscious and
there's something about a baby's cry that you don't forget.''
   Thakkar, who continues to practice medicine, denied the
allegations.
   ``All I can say is the facts in the matter will not stand up to
these allegations,'' he said.
   Thakkar's attorney, Michael Lacey, said he was told Hertzinger's
infant was stillborn at a local hospital. WISH-TV reported Tuesday
that although state law would require a death certificate for a
stillbirth, none was filed with the Madison County Health Department
during that time.
   Lacey also said the Indiana attorney general's office was
investigating Thakkar as a result of the complaints.
   Collins claims Thakkar fathered her unborn child and that he
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument during an examination on
Jan. 9, 1988.
   During the examination, Collins said Tuesday, Thakkar told her
she was not carrying a child.
   ``I breathed a sigh of relief and I felt an excruciating pain
that sent me to the top of the examining table,'' she said. ``I felt
the instrument dragging on the examining table.... I told him to
take it out.''
   Thakkar again manipulated the instrument, causing more pain, she
said.
   ``At that point, I just rolled off the top of the examining
table. The instrument fell out and I went to the bathroom,'' she
said.
   Thakkar also denied Collins' claims, but did say he had an
on-again, off-again relationship with her at one time.
   Indianapolis attorney Robert York, who represents both women,
said they were seeking damages for the loss of the fetuses and for
emotional harm.
   ``I can't imagine what it would be like to be a mother and have
something growing inside you that you wanted and to have it taken
from you in the way that it was,'' York said.
   Madison Circuit Judge Fredrick Spencer signed a temporary
restraining order against Thakkar on Thursday preventing him from
attempting to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of his assets
pending a hearing Feb. 13.
   The order came after York filed a petition to set up a
receivership for Thakkar's assets, claiming the doctor advertised to
sell real estate in Madison County after Collins filed her complaint.

   Q. Mr. President, there have been hints that Gorbachev may
propose a test to defuse the situation in Central America. I wonder
if you see the possibility of superpower deals in Central America
and, if so, what you _ if you could suggest what would be acceptable
to you?
   A. I don't know about a deal, but I can see a possibility of
cooperation in Central America, because I would like the Soviets to
understand that we have very special interests in this hemisphere,
particularly in Central America, and that our commitment to
democracy and to freedom and free elections and these principles is
unshakable.
   And I don't think they really have substantive interests in this
part of the world, certainly none that rival ours.
   So, I would like to think they would understand that.
   And there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new
spirit of cooperation, and this would clearly be one of them.
   So, I'd like to think that is the way that the matter would be
approached by the Soviets.
   Yeah, a follow-up.
   Q. Could I follow up and ask you whether an understanding on
Central America, whether you'd be willing to include abandonment of
aid to the Contras as part of such an understanding?
   A. I wouldn't make a deal on that with the Soviets, nor would
that come up.
   I don't believe you'd ever have a _ I can't see a situation of
that nature arising, knowing, as I do, what will be negotiated and
discussed with the _ so I think that's a _ so hypothetical as to not
even be a possibility of any kind.
   Yeah, Charles, and then I do have to run.
   Q. Mr. President, we still don't know what the taxpayer's burden
is in here out of this $40 billion and cents, first from S&amp;L funds
and the shortfall from treasury funds. How big is it, and have you,
in going through your budget, had to knock out some things to pay
for this?
   A. We've had to knock out a lot of things on the overall budget
for a lot of different reasons, but I'd like to leave this to Dick
for the questioning, to give the specific amounts.
   It is shared, as I've indicated, and he can give you the amounts
that are involved.

   A. We didn't get that far back, no.
   But if there's been an egregious offense to those in the back
benches, I will take one parting question, and inasmuch as you
raised it, fire away.
   Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Back on the ethics issue,
a couple of your prospective _
   A. Mindful that the last question always does get you in great
trouble. Go ahead. (Laughter.)
   Q. A couple of your prospective nominees _ one of your
prospective nominees and your counsel have just recently changed
their minds on matters that would have violated the ethics rules
under the Reagan administration. Did you have difficulty in getting
the word out that times would be tougher under your administration?
   A. No, I don't think so.
   For example, if you're referring to the Boyden Gray matter, which
I think you are, that matter was reviewed every single year by the
Office of Government Ethics.
   And he was deemed in compliance every single year.
   But now we've got a new ball game here.
   He's the general counsel here in the White House, and I'm the
president.
   And I've set out rhetorically the highest possible standards and
we're trying to back that up by findings from this commission.
   And so, I do think that _ that we've got _ we've got to be very
careful about perceptions of impropriety when it comes to conflict
of interest, not rumors or innuendoes of one sort or another.
   I don't think you can _ I should deal in those things.
   But when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest, I'd like
our people to bend over backwards.
   And I think that's what has happened in both the question of Lou
Sullivan, whether he's entitled to _ all he did was ask, ``Am I
entitled to continue these arrangements with this small university?''
   And all Boyden did, in my view now, is to try to go a step beyond
what the government ethics office has said to avoid the perception
of impropriety.
   But _ so, I think it might be different now.
   I have to approach it differently as president, not that you have
lower standards, but I just think that again, this whole question o
perception, we've got to look at it very, very carefully.
   But I want to be fair.
   I do not want to have the loudest charge, no matter how
irresponsible, be that that sets the standards.
   We've got to achieve more objective standards.
   And that's why I'm putting a lot of faith in the _ hope to put a
lot of faith in the findings of Judge Wilkey and former Attorney
General Griffin Bell.
   And they will be looking at all these matters in terms of
reality, and then to some degree I'm sure, in terms of perception.

<TEXT>
   So, what might be legal and what might be perfectly sound
ethically might have to be altered, given this new approach because
of perception.
   It's a delicate one.
   I don't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible
way that good people just throw up their hands and say, ``Look, who
needs that kind of grief? Who needs it? Why should I have to give up
all my whatever it is, my health plan from the XYZ Company?''
   And yet, on the other hand, we're in a different time now; we're
in a time when we've got to try to set these standards as high as
possible.
   So, I think Dr. Sullivan did the right thing in asking what was
proper.
   I think Boyden Gray did the correct thing every year in asking
what was proper and reviewing his own personal holdings in a family
company with the ethics office, but now, taking another step because
of perception in this case.
   So, we've got to reach _ we've got to work with these individuals
to find the proper answer, and we've got to work with the commission
to try to codify these standards.
   Q. Sir, if I might follow up, you said during the campaign very
clearly that your staffers would not take outside income. I wonder
why they need a legal opinion to understand that.
   A. They had a legal opinion saying it was perfectly proper from
this family company.
   And so, now we're changing that and saying, ``Look, there's this
different perception problem here in this new era, so let's bend
over as far backwards as we possibly can to recognize that.''
   Thank you all very much.
   Q. What about leveraged buyouts, Mr. President?
   A. There's your LBO man right there. (Referring to Brady.)
   (Laughter.)

<TEXT>
   There's no way of getting around it anymore _
London has become a filthy city.
   And this, despite its manicured gardens, carefully preserved
historic monuments and architectural treasures.
   Some of the capital's littered streets have become obstacle
courses of trash bags, fast-food wrappers, beer cans and dog
droppings.
   British VIPs are forever returning from abroad saying how
littered London looks compared with shiny Zurich or spotless
Brussels.
   ``Too much of London has become dirty, degrading and
depressing,'' says the latest report on the city's litter scourge.
   London, with nearly 7 million residents, generates about 14
million tons of waste annually, says Jeff Cooper of the London Waste
Regulation Authority, a watchdog body. New York City, with a
population of more than 7 million, collected 8 million tons of trash
last year, according to the city's sanitation department.
   A lot of London's garbage becomes litter.
   To reach the trendy restaurants and West End theaters of Soho or
Covent Garden, patrons often must dodge overflowing garbage bags
heaped on curbs and around lampposts.
   At subway stations, commuters tread gingerly over slippery potato
chip bags and cellophane wrappers and step around wads of gum that
cover stairways and escalators.
   In London's financial district, stockbrokers and bankers leave a
daily 90-ton trail of newspapers, coffee cups and fast-food wrappers.
   ``London is well on the way to gaining an unenviable distinction
of being the most littered and cluttered capital of any advanced
country in the world,'' said Lord St. John of Fawsley, chairman of
the Royal Fine Art Commission, which released the latest litter
report.
   ``Our streets are disfigured by rubbish.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has threatened tougher litter
laws and some communities are trying to clean up their sidewalks.
   The problem is that many Britons simply believe it's someone
else's job to pick up after them, say Judy Hillman, who wrote the
report, and Graham Ashworth, director general of the Tidy Britain
Group.
   The litter threatens London's tourist industry, says Michael
Medlicott, chief executive of the British Tourist Authority.
   ``We have a bad reputation and a bad image,'' he said. ``London
is one of the dirtiest cities in the world.''
   The Tidy Britain Group, a charity, has produced a TV ad showing
central London's Oxford Street crowded with pigs _ of the two-legged
and four-legged varieties.
   A man is seen sprouting a pig's tail through his trousers as he
opens a letter and discards it in a hedge. A woman at a bus stop
tosses a used tissue under her seat, and her hand becomes a pig's
hoof.
   ``Lack of personal discipline is undoubtedly largely to blame,''
Ms. Hillman says.
   ``Whether or not this decline in standards out of the home stems
from the permissive society, lack of parental control, bad manners
or overexpectation with regard to the ability of `them' to create
and maintain a clean environment for `us,' the result is plain to
see.''
   There are other factors, too.
   Few London boroughs have ``pooper-scooper'' laws, so pet owners
don't clean up after their animals.
   Recycling isn't common and cans and bottles carry no refund. Most
Londoners live in apartments with little kitchen or communal storage
space, and many must put their trash bags on the curb days before it
is collected.
   Some businesses, reluctant to lose selling space, dump empty
crates and packaging outside their doors.
   Ms. Hillman's report, ``A New Look For London,'' was commissioned
after Mrs. Thatcher, accompanying French President Francois
Mitterrand from Heathrow Airport to central London in 1986, was
angered by the litter she saw from her limousine.
   She ``blew her top,'' said Lord St. John. Earlier this year, she
said stiffer laws might be in order.
   The current law carries a maximum fine of about $700. But
authorities say the average fine is only about $50, and prosecutors
must prove the accused had no intention of coming back later to
collect the litter.
   The borough of Kensington is fighting back by looking through
illegally dumped trash for something that might identify the
culprit. If the trash-sifters find a clue, such as an addressed
envelope, they send the owner photocopies of the evidence and a
warning.
   In Westminster, new laws empower about 70 outdoor workers to warn
litterers to pick up their garbage or face a fine of about $17.50.

   Barbara Tuchman, a two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning author whose books revealed the lessons of history,
died Monday of complications following a stroke. She was 77.
   Tuchman was admitted to Greenwich Hospital on Saturday and died
Monday afternoon, said hospital spokeswoman Eleanor Hannon.
   Tuchman's latest book, ``The First Salute,'' a look at the
American Revolution and the Dutch revolution that preceded it by 200
years, has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than
nine weeks.
   She said it would be her last book because of failing eyesight.
   Tuchman wrote 10 books, winning the Pulitzer Prize for history
for ``The Guns of August'' in 1962, and for ``Stilwell and the
American Experience in China'' in 1971.
   In 1978, she was awarded the Gold Medal for History of the
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She has received
22 honorary doctorates.
   She also wrote ``The Proud Tower,'' a story of Europe before
World War I, and ``A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,''
which traces the tumult of the period by following the career of a
feudal lord, Enguerrand de Coucy VII.
   ``The Guns of August,'' the book that brought her fame when it
was published, examined how the military buildup in Europe during
the opening years of this century led inexorably to the outbreak of
World War I.
   It was a favorite of President John F. Kennedy because of its
lessons for leaders in the nuclear age and he presented a copy to
British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.
   Tuchman was born on Jan. 30, 1912, in New York City and graduated
from Radcliffe College in 1933. She lived in Greenwich.
   Her mother, Alma Morgenthau, was the daughter of Henry Morgenthau
Sr., Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to Turkey.
   While sailing with her family to visit her grandfather in Turkey
in August 1914, Tuchman witnessed the naval battle between the
English ship Gloucester and the German ship Goeben in the
Mediterrean. Although only a young child at the time, Tuchman said
the battle remained a vivid memory through frequent family retelling
and she recounted it in ``The Guns of August.''
   Tuchman began her writing career as an editorial assistant and
occasional correspondent for The Nation, which her father,
investment banker Maurice Wertheim, bought in 1935 to save from
bankruptcy. She covered President Roosevelt's 1936 campaign and the
Spanish Civil War.
   During World War II, she worked for the U.S. Office of War
Information. She once described her job as ``to write stories beamed
to Europe, trying to acquaint our European listeners, much against
their will, with the extent of America's war effort in the Far
East.''
   Her first book was ``Bible and Sword,'' an account of the
founding of Israel, which was published in 1956 after being rejected
by a number of publishers.
   ``The experience of writing history affected me as I suppose
heroin does the addict and from then on I was caught,'' she wrote in
an autobiographical sketch.
   ``As an historian, I belong to the How rather than the Why
school,'' Tuchman wrote. ``I am a seeker of the small facts not the
big Explanation; a narrator not a philospher. ...''
   ``With each book I approached nearer, as I hope, to my goal of
presenting history as literature.''
   She married Lester R. Tuchman, a physician, on June 18, 1940,
``as it happened on the day that Paris fell, which then seemed to us
almost more important than marriage.''
   She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in
1971.
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by three daughters,
four grandchildren and a sister.

<HEAD>Moslem Guerrillas Smash Farms Needed For Reconstruction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GHAZI ABAD, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas who captured the
huge Ghazi Abad government farm smashed much of the equipment,
despite its importance to reconstruction, because it was made by the
hated Soviets.
   Offices, classrooms and residential buildings were damaged,
machinery was burned, livestock were taken away and milking machines
and other modern equipment smashed.
   Burned-out tractors and bulldozers dotted the tree-lined roads of
the farm 15 miles east of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, along
with hulks of Afghan army tanks and trucks. Charred remains of
textbooks and farming manuals, the residue of guerrilla bonfires,
littered roadside flower beds.
   A billboard advertising a film on modern farming methods still
hung above the entrance of a movie theater that had been set afire.
   ``We burned it because it showed Russian films,'' said one of the
guerrillas who drove government forces out of Ghazi Abad last month.
   A guerrilla giving a tour of the dairy section of the complex
shrugged off questions about the wrecked milking equipment. ``We
don't want enemy cows,'' he said.
   Scores of mujahedeen _ the ``Islamic holy warriors'' who began
fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago _ sat in the abandoned
buildings in turbans or fur hats, brewing tea and talking.
   Others manned rocket launchers outside, sitting on small benches
taken from classrooms. Some decorated their weapons with pink roses.
   Guerrilla commanders said every effort was being made to limit
damage as their forces push back government troops, noting the value
of modern complexes like Ghazi Abad in rebuilding.
   Some admitted it was difficult to restrain their men and keep
them from attacking anything associated with the Marxist government
and its Soviet sponsors.
   ``We know there are mujahedeen who only think about fighting,''
said Ahman Ehsan, a guerrilla guide. ``They don't think about the
future, that we will need this place.''
   Every effort will be made to avoid major attacks on cities in
order to minimize civilian casualties, the commanders said, adding
that their men had been told to protect civilians and avoid causing
damage whenever possible.
   Some guerrillas said they wrecked parts of Ghazi Abad because the
buildings and equipment were made by the Soviets.
   ``We don't want help from Russia,'' not even functioning farm
equipment, said Khialuddin, a young guerrilla commander who uses
only one name. He pointed at a row of damaged Soviet combine
harvesters.
   He and other commanders said the government formed after the fall
of teh Marxist regime, which they predict is imminent, will look to
Western nations for aid and equipment to rebuild and modernize the
country. The United States has been the chief arms supplier to
insurgents based in neighboring Pakistan.
   ``In the future, when an Islamic government is built, we don't
want Russian equipment; we want American and Japanese equipment,''
Khialuddin said.
   Commanders at Ghazi Abad said the complex would be reconstructed.
The large orchards, some buildings and the irrigation system were
not damaged.
   The farm was built by Soviet experts in the late 1960s under an
agreement with Zaher Shah, the last king, to help develop and teach
modern farming methods. Afghanistan is among the world's poorest
nations and exiles say it has few advanced agricultural centers
   Soviet technicians helped manage the farm after the Kremlin sent
military forces to Afghanistan in December 1979. The last Red Army
units now are withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated agreement and all
are to be out by Feb. 15.
   Ghazi Abad's large orange and grapefruit crops were exported to
the Soviet Union, the guerrillas said, displaying production records
in Russian.
   A few Soviet newspapers, textbooks and cigarette packs scattered
through the administration buildings were the only signs of of the
foreigners who left a few months ago.
   ``Death to the Russians'' was painted on an office wall.

<HEAD>Governor Files FCC Petition To Block Pension System Purchase Of TV

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Guy Hunt filed a petition Monday
with the Federal Communications Commission to block the state
pension system from buying a television station, saying it raised
troubling First Amendment issues.
   Hunt objected to the $70 million purchase agreement on several
grounds, including freedom of press implications raised by a
state-funded agency gaining control of a major news outlet in the
seat of government.
   David Bronner, who manages the $8 billion portfolio of the
Retirement Systems of Alabama, has defended his decision to buy
WSFA-TV from Cosmos Broadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C. He said
there would be no tampering with the news product.
   ``We're glad the issue is before the FCC, where it ought to be,''
said Bill Stephens, an attorney for the retirment systems.
   Monday was the deadline for petitions to be filed concerning
transfer of the WSFA license. The Hunt petition asks the federal
agency to delay any decision until the courts in Alabama resolve
legal issues raised by the purchase agreement.
   The FCC petition by Hunt sets in motion what may be a protracted
legal fight. Bronner has said the purchase is a ``done deal,''
needing only FCC approval.
   ``It is not a done deal,'' said Hunt at a news conference Monday.
   The petition filed by Hunt contends the purchase of the
long-dominant commercial television station in the state capital
``raises clear and very troubling First Amendment issues.''
   The petition says the purchase also would violate Alabama law
barring government from entering the field of private enterprise. It
further says the deal would violate FCC rules by giving state
government two broadcast outlets in Montgomery, counting the state's
educational television operation.
   William Walsh, deputy secretary-treasurer of the retirement
systems, says pension program officials feel there is no conflict
with state law. Already, he said, ``the state is involved in the
whisky business, the state is in the hotel and motel business, the
state runs the state docks.''
   Walsh referred to the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board
that regulates liquor sales, most of which are sold from state-run
stores, and state-owned resorts that are part of Alabama's state
park system.

   Phil Donahue dressed in drag for a show
on transvestites, but talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael has gone
one further: She donned a hooker's outfit on New York's 42nd Street
and got a proposition.
   Raphael's stunt was filmed for a Feb. 20 show on prostitutes and
their families.
   ``One of the things these women say when you go to interview them
is, `You haven't walked in our shoes.' Well, Sally _ who is not a
big fan of all that _ walked in their shoes,'' said Burt Dubrow,
executive producer of Raphael's nationally syndicated talk show,
normally filmed at WTNH in New Haven.
   After interviewing a hooker, Raphael last week put on an outfit
Dubrow described as tasteless and joined the woman on 42nd Street.
   Dubrow said some passers-by recognized Raphael immediately
because of her trademark red eyeglasses. There was an attempt to
proposition her, but ``it stopped as soon as they realized who she
was,'' he said.
   ``You won't see that on tape,'' Dubrow added.
   Raphael was in Florida on Monday and couldn't be reached for

   John McEnroe said he has lost the intensity that
made him the top-ranked player in tennis because the game just
``doesn't seem quite as important.''
   ``I wish I loved tennis like Magic Johnson loves basketball or
Pete Rose loves baseball, but I never did,'' McEnroe, who is entered
in the $300,000 Volvo Chicago tennis tournament that starts today,
told the Chicago Tribune.
   ``When I look back _ and it's easy to look back _ if I was Number
One again I would handle it differently and enjoy it much more.
Instead, I felt there was nowhere to go but down.''
   McEnroe, who turns 30 next week, is ranked No. 3 in the
tournament, behind top-ranked Ivan Lendl and Jimmy Connors.
   ``I don't feel I'm giving 100 percent,'' McEnroe said, ``and
that's more important at this moment than being Number One. The fire
isn't burning, the flame has sort of dimmed a bit.
   ``It doesn't seem quite as important. I've been through it all so

   Country singer Johnny Paycheck was taken
to jail after a judge confirmed his 7-to-9{-year sentence for a 1985
tavern shooting, despite the singer's plea for mercy.
   Paycheck, 50, best known for his 1978 hit ``Take This Job and
Shove It,'' said he needs to give concerts to earn money for his
wife's cancer treatment. He said they don't have health insurance.
   ``If I'm taken away, my wife will be dead in six months,''
Paycheck told Highland County Common Pleas Judge Darrell Hottle on
Monday.
   But after hearing testimony from Paycheck and four character
witnesses, Hottle gave Paycheck the same term he ordered in 1986.
The 4th Ohio District Court of Appeals had ordered the resentencing
hearing to allow Paycheck to present testimony that could have led
to a shorter sentence.
   Paycheck, whose real name is Donnie Lytle, was convicted of
aggravated assault, tampering with evidence and use of a firearm
during a felony.
   Paycheck was handcuffed and taken to a Hillsboro-area jail to
await transfer later this week to a state prison.

   Country singer Tammy Wynette has agreed
to pay $450,000 to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to
settle a federal claim stemming from a failed savings and loan.
   ``I am just tickled to death with this settlement, and Tammy and
(husband-manager) George (Richey) are, too,'' their attorney, Ralph
S. Gordon, said Monday.
   Wynette and Richey filed an emergency bankruptcy petition Sept.
20 after a U.S. marshal showed up with a court order to seize the
furnishings of their $1.5 million home.
   The couple had invested in a shopping mall in Florida. But when
their lender, a savings and loan, failed, a $750,000 judgment was
entered against Wynette. Interest and costs have pushed that figure
well above $1 million, Gordon said.
   Gordon said the agreement calls for Wynette to pay $350,000 as
soon as a bankruptcy judge approves it, plus $100,000 over a
six-month period. Wynette and Richey will remain under bankruptcy
court protection until the payments are made, he said.

health-care philanthropy, said the effort, titled ``Fighting Back,''
was aimed at communities of 100,000 to 250,000.
   Regions straddling more than one county or parts of bigger cities
are eligible to apply for the money.
   Up to 12 communities will receive one- or two-year planning
grants of $100,000 a year. Eight will be selected for subsequent
grants of $3 million each over five years.
   Dr. W. Anderson Spickard Jr., professor of medicine at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., will direct the program.
   ``To date, most communities have focused on limiting the supply
of illegal drugs and alcohol _ a crucially important endeavor,''
said Leighton E. Cluff, president of the Princeton, N.J.-based
foundation, in a news release. ``But efforts to reduce the demand
for these substances have been fragmented and short-lived.''
   He said the new initiative ``has been designed to help
communities fight back, using preventive education and treatment to
complement the important law enforcement efforts already under way.''
   Citizens' task forces must submit letters of intent by May 1 and
formally apply by Sept. 1. The initial grants will be awarded in
February 1990.

   A homeless man who won a $2.7 million jackpot
says he plans to get an apartment but will continue to work at the
recycling plant he has called home for years.
   Don Sarbaugh said he also will continue his nightly habit of
gambling at a casino, but has no other firm plans for his new found
wealth.
   ``I'm no different today than I was a week ago,'' said the
54-year-old former vagrant. ``I'm still a reclamation engineer.''
   Sarbaugh was given his first installment of $137,500 on Monday
for hitting the jackpot on a Megabucks machine at the Palace Station
casino. He will be paid in annual installments for 20 years.
   Sarbaugh's boss, George Liquori, said most of the first check is
already spoken for.
   ``He's got a lot of money to repay to Uncle Sam and he has a lot
of debts to pay off,'' said Liquori, who operates Nova Recycling.
``We're going to get him an apartment and pay a year's rent in
advance to set him up. He's not going to have a lot left.''
   Liquori said Sarbaugh has worked and lived at the plant for
several years. He said his diligence at work separated him from the
other homeless people who dropped off cans and newspapers there.
   ``He was there every morning and he was always working hard,
which I respected,'' said Liquori. ``He pretty much lived at the
plant but we're going to find him an apartment now.''
   Sarbaugh appeared at a Monday press conference to announce the
jackpot victory, which occurred Friday night. For the press
conference, Sarbaugh had received a haircut, got his beard trimmed
and was wearing new clothes.
   Sarbaugh said he wouldn't call himself a compulsive gambler, but
admitted he gambled away most of his paychecks.
   ``I gamble because I enjoy it,'' he said. ``This is the first
time I've ever withdrawn something from the Palace Station.''
   Originally from Lancaster, Pa., Sarbaugh came to Las Vegas eight
years ago and has lived on the streets for most of that time. He has
no family in town and says he's been estranged from his two sons for
years.
   Sarbaugh said he may give some money to charity and perhaps take
a trip to the Bahamas.

<HEAD>Experts Counting on Only Slight Increase in Soybean Acreage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are keeping an eye on moisture
conditions and world oilseed supplies as they look ahead to planting
soybeans this spring, the Agriculture Department says.
   As of now the USDA experts are looking for only a slight increase
in this year's soybean acreage from the drought-scarred 1988 season.
But conditions could alter that outlook.
   Results of a USDA survey on planting intentions will be released
on March 31, which will provide the first hard evidence of 1989 crop
production plans. The report will cover corn, wheat, cotton and a
number of other crops in addition to soybeans.
   Soybean production dropped to 1.54 billion bushels last year, the
smallest output since 1976, as the national average yield plummeted
20 percent to 26.8 bushels per acre, the lowest since 1983, another
drought year.
   ``The drought's impact was heaviest in the Corn Belt states of
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio,'' says the
department's Economic Research Service. ``The other major (soybean)
producing regions, the Delta and the Southeastern states, had better
yields in 1988 than in 1987.''
   Last year, in contrast to 1983 when crops appeared normal until
about midsummer, there were indications of drought by mid-June.
   ``By July, some analysts were forecasting the most severe drought
since the 1930s,'' the agency said in a report. ``The market's early
awareness of the drought boosted prices. Although the drought was
severe, the market probably overreacted, and this may affect prices
into early 1989.''
   Soybean prices in central Illinois climbed to $8.92 per bushel
last June but ``have posted declines virtually every month since,''
the agency said. ``Because drought expectations were high and early,
prices may have peaked early.''
   The U.S. soybean acreage rose to a record 71.4 million acres
planted in 1979 from 46.9 million acres in 1972 as world demand
helped bolster exports. But plantings have declined most years since
they were 70.9 million acres in 1982. The 58.9 million acres planted
last year was the first increase in four years.
   ``Soybean acreage in both the eastern and western Corn Belt has
been remarkably stable, particularly since the implementation of the
(1985 farm law),'' the report said.
   Recent changes in programs, however, have given farmers
additional flexibility on plantings, particularly in the Corn Belt
states where soybean prices relative to corn prices are important.
   ``The Southeast and Delta states face a different situation,''
the report said. ``It appears that much of the land planted to
soybeans in the 1970s and early 1980s is now idle,'' the report
said. ``Attractive prices and low land rents could encourage soybean
expansion in the regions.''
   The report added: ``However, acreage reponse is likely to be
limited by the ability to bring fixed resources into production.
Probably, more than one season of attractive prices would be
necessary to move such land back into production.''

   The Agriculture Department says that
conservation planning to protect highly vulnerable land from erosion
has edged close to the two-thirds mark, give or take a few
percentage points.
   As of Jan. 1, the department's Soil Conservation Service said
Monday, plans were completed for 89.2 million acres, or slightly
less than 63 percent of the estimated 141.7 million acres.
   However, SCS chief Wilson Scaling said in his agency's statement:
``We met our goal of having conservation plans on 65 percent of
highly erodible land by Jan. 1.''
   When asked about the discrepancy between Scaling's claim and the
Jan. 1 figures that were provided by the agency, officials said the
141.7 million acres were an estimate that is expected to be adjusted
downward to about 136 million acres at some future point.
   Thus, said spokeswoman Leslie Wilder, the goal for having 65
percent of the plans done by Jan. 1 had been met.
   To remain eligible for USDA programs _ including crop price
supports and other benefits _ farmers who operate highly erodible
cropland must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989.
   As of Jan. 1, conservation plans have been implemented on 25.2
million acres, or 18 percent of the land.

   An Agriculture Department survey of catfish
farmers shows that 1988 sales totaled $284.8 million, up 17 percent
from 1987.
   More than 1,900 catfish farmers in 17 states were surveyed, the
department said Monday. The sales included about $265 million from
production units and $20 million from hatchery operations.
   Losses of 100 million fish were reported in 1988, caused by
disease, 39 percent; oxygen depletion, 18 percent; winterkill, 12
percent; flood, 9 percent; and all other causes, 22 percent.
   As of Jan. 1, catfish hatchery inventories included 1.35 million
broodfish, 85 million stockers and 365 million fingerlings, the
report said. Production units had 3.77 million large fish weighing
more than three pounds each; 147 million food-size, three-quarters
of a pound to three pounds; 261 million stockers and 516 million
fingerlings.
   Here are total sales by states, with 1987 in the first column and
1988 in the second, in thousands of dollars. Georgia and Idaho are
included as ``other'' states but not broken down individually.

   President Bush's proposal for a $50 million
program to combat fraud in the savings and loan industry would
enable immediate deployment of extra investigators to probe 200
pending cases, the Justice Department says.
   ``If this were approved, these people could get right on the
job'' investigating some 200 cases of suspected savings-and-loan
fraud, David Runkel, a spokesman for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, said Monday.
   ``We need more people _ there is no doubt about it,'' Runkel said
after Bush announced that he will ask Congress to appropriate $50
million a year to set up a task force to investigate S&amp;L fraud.
   Bush proposed the ``financial institutions special team'' as part
of his broader plan to raise deposit insurance premiums to help
finance the $100 billion bailout of the troubled thrift industry.
   The $50 million, which must be approved by Congress, would
support deployment of ``a couple of hundred additional FBI agents''
and 80 to 85 more federal prosecutors assigned to S&amp;L fraud, Runkel
said.
   The extra people ``would double in general terms the criminal
division's field investment into this kind of activity,'' Runkel
said.
   After he took office last summer, Thornburgh sought a briefing on
the savings and loan crisis and ``as a result of that briefing
obtained a specific assessment of need,'' Runkel said.
   ``This $50 million was a response to that request by the
department to go after fraudulent activity,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel estimated that about 200 cases of savings-and-loan fraud
either are being investigated by the Justice Department or have been
reported to federal authorities. These include cases ``where we have
some suspicion or we have reason to believe'' that fraud occurred,
he said.
   Runkel declined to say how many of the 200 cases are under active
investigation.
   The special team envisioned by Bush would absorb two separate S&amp;L
fraud units that have investigated alleged wrongdoing by thrift
industry officials in Texas and Oklahoma.

   WASHINGTON _ Consumer complaints against major airlines rose 50
percent in January and airlines reported increases in late flights
and mishandled baggage at the end of last year, but on-time
performance was still well ahead of a year ago, a government report
said Monday.
   The Department of Transportation, in its monthly consumer report
on air travel, said consumer complaints against the industry
reported to the department went from 724 in December _ the lowest
level in four years _ to 1,086 in January. But the new total was
still a 70 percent improvement over the 3,674 complaints received in
January 1988.
   Complaints covered a wide variety of problems, including flight
cancellations, ticketing mistakes, difficulty in getting refunds,
lost baggage, rude employees, problems with smoking restrictions and
misleading advertising.
   The nation's 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 76.1
percent of their flights were on time in December, compared to 77.7
percent a month earlier. The rate was still nearly 10 points better
than December 1987 when one-third of all flights were late.
   A department news release blamed the Christmas-New Year holiday
season for an increase in mishandled baggage reports filed against
the carriers in December. The reports averaged 8.58 per 1,000
passengers compared with 6.17 in November.
   The airlines covered in the monthly consumer report account for
about 90 percent of domestic flight revenue. Carriers are required
to report on operations in and out of the nation's 27 largest
airports.
   For the third month in a row, Eastern Airlines reported the best
on-time record, with 88.1 percent of its flights arriving within 15
minutes of posted time. Earlier this year, Eastern was consistently
among airlines with the most delayed flights. The figures do not
count fights delayed due to mechanical problems.
   Eastern was followed by Southwest with 79.6 percent on time and
Delta with 79.3 percent.
   Piedmont had the worst record for mishandled baggage, 12.27 per
1,000 passengers, and Southwest had the best, 4.59 per 1,000.
   Pan American had the most ticketed passengers denied seats on
overbooked flights, with 10.54 per 10,000 boardings for the first
nine months of 1988.

   The Metropolitan Opera, which first performed
Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' in 1982 starring Luciano Pavarotti, brought it
back Monday night, without Pavarotti. Judging by the number of
people who left before it was over, ``Idomeneo'' isn't going to fare
too well without a superstar.
   There is beautiful music in the opera, which Mozart composed when
he was 24, but it's in the style of its time _ 1781 _ with little to
break up the long solo arias.
   The late Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who designed the production, sets
and costumes, did a marvelous job. The backdrops look like gray
etchings, often serving as screens for projections of the watchful
stone face of Neptune, the sea god Idomeneo betrays.
   Center stairs are flanked by side stairs and pillars. The chorus
comes and goes with finesse and singers move around. Nobody just
stands and sings.
   Still, without superstar talent, nearly four hours of this bores
many modern operagoers, although conductor David Stivender shapes
the music beautifully.
   Siegfried Jerusalem, often featured in Wagnerian operas, sings
Idomeneo. His voice has splendid qualities, full, rich, shot through
with colors.
   He sounded wonderful in the first act Monday night but by Act 2
it was clear that his voice isn't really flexible enough for the
part. He was having to work hard and experiencing difficulties.
   A voice needs to stay clear and true on the long lyric lines of
this music plus sing ornamentation.
   Carol Vaness was the stylist of the evening, sailing through the
music with ease and grace. She sang Elettra, who loves Idomeneo's
son Idamante. But Idamante loves Ilia, sung on Monday by Marvis
Martin, with lovely tone and not enough volume.
   Idamante, written to be sung by a woman, was assigned to
Frederica von Stade, who was ill with the flu. She was replaced by
another top-drawer mezzo-soprano, Susan Quittmeyer. She had some
difficulty with pitch.
   This season, the Met is using a different version of ``Idomeneo''
than last time it staged the opera, in the 1985-86 season. Based on
the Munich premiere of 1781, with a couple of exceptions, it takes
three arias out, puts two arias and a recitative in and leaves one
aria the way Mozart revised it in 1786.

   President Bush appears to be weathering the
first crisis of his presidency without jeopardizing his honeymoon
with Congress.
   Bush had warned that any proposal he devised for bailing out
insolvent savings and loan institutions ``would not be popular,''
but the plan he outlined Monday is winning respect if not enthusiasm
from Democrats and Republicans.
   Now that the first concrete legislative proposal to issue from
the Bush administration has given the president a chance to prove
his leadership, attention shifts to the larger challenge: his budget
address to Congress on Thursday.
   ``We're still waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute. ``So much is going to revolve around the
budget that right now it is more of a test.''
   Bush's bailout, announced after consultation with top financial
aides and leading members of Congress, calls for increased insurance
fees on banks and savings and loans and the issuance of $50 billion
in special bonds to finance the cost of failing institutions.
   Absent is a controversial earlier proposal the administration
floated for a direct fee on depositors.
   However, when pressed on the subject at a news conference, Bush
conceded there was no way of guaranteeing that the insurance
increase wouldn't be passed along to depositors.
   ``Nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of
this magnitude,'' Bush said.
   His plan also would increase the Justice Department's budget by
$50 million to ``seek out and punish'' those whose mismanagement of
S&amp;Ls Bush blamed for much of the problem.
   Bush's plan, according to some analysts, was a relatively
skillful recovery from the awkwardness two weeks ago when his
administration's consideration of a direct fee on depositors became
known.
   A firestorm of criticism followed, both on Capitol Hill and from
the industry. And the criticism did not abate after some top
administration officials, including Chief of Staff John Sununu, kept
the controversy simmering by suggesting publicly that the fee
remained a live option.
   Steve Hess, an analyst on the presidency at the Brookings
Institute, a liberal research organization, said Bush's
self-proclaimed decision to ``face the problem squarely'' even
before his budget speech was ``an effort to regroup.''
   ``It wouldn't have happened had not his administration bungled it
last week,'' Hess said.
   Still, Hess said, Bush's relations with Congress remain good. But
``there's always a honeymoon when there's nothing on the table,'' he
said. ``It may end up as a two-week honeymoon.''
   Bush called his proposal ``the fairest system that the best minds
in this administration can come up with.''
   But, by including congressional budget leaders early on in the
process of developing the scheme, Bush gave the first solid evidence
of his inaugural address vow to extend ``an offered hand'' to
Congress.
   And, for that gesture, members of both parties voiced their
appreciation.
   ``I think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal,''
said Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.
   Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., predicted: ``The major portion of it
will fly.''
   And Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, exclaimed, ``I think you're going
to see some real bipartisanship here.''
   But Gramm added that, even though he supported the president's
approach, any answer to a multibillion-dollar problem wasn't
something you'd want to embrace and ``kiss on the mouth.''
   ``We have a big selling job,'' Bush conceded on Monday.

   Black conservative Robert L. Woodson says he
turned down the No. 2 job at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development out of fear the Bush administration intends to copy the
methods of the Democrats in competing for the loyalty of the
nation's blacks.
   ``Going back to race-specific solutions and re-igniting the alms
race is inadequate to addressing the needs of the black
underclass,'' Woodson said in an interview Monday. ``We've spent $1
trillion in 20 years to aid the problems of the poor and we see now
that one-third of black America is in danger of becoming a permanent
underclass.''
   Woodson said he had been offered the job as undersecretary of HUD
by Secretary Jack Kemp and was undergoing FBI clearance.
   He would have become one of the highest-ranking blacks in the
administration. President Bush has selected only one black for his
Cabinet _ Louis Sullivan, nominated as secretary of health and human
services.
   Woodson noted that Bush has met since his election with Jesse
Jackson, Coretta Scott King and Benjamin Hooks of the NAACP and with
other traditional civil rights leaders.
   He said he feared those sessions showed that the president would
adopt old ideas to the exclusion of ``new approaches by local
grass-roots leaders.''
   Woodson, once mentioned as a possible Bush choice to head HUD, is
the founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
which promotes black self-help efforts and champions turning over
public housing projects to their tenants.
   Previously he was with the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank. He calls himself a ``radical pragmatist.''
   ``It is important for this nation to have competitive ideas,''
Woodson said. ``I'm just fearful that if the Bush administration
limits itself to reaching out to black Americana just through the
civil rights leadership it will miss the opportunity to include the
experiences, views and opinions of grass-roots leaders who represent
the new faces, new ideas.
   ``If I were on the inside and I saw the trend moving in that
direction, I would feel morally bound to speak out and challenge it.
It would be unfair to the administration and to my constituents
among the poor for me to have to be silent. I'm too independent for
that.''

<HEAD>Bush Defends Nominees on Ethics Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said he expects members of his
administration to ``bend over backwards'' to avoid any appearance of
ethical conflicts after several of his top appointees faced
questions on that very issue.
   Bush on Monday said that two of them, White House legal counsel
C. Boyden Gray, who is also Bush's top ethics adviser, and Cabinet
nominee Dr. Louis Sullivan, had gone beyond what was legally
required by disentangling themselves from outside business
arrangements.
   And Bush said he had seen nothing so far beyond rumor and
innuendo regarding a third, Defense Secretary-designate John Tower,
whose confirmation is on hold while a Senate committee checks new
allegations of drinking and womanizing by the former senator.
   Bush launched his administration with a series of events in which
he proclaimed his commitment to ethical government, but several of
his nominees ran into questions on such issues almost immediately.
   Last week, his choice as agriculture secretary, Clayton Yeutter,
acknowledged letting a tobacco company pay for a lavish
inaugural-week reception in his honor. And Bush's choice to head the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, former Rep. Jack Kemp,
ran into questions about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding
House limits. Kemp was confirmed after agreeing to forgo some of the
fees and defer others.
   Gray, who oversees ethics policy for Bush, on Monday resigned as
chairman of a family-owned, multimillion-dollar communications
company that had paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars while he
was on Bush's vice presidential payroll. Gray was not bound by a
Reagan administration policy against such arrangements because he
worked for Bush, who had more lenient standards as vice president.
   ``We are in a new era on these matters,'' Bush said at a news
conference Monday. ``Matters that might have been approved and
looked at one way, may have a different perception today. ... So, I
think it might be different now. I have to approach it differently
as president.''
   Bush said that when it comes to the appearance of conflict of
interest, ``I'd like our people to bend over backwards ... as far as
we possibly can.''
   When his dual role was first reported, Gray had said he would
stop accepting pay from Summit Communications Inc. but would
continue to head the Atlanta-based company.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gray
subsequently decided to resign from Summit on the advice of the
chairman and vice-chairman of Bush's new ethics commission, ``to
avoid any possibility of even the appearance of a conflict.''
   Gray also announced he was putting his personal assets _
estimated at $10 million _ into a blind trust.
   Sullivan, the president's nominee as secretary of health and
human services, last week asked if he could take a paid sabbatical
leave from the Morehouse College School of Medicine while serving in
the Cabinet. Sullivan said later he would forfeit his accumulated
sabbatical pay, estimated at $300,000.
   Bush said that both Gray and Sullivan had gone beyond the law's
requirements to eliminate any questions about propriety.
   Gray could face additional questions, however. The New York Times
reported today that the Office of Government Ethics is investigating
whether Gray should have reported $89,000 in deferred income from
Summit in 1985 and 1986. Donald Campbell, deputy director of the
ethics office, told the Times that deferred income had to be
reported in the year it is earned.
   Bush on Monday also stood by Tower against new allegations of
womanizing and drinking and other matters. Bush said he still
endorses Tower, and that he should not be drummed out of the Cabinet
appointment by rumors.
   Some allegations have been examined by the FBI and found
groundless, Bush said. But he added, ``If somebody comes up with
facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I wouldn't take
another look.''
   Bush's new ethics panel is to come up with recommendations for
ethics standards for the administration and proposed congressional
legislation.
   Bush said that while he wants high ethical standards, he doesn't
want the rules to be so burdensome they keep qualified people out of
government.
   ``I don't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible
way that good people just throw up their hands and say, `Look, who
needs that kind of grief?'''
   ``And yet,'' he added, ``we're in a different time now. We're in
a time when we've got to set these standards as high as possible.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to the highest level in nearly
four years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 8.57 percent, up from 8.33
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.53 percent, up from 8.39 percent

   Congressional leaders are offering cautious
praise for President Bush's plan to bail out the savings and loan
industry, but many are wary of his proposal to sock the taxpayers
for about half the $90 billion initial cost.
   Bush on Monday offered a complex financing scheme mixing tax
dollars with higher insurance premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls.
   He also called for an overhaul of the financial regulatory system
aimed at preventing S&amp;L problems from recurring, vowed to pursue
wrongdoers in the industry and pledged to protect insured deposits.
He recommended no direct fee on depositors.
   ``In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savers
have not lost one dollar of insured deposits and I am determined
that they never will,'' the president said at a news conference.
   Under the Bush plan, which must be approved by Congress, the
government would sell $50 billion in 30-year in bonds as needed over
three years to finance the cost of closing or selling about 350
failed institutions. That's in addition to the $40 billion pledged
last year by regulators to rescue and prop up 223 institutions.
   Insurance premiums paid by financial institutions, combined with
tax dollars, would pay the interest on the bonds and meet
regulators' 1988 commitments. Money to pay off the principal on the
bonds would come from the S&amp;L industry.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, said Bush had presented ``by and large a sensible
proposal'' and that ``the structural reforms make sense.''
   However, Riegle said the taxpayer cost was ``a substantial amount
of money'' and said he was concerned it would cut into other
programs such as the fight against drugs and education.
   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, said the public would
shoulder 54 percent of the burden over the 30-year life of the plan.
He estimated the cost to taxpayers at $28.1 billion from 1989
through 1994. Over 10 years, the cost would be $39.9 billion.
   ``In my view (that) would be a little high,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan,. ``It would begin to crowd some of
these other programs Congress wants, like education, the
environment. ... I would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact.''
   The spending is structured to help the president meet his ``no
new taxes'' pledge by minimizing the impact on the fiscal 1990
budget that Bush will present to Congress on Thursday. Taxpayer
spending would amount to $11.1 billion during the remainder of this
fiscal year, but would dip to $1.9 billion in 1990. It would bounce
back to $6 billion in 1991.
   Bush's plan also would increase the insurance premium paid by
S&amp;Ls from the current $2.08 per $1,000 of deposits to $2.30 from
1991 through 1994, dropping to $1.80 after that. Banks' premiums
would rise from 83 cents now to $1.20 in 1990 to $1.50 after that.
   Administration officials who spoke after Bush left the news
conference stressed that the money raised by the higher bank
premiums would go into the banks' own insurance fund, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., and would not directly pay for S&amp;L problems.
   However, the money raised by the bank premiums would count as
revenue on government balance sheets. Thus, the government would be
able to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year without
adding to the budget deficit.
   ``There is a lot of blue smoke and mirrors in the plan,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee. ``I estimate that the convoluted (scheme for selling the
bonds)) will end up costing the taxpayers $600 million to $1 billion
a year.''
   Banks and savings and loans likely would try to pass on at least
a portion of the higher insurance premiums to consumers, possibly in
the form of lower interest rates on savings accounts.
   ``I would hope that wouldn't happen, but there's no guaranteeing
what the institutions will do,'' Bush said. ``Nothing is without
pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said competition from money
market mutual funds and other investments would prevent S&amp;Ls from
passing on much of the cost. He acknowledged that some banks and
S&amp;Ls may get into trouble because of that.
   ``There may be some (failures) but in the long run we'll have a
much sounder system,'' he said.
   The announcement marked Bush's first attempt as president to deal
with a major problem. He proposed:
   _An administrative merger of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which insures commercial banks, and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which backs S&amp;L deposits. The agencies' staffs
would be combined, but the money in their respective funds would not
be mixed.
   _Placing insolvent S&amp;Ls under the control of the new deposit
agency. However, a separate three-member board headed by the
Treasury secretary would oversee bailout spending.
   _Regulatory changes, including steps to reduce the type of risky
investments that got the industry into difficulty, and an expanded
role for the Treasury Department in supervising S&amp;Ls.
   _Requiring S&amp;L owners to put up more of their own money. By June
1, 1991, capital requirements would be 6 percent, the same as banks
and double the current S&amp;L requirement.
   _An additional $50 million to the Justice Department for
investigation of wrongdoing within the industry. Maximum civil
penalties against S&amp;Ls and banks would be raised to $1 million a day
and criminal penalties against executives would go as high as 20
years in prison. Regulators also would be given authority to pay
rewards to informants.

   Budget Director Richard Darman said the bailout would cost
taxpayers $28.1 billion between 1989 and 1994 of the rescue plan,
and a total of $39.9 billion over 10 years. Over 30 years, the

The premiums would go into the bank insurance fund, and could be
lowered as the fund is built up. The fee for S&amp;Ls, now $2.08 per
$1,000, would rise to $2.30 from 1991 until 1994, when it would

regulators pledged last year to sell or prop up 223 institutions.
   Part of the interest on the bonds would be paid by increasing

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The insurance funds for the two agencies would remain separate,
although the new agency would carry the FDIC name and both banks and
thrifts would post the FDIC sticker on their door.
   The current three-member FDIC board would be expanded to five
members, including the top S&amp;L regulator, the chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>INSOLVENT THRIFTS</BYLINE>

   A newly created Resolution Trust Corporation would be established
to resolve the affairs of insolvent thrifts within five years
although, the FDIC, under contract, would take control of the failed
S&amp;Ls.
   The new corporation would have an oversight board comprised of
the secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board and the head of the General Accounting Office.

Nicholas F. Brady said the current bank board chairman, M. Danny
Wall, would get the job.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Proposal on Death Penalty Greeted Skeptically</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to
speed up resolution of appeals by death row inmates avoids the true
issue, says one legal authority, while the head of America's lawyers
urges caution with any such reform.
   ``The lack of legal resources is the real problem,'' said Tanya
Coke of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, after
Rehnquist unveiled the proposal on Monday.
   American Bar Association President Robert Raven said ``proposals
for reform, even modest ones, must be carefully thought through so
the integrity of the system and the rights of defendants are
protected.''
   Rehnquist told the ABA that reforms are needed to reduce delays
in resolving death penalty appeals that often mean postponing
executions for years.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, the policy-making body for the
nation's largest lawyers' organization, had a busy day in which it
adopted a resolution endorsing legislation to ban discrimination
against homosexuals.
   Twice before, the group rejected similar proposals by narrow
margins.
   The delegates also approved a resolution urging Congress to
repeal the antitrust exemption granted the insurance industry 44
years ago.
   The repeal, if adopted by Congress, would mean increased federal
regulation of an industry lawyers blame for skyrocketing insurance
premiums. Insurance industry officials have charged the lawyers with
responsibility for the so-called liability insurance crisis.
   The ABA also unanimously called on Congress to approve a 50
percent pay-raise package that would mean higher pay for federal
judges. The U.S. House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on
the measure today.
   In his speech on the death penalty and other matters, Rehnquist
acknowledged that many death penalty sentences and convictions are
overturned by federal courts.
   ``But to my mind the flaw in the present system is not that
capital sentences are set aside by federal courts, but that
litigation ultimately resolved in favor of the states takes
literally years and years and years,'' Rehnquist said.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund says about 40
percent of state death penalty convictions and sentences are
overturned by federal courts.
   The chief justice cited the most recent execution in the country,
that of serial killer Ted Bundy in Florida on Jan. 24, as an example
of a system of death penalty appeals that is often ``chaotic and
drawn out unnecessarily.''
   Rehnquist noted that the Supreme Court turned down three separate
emergency pleas in Bundy's behalf hours before he was put to death.
   ``All three of these actions were being prosecuted simultaneously
on the day before the execution of a prisoner who had been on death
row for nine years,'' he said. ``Surely it would be a bold person to
say that this system could not be improved.''
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell was appointed by
Rehnquist to head a committee of federal judges looking into the
question, and the ABA also has a panel studying the issue.
   Rehnquist said he is not calling for a drastic curtailing of the
right of convicted killers to appeal to the federal courts for help.
   Instead he said he wants ``modest changes'' aimed at
consolidating appeals, imposing deadlines for when they can be filed
and assuring death row inmates they will have legal representation
for federal court appeals.
   In some states the average time elapsed between the commission of
a crime and execution is more than 13 years, Rehnquist said. There
are more than 2,000 prisoners on death row nationwide.
   Since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed states to reinstate
the death penalty, there have been 106 executions nationwide.
   More than 11,000 federal court appeals were filed last year in
death penalty cases.
   On another subject, Rehnquist reiterated his endorsement of the
pending increase in pay for federal judges.
   ``These increases simply restore to federal judges the purchasing
power that has been eaten away by inflation over the past 20
years,'' Rehnquist said. ``They are essential if we are to continue
to attract from the financially greener fields of private practice
the sort of experienced and capable lawyers whom we want as judges.''

<HEAD>With PM-Pay Raise Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To help take themselves off the hot seat on the
pay issue, Congress in 1967 established a nine-member Commission on
Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries.
   The commission's job is to recommend to the president every four
years the appropriate pay levels for members of the House and
Senate, federal judges, the president and vice president, and the
top layers of executive-branch workers.
   Three members of the panel are appointed by the president, two by
the president of the Senate, two by the speaker of the House and two
by the chief justice. Their recommendations could be accepted,
rejected or modified by the president, who then includes his final
recommendations in the budget he submits to Congress.
   Under the procedure, unless both the House and Senate vote to
head them off, the recommended raises become law 30 days after the
president proposes them.
   This year's recommendations for a 51 percent pay raise for
members of Congress, and similar increases for other top federal
workers, came from a commission chaired by Lloyd Cutler, a
Washington attorney and former White House counsel to President
Carter.
   Cutler was appointed to the panel by President Reagan, along with
former postmaster general Preston R. Tisch and William Agee,
president of Morrison, Knudsen Corp.
   The president of the Senate _ then-vice president George Bush _
appointed former Sens. Thomas F. Eagleton, D-Mo., and Charles McC.
Mathias, R-Md., to the panel. Appointees of House Speaker Jim Wright
were John J. Creedon of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and
former Rep. William R. Ratchford, D-Conn. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist appointed James Lynn of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. and Carl
Humelsine of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.

   A shy 19-year-old who lived in a trailer
with five other people is charged with killing two roommates and
suspected in four other slayings in what police say could be West
Virginia's biggest killing spree.
   Mark Southern McCallister, whose trailer was found with dead or
malnourished animals, has confessed to killing the two roommates but
has not said why, according to authorities.
   Investigators said they are looking for a motive and evidence to
pin the four other deaths to McCallister. A grand jury began hearing
evidence this week.
   ``Right now, everything in that case is being looked at,'' said
Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes.
   McCallister is charged with killing brothers Billy and Otis
Sanson. Also slain were their sister, Bonnie Sanson; her boyfriend,
Jimmy Price; her former boyfriend, James Schillings; and
McCallister's grandmother, Charlotte Ruby Ferrell.
   Ferrell, 69, was found dead in her home; the other bodies were
found near a three-trailer compound behind the St. Albans Moose
Lodge.
   All were killed by a close-range shotgun blast to the head.
   Since he was 16, McCallister spent much time at the 12-foot-wide
trailer with the Sanson brothers; the Sansons' mother, Carol
Rutherford; and Rutherford's daughter, 8-year-old Tammy, and her
granddaughter, 2-year-old Victoria Pauley.
   The Rutherfords and Sansons took McCallister in after he had an
argument with his parents. But late last year, some family members
say domestic quarrels began at the trailer.
   Mrs. Rutherford, 46, has moved away and won't talk to reporters.
Access to McCallister has been denied by defense attorneys and
prosecutors.
   The Sanson brothers were shot Jan. 8. The four others were found
later.
   Otis, 25, shot in the back and left in a camper trailer, was
found covered with cushions, said assistant prosecutor Reagan
Whitmyer.
   Billy, 27, shot in face, was left in the chicken-wire dog pen, a
makeshift contraption littered with rusted coffee cans.
   After McCallister was arrested, the search intensified for four
people who had been reported missing. Three of the missing lived in
the trailer compound.
   McCallister's grandmother was found in the bedroom of her St.
Albans home Jan. 13, shot in the head at close range and wrapped in
sheets and a curtain, authorities said.
   The door to the house had been padlocked from the outside;
McCallister had a key, Whitmyer said.
   All three bodies were found the same way: nude from the waist
down but somehow wrapped or covered.
   On Jan. 21, police began searching the area around the trailer
compound and within 1{ weeks found three more bodies.
   Ms. Sanson, 19, was found buried on the grounds of an abandoned
motel across U.S. 60 from the trailers. Price, 22, and Schillings,
20, were found shot in a nearby junkyard. All three appeared to have
been dead for quite some time.
   The local animal shelter received complaints about trailer, and
on Nov. 10 officials picked up 10 dogs that were starved for food
and attention, said Sylvia Shaffer of the county animal shelter.
   After the Sansons' bodies were found, more animals were picked up
at the trailer _ six dogs, two cats, goldfish, two turtles, a
rabbit, a white rat, a dead kitten, a dead puppy and a dead
mockingbird.
   McCallister colored his natural red hair black after police
sought him for questioning on Jan. 10, acquaintances said.
   ``I remember that day,'' said David Smith, who runs a body shop
near the trailers. ``I saw him walking by and had commented on his
hair being nice and shiny and black.''
   It was not unusual to see McCallister walking in the area.
   ``He used to skip school and hang around here bumming
cigarettes,'' Smith recalled. ``I'd give him a couple of dollars to
sweep up the parking lot.''
   Neighbors remember McCallister as quiet, kind of shy and always
looking for money.
   ``I knew him for two to four months. He would help clean up
around the place,'' said Jerry Norman of the Moose Lodge. ``I would
tell my janitor if he ever needed help to go back there and get him
and give him $10 for helping.''
   Greg Perdew said McCallister used to sit on the porch and count
``a big stack of food stamps,'' and he often wondered where
McCallister had obtained them. Prosecutors said Schillings' and Ms.
Sanson's food stamps continued to arrive at the trailers after they
disappeared.
   West Virginia's worst mass killings occurred in 1932, when Harry
Powers admitted killing five people and was hanged. Historians say
Powers killed two women and three children in a garage called ``the
chamber of horrors'' and buried his victims in a ditch.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Expanded Use of Experimental AIDS Pneumonia Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
the expanded use of an aerosol drug to fight a life-threatening
pneumonia that strikes AIDS patients.
   Under the new rules, the FDA has approved the experimental use of
aerosol pentamidine for AIDS patients who have had at least one
episode of penumocystic carinii pneumonia, or who have white blood
cell counts that are at or below 200 per cubic millimeter.
   The FDA action recommends the use of aerosol pentamidine every
four weeks as a preventive measure against the AIDS-related
pneumonia. The injectable form of the drug was approved in 1984 for
patients who already had the pneumonia.
   FDA approval came after a San Francisco study showed that using
aerosol pentamidine lowered the incidence of the pneumonia among
AIDS patients.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that renders the body unable to resist other diseases and
infections. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   A white blood cell called T4 helper is the primary immune cell
attacked by HIV. Most healthy people have T4 helper cell counts of
1,000 per cubic millimeter.
   Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the most common infection that
kills AIDS patients.

<TEXT>
   Illicit drug use by military personnel has
dropped significantly in the past several years, according to a
report by the Pentagon.
   The overall figure for the use of any drug dropped from 9 percent
in 1985 to 4.8 percent in 1988, the Defense Department said.
   Use of marijuana declined from 6.5 percent in 1985 to 2.9 percent
last year, while use of other illicit drugs dropped from 5.8 percent
in 1985 to 3.1 percent in 1988, the Pentagon said.
   Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use also declined, and the
survey ``found that almost 80 percent of military personnel took
some action within the past year to improve their nutrition,'' the
Pentagon added.
   Last July, based on some preliminary results from the same
survey, the Pentagon projected 1988's overall illegal drug use rate
at 5.5 percent. The additional drop to a rate of 4.8 percent is
based on final tabulations of statistics from military outposts
around the world, the Pentagon said.

<NOTE>Author Of Trade-Curb Law Urges Easing For Soviets</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Curbs on trade with the Soviet Union should be
relaxed in light of the Kremlin's agreement to allow more Jews to
emigrate, says the co-author of the law that imposed the
restrictions.
   The letter by Charles Vanik, a former congressman from Ohio who
co-sponsored the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, reflects a fledgling
movement among legislators and Jewish groups for a reassessment of
restrictions on trade with the Soviets.
   The Jan. 30 letter from Vanik, now in private law practice, was
written to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress. A
copy was obtained from the organization.
   The group is one of several prominent Jewish organizations
advocating a re-examination of the 1974 amendment that imposes high
tariffs on imports from any Communist country denying its citizens
the right to emigrate.
   The amendment, which had been originated by the late senator
Henry Jackson, was designed to stop Soviet restrictions on Jews
seeking to emigrate and has served as leverage in the hands of
successive administrations in their dealings with Moscow.

<HEAD>More Consumer Complaints, Late Flights in Report on Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late flights and baggage problems increased
among major U.S. airlines and consumer complaints rose by 50 percent
in the latest monthly government report, but the industry is still
doing better than it was a year ago.
   The nation's 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 76.1
percent of their flights were on time in December, compared with
77.7 percent a month earlier. The rate was still nearly 10 points
better than December 1987 when one-third of all flights were late.
   The department, in its monthly air travel consumer report Monday,
blamed the Christmas-New Year holiday season for an increase in
mishandled baggage reports filed against the carriers in December.
   The reports averaged 8.58 per 1,000 passengers, compared with
6.17 in November.
   The airlines covered in the report account for about 90 percent
of domestic flight revenue. Carriers are required to report on
operations in and out of the nation's 27 largest airports.
   The report said consumer complaints against the industry reported
to the department went from 724 in December _ the lowest level in
four years _ to 1,086 in January. But the new total was still a 70
percent improvement over the 3,674 complaints received in January
1988.
   Complaints covered a wide variety of problems, including flight
cancellations, ticketing mistakes, difficulty in getting refunds,
lost baggage, rude employees, problems with smoking restrictions and
misleading advertising.
   For the third month in a row, Eastern Airlines reported the best
on-time record, with 88.1 percent of its flights arriving within 15
minutes of posted time. Earlier this year, Eastern was consistently
among airlines with the most delayed flights, not including those
delayed due to mechanical problems.
   Eastern was followed by Southwest with 79.6 percent on time and
Delta with 79.3 percent.
   Piedmont had the worst record for mishandled baggage, 12.27 per
1,000 passengers, and Southwest had the best, 4.59 per 1,000.
   Pan American had the most ticketed passengers denied seats on
overbooked flights, with 10.54 per 10,000 boardings for the first
nine months of 1988.

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices rose to a new high on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 129.50 yen, down 0.20 yen from Monday's
close of 129.70 yen. The currency had opened at 129.37 yen and moved
in a range of 129.30-129.55 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
142.97 points to a record 31,828.75 points Monday, gained another
51.90 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish at 31,880.65, a new record.
The index had been higher, ending the morning session at 31,909.22,
and then drifted lower during the afternoon.
   ``Investors' buying interest is very strong, especially
individual investors,'' said Seichiro Kita of Daiwa Securities.
   He said the market had finally found a direction for trading, and
participants targeted their interest in construction issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip at the opening of Tokyo
trading followed its slide in New York, dealers said. After
coordinated dollar-selling intervention by central banks in New York
and Europe, the currency closed lower at 129.41 yen in New York.
   A dealer with the Mitsubishi Bank said there was ``little
movement'' on the exchange rate in early trading in Tokyo because of
the absence of major market-affecting news.
   Other dealers said market players stepped off to the sidelines
amid uncertainties over the Group of Seven industrial countries'
coordination policy.

<HEAD>Dukakis: Wife's Drinking After Defeat In Presidential Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exhaustion from the presidential campaign and
post-election letdown led Kitty Dukakis to a drinking problem, Gov.
Michael Dukakis said in announcing that his ``courageous'' wife has
begun treatment for alcohol abuse.
   At a news conference Monday, Dukakis said his wife, who conquered
a 26-year addiction to diet pills, had entered a private alcohol
treatment center in Newport, R.I.
   He said his wife's underlying chemical dependency flared into
bouts of excessive drinking after his loss to George Bush in the
November presidential election.
   ``As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or is
solid, if you are chemically dependent, you are chemically
dependent,'' Dukakis said.
   ``It is a disease from which you never recover; you're always
recovering.''
   The former Democratic candidate, who has often appeared subdued
and distracted since the election, acknowledged that he has felt
physically exhausted and ``disappointed'' by the defeat. He quickly
added, ``I'm not chemically dependent.''
   The 52-year-old Mrs. Dukakis stumped tirelessly for her husband
and was called a key influence in his decision to seek the
presidency. Since the election, Mrs. Dukakis has traveled widely,
began a new career as an author and lecturer and welcomed the birth
of her first grandchild.
   But the 55-year-old governor said, ``It was clear, within some
weeks after the election, that something was happening. ...
   ``Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress
of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown all combined to
create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions while
at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quatities,'' he said.
   He said several episodes occurred when ``it was obvious'' that
his wife drank too much. After counseling failed, Dukakis said, his
wife and family in consultation with her doctor decided on
residential treatment.
   Dukakis, who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass of
wine, said his wife entered Edgehill Newport on Sunday and will stay
there about a month.
   ``She's not only a great wife and a great women, she's very
courageous,'' Dukakis, asking the public to respect her privacy and
support her recovery.
   The 28-day program begins with up to seven days of intensely
supervised and often grueling detoxification at $353 per day, said
Gaele Pesaturo, a spokeswoman for the 160-bed center.
   The rest of the program is spent in one of the six 24-bed
recovery units, at $271 per day, where there is group and peer
counseling, recreation and spiritual advice, she said.
   ``It's a very intensive program. I think a person comes to
Edgehill Newport and they have to do a lot of self-searching, a lot
of acceptance,'' Ms. Pesaturo said. ``A lot of education goes on
here about the disease.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, who has struggled for years to quit cigarettes, has
had a history of chemical dependency dating to her teen years.
   In July 1987, as her husband's campaign for the presidency was
taking shape, Mrs. Dukakis announced that five years earlier she had
entered a Minnesota center, where she overcame her addiction to
amphetamines she took to control her weight.
   She won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner,
often appearing for Dukakis and speaking openly about her own
struggle with drugs.
   Dukakis said he and his wife had agreed to delay her entry into
the program until after the birth of their first grandchild. Last
Wednesday, her son John's wife, Lisa, gave birth to Alexandra Jane
Dukakis.
   During the last three months, Mrs. Dukakis did not appear at her
husband's side on several occasions when she might have been
expected.
   On Jan. 3, for example, when Dukakis made the surprise
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, some
observers remarked on the fact that Mrs. Dukakis was not present.
   Dukakis said Monday his wife's condition had nothing to do with
his surprise announcement not to seek re-election. The governor, who
has left open the possibility that he would run for the White House
again in 1992, was asked about the possible impact of Mrs. Dukakis'
problem on another national campaign.
   ``At this time, I'm spending no time thinking about national
office,'' he said.

   A Delta Air Lines jet with 32 passengers
was forced back to Shreveport Regional Airport minutes after takeoff
when the pilot shut down an engine because it was shooting sparks,
the airline said.
   Flight 592 en route to Birmingham, Ala., and Atlanta landed
safety Monday night using two of the Boeing 727's three engines. No
inuries were reported.
   ``Right after he took off, the pilot got an indication of a
problem with one of the engines, so he shut it off and returned to
the airport,'' said Jim Lundy, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta. ``The
pilot was out of the airport for just a few minutes.''
   Doug Free, Delta superintendent in Shreveport, said passengers
were transferred to a flight to Dallas to make connecting flights to
their destinations.
   ``We won't be able to know what was wrong with the engine until
our maintenance people take a look at it,'' Free said.
   Angela Everhart, a student at Louisiana Tech in nearby Ruston,
said she was driving on Interstate 20 when the jet passed overhead,
trailing sparks.
   ``At first I thought it was fireworks,'' Ms. Everhart said.
``Then I saw it was a plane and I said, `My God.' It disappeared in
the clouds.''
   ``I was terrified the plane was in trouble,'' she said. ``I kept
wondering if it was going to fall. I kept looking for a fire or
something to happen. We never saw it again.''

<UNK>Brazilian Carnival Hits High Point with Samba Parade</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carnival hit a heated high point in
Brazil with a burst of bikinis and a mass samba-in-the-streets.
   Millions of Brazilians shed their worries and much of their
clothes to take part in the four-day dance of pre-Lenten debauchery
that ends on Ash Wednesday. The climax was the so-called samba
schools, a two-night exhibition that concluded Monday night.
   The schools are actually neighborhood groups from the poor
districts. The top groups have more than 5,000 members, most decked
out in glittering rhinestone bikinis or luxurious costumes in a
king-for-a-day fantasy.
   The samba-school parade began Sunday night along the
six-block-long grandstands known as the ``Sambadrome'' and built
specially for the carnival event. The 18 top groups competed for a
cash prize based on costumes, floats, rhythm, and the special samba
written for each school's theme of the year.
   About 150,000 spectators were expected at the sambadrome, paying
up to $213 for a seat or $12,000 for a box where tuxedoed waiters
served gourmet food and drink to dignitaries and businessmen.
   Other revelers packed private clubs for the steamy carnival
balls, such as the Grande Gala G, which is geared to homosexuals,
and the Bum Bum Ball, which features the painting of the backsides
of young women.
   The goings-on are transmitted live on network television, but
Justice Minister Oscar Dias Correa warned that networks that show
too much would be punished.
   This year's carnival was less violent than usual, health
officials in Rio said. Jose Noronha, the Rio de Janeiro state health
secretary, said hospitals reported a 10 percent drop in
violence-caused injuries compared with 1988.
   Most of the cases treated were for drunkenness and alcohol-caused
accidents, he said.
   The revelry was echoed elsewhere on Monday. West Germans dressed
as clowns, Arab sheiks, American Indians, musketeers and other
creations for Rose Monday celebrations in Cologne, Duesseldorf,
Mainz and Bonn.
   Left-wing extremists marred the Mainz festivities, police said.
   With spectators and officials preoccupied by the parade,
stone-throwing extremists broke 30 government office and hotel
windows and hurled paint-filled balloons at buildings, Mainz police
said.
   Police said the culprits left behind messages saying they staged
the acts to protest NATO and demand the release from prison of
members of the Red Army Faction, West Germany's most notorious
leftist terror gang. No arrests were reported.
   In Trinidad and Tobago, revelers ushered in the two-day carnival
on Monday festooned in a blaze of sequins, steel and brass bands and
irreverent calypso songs lampooning the government of the West
Indian islands.
   Hollis Liverpool, under the carnival pseudonym of Chalkdust, was
chosen Calypso Monarch for his biting calypso ``Chaffeur wanted,''
which compared the country to a taxi careening out of control
because its driver, Prime Minnister A.N.R. Robinson, ``cannot
drive.''

<HEAD>Report: Iran Assures French Envoy Some Hostages Will Be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian officials have told France's foreign
minister that some foreign hostages in Lebanon will be freed
``within a short period,'' Kuwait's state-run news agency reported.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas flew to Kuwait Monday for a brief
state visit after a two-day trip to Iran.
   The Kuwait News Agency, quoted diplomats traveling with Dumas,
said: ``He (Dumas) obtained a promise from responsible officials (in
Tehran) that a number of Western hostages held in Lebanon will be
released within a short period.'' The diplomats did not elaborate,
the report said.
   Iran has influence over the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of
God, which is considered an umbrella for groups holding most of the
15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Iranian officials, however,
dissociate themselves from the kidnappers.
   The 15 hostages in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons, one
Belgian, one Irishman and one Italian. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   In a statement at Kuwait international airport, Dumas said his
weekend trip to Tehran achieved its objectives and was ``fruitful in
many ways.''
   ``I discussed the entire file of French-Iran relations and laid
down a blueprint for a future relationship,'' he said.
   Iranian media generally were hostile toward the Dumas visit,
pointing out that France was a major arms supplier to Iraq during
the eight-year Iran-Iraq war halted by an Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   In Tehran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a news
conference Monday that France and Iran had agreed ``to forget the
past and think of expanding mutual ties in the future.''
   But he accused France of not keeping a promise to free Anis
Naccache, leader of a pro-Iranian terrorist squad jailed for
attempting to assassinate a former Iranian prime minister.
   Velayati said France had pledged to free Naccache, a Lebanese
national, in return for an Iranian promise to use its influence with
the Lebanese Shiite factions for the release of French hostages
formerly held in Lebanon.
   ``Unfortunately they haven't kept this promise,'' Velayati said,
adding, ``We do hope that Mr. Naccache will be released.''
   Naccache was convicted of leading a five-man squad in a 1980
attempt to kill ex-Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar outside his home
in a Paris suburb. Bakhtiar was unhurt, but a French woman and a
police officer were killed and three police officers were wounded.
   Last week, Naccache appealed to Iran to insist on his release,
implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to freedom for
the last three French captives in May.
   On Sunday, former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua
repeated earlier French denials that a deal was made.
   Bakhtiar was the last prime minister to serve under the late Shah
Reza Pahlavi before the Iranian monarchy was overthrown in 1979.

<HEAD>Pulitzer Winner Quits Atlanta Newspaper For Newsday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Doug Marlette,
whose syndicated comic strip ``Kudzu'' revolves around life in a
small southern town, is leaving his native Dixie for the Big Apple.
   In his resignation letter Monday, Marlette said he resigned as
the Atlanta Constitution's editorial cartoonist because he was upset
by the resignation of editor Bill Kovach three months ago.
   Kovach, who hired Marlette away from The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer in April 1987, resigned in a dispute with senior executives.
   ``I have spent many sleepless nights over the last two months
trying to find a way to stay here,'' Marlette wrote Arnold
Rosenfeld, who took Kovach's place as editor of the Atlanta Journal
and the Atlanta Constitution, which are published by Cox Enterprises.
   ``As a native Southerner, I came here inspired by the vision of
Bill Kovach for world-class journalism in this region so richly
deserving of it,'' wrote Marlette, who will join Newsday on New
York's Long Island.
   ``Tragically, that dream was thwarted. Like many Southerners
before me, I head north with a sense of sadness and longing for what
might have been.''
   Constitution Editorial Page Editor Tom Teepen said he knew of no
disputes involving Marlette. ``There have not been any clashes here
over cartoons,'' Teepen said.
   Born in Greensboro, N.C., and raised in Laurel, Miss., and
Sanford, Fla., Marlette has been drawing newspaper cartoons since he
was 16. He spent 15 years at the Observer before moving to Atlanta.
   Marlette won a Pulitzer for editorial cartoons last year for work
at the Observer and the Constitution. He was the first cartoonist to
win a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University.
   His editorial cartoons are syndicated to more than 125 newspapers
in the United States and abroad and have been compiled in five
books. His ``Kudzu'' strip, based in the mythical town of Bypass,
N.C., has been collected in four books.
   ``Leaving is a very sad ... thing. I feel real ambivalence about
it,'' the 39-year-old cartoonist said. ``At the same time, I'm
excited about the opportunity.''
   ``Obviously, the addition of an exceptional talent such as Doug
Marlette to the editorial pages of Newsday ... will strengthen what
we believe to be the best viewpoints in the New York area,'' Newsday
Publisher Robert M. Johnson said in a statement.
   Marlette is expected to begin work for Newsday, which is owned by
Times Mirror of Los Angeles, in about three weeks.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips In Tokyo, Another Record Stock High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen
today, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index climbed to yet
another record high.
   The dollar closed at 129.50 yen, down 0.20 yen from Monday's
129.70-yen finish. After opening at 129.37 yen, it stayed in a
narrow range between 129.30 yen and 129.55 yen.
   ``There was nothing going on in the Tokyo market today,'' said
Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank.
   He said market players were merely making small position
adjustments following dollar-selling intervention by central banks
in New York and Europe.
   Other Asian markets including Hong Kong and Singapore were closed
for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which also prompted a
wait-and-see mood in Tokyo, he added.
   Singapore's market reopens Wednesday, Hong Kong's on Thursday.
   ``Although the market lacked incentives today, speculative
investors showed strong dollar-buying interest,'' Kinugasa said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added
51.90 points, or 0.16 percent, closing at 31,880.65, its third new
high in three consecutive trading days.
   Profit-taking selling in the afternoon check the index's rise
somewhat today, however.
   Stability in the currency market encouraged buying by individual
and foreign investors, said a dealer with a major securities firm in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.8
billion shares, construction issues, such as cement, were among the
gainers.

<HEAD>Experts Praise Mrs. Dukakis For Quick Treatment Of Drinking Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis' recent episodes of heavy drinking
after overcoming a long dependence on diet pills is a sadly typical
pattern of switching from one abused substance to another, doctors
say.
   ``It is obviously the case, especially nowadays, that addiction
or dependence on more than one substance is rather common,'' said
Dr. Peter Nathan, director of the Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies
in Piscataway, N.J.
   For reasons that are not well understood, people who have trouble
with one mood-altering substance are especially susceptible to
excessive use of others.
   ``Drug switching does occur, and the drug that's easiest to
switch into is alcohol,'' said Dr. Roger Weiss of McLean Hospital in
Belmont. ``It's easy to get, cheap, legal and the most socially
acceptable.''
   Experts said that most researchers now reject the once-popular
idea that some people have addictive personalities. Instead, people
with addiction problems typically have little in common other than
their addictions.
   Weiss said that people who abuse more than one drug may be
``addicted to mood change, not just to a particular drug.''
   On Monday, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said that his wife had been
admitted to the alcohol treatment program in Newport, R.I.
   Mrs. Dukakis was treated in 1982 for a 26-year reliance on
amphetamines. However, the Democratic governor said his wife had
never had a drinking problem until shortly after he lost the
presidential election on Nov. 8.
   ``Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress
of the campaign effort and the post-election let-down all combined
to create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions
while at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quantities,'' he
said.
   Several doctors praised Mrs. Dukakis for seeking help after such
a relatively brief siege of alcohol problems.
   ``For a public figure, who knows any revelation about problems is
going to be widely publicized, it takes great courage to seek
treatment,'' said Dr. Domenic Ciraulo of New England Medical Center
in Boston.
   ``This is a family that certainly knows about substance abuse,''
he said. ``It's unusual to seek help so early, but it shows they
know the signs of trouble so well.''
   Nathan said that if Mrs. Dukakis' drinking only began in
November, there probably has not been time for her to become
physically dependent on alcohol.
   ``If what the governor says is accurate, they have been quite
courageous in deciding to do something about this early,'' Nathan
said. ``The odds are far better that they will be able to get it
under control, and there won't be any permanent consequences.''
   Dr. Patricia Sutker of the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in New Orleans said that seeking treatment for alcohol abuse does
not necessarily mean someone is an alcoholic.
   ``You could go in because you don't like the fact that you drank
heavily on a few occasions,'' she said. ``You want to nip it in the
bud. She might not be an alcoholic and wants to go in for some
stress management.''

   If Georgia decides to adopt one legislator's idea
of a state rock 'n' roll song, it'll be easy to remember the chorus:
``A wop bop alu bop a wop bam boom.''
   State Rep. Billy Randall said he planned to introduce a
resolution today to make Little Richard's ``Tutti Frutti'' the
state's official rock song.
   Georgia already has an official state song _ ``Georgia On My
Mind'' by Ray Charles. But Randall said he'd like to see the state
recognize some of its native rock 'n' roll pioneers.
   ``I chose Little Richard because he was the first of the great
rock 'n' roll stars to come out of the state of Georgia,'' the
legislator said. ``Little'' Richard Penniman, 53, was raised in
Macon, which Randall represents.
   ``I love the idea,'' Little Richard, who now lives in California,
said in a telephone interview Monday. ``Give my love to him
(Randall) and everybody there. God bless you.''
   ``Tutti-Frutti,'' a nonsensical tune that was Little Richard's
first big hit, reached No. 2 on the rhythm and blues charts in 1955
and later achieved classic status as a rock standard.

   Physicist Ed Wagner says he's found
evidence that trees talk to each other. If so, they probably say
nicer things than other scientists say about him.
   Wagner, who left academia to start his own research laboratory,
says trees ``talk'' in signals that he calls ``W-waves.''
   Explaining the phenomenon, Wagner pointed to a blip on a chart
recording a tree being chopped. ``It put out a tremendous cry of
alarm,'' he said. ``The adjacent trees put out smaller ones.''
   An abstract of his research was published last fall in Northwest
Science magazine.
   Wagner, 58, holds a doctorate in physics from the University of
Tennessee. He formerly worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories
in Tennessee and taught physics at California State Polytechnic
University for five years.
   He returned to his family home near Grants Pass in the 1970s to
establish the Wagner Research Laboratory ``so no one could tell me
what I was doing scientifically was right or wrong.''
   Wagner said his work has been greeted with skepticism, but he
remained confident it would be accepted one day.
   ``For some people, it's so contrary to what they think that they
won't bother to read the evidence,'' he said. ``But it's just a
matter of time.''

   Baltimore County Judge Dana Levitz got to
thinking about the ancient philosophical question: Who will judge
the judges? So he asked the lawyers who appear in his courtroom to
do it.
   Levitz's effort to get evaluated _ which included sending 150
questionnaires to lawyers who have appeared before him _ was
prompted by his worries about how attorneys can change when they sit
on the bench.
   ``They can become pompous jerks in black robes,'' said Levitz,
40, who was a county prosecutor before he became a circuit judge
three years ago.
   ``I wondered if they were aware of it, and then when I got here,
I realized how easy it is to become unaware. There's no other job
where there's no supervision.''
   County bar association president Myles F. Friedman praised
Levitz's survey as ``fantastic'' and ``long overdue.'' But there was
no indication that the idea was going to catch on among Levitz's
colleagues.
   ``I care what they think of me as a judge, but I wouldn't do
it,'' said Judge Leonard S. Jacobsen. ``I don't think it does any
good that way.''
   Levitz said he feels ``very positive'' about the 60 responses
he's received so far. Some opened his eyes to problems he wasn't
aware of, he said.
   ``For those judges interested in evaluating their skills, I think
this is an excellent vehicle,'' he said. ``For those who aren't
interested, it wouldn't help.''

<HEAD>Head of Opposition Party Resigns After Linked to Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan's stock-profiteering scandal claimed yet
another promiment casualty today as the chief of an opposition party
resigned over his lucrative dealings with the company at the heart
of the affair.
   The so-called Recruit scandal has shaken public confidence in
Japan's government. Three members of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's Cabinet have resigned because of links to the affair, as
have more than a dozen other government officials, business leaders
and media executives.
   Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party,
stepped down today amid pressure from party members who want to
distance the party from the scandal. He said he was not guilty of
any wrongdoing and was quitting for the party' sake.
   ``If my resignation can bring gains for the party, I decided it
is better for me to withdraw now,'' he told a news conference. ``I
would like to apologize to my colleagues and to the people for
troubles caused by my involvement in the Recruit scandal.''
   ``I believe my innocence was widely understood by my supporters,
but I also could not overlook the fact that some of my colleagues
are concerned about the next election,'' he said, referring to
upcoming voting in July for half the seats in the House of
Councillors, the upper house of parliament.
   Tsukamoto will retain his seat in the House of Representatives.
   The Democratic Socialist Party, with 29 of 512 seats, is the
third largest opposition bloc after the Japan Socialist Party and
the Komeito, the Clean Government Party.
   Since last summer, the Recruit scandal has become a subject of
national debate as it highlighted the sometimes dubious connections
between business and politics.
   Tsukamoto bought 10,000 unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a
real estate subsidiary of the information-based conglomerate Recruit
Co., through his secretary, and earned about $77,000 by selling them
immediately after the company went public in 1986.
   Pressure had mounted on Tsukamoto to resign because he was the
only one of four opposition politicians linked to the scandal who
had not taken responsibility for their roles.
   The three others have given up party posts or parliament seats.
Tsukamoto was first implicated in the scandal in October.
   Though the stock transactions were not illegal under Japanese
securities law, they had a taint of bribery and influence-peddling.
   Prosecutors have questioned Recruit executives as well as
government officials in a bribery probe, and reportedly are prepared
to arrest several public officials for allegedly profiting from
privileged access to prelisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. in
exchange for doing favors for the company.
   Prime Minister Takeshita tried to erase the shadow of the scandal
by reshuffling his administration last December, but two Cabinet
members _ Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa and Ken Harada, director
general of the Economic Planning Agency _ have since quit because of
links to Recruit.
   Takeshita himself is tied to the scandal because his secretary
bought pre-listed shares in Recruit-Cosmos, but the prime minister
denied any knowledge of the deal and has ruled out opposition
demands to resign and call early elections.
   The moderate Democratic Socialist Party will likely toughen its
stance against the ruling party in Parliament now that its
scandal-tainted chairman is stepping down.
   Tsukamoto's resignation also will likely fuel opposition demands
that Takeshita resign.

   Savings and loan executives expressed some
misgivings about President Bush's rescue plan for the industry but
many said they aren't likely to pass along the costs of higher
insurance premiums to customers.
   ``When people say, `Are they going to pass this premium on to the
public?' I have to laugh,'' said Marion Sandler, president and chief
executive officer of World Savings &amp; Loan Association of Oakland.
``We're not a cost-plus industry. We're going to have to eat it.''
   Top officers at four other big California thrifts, Great Western,
California Federal, Glendale Federal and Home Federal, said they,
too, were unlikely to cut interest rates for fear of losing
depositors to banks, mutual funds or the stock market. All five
thrifts are among the nation's 10 largest.
   Under the Bush plan, which must be approved by Congress, the
government would sell $50 billion in bonds to finance the cost of
closing or selling about 350 failed institutions. That's in addition
to the $40 billion pledged last year by regulators to rescue and
prop up 223 institutions.
   Insurance premiums paid by financial institutions, combined with
tax dollars, would pay the interest on the bonds and meet
regulators' 1988 commitments. Money to pay off the principal on the
bonds would come from the S&amp;L industry.
   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions and president of First Federal Savings Bank of
Cleveland, said higher insurance premiums would imperil more thrifts.
   ``This continues to bleed the healthy institutions; there is just
no end in sight,'' Koch said. ``This is going to raise the cost of
our funds and create more insolvencies.''
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's biggest
lobbying group, was more cautious, saying it would neither endorse
nor reject the plan.
   League Chairman Barney Beeksman said he was glad Bush dropped an
earlier proposal to levy a fee on depositors and reiterated the
government's pledge to insure depositors. But he found other parts
of the plan ``burdensome,'' particularly insurance premiums.
   ``We see today's proposal as a first step only,'' Beeksman said.
   The American Bankers Association took heart in assurances that
even though banks' insurance premiums would rise, their insurance
fund _ the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ would be kept separate
from the S&amp;L fund.
   But J.J. Pinola, chairman and chief executive of First Interstate
Bancorp in Los Angeles, criticized the proposed increase in bank's
premiums and said the plan would inevitably force banks and S&amp;Ls to
cut interest rates for depositors or raise fees.
   ``I'm somewhat appalled and looking for the right word to
describe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do with
the mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay,''
Pinola said. ``It's simply a bashing of the banks.''
   Many S&amp;L executives praised Bush for moving quickly to tackle the
long-festering problem.
   ``I like what I see,'' said James Montgomery, chairman and chief
executive officer of Beverly Hills-based Great Western Financial
Corp., the nation's second-largest S&amp;L with $33 billion in assets.
``I think he's showing some leadership, saying, `We've got to get on
with this problem,' and spreading the pain around a little bit.''
   Montgomery said he supported the administration's insistence that
thrifts put up more of their own money to back deposits and promise
to crack down on fraud and mismanagement.
   The initial reaction appeared favorable in Texas, where the
depressed oil and gas industry has produced some of the biggest S&amp;L
losses.
   ``We are pleased that he (Bush), very strongly at the beginning
and end of the press conference, spoke of the full faith and credit
of government behind thrifts,'' said Russ Cobler, a spokesman for
San Antonio Savings Association, one of 350 insolvent thrifts the
president's plan is designed to help.

<HEAD>Sakharov Criticizes Le Figaro Article As Misquoting Him On Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov contends a
French newspaper misquoted him as saying opponents of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev could thwart the Soviet president's reforms or oust him.
   Sakharov also said Monday that it had been his understanding that
the conversation with journalist Jean-Pierre Barou on which the Le
Figaro story was based was intended to serve as material for a book
_ not for a newspaper story.
   Le Figaro published the interview Jan. 26 and an editorial in the
Soviet government newspaper Izvestia attacked the reported comments
last week.
   In a letter published Monday in the government newspaper Izestia,
Sakharov described his discussion with Barou as a ``tea-table
conversation'' with a French guest. He said his remarks were taken
out of context.
   Sakharov, a 67-year-old physicist who won the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize, also criticized Izvestia's editorial for ``unjustly''
representing him.
   He wrote that he and his wife, Yelena Bonner, said during the
conversation that the couple believes the Soviet Union must hold
direct elections and that the current system of indirect elections
may increase the danger of Gorbachev being overthrown and his
policies cast aside.
   ``Meanwhile, it was not noticed that my wife said, `Gorbachev
does not need to fear direct elections. The people would necessarily
elect him. Our country has no other leader,''' he wrote in the
letter to Izvestia.
   ``I fully agree with this,'' he said.
   ``I actively support perestroika (Gorbachov's reform campaign). I
am convinced it's necessary for our country and the whole world,''
he added, stressing that Gorbachev plays a special role in the
Soviet Union's reform.
   In the Figaro article, Sakharov was quoted as saying, ``The
conservatives will overthrow Gorbachev or at least impose their
views on him.''
   Le Figaro quoted Bonner as saying: ``The only real defense for a
chief of state is direct election. Why is Gorbachev afraid? We would
elect him. Our country has no other leader.''
   She also was quoted by Barou as saying she thought Gorbachev will
be overthrown soon. ``I would not bet 10 rubles on Gorbachev,'' the
paper quoted her as saying.
   Le Figaro published a note Feb. 3 saying Barou had told Sakharov
and his wife that they would be quoted when he met them in a
six-hour interview conducted over three consecutive evenings in
their Moscow home.
   ``Barou asserted to us, in a handwritten letter, that he warned
the Sakharovs that extracts from their conversations would be
published in several major newspapers,'' according to the note.
   On Monday, Sakharov and Bonner met with the Pope John Paul II in
the Vatican. It was Sakharov's second trip outside the Soviet Union
since he was freed from internal exile in December 1986.
   The meeting with the pope in his library lasted an hour and 20
minutes, according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro. The
unusually long audience was ``very nice,'' Bonner said. They did not
comment on what was discussed.
   Sakharov is in Italy for five days to receive several academic
and civic honors. The trip comes as the Soviet activist is running
for a seat in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for March.

   Actor Todd Bridges, who starred in the TV
series ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was ordered held without bail on an
attempted murder charge for allegedly shooting a man five times and
trying to slash his throat.
   Bridges, 23, was silent in Municipal Court on Monday except to
acknowledge his name and plead innocent.
   ``From what I understand,'' said Deputy District Attorney Irv
Cohen, ``if the defendant had been a better shot, we would have had
a first-degree murder.''
   Judge David S. Milton declared Bridges a danger to the community
and said an affidavit filed by police indicated the actor was a
heavy cocaine user.
   ``According to witnesses, he sells sometimes to support his habit
since he has spent much of his TV show earnings,'' the judge said,
reading from the affidavit.
   Bridges played Gary Coleman's older brother in the series from
1978-86.
   According to the affidavit, Bridges shot 25-year-old Kenneth Clay
on Thursday while Clay was standing, then emptied the gun into him
as he lay on the floor of a house in south-central Los Angeles known
as a drug hangout.
   The affidavit said Bridges then left and got a knife, came back
and tried to slash Clay's throat, cutting his jaw.
   Harvey Duckett, 30, an associate arrested with Bridges, was held
in lieu of $50,000 bail. Cohen said Duckett was quoted as allegedly
yelling, ``Shoot him! Kill him!'' as Bridges shot Clay.
   Bridges and Duckett were arrested at the house. Bridges also had
been arrested there two weeks earlier for investigation of
possessing cocaine.
   ``I think much of what the court heard is hearsay and may not be
true. But I can't disprove it at this time,'' Johnnie Cochran,
Bridges' attorney, told the judge.
   The judge dismissed a request for bail and scheduled a
preliminary hearing for Feb. 17.
   Bridges received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after
pleading no contest to making a bomb threat in a case that stemmed
from the bombing of an auto customizer's car during a dispute over
work on the actor's Porsche.

   It apparently helped Marvin Mitchelson's
headaches, Sonny Bono's sciatica, Whitey Ford's sore shoulder and
David Brenner's bad back, but medical officials say prescribing
cocaine for pain has no place in medicine.
   The state has told Dr. Milton Reder and 20 other physicians to
stop prescribing what's called sphenopalatine ganglion block.
   But Reder, who developed the method, said Monday he won't quit.
   ``These days cocaine has a bad name. What can I do about that?''
he asked. ``I say it's the best local anesthetic.''
   Brenner, the comedian, accused the state Health Department and
the New York County Medical Society of ``a witch hunt. ... They
can't get Noriega, they can't get the crack dealers a few blocks
away, but they're going after an 89-year-old humanitarian.''
   For four decades, Reder has used cocaine, legally purchased from
pharmaceutical companies, to treat a variety of maladies. A liquid
solution containing 13 percent cocaine is applied with metal swabs
inserted through the nostrils against a nerve center at the base of
the brain. Reder, his patients, and some doctors say the procedure
relieves pain, although no one knows why.
   Reder's treatment was no secret. He has participated in medical
studies and been the subject of newspaper and magazine features,
which invariably focus on his many celebrated patients.
   The state Health Department's objections are these: Reder doesn't
always examine patients before treating them; he doesn't make sure
they are not former cocaine addicts who might become addicted again;
and he employs too much cocaine.
   Reder said that most of his patients have been examined many
times before they come to him, and that he does examine those who
have not. And he says he administers too small an amount of the drug
to hook anyone.
   He vigorously denied a Daily News report that state investigators
``found about a half-dozen patients who went to Reder's office just
to get high.''
   Thomas Coffey of the Health Department said ``prescribing cocaine
for non-specific pains is like taking a sledgehammer to a tack.''
   The state cites the New York County Medical Society's conclusion
in 1975 that Reder's procedure has ``no basis in scientific medicine
to warrant its use.'' But the society also conceded that the
procedure ``appears to help some patients'' and urged it be studied.
   Such an experiment is in fact planned by two Yale Medical School
pain specialists who say they have used Reder's method successfully
on two of three patients.
   Reder came to the attention of the Health Department because of
his large orders of pharmaceutical cocaine. After an investigation,
the department on March 1 ordered him and the other physicians to
stop the treatments.
   At first Reder agreed, but later wrote the department a letter
saying he had changed his mind and wanted the medical society to
review its opinion. In a statement Monday, the society said that in
1987 its peer review committee reconsidered and affirmed its 1975
ruling on the procedure, and planned no change. It also said it was
not considering legal or disciplinary action against Reder.
   State officials say they are still investigating and won't move
against Reder until they confer with the medical society.
   Meanwhile, Reder's patients stand by their man.
   Bono, who was treated for a pinched sciatica nerve, said: ``I
guarantee you'd get less drugs from him than you would from a
general (doctor).''
   Film critic Rex Reed, another Reder patient, said: ``You don't
feel stoned, you feel better. Wouldn't you rather give somebody $25
in cash and feel better than spend thousands of dollars and have no
results.''
   Ford, the former New York Yankees pitcher, said saloonkeeper
Toots Shor took him to Reder for treatment of a sore shoulder, which
felt better the next day. He said he didn't know the physician had
used cocaine.
   Mitchelson, the divorce lawyer who credited Reder as the only
doctor able to relieve his headaches, said: ``I've seen people go in
there crippled, in wheelchairs, and walk out.''
   Other patients, Reder says, have included Pablo Picasso, Henry
Fonda and Winston Churchill.
   Reder said Monday that news of the state investigation, which
appeared Sunday in the Daily News, had already brought him new
patients.
   ``They all want to be cured,'' he said. ``I'll treat them as long
as they let me.''

   Cocaine is used routinely by doctors as a local
anesthetic, and patients often don't know they have received it, an
anesthesiologist said.
   It is most commonly used to deaden nerves in the nose before
inserting a tube through a patient's nose into the airway, said Dr.
Kuntala Sinha, an anesthesiologist and director of the pain clinic
at New York University Medical Center.
   It is also used by plastic surgeons when doing nasal surgery. It
is dispensed as a liquid solution and applied inside the nose with
swabs, she said Monday.
   Cocaine's advantage over other local anesthetics such as
lidocaine is that it also constricts blood vessels, Sinha said.
``When you pre-treat the patient with cocaine, it serves a dual
purpose,'' she said.
   ``It will decrease the bleeding (by shrinking the blood vessels),
and it increases the size of the (nasal) passage because it
decreases the size of the blood vessels in the area. It makes it
easier to put in a large tube without bleeding. And, number two, it
is a very good local anesthetic.''
   Cocaine is a controlled substance, so it is kept locked in
hospital pharmacies and is given out only in limited quantities,
Sinha said.
   She said that anesthesiologists routinely administer doses three
or four times higher than those used by Dr. Milton Reder, who has
been ordered by the state to stop administering cocaine to treat
pain. And even at the higher doses, the cocaine does not produce a
``high,'' Sinha said.
   ``Patients have consistently never even known about it,'' she
said. Even when the patients are told they're getting cocaine ``they
don't get a false high,'' she said.
   Reder's treatments differ from standard medical practice in that
he uses cocaine to treat pain in places other than the nose, Sinha
said.
   She said that she has experimented with treatment similar to that
used by Reder, and she has found that it helps about half of the
patients who receive it. Furthermore, patients do not appear to
become addicted, she said.
   ``I don't think there's a problem with addiction, if that's what
the public is worried about,'' she said. ``The question is whether
it works and if you see side effects.'' Medical journals contain no
reports of serious side effects, she said.
   ``There probably is a role for this kind of treatment,'' she
said, referring to Reder's methods. ``It's probably not accurate to
dismiss it as a crazy idea.''

<HEAD>Drug Smuggler Acquitted of Murder on High Seas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An admitted drug smuggler accused of
killing a woman, then ordering her tied to an anchor and thrown
overboard off the Bahamas, was acquitted of murder on the high seas
by a federal jury.
   William ``Skip'' Walton of Delray Beach was acquitted Monday in
the death of Brenda Blum, 37, of Fort Lauderdale, during a
drug-smuggling trip six years ago.
   The foreman of the U.S. District Court jury said afterward that
the panel didn't believe the testimony of the government's two chief
witnesses, who admitted they participated in the killing.
   ``The government didn't prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' said foreman Louis Agnello of Pembroke Park. ``It was very
frustrating because there was no body, just the testimony of those
two witnesses.''
   Walton, 46, pleaded guilty to marijuana importation and
conspiracy charges before the start of the trial two weeks ago. He
seemed momentarily stunned at the verdict announcement, then smiled
and patted his attorney, Don Ferguson, on the shoulder.
   ``His reaction was relief,'' Ferguson said. ``All along he's
maintained his innocence.''
   Walton was quickly led away from the courtroom by U.S. marshals.
He will remain in custody without bond until his March 13 sentencing
on the drug charges.
   Walton, who was cleared of murder charges 15 years ago in an
unrelated case, faces a maximum 10 year prison sentence for the drug
charges. He would have faced a mandatory life sentence if convicted
of murder.
   Prosecutors said Walton forced Ms. Blum aboard his yacht, beat
her with a club and then ordered her tied to an anchor and thrown
into the Atlantic on Dec. 2, 1982.
   William Pryor, the boat's first mate, said he helped dump Ms.
Blum's body into the water after she demanded a share of the drug
cargo. He agreed to testify against Walton and plead guilty to a
reduced charge of second-degree murder.
   David Nesbit, Ms. Blum's friend, testified that Walton ordered
the woman thrown overboard and threatened to kill him if he didn't
participate. But after he was granted immunity from prosecution, he
testified he lied to authorities when he reported the murder.

<TEXT>
   A group of relatives of Pan Am Flight 103 victims
has demanded the resignation of the head of the Federal Aviation
Administration, saying he failed to maintain security on the doomed
flight.
   At an emotional news conference Monday, 30 people who lost loved
ones on the downed jetliner accused the government and Pan Am of
negligence before the Dec. 21 bombing. They demanded the broadest
possible congressional investigation of the tragedy that killed 270
people.
   ``My husband was murdered on the flight,'' said a tearful Wendy
Giebler, widow of William Giebler Jr. ``He never would have got on
that flight if we had been given the facts. And what we need to know
is who is accountable.''
   The group chiefly demanded an accounting of why the government
had not made public a terrorist threat that a U.S. flight from
Frankfurt, West Germany, would be bombed in December. U.S. airlines
and embassy personnel were warned.
   ``The FBI says, well, the bomb threat was really nothing more
than a hoax,'' said Daniel Cohen, of Port Jervis, whose daughter was
aboard Flight 103. ``If it was a hoax, why did that plane blow up?
Why is my daughter dead?''
   Government officials have said they get similar unconfirmed
threats on a daily basis and would cripple the airline industry by
announcing them all. The relatives called that policy ``immoral and
possibly criminal.''
   Further, the group said in a statement that while the FAA
receives up to 500 threats annually, fewer than 25 are rated
``high-level,'' as it said the Frankfurt threat apparently was.
   The relatives specifically blamed FAA chief Alan McArtor for a
lack of security on the flight, and called for his resignation. They
asked Congress to make its investigation of the incident ``full and
complete.''
   An FAA spokesman did not return two telephone messages. Pamela
Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, noted that the threat had not
identified a specific flight and she said Pan Am had increased its
security after receiving the warning.
   In an outpouring of emotion and frustration, the relatives voiced
a litany of other complaints, ranging from their inability to
recover their loved ones' personal effects to the handling of the
victims' remains.
   The New York-bound flight, which originated in Frankfurt and
changed to a larger plane in London, exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland. All 259 aboard died, as did 11 on the ground.
Investigators blamed plastic explosives that had been smuggled
aboard.
   Among the dead were 35 students returning from a Syracuse
University overseas study program. Syracuse announced plans Monday
to convert the university's main entrance into a memorial to the
students.
   The centerpiece of the $500,000 memorial will be a 4-foot-high,
semicircular limestone wall on which the names of the students will
be engraved, according to Virginia Denton, Syracuse's director of
design and construction. She said the project is to be completed by
fall.

<HEAD>Mexico Accepts Contra-Linked US Diplomat As New Ambassador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has told the United States it would accept the appointment
of controversial career diplomat John Negroponte as the next U.S.
ambassador.
   Opposition leaders in Mexico say they oppose the choice of
Negroponte because he helped orchestrate the civil war in Nicaragua
and meddled unduly in Honduran affairs while ambassador to that
country from 1982 to 1985.
   Late Monday, the Foreign Ministry said it had sent a letter to
the Bush adminstration expressing support for the proposed
appointment of Negroponte, currently a deputy national security
advisor.
   The White House has not announced Negroponte's candidacy for the
job, but sources in Washington said last week that he would be
picked to replace Ambassador Charles Pilliod.
   As U.S. envoy to Honduras, Negroponte had a major role in
assisting the U.S.-backed Contra rebels seeking to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas. Honduras was a major base of Contra
operations.
   In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said:
   ``By sending this letter, the government of Mexico expresses to
the United States of America its desire that this career diplomat be
chosen, contributing to the strengthening of bilateral ties with
equality and strict respect for the sovereignty of both countries.''
   It said Negroponte's designation would be ``within the spirit of
the declarations'' President Bush and Secretary State James Baker
have made concerning the future of relations between the United
States and Mexico.
   Negroponte, 50, was a close ally of the former head of the
Honduran armed forces, Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, known as the
godfather of the Contra movement.
   Alvarez, armed forces chief from 1982 until his overthrow in
1984, was shot to death in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa last
month. A leftist group claimed responsibility.
   As head of the national police in 1981, Alvarez told then-CIA
Director William Casey that the Contras could operate from Honduran
territory, thus allowing the movement to grow. A preliminary
cease-fire was signed by the warring Nicaraguan parties last March,
but peace talks have since stalled.
   Mexico City daily newspapers have reacted angrily to Negroponte's
possible appointment.
   The daily Excelsior on Friday ran a lengthy front-page story
describing Negroponte as a diplomat who ``has earned a reputation
for being more astute and calculating than Machiavelli.''
   The liberal daily La Jornada called Negroponte's appointment ``an
ominous decision'' and compared him unfavorably to former Ambassador
John Gavin, who was extremely unpopular in Mexico City.
   La Jornada also began a three-part series Thursday on Negroponte
called ``The Path of an Ultra-Hawk.''
   Negroponte began his diplomatic career in Hong Kong in the early
1960s. He served in the U.S. Embassy in Saigon during the Vietnam
War and was a member of the U.S. negotiating team at the Paris peace
talks on that conflict.
   Later, Negroponte served at the U.S. Embassy in Quito, Ecuador,
and was a consul general in Greece.

<TEXT>
   Retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr. was resting comfortably in a hospital after
being admitted for an acute respiratory infection.
   ``He has a relatively minor illness that has lingered for a few
days, an acute respiratory infection _ a cold, really,'' said Dr.
Joel P. Schrank, chief of Cardiology at Baptist Medical Center.
   ``There is some suspicion that he might have a little
pneumonia,'' and results of tests to determine that should be known
sometime today, Schrank said.
   Powell, 81, was listed in stable condition early today, said
Cindy Hamilton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The former associate justice was taken to Baptist Medical Center
by ambulance shortly before noon Monday after feeling dizzy while
working at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville.
   Powell had some minor abnormalities on his electrocardiogram and
was placed on a heart monitor as a precaution, Schrank said.
   The physician refused to speculate on how long Powell should
remain in the hospital.
   ``The best thing for him would be a little rest and a little
time,'' the doctor said.
   Powell was in Jacksonville as a visiting judge on a three-judge
panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Chief Circuit Judge Paul Roney said Powell developed a cold
during the weekend and began feeling worse Monday. He said he and
another judge would still hear oral arguments as a quorum of the
court by taping the sessions.
   Powell retired from the high court June 26, 1987, citing concerns
about his health as one reason. He had suffered from prostate cancer.
   Powell took senior status when he stepped down, and has since
participated in several cases for the Richmond-based 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   In a recent conversation with a reporter, Powell said he had been
invited to act as a visiting judge in at least 10 of the 13 federal
appeals courts.
   When asked why he chose the 11th Circuit court, he laughed and
answered, ``Because I get to go to Florida in February.''
   Powell and his wife, Josephine, have homes in Richmond and
Washington. His wife was with him in Jacksonville.
   During his 14-year Supreme Court tenure, Powell avoided the rigid
ideology that at times isolated the court's liberal and conservative
wings.
   He was 64 when nominated by President Richard Nixon in 1971 and
was sworn in Jan. 7, 1972, replacing liberal Justice Hugo L. Black.
   Before joining the court, Powell practiced trial law for 34 years
in his hometown of Richmond except for service during World War II.
He also served as president of the American Bar Association from
1964 to 1965 and the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1969.

<TEXT>
   The government and the opposition sat down
at the same table to seek a common course for Poland's future, but
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa cautioned that deep distrust hangs
over the historic talks.
   Fifty-seven delegates of divergent views sat at a specially built
circular table under the glare of television lights for Monday's
remarkable opening session.
   Opposition activists faced officials who had interned them during
the 1981 crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, debating conditions
for the free trade union movement's reinstatement and a possible
opposition role in government.
   It was first time since the Communists consolidated power after
World War II with Soviet backing that a cross-section of the
opposition had begun formal talks with authorities over how to run
Poland and salvage an economy in crisis.
   Delegates representing the opposition, the Communist Party, the
government and the influential Roman Catholic Church met for about
three hours and agreed to break up into three working groups
beginning Wednesday.
   One group will discuss economic and social policy, one trade
unions and the third political reforms, according to a joint
statement issued after the session at the Council of Ministers
palace.
   Opposition spokesmen have said they expect the real work of the
negotiations to take place in these groups _ and to last about six
weeks.
   If a grand compromise is reached, it could be quickly enacted
into law by the Communist-dominated parliament.
   The chief official at the talks was Politburo member and Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, a key player in the 1981 crackdown.
Walesa led a 25-member group representing Solidarity and other
opposition groups.
   Kiszczak said ending the seven-year ban on Solidarity is possible
only if the talks produce broad agreement on political and economic
reform.
   ``If we work out at the round table and officially announce to
society a confirmed consensus on the idea of non-confrontational
elections as well as support for planned political and economic
reforms, there will be an immediate possibility'' to lift the ban,
he said.
   The authorities have indicated they are willing to allow the
opposition seats in parliament as a minority party, but the
opposition does not believe the Communists have any intention of
sharing power.
   Walesa seemed to be advocating quick legalization.
   ``We demand Solidarity. We have the right to it,'' he said in a
blunt speech immediately following Kiszczak's.
   Authorities agreed in advance that the talks could result in
reinstating Solidarity. In exchange, they seek an opposition
endorsement of painful reforms that could increase prices and lead
to layoffs if outmoded plants are closed.
   Many government opponents are wary of the offer.
   ``This table is surrounded by social hope, but also distrust,''
said Walesa. ``There will be people who will not accept what we work
out here. We must know this and accept this.''
   Walesa, quoted by the state PAP news agency, blamed the country's
economic and political crisis on the lack of freedoms.
   ``We know the country is in ruins. But it has not been ruined by
gnomes _ but by a power structure that has deprived people of their
rights and wasted the fruits of their labor,'' Walesa said.
   ``The time of social and political monopoly is ending. We need a
restructuring that will turn the one-party state into a state of the
nation and the society,'' he said.
   Solidarity says it wants to discuss reform of the legal system to
create a more independent judiciary, freedom of clubs and
associations, access to the mass media, democratization of local
government at smaller round tables.
   The talks were given heavy television coverage and the Communist
Party daily newspaper Trybuna Ludu printed an extra edition Monday
night about the meeting, which Kiszczak first proposed in August as
a way of ending the country's worst labor turmoil since Solidarity's
heyday.
   The economic crisis has spawned 60 percent inflation and chronic
consumer shortages. Poland is trying to cope with a $39 billion
foreign debt, an obsolete industrial base and the exodus of talented
young people to the West.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference after
Monday's talks that authorities were satisfied with the start. The
speeches ``showed a rather convergent way of thinking about the
future and about the changes necessary in Poland,'' he said.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said his hopes have
brightened.
   ``Yesterday I said that I was a moderate optimist. Today I can
say I am still a moderate optimist, but a little bit more of one,''
he said in an interview on state-run television that would have been
unthinkable a few months ago.

   Ronald Reagan celebrated his 78th birthday by
saying he's had enough of retirement and was ``saddled up and ready
to ride again'' for a balanced federal budget and repeal of the
two-term presidency.
   The 40th President's birthday celebration Monday included an
office chat with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a
black-tie party and a speech to students at the University of
Southern California, where he was serenaded by the USC Marching Band.
   ``One of my biggest disappointments as president was I wasn't
able to balance the budget,'' Reagan told the college audience.
   Reagan received extended applause when answering a question about
over-the-counter military weapons, such as the AK-47 assault rifle
used to gun down five Stockton schoolchildren last month.
   ``I do not believe in taking away the right of the citizen for
sporting, for hunting and so forth, or for home defense,'' he said.
``But I do believe that an AK-47, a machine gun, is not a sporting
weapon or needed for defense of a home.''
   The speech was Reagan's first public event since a spirited
welcome home airport rally Jan. 20, the day he relinquished the
presidency to George Bush. The former president said he does not
relish retirement.
   ``Two weeks ago, I went into retirement. Boy, am I glad that's
over,'' said Reagan.
   ``I don't like retirement. It took all the fun out of Saturdays.
For two weeks, I tried to adjust to private life and growing old
gracefully, but that's not my style. Here I am, saddled up and ready
to ride again.''
   Earlier Monday, the visiting Japanese prime minister paid a
30-minute courtesy call on Reagan at the former president's
34th-floor Century City office.
   On Monday night, comedian Bob Hope, actor Jimmy Stewart and other
members of Hollywood's elite helped Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
celebrate his birthday at the posh Bistro Garden in Beverly Hills.
   ``We're all here to wish him the best,'' Hope said before
entering the private party.
   The president, who joked it was the 39th anniversary of his 39th
birthday, said his wish was ``that I'll have a lot more.''
   Guests at the celebration included two of Reagan's inner circle
in government, former Secretary of State George Shultz and former
Attorney General William French Smith. Also among the approximately
100 guests were MCA Inc. chief Lew Wasserman, Texas oilman Marvin
Davis, actress Eva Gabor and entertainment tycoon Merv Griffin.
   The menu was roast chicken with baby carrots, asparagus, and
noisette potatoes. The prelude to the meal included rigatoni with
salami, ham, bacon, black and green olives and Italian-style sauce.
   The birthday desert was chocolate tartuffo ice cream and lemon
cake.
   In his 22-minute address at USC, Reagan outlined some of his
political work for the future.
   ``Today I start stumping for our future president, Republican or
Democrat, to bring government under control,'' he said. ``We don't
have a deficit because the people aren't taxed enough; we have a
deficit because the Congress spends too much.''
   He criticized the constitutional amendment that limits
presidential terms to two.
   ``The 22nd Amendment is politically motivated, and it should be
repealed,'' Reagan said. ``Two times isn't necessarily enough time
to get all you want done, done. I still had things to do when I
left.''
   About a dozen demonstrators staged a brief protest outside the
auditorium, most of them decrying Reagan's stance against abortion.
The protesters were countered by members of the campus Young
Republicans.

   Anger and suspicion arising from the
death of a young black in police custody have led to seven straight
days of protest marches and a vow to continue pressuring authorities
for a thorough investigation.
   A group of 60 blacks started out in Manahan Village, a low-income
housing project, and marched peacefully through the business
district of this affluent northern New Jersey township Monday night
chanting, ``We Want Justice,'' and carrying placards criticizing the
police.
   Marchers said before the one-hour rally that they wanted to be a
visible reminder of dissatisfaction with the inquiry into the death
of John ``Tony' Jackson, 22.
   Jackson was well-known in the close-knit Manahan Village
community, protesters said. His death has been linked to possible
drug abuse, but marchers contend rough handling by police may have
caused the death of the asthma sufferer.
   The marches have been peaceful, unlike recent racial disturbances
in Miami and Tampa, Fla., stemming from the deaths of blacks during
encounters with police.
   Similar disturbances have touched New Jersey in recent months. In
Perth Amboy, Hispanics demonstrated their anger for two nights in
June after a Mexican man was shot and killed by an off-duty police
officer.
   In an effort to defuse tension in Morristown, a town of about
16,500 people, U.S. Justice Department mediators are looking into
Jackson's death at the mayor's request. The mayor and police chief
have met separately with marchers, but protesters who have
participated in all seven marches said Monday they do not trust
local authorities.
   ``It's nothing racial, it's just justice,'' said Louan McCoy, one
of the marchers.
   ``A life was taken while in the custody of police,'' said another
marcher, Gwen King. ``Regardless of color, a life has been taken.''
   An autopsy showed Jackson had cocaine and opiates in his system
when he died on Jan. 28, officials say. Preliminary tests also
showed no signs of physical trauma to the body.
   The autopsy did not reveal a cause of death and a final
toxicological report will be finished within eight weeks, said the
state medical examiner's office. Protesters say they are willing to
march during that time.
   ``We're going to march as long as it takes,'' said Frank Osborne,
the victim's uncle and organizer of the rallies.
   Police Chief Robert White and Mayor David Manahan on Monday
praised the orderliness and discipline of the marches, but said
there was little they could do to satisfy the participants.
   Before Jackson's arrest on a traffic warrant, he ran from police
and was caught after bumping into an officer near a house in Manahan
Village, where he lived, authorities say.
   Police said they found Jackson with a small amount of cocaine and
marijuana, and an asthma inhalator. Shortly after he was handcuffed,
Jackson complained of shortness of breath, police said. Witnesses
have said he cried out for help and, soon after, collapsed.
   Police took him to Morristown Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead.
   ``(Police) were aware of the asthma,'' White said. ``A quick
decision was made to take him to the hospital. I find no fault with
that decision.''
   Protesters say the police were inattentive and questioned why an
ambulance was not summoned. They say the case is typical of the
town's treatment of blacks.
   The mayor, who met with marchers Friday, said he understands the
resentment of blacks, which he attributes partially to economic and
housing discrimination in the town. But he said they are wrong to
accuse police of impropriety.
   ``I really believe, having read the autopsy report, that the
police did everything by the book,'' said Manahan, whose brother
developed the housing project. ``(Protesters) have picked the wrong
case. I'm not saying the police haven't roughed up black people
here, but they picked the wrong case.''

   An inmate was killed and prison facilities
burned during a four-hour riot at penitentiary in the central city
of San Luis Potosi, the Excelsior news service reported.
   Twenty inmates were arrested and area residents said they saw at
least 20 prisoners escape during Monday's riot, the private news
service said.
   The report provided only sketchy details about the riot. It did
not say how it began or how inmate Roberto Martell Antablo was
killed.
   However, the agency said inmate Mauro Gomez Pando was arrested
for questioning in the killing and a possible role in the riot.
   It said the prison's archives, medical clinic and a courtroom
were burned before riot police quelled the uprising.

<HEAD>Academy Award Winner Lionel Newman Dies At Age 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lionel Newman, who composed, conducted or
supervised the scores of more than 250 movies, including ``Hello,
Dolly,'' for which he won an Oscar, has died. He was 73.
   Newman died of a heart attack Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, publicist Chuck Panama said.
   Newman's 11 Oscar nominations included for scoring the music of
such films as ``Doctor Doolittle,'' ``Mardi Gras,'' ``Let's Make
Love'' and ``The Pleasure Seekers,'' among others. His also wrote
the score for ``Love Me Tender,'' during which Elvis Presley made
his film debut, and conducted the scores for ``Cleopatra,'' ``Planet
of the Apes,'' and ``The Omen.''
   He shared the Academy Award with Lennie Hayton for musical
adaption of Jerry Herman's score of ``Hello, Dolly,'' the 1969 movie
that starred Barbra Streisand.
   Born Jan. 4, 1916, in New Haven, Conn., Newman moved to Hollywood
when he was a teen-ager. His first job was conducting for the Earl
Carroll Vanities, where he met his wife, Beverly Carroll.
   The musician then worked as Mae West's piano player until he
joined 20th Century Fox in 1943 as a rehearsal pianist. He remained
with Fox for more than 40 years.
   His first major hit was the song ``Again'' from the movie
``Roadhouse.''
   Newman, who in his later years at Fox oversaw the musical
segments for motion pictures and television, resigned in 1985. But
two years later he joined MGM-UA with similar responsibilities.
   Many of Newman's relatives were also active in the entertainment
industry, including his nephew, pop singer and songwriter Randy
Newman.
   In addition to his wife, Newman is survived by a brother three
sisters and three daughters.

   The dollar was lower in early European trading
today, pressured by Monday's central bank intervention and the
absence of many traders celebrating holidays in Asia and West
Germany, currency dealers said.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said the market was uncertain and a bit jumpy following
Monday's dollar sales by seven European central banks, the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada.
   They said that while the sales seem small, the appearance of the
central banks confirmed their resolve to keep the dollar from
climbing too high.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.20 yen to a closing 129.50. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 129.58 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8693 West German marks, down from 1.8810
   _1.5885 Swiss francs, down from 1.5969
   _6.3620 French francs, down from 6.3950
   _2.1093 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1200
   _1,364.75 Italian lire, down from 1,370.50
   _1.1825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1840
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7368, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.7345 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $391.75 a troy ounce, up
from $388.95 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $391.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $391.30, up from $387.50 bid late
Monday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.91 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.82.
   Financial markets are closed in Hong Kong until Thursday for the
Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations. Workers in parts of West
Germany were participating in carnival celebrations.

   A girl whose hand is frozen in the shape of a claw
from clutching her dead mother's hand for three days while trapped
under rubble is among the Armenian earthquake victims arriving in
this country for treatment.
   The 15-year-old girl, Lena, is among dozens of survivors of the
devastating December earthquake who have begun arriving this week to
receive medical treatment arranged by two American organizations
that sent volunteers to the quake-damaged region.
   Lena was unaware that the parent she was clutching so tightly was
dead, doctors said Monday. Now, she needs treatment for a paralyzed
left hand.
   Soviet doctors told varied and tragic stories about other
victims, some so severely injured that their limbs, skulls and bones
were crushed, the American volunteers said.
   ``They said that they didn't get their first smile from a kid for
three weeks. The kids couldn't sleep through the night. They said
one would start crying and all the others would start,'' Dr. Nishan
G. Goudsouzian, chief of pediatric anesthesiology at Massachusetts
General Hospital, said at a news conference.
   Two American organizations, Project HOPE and Americares, are
coordinating what are the first airlifts of Armenian earthquake
victims to the United States.
   Fifteen Armenians arrived Sunday in New York City with the help
of Americares, a relief agency based in New Canaan, Conn. The
patients are scheduled to go to hospitals in New York, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania and Missouri for treatment. Americares officials said
they expect another airlift of victims to arrive in the United
States by the end of the week.
   A group of 37 children sponsored by the Virginia-based
organization Project HOPE is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force
Base near Washington on Thursday.
   Those children will go to hospitals in Massachusetts, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, Florida and Ohio. Each child will
be accompanied by a guardian, Project Hope officials said.
   Most of the adults and children need surgical and reconstructive
treatment. The average stay will be between two and three months,
doctors said.
   ``They have severe orthopedic or reconstructive needs,'' said
Americares spokesman Steve Norman. ``We're talking about crushed
pelvises. We have cases in which whole buildings fell on people's
legs and arms.''
   Nine physicians from Americares participated in medical relief
effort in Armenia. Eight doctors flew to Armenia in the Project Hope
effort.
   Doctors plan to insert tendon implants, muscle implants and use
skin grafts to ``rebuild sections of bodies that are missing,'' said
Norman.
   Meanwhile, a C-5A jet loaded with 140,000 pounds of soup, new
clothes, batteries and candles donated by such corporations as
Lipton and Kodak lifted off Monday from Westover Air Force Base in
Chicopee.
   Air base spokesman Gordon Newell said the jet was expected to
land in Incirlik, Turkey, on Wednesday and the items would be
ferried to Armenia across the border because the Armenian airport is
too small to land the huge jet.

<HEAD>Award-Winning Director, Choreographer Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ron Field, a Tony and Emmy award winning director
and choreographer who developed routines for dancers ranging from
Fred Astaire to Michael Jackson, has died at age 55.
   Field died Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital of neurological
impairment due to brain lesions. He had lived in Manhattan.
   Field's career began in 1942 when as an 8-year-old he appeared
with Gertrude Lawrence on Broadway in ``Lady In The Dark.'' He also
danced in numerous Broadway shows early in his career, including
``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' and ``Kismet.''
   Besides Jackson and Astaire, Field choreographed Gene Kelly, Ray
Bolger, Ben Vereen, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Cyd Charisse, Debbie Allen,
Carol Lawrence, Chita Rivera, Sandy Duncan, Marge Champion, Shirley
MacLaine, Debbie Reynolds, Raquel Welch, Ann-Margret, Liza Minnelli,
Bernadette Peters, Tommy Tune and others.
   He won Tony awards for his work as director and choreographer of
the Broadway musical ``Applause,'' starring Lauren Bacall.
   Field's choreography for ``Zorba'' and most recently, ``Rags,''
resulted in additional Tony nominations.
   Field's other Broadway credits as director and choreographer
include ``King of Hearts,'' and the revivals of ``On The Town'' and
``Peter Pan.''
   He won Emmys for choreographing such shows as ``Ben Vereen ...
His Roots,'' ``America Salutes Richard Rodgers'' and ``Baryshnikov
on Broadway,'' which won a record nine Emmys.
   He also directed Carol Burnett in ``Once Upon A Mattress''; Danny
Kaye and Ms. Duncan in ``Pinocchio''; and Dean Jones and Teri Garr
in ``The Brothers Grimm.''
   Field also was responsible for the dances and musical staging of
five years of the Academy Awards presentations, three years of the
Tony Awards and three years of the Emmy Awards.
   Besides his work in theater and television, Field has produced
and staged productions for venues ranging from the Casino de Paris
to the Casino du Liban in Beirut to the 1984 World's Fair in New
Orleans.
   Field made his choreographic opera debut with the New York City
Opera premier of ``Ashmedai'' and worked with director Martin
Scorcese on the Robert de Niro-Ms. Minnelli movie, ``New York, New
York.''
   In 1984, choreographed the spectacular show at the Los Angeles
Olympics that included 3,300 dancers, singers and musicians at the
opening ceremonies.
   At his death, Field was working on a new production, a musical
entitled ``Sound Stage 10.''
   Field's choreography can be seen in the current national tour of
``Cabaret,'' starring Joel Grey.
   He is survived by his mother, Meta Adorf of Chula Vista, Calif.,
and his father, Harry Field.
   Funeral arrangements were not completed but attorney Michael
Miller said a memorial will be staged within six weeks at a Broadway
theater.

   Snow was falling in the Great Lakes and the Southwest and
freezing rain stretched from the Appalachians to Texas' Gulf Coast
after another day of record-breaking cold.
   Forty-one cities tied or set record lows Monday in 10 states,
mainly between the Pacific Coast and the Rockies. They included Ely,
Nev., where a reading of 30 degrees below zero was the lowest
temperature ever recorded there.
   Snow reached from northern New York state across the Great Lakes
region to Minnesota and North Dakota. Buffalo, N.Y., received 5
inches in the six hours that ended at 1 a.m. EST.
   Snow also was falling in northeast New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle.
   Freezing rain was falling over parts of the Virginias, Tennessee,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and the lower Texas Gulf Coast. Rain
was scattered from southeast Louisiana to North Carolina.
   Winter storm warnings and advisories for sleet and freezing rain
have been posted from the southeast Texas, Louisiana, much of
Mississippi and northwest Alabama.
   Advisories for snow squalls have been posted over portions of
western and northern New York state. A snow advisory was issued for
southwest and south central New Mexico, and freeze warnings were
posted for southwest Arizona and the valleys and lower deserts of
Southern California.
   Today's forecast called for snow with some sleet scattered across
much of Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, and freezing rain along
the Texas Gulf Coast and over interior portions of Louisiana and
Mississippi. Light snow was forecast to extend from Montana across
the Dakotas and northern Minnesota to Upper Michigan, and from New
York state to northern New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the teens in the central and
northern Rockies and in much of Nevada, Utah and Idaho; in the teens
and 20s in much of the Great Plains, the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and northern
New England; in the 50s in the Desert Southwest and Southern
California; in the 50s and 60s from southern Alabama to much of
Georgia and the Carolinas; and in the 70s and lower 80s in southern
Georgia and Florida. Most other areas were expected to have highs in
the 30s and 40s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 37 degrees below zero at
Craig, Colo., to 75 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   A troupe of 59 Soviet ballet dancers is stranded
at a hotel here, its 15-city U.S tour stalled until the producer
either finds enough money to continue or sends the dancers back home.
   The Donetsk Ballet was scheduled to move on to Detroit Monday.
But after big-name guest stars from major companies failed to appear
with the troupe last week, U.S. and Mexican investors reportedly
withdrew their backing.
   Producer Jan Urdzik said Monday that she had until today to find
other investors.
   ``We've not made an announcement that we've canceled. We're still
working on some things,'' Ms. Urdzik said.
   In the meantime, the Howard Gilman Foundation in New York said it
would advance the dancers' living expenses for a week.
   The Lyric Opera House, where the Ukrainian troupe put on five
performances before half-empty houses, has paid for three days'
worth of lunches for the troupe, and the theater's wardrobe staff
bought fruit for the dancers.
   ``Locally, they are being treated very well. All kinds of offers
of help have come in,'' said Tim Kroneberger, the theater's building
manager.
   Ms. Urdzik said the dancers have return tickets to Moscow and
that if the tour is canceled they will be put on flights back home.

<TEXT>
   California's wage policies toward its female
employees in the 1930s are being debated anew as lawyers for 60,000
to 70,000 women try to prove deliberate bias in state pay scales.
   A federal court trial scheduled to open today may determine
whether there is any legal life left in the doctrine of ``comparable
worth,'' or equal pay for different jobs of similar value.
   But lawyers for the women are disavowing that label and describe
their case as one of simple sex discrimination.
   The California State Employees' Association contends the state
adopted a deliberate policy of paying less for female-dominated jobs
in state service in 1931 and has preserved the effects of that
policy to this day. State lawyers deny such a policy ever existed,
but say any taint was removed when job classifications were
reorganized in 1937-38.
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, hearing the case without
a jury, is limiting testimony in the first phase of the trial to the
intent and effects of state policies in the 1930s.
   If the union can prove deliberate discrimination, later phases
will examine recent wage practices, with potential damages of more
than $100 million for women in female-dominated state jobs since
1977.
   The CSEA suit, filed in 1984, ran into a huge obstacle the next
year in a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
covers California and eight other Western states.
   Overturning the nation's first statewide comparable worth
verdict, the court ruled that the state of Washington could follow
prevailing market wages in paying less to workers in
female-dominated jobs.
   The opinion by Judge Anthony M. Kennedy, now a Supreme Court
justice, said a decision to pay unequal market wages did not
constitute the type of intentional discrimination needed for such a
suit.
   The California employees' group claims it has found the evidence
needed to survive the appeals court ruling: a policy of sex-based
salary-setting in state government dating back to 1931.
   ``The state has never relied primarily on prevailing rates in
setting salaries,'' the union said in court papers.
   ``Wage discrimination on the basis of sex was the state's
standard operating procedure during the early 1930s, and ... the
effects of such discrimination carry over to the present day.''
   So far, the union's strategy has succeeded in keeping the case in
court. Patel has ruled that the claims of intentional discrimination
in salary-setting, if proved, would be grounds for awarding damages.
   But Patel, a former lawyer for the National Organization for
Women, has indicated skepticism about the employees' association's
claims that it can prove a link between the alleged discrimination
of the early 1930s and later pay policies.

   Three out of four Israeli Jews oppose the
formation of a Palestinian state and four out of five say such a
state would threaten Israel's security, according to a public
opinion poll released today.
   The results indicate a slight thaw in Israeli attitudes toward a
Palestinian state. A similar survey conducted a decade ago found
that nine out of 10 opposed the formation of a Palestinian state and
believed it would threaten Israel.
   The current survey, conducted by the Israel Institute of Applied
Social Research, asked a nationwide sample of 1,192 Israeli Jews if
they would ``accept or oppose the establishment of a Palestinian
state.''
   Seventy-seven percent said they would oppose a separate
Palestinian state, and 23 percent said they would accept it.
   In a second question, the institute asked ``Do you believe a
Palestinian state on the West Bank would threaten or not threaten
the security of the state of Israel?''
   About 80 percent said such a state would be threatening.
   ``It's still a very high number, but there is a certain thawing
which is very slow ... but in a dovish direction,'' said Elihu Katz,
director of the private institute.
   The survey was conducted last month and involved Jews 20 years
and older, Katz said. He said it was the latest in a series begun in
1967, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan
and Egypt in the Middle East war.
   Katz said the institute does not officially quote a margin of
error for its surveys but estimated it to be in a range of 3 to 5
percent.

<TEXT>
   A second Marine has been convicted of
negligence in the death of a soldier who had been left behind in the
Mojave Desert during a training exercise last summer.
   Sgt. Thomas Turnell was found guilty Monday and demoted to lance
corporal, the same punishment given last week to another sergeant in
the death of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother.
   Turnell was found innocent of two other counts _ the more serious
charge of failure to obey a lawful order and a lesser charge of
unauthorized absence.
   ``I'm just glad it wasn't any harder on my family,'' Turnell said
as he left court.
   The military jury deliberated about two hours before returning
the verdict.
   Turnell was accused of failing to follow the policies of his unit
by being absent without authorization for two days during Rother's
disappearance. He also was accused of negligence for failing to
account for the whereabouts and welfare of Rother, 19, of
Minneapolis, who was a member of Turnell's squad.
   Rother was left behind after being posted as a road guide for an
exercise at Twentynine Palms, Calif., on Aug. 30. His remains were
not found until December.
   Turnell's superior, Sgt. Christopher Clyde, was found guilty of
negligence last week for allowing Turnell special time off and for
failing to account for his men.
   In testimony Monday at Turnell's trial, Clyde acknowledged having
given Turnell permission to take two days' liberty.
   In closing arguments, Capt. Robert Nunally, the prosecutor, told
the jury that Turnell was only concerned with his two days' off, not
the whereabouts of Rother.
   ``If he had cared, or asked one question, maybe we wouldn't be
here today,'' Nunally said.
   But Turnell's civilian attorney, Guy Garand, said the
disappearance was not entirely the fault of his client.
   ``There are many people who are responsible for this incident,''
Garand said. He said there was poor communication in the entire
company, a reflection of poor leadership.

   Flooding caused by torrential rain has left
20,000 people homeless in Zambia's capital, Lusaka, a ruling party
official said today.
   Bautis Kapula, a senior member of the ruling United National
Indepedence Party, appealed to the government to provide emergency
assistance for people whose mud houses were washed away in
torrential rain Monday.
   He said $30,000 was needed to buy relief supplies for families
being housed in churches, schools and shelters in the city
showground.
   On Monday, police reported two children drowned in a water-filled
pothole during Zambia's heaviest rains in 10 years.
   Most of the destroyed houses were built from bricks of hardened
mud under a state self-help scheme allowing city dwellers to build
their own homes without adhering to standard building regulations.
It was an effort to relieve a chronic housing shortage.

<HEAD>As Pullout Ends, Soviets Say Up to 15,000 Troops Died in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Foreign Ministry official said today up to 15,000
Soviet troops were killed in Afghanistan, 2,000 more than the last
reported figure and an indication of heavy losses the Kremlin
incurred during waning days of its intervention.
   ``It doesn't mean that during the last months we had the
bloodiest period of the war in Afghanistan,'' Yuri K. Alexeyev, head
of the ministry's Middle East Department, insisted to reporters.
   But he added: ``We had shellings by the opposition of the cities
... and a lot of civilians died, and of course Soviet servicemen.''
   He said the new death toll came from Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who left Islamabad, Pakistan on Monday.
   After they began their withdrawal last May 15, Soviet forces had
to rely increasingly on Afghan government troops to protect them
from guerrilla attacks. The pullout, brokered by the United Nations,
is to be completed next Wednesday.
   The last report on casualties was from Soviet Gen. Alexei D.
Lizichev. He told a Moscow news conference May 25 that 13,310 Soviet
troops had been killed, 35,478 wounded and 311 were missing. He said
his figures applied from Dec. 27, 1979, when Soviet troops and tanks
entered the Afghan war, until May 1, 1988.
   Alexeyev did not say what period his figure covered and did not
give numbers of wounded and missing.

   Mardi Gras revelers _ their spirits bolstered
by, well, spirits _ took to the streets in 38-degree weather today
for the nation's bawdiest celebration.
   ``It's not that cold,'' said jazz musician Pete Fountain, dressed
as a samurai with his Half-Fast Marching Club. ``It's just a little
wind, but we'll fix that with some fire water.''
   ``We were colder about five years ago,'' he laughed. ``We were in
kilts.''
   In another part of town, the Zulu parade lined up _ blacks in
black face and grass skirts in an age-old spoof of the city's
pretentious social circles.
   Eleven parades were scheduled in the New Orleans area, and up to
1.8 million people were expected for the celebration of excess that
ends Carnival's month of balls and two weeks of parades before the
start of Lent.
   At dawn, most of the activity was along St. Charles Avenue, the
main parade route, where early risers staked out their positions and
set up tents, makeshift bars and barbecue grills for a day-long
frolic.
   ``You have to get here early to get a curbside spot. Last year I
didn't get here until 6 and I was five rows back,'' said Ross Allen,
whose place had been staked out at midnight.
   The festivities have been marred by the slaying of a tourist
known as ``Mr. Mardi Gras'' to his friends.
   Mardi Gras ends midnight, when Ash Wednesday ushers in six weeks
of Lenten repentance to this predominantly Roman Catholic city.
   ``Last year we had about a million people on the streets during
the day,'' said Ray Holman, chief of police field operations.
   ``I think that if the weather doesn't get totally unbearable
we'll get at least that number again, maybe more.''
   He said crowds were bigger than usual despite wet, cold weather
during the popular weekend Endymion and Bacchus parades. Bad
weather, however, canceled Fat Tuesday parades in the little Acadian
communities of Grand Marais and Loreauville.
   The National Weather Service forecast a 50 percent chance of rain
or drizzle, with highs in the upper 40s but winds near 15 mph making
it feel as if it were near 30.
   For Stacy Winck, 19, of New Orleans, ear muffs and a down parka
did little to fend off the wind that made temperatures in the 30s
feel much colder.
   ``We're acting like idiots,'' she said. ``But it's all in the
fun.''
   That kind of weather can be good for business, bartenders said.
   ``People want to come in out of the cold,'' said Bill Hadley,
manager of Lulu White's Mahogany Hall bar.
   But Ivan Cook of Phoenix said only a downpour could keep him
under a roof on Mardi Gras.
   ``When you're out on the street you don't feel it,'' said Cook,
who was among the thousands of tourists jamming the city.
   Hotels decked in the carnival colors of purple, green and gold
were nearly at capacity.
   There were two parades Monday, and a Mississippi riverfront
shopping development held its third annual ``Lundi Gras''
celebration with bands, fireworks, a riverboat parade and the
ceremonial arrival by boat of a man dressed as Rex, King of Carnival.
   The identity of the real Rex _ a different member of New Orleans
society each year _ is kept secret until the final hours before he
rides in the biggest parade of the season and meets the mayor for a
champagne toast before downtown crowds.
   This year the honor went to Beauregard Bassich, 62, executive
director of City Park.
   The slaying occurred early Monday.
   Randy Michael Robichaux, 37, of Baton Rouge, was fatally shot
after turning out his pockets to show a holdup man he didn't have
any money, a companion told police. No arrests have been made.
   Authorities said Robichaux was an employee at Louisiana State
University who came to New Orleans to see Sunday night's Bacchus
parade.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he was LSU's Mr. Mardi Gras. I just
told someone the other day purple, green and yellow run through his
blood,'' said Renee J. Nesbitt, director of residential housing at
LSU, where Robichaux supervised four dormitories.
   She said he had designed the floats for the campus Krewe of the
Tiger carnival parade for seven years, and rode in the group's
eighth annual parade Thursday.
   The slaying was not the only problems connected with Carnival.
   Two float riders were injured when they were hit by objects
thrown at them, police spokeswoman Yvonne Bechet said. Both were
released after treatment at New Orleans hospitals.
   A man was injured when he fell about 12 feet from a float.

   An evangelist who admitted molesting at least
100 boys along the Southern revival circuit since the 1960s was
sentenced to 2{ years in prison today for sodomizing two teen-agers.
   ``I suppose the thing that troubles me most is somebody of the
cloth, who knows the truth, has openly and flagrantly lied,'' Judge
Kenneth Trabue told Mario ``Tony'' Leyva. ``There was an overt
effort to poison the jury on your behalf.''
   Leyva, a Pentecostal preacher from Columbus, Ga., testified at
his trial in state court in September that he never had sex with
children, but he later told the FBI he had sexually abused at least
100 boys beginning in the 1960s.
   Leyva took the stand briefly this morning and said he had lied at
his trial.
   He had faced up to 10 years on the state charges, but the jury
recommended 15 months for each count of child sodomy, and the judge
could not impose a higher sentence, said Assistant Commonwealth's
Attorney Randy Leach.
   In October, Leyva pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy
and shipping minors across state lines for prostitution.
   Federal prosecutors said Leyva and two fellow preachers for years
used the Tony Leyva Evangelistic Association Inc., based in
Columbus, to gain access to boys for sexual purposes. The three
preachers are awaiting sentencing.
   Under the plea bargain, prosecutors will seek a maximum of 20
years in prison.

<HEAD>Governor Seeks to Block Pension System's Purchase Of TV Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Guy Hunt says the Alabama pension
system's purchase of a Montgomery TV station raises troubling First
Amendment questions, and he has asked the Federal Communications
Commission to block the deal.
   Hunt filed a petition Monday opposing the $70 million purchase
agreement for WSFA.
   ``We're glad the issue is before the FCC, where it ought to be,''
said Bill Stephens, an attorney for Retirement Systems of Alabama.
   Monday was the deadline for petitions to be filed concerning
transfer of the license of the station.
   Hunt said the state-funded agency's purchase of the dominant
broadcast news operation in the capital ``raises clear and very
troubling First Amendment issues.''
   David Bronner, who manages the retirement system's $8 billion
portfolio, has defended his decision to buy WSFA from Cosmos
Broadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C. He said there would be no
tampering with the news.
   Bronner has said that the purchase is a ``done deal,'' needing
only FCC approval, and that Alabama would lose $10 million in
earnest money if the state backs out.
   But the governor said the deal is not final, and he asked the FCC
to delay any decision until Alabama courts resolve legal issues
raised by the agreement.
   The petition said the purchase would violate Alabama law barring
government from private enterprise and violate FCC rules by giving
state government two broadcast outlets in Montgomery, counting the
state's educational TV operation.
   William Walsh, deputy secretary-treasurer of the retirement
system, said pension program officials feel there is no conflict
with state law.
   Already, he said, ``the state is involved in the whisky business,
the state is in the hotel and motel business, the state runs the
state docks.'' He was referring to Alabama's state-run liquor stores
and state-owned resorts.
   Hunt has suggested the purchase of WSFA was concocted by Bronner
and teacher lobbyist Paul Hubbert, a major critic of Hunt's
Republican administration.

   Insurgents killed at least 10 people,
including soldiers and a farmer, in three ambushes, the military
said today.
   Maj. Cayetano Ordinaria, army regional spokesman, said eight
Moslem guerrillas today attacked an army truck en route to market in
Bubong in Lanao del Sur province, about 510 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Three soldiers, including a lieutenant, were killed and two were
injured, he said. A farmer who was inspecting a nearby ricefield
also was killed by stray bullets, Ordinaria said.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the government for 17 years,
but the rebellion has tapered off in the past few years to
occasional skirmishes with government troops.
   On Monday, four government soldiers were shot to death when about
50 guerrillas of the communist New People's Army ambushed a truck
near the town of San Luis in Nueva Ecija, about 70 miles northeast
of Manila, a military report said. The report said two soldiers were
wounded.
   Also Monday, suspected communist rebels shot and killed a
Philippine constabulary major and his aide in an ambush in Rizal
province on the outskirts of the capital, the military said.
   It said an undetermined number of rebels in a truck fired at a
vehicle carrying Maj. Antonio Manalo and Sgt. Julian Guitan. They
were killed and another soldier was wounded.
   Manalo was the commanding officer of the 225th Philippine
Constabulary company based in Rizal province.
   The communist rebels have been waging a 20-year insurgency.

   Barbara Tuchman was remembered upon her
death as the popular historian whose 1962 ``The Guns of August''
reminded the superpowers of the dangers of diplomatic miscalculation
as they teetered on the brink.
   The two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and author of 11 books,
including the current best seller ``The First Salute,'' died Monday
at a hospital in Greenwich following a stroke. She was 77.
   ```The Guns of August' had a tremendous impact on President
Kennedy and all who went through the Cuban missile crisis,'' said
William Manchester, author of ``The Death of a President'' and
writer-in-residence at Wesleyan University in Middletown.
   Tuchman's ``The First Salute,'' a look at the American Revolution
and the Dutch revolution that preceded it by 200 years, has been on
The New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks.
   She said last fall it would be her last book because of failing
eyesight.
   Tuchman won the Pulitzer for history for ``The Guns of August''
in 1962 and ``Stilwell and the American Experience in China'' in
1971. The latter work was hailed as ``brilliant'' by America's
pre-eminent China scholar, John K. Fairbank of Harvard University.
   In 1978, she was awarded the Gold Medal for History of the
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
   She also wrote ``The Proud Tower,'' a story of Europe before
World War I, and ``A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,''
which traces the tumult of the period by following the career of a
feudal lord.
   ``The Guns of August,'' which established her reputation,
examined how the military buildup in Europe led the Great Powers to
bungle their way into World War I.
   It was a favorite of President Kennedy because of its lessons for
leaders in the nuclear age, said historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a
Kennedy adviser. Kennedy presented a copy of the book to British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.
   ``What he felt was that `The Guns of August' was a clear
demonstration (of) the extent that miscalculation got people into
war,'' Schlesinger said in a telephone interview.
   Writer John Hersey, who worked with Tuchman on the issues of
censorship and freedom of speech for the Author's League, called the
book ``a kind of parable for our times, to make us realize where
some of our policies might lead us.''
   Tuchman was born Jan. 30, 1912, in New York City and graduated
from Radcliffe College in 1933. She lived in Greenwich.
   She expressed pride in the fact that she never gained an advanced
degree and was not an academic, saying during an interview last fall
that ``a Ph.D. would have ruined me.''
   Although some professional historians criticized some of her work
as shallow, others praised her as a writer whose broad scope and
lively style made history exciting for the general reading public.
   ```The Guns of August' was a superb book,'' said John M. Blum,
Sterling professor of history at Yale University. ``It would have
been a very picayune professional historian who had any objections
to it.''
   ``As an historian, I belong to the How rather than the Why
school,'' Tuchman wrote in an autobiographical sketch. ``I am a
seeker of the small facts not the big Explanation; a narrator not a
philosopher. ...''
   ``With each book I approached nearer, as I hope, to my goal of
presenting history as literature.''
   Tuchman began her career as an editorial assistant and occasional
correspondent for The Nation, which her father, investment banker
Maurice Wertheim, bought in 1935 to save from bankruptcy. She
covered President Roosevelt's 1936 campaign and the Spanish Civil
War.
   Tuchman's mother, Alma Morgenthau, was a sister of Henry
Morgenthau Jr., Treasury Secretary under President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
   During World War II, she worked for the U.S. Office of War
Information in New York.
   Tuchman is survived by her husband of 48 years, Dr. Lester R.
Tuchman, their three daughters, a sister and four grandchildren.
   A private funeral will be held Wednesday. A public memorial
service will be held Sunday at the New York City Library's Celeste
Bartos Forum.

   The first installment of CBS's ``Lonesome Dove''
was the highest-rated show of the week.
   Sunday night's premiere of the four-night Western drama had a
28.5 rating and a 42 share and was the highest-rated start for a
miniseries so far this season, according to A.C. Nielsen figures.
   Monday night's episode dropped in the overnight ratings from the
nation's 17 largest markets, getting a 20.2 rating and 29 share. But
the episode's ratings are expected to increase considerably when
figures from rural areas become available.
   Sunday night's installment had a 34 share in the overnights and a
42 share nationally.
   ``Lonesome Dove,'' starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones and
Anjelica Huston, is based on the 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
by Larry McMurtry. It airs through Wednesday.
   NBC's movie ``The Sex Tapes,'' which ran against ``Lonesome
Dove'' on Sunday, was 25th in the ratings, with a 16.2 rating and 24
share.
   On Monday, NBC put up its highest-rated comedies, including
``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest,'' ``Cheers'' and ``Night Court.''
They averaged a rating of 18.6. ABC's ``Columbo'' had an overnight
rating of 18.0.
   The national rating is a percentage of the 90.4 million U.S.
homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use.

   Andre Cayatte, a lawyer turned moviemaker who was
known for his films on crime and justice, died Sunday of heart
failure at age 80.
   In 1950, Cayatte's ``Justice est Faite'' (``Justice is Done'')
won the Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival. He later made
more films focusing on the weaknesses or errors of the judicial
system, notably ``Nous Sommes Tous des Assassins'' (``We Are All
Murderers'') in 1951.

   Southwestern farmers struggled to save their citrus crops today
and Idaho ranchers searched for livestock smothered in seemingly
bottomless snow drifts as a deadly arctic air mass shattered more
weather records across the nation.
   Ice covered vast parts of the Southeast and Texas, causing power
outages, filling hotels and causing hundreds of auto accidents on
glassy roads. New Orleans went ahead with its soggy Mardi Gras, but
other Louisiana towns decided that this Fat Tuesday would be spent
indoors.
   At least 78 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31,
when frigid air broke out of Alaska.
   Among the latest was a 59-year-old Chicago man found frozen to
death Monday outside a metal shop where he often sold aluminum cans,
police said. In Washington state, divers found the body of a
53-year-old orchard worker whose car broke through the ice in
Osoyoos Lake. Two young brothers drowned in Kentucky after falling
through thin ice on a pond. And an 84-year-old woman died of
exposure in Dunnville, Ky., after slipping on an icy sidewalk and
falling into a ditch.
   With the cold front stopped in its tracks, no immediate relief is
expected. The cold continued to plague virtually the entire nation,
but especially the western third.
   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus declared a state of emergency Monday
in rural Clark County, and two dozen National Guard troops helped
ranchers today as they searched drifts as deep as 15 feet for buried
cattle and sheep. They also helped clear snow from streets in
Dubois, blocked since last week by drifts up to 8 feet.
   Guardsmen used a helicopter to drop hay to stranded cattle and
sheep, said Ross Mayfield, operations officer for the Idaho state
Bureau of Disaster Services. ``We're talking hundreds'' of animals
killed, he said.
   County Commissioner Ab Laird said he lost more than 600 sheep,
700 cows and dozens of heifers and bulls on his property near Dubois
in eastern Idaho.
   ``They were all young cows, all pregnant, all ready to calve,''
Laird said.
   The Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to save nearly
500 trumpeter swans that have been unable to feed on a frozen fork
of the Snake River. At least 20 of the swans have died so far. The
flock represents a quarter of the species' population in North
America.
   In California, Texas and Arizona, citrus farmers fretted as
temperatures dropped below freezing in usually temperate growing
areas.
   ``If the weather forecast is correct, we're looking at a high
probability of serious damage,'' said Ray Prewett, executive
director of Texas Citrus Mutual, a McAllen-based growers'
organizations.
   Growers brought out smudge pots and turned on giant fans to keep
crop-damaging frost from settling. In California's San Joaquin
Valley, one grower reported temperatures dipping to 19 degrees
Monday.
   Today's low at 2 a.m. EST was minus 37 degrees in Craig, Colo.
   More than 40 record lows were set Monday, and the record cold
continued today in several cities. Sacramento, Calif., broke a
106-year-old record with 26 degrees, and San Francisco, which had
its coldest February day ever with 31 degrees on Monday, rose to 32
today, a record for the date. Colorado Springs, Colo., was 11
degrees below zero. Las Vegas hit 16 degrees _ its coldest February
day ever _ and Winnemucca, Nev., tied its record low of minus 18.
Milford, Utah, had its coldest February day ever with minus 29.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was a record 23 degrees.
   Chicago's low of minus 4 marked the first subzero readings of the
year there, and helped fill homeless shelters.
   In New Mexico, a fierce snowstorm dumped so much snow at Taos Ski
Valley that it couldn't be measured. The resort's gauge only goes to
110 inches _ just over 9 feet _ and it was lost somewhere under the
snow.
   More snow fell early today over northeast New Mexico and Texas'
panhandle. Snow also fell from northern New York state across
northern Ohio, the upper Great Lakes, Minnesota and North Dakota.
Buffalo, N.Y., had 8 inches of snow overnight.
   Freezing rain continued to fall over a vast stretch of the
Southeast, where icy roads have created havoc.
   ``We're on our way to a deadly Mardi Gras in terms of traffic,''
said Lt. Ronnie Jones, a spokesman for the Louisiana state police.
Two more people died in weather-related traffic accidents in
Louisiana on Monday, bringing the state's total to six.
   Although New Orleans planned to go ahead with its Mardi Gras
celebrations today, parades were canceled in the little Acadian
communities of Grand Marais and Loreauville. Temperatures were in
the upper 40s, but the wind made it feel closer to 30.
   Still, bundled-up enthusiasts early today began lining St.
Charles Avenue for a good spot to catch trinkets tossed from Mardi
Gras floats.
   ``We're acting like idiots,'' said Stacy Winck, 19, wearing ear
muffs and a down parka. ``But it's all in the fun.''
   In Arkansas, video shop owners were grateful for the dreadful
weather. ``It's amazing how many people can't get to work but can
come get movies,'' said Lisa Laffoon, manager of Look Video in North
Little Rock.
   The weather was blamed for a 21-car pileup in Huntsville, Ala.,
on Monday. In Jackson, Miss., a power outage that resulted from icy
wires left about 60,000 people without electricity and helped fill
hotels. Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus ordered all state offices closed
today because of the cold.
   ``The North Pole has opened its front door and is pushing the
cold air straight toward us,'' said Ray Young, a National Weather
Service meteorologist in Birmingham, Ala. ``The next cold air will
reinforce the cold air that is already here. All of this is just
sitting on top of us.''

   Discovery's five astronauts completed
a successful practice countdown in the spaceship today as
technicians worked to replace three engine pumps in time to meet a
mid-March launch date, NASA said.
   Wearing bulky space suits, the crew of the 28th shuttle mission
entered the cabin for the final two hours of the rehearsal, which
concluded at 11:37 a.m., 37 minutes late because of minor
communications and computer problems.
   ``Everything appears to have been successful for today's terminal
countdown demonstration test,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   The countdown test, which began Sunday, duplicated much of the
actual count except that the fuel tank was not loaded and some
procedures were shortened.
   Discovery was powered up and its electronic, communications and
other systems were checked. The communications satellite to be
deployed by the crew was loaded in the cargo bay on Monday.
   As the countdown progressed, technicians at the base of the
launch pad continued removing the oxygen turbopumps from Discovery's
three main engines. The first was pulled Monday, and the second came
out early today.
   They will be replaced as a precaution because of two tiny cracks
discovered in the shuttle Atlantis after its flight in December.
Discovery has identical pumps.
   The repairs delayed the launch from Feb. 23 until March 10 at the
earliest. Officials said last week that if Discovery could not get
off the only available launch pad by March 18, the mission might
have to be delayed for months.
   That's because the next shuttle mission, that of Atlantis, must
take place between April 28 and May 28 in order for its crew to
dispatch the Magellan spacecraft to orbit Venus, which will not come
into proper position again until 1991.
   Astronaut Mike Coats, commander of the Discovery mission, said
Monday he is confident about a mid-March launch.
   ``We were discouraged about a week ago, because the first
analysis indicated it might take too long a time to get the new
pumps and that there would be no way we could launch in March,'' he
said. ``Now everybody we've talked to is very optimistic. We're
confident they've got a good fix on it now.''
   Arnold Aldrich, NASA national space transportation system
director, said in Washington on Monday he is certain of launching
Discovery without affecting the Atlantis launch.

   Louis H. Narcisse, a flamboyant religious leader
who dressed in royal finery, was regarded as a king by his followers
and adopted as his motto ``It's nice to be nice,'' has died at age
67.
   Narcisse, who died of a heart attack Friday at Mount Carmel Mercy
Hospital, wore robes and a crown, carried a golden staff and was
known as His Grace.
   At church events and funerals, a red carpet would be rolled to
his Mercedes-Benz or Rolls-Royce.
   Narcisse bought a $3.5 million, 42-room mansion soon after he
moved to Detroit in 1971, said his son, the Rev. Prince Narcisse.
   In keeping with his motto, Narcisse allowed the homeless into his
mansion, and his churches led national relief efforts for the hungry.
   He was born and raised in Gretna, La., and ordained by
Metropolitan Spiritual Churches Inc. before his 1945 founding of
Mount Zion Spiritual Temple in Oakland, Calif.
   In 1956 in Oakland, Narcisse was crowned a king by bishops from
the Church of God in Christ and the Church of God. He built churches
in New Orleans, Sacramento, Orlando, Houston and Baton Rouge, the
younger Narcisse said.
   In 1987, Mayor Coleman Young gave him an Award of Merit.
   Funeral services will be Thursday.

   Two men arrested in the killing of a
Nicaraguan rebel commander admitted to roles in the assassination,
and one of them said the killing was planned by the Nicaraguan
Embassy in Honduras.
   Nicaragua today denied the accusation.
   Luis Fernandez Ordonez Reyes, one of three men under arrest in
the case, said Monday that he was a go-between for the Nicaraguan
Embassy security chief and a former Honduran police officer accused
in the Jan. 7 killing of Manuel Rugama, a commander of the
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   ``The plan to eliminate Rugama was prepared by the Nicaraguan
Embassy in Tegucigalpa,'' Ordonez said at a news conference
organized by the Honduran military.
   ``Luis Fernandez Ordonez Reyes' accusations are ridiculous and
completely removed from the truth. The embassy has no security
chief. We deny all involvement by our embassy in the assassination
of the Contra chief,'' Nicaraguan Embassy spokesman Juan Jose
Membreno said today by telephone.
   The Contras have blamed the Nicaraguan government for Rugama's
slaying. They said Rugama was to meet with other Contra leaders on
the day he died.
   Ordonez identified the Nicaraguan Embassy security chief as Jose
de Jesus Pena, and said he introduced Pena to one of Ordonez's
employees, Rigoberto Matute, a former police detective.
   Ordonez, a Nicaraguan who operated a money exchange in
Tegucigalpa, said Pena often visited his business and paid him
between $500 and $1,500 for information about anti-Sandinista rebels
in Honduras.
   Membreno denied that anyone named Jose de Jesus Pena worked for
the embassy.
   The other man presented at the news conference was Juan Bautista
Nunez Amador.
   Bautista Nunez said Matute told him he would pay Bautista Nunez
$20,000 to help in the killing. ``I was the first to fire at
Rugama,'' Bautista Nunez said.
   He said Matute and a third man he knew only by the last name Cano
Arteaga then joined in killing Rugama.
   Matute, Bautista Nunez and Ordonez are being held in the killing.
There was no indication why Matute did not attend the news
conference.
   Rugama apparently was alone when he was shot as he drove on a
highway west of the Honduran capital. Officers found his body on the
road. They said he had been shot 26 times.
   A doctor, Rugama had been a Contra for nine years and was one of
the organization's regional commanders.

   Israel's response to the Palestinian uprising
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ``led to a substantial increase in
human rights violations,'' the State Department said today in its
annual report on human rights conditions worldwide.
   The wide-ranging study also hailed ``remarkable changes in the
Soviet Union'' under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the past
year.
   The report criticized Israeli troops for practices that resulted
in ``many avoidable deaths and injuries'' during the 14-month
uprising.
   From time to time since the violence started in the occupied
territories, the State Department has expressed criticism of Israeli
efforts to bring it under control, but the report appeared to go
beyond the earlier statements.
   The report said Israeli authorities in some cases prosecuted or
took disciplinary action against soldiers or settlers who had killed
Palestinians.
   But it added, ``Regulations were not rigorously enforced;
punishments were usually lenient, and there were many cases of
unjustified killing that did not result in disciplinary actions or
prosecutions.''
   The Palestinian uprising, which began in December 1987, caught
the Israeli army ``by surprise,'' the report said. The armed forces,
``untrained and inexperienced in riot control, responded in a manner
which led to a substantial increase in human rights violations,'' it
said.
   Criticism of the Israel reaction to the uprising also was raised
on Capitol Hill today by the private human rights group Amnesty
International and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   In a report to the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, Amnesty International said that while both sides have
used violence in the Palestinian uprising which began in December
1987, there have been excesses on the Israeli side.
   ``Demonstrators have thrown rocks and Molotov cocktails,'' the
report said. ``However, the tactics of the Israeli army have
exceeded the use of reasonable force.''
   It said there have been ``hundreds of questionable killings'' by
Israeli security forces and that few have been adequately
investigated.
   Amnesty International and the lawyers committee questioned the
use of high velocity bullets by the Israeli forces as well as the
use of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can be
lethal.
   Citing figures compiled by the press, Palestinians and the
Israeli government, the State Department report said ``366
Palestinians were killed in 1988 as a result of the uprising, most
of the by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), some by Israeli
settlers. ... Over 20,000 Palestinians were wounded or injured by
the IDF.''
   The report found that 11 Israelis had been killed in the uprising
and approximately 1,100 injured.
   The 1,560-page report on conditions in more than 160 nations was
prepared for submission to Congress and public release on Wednesday.
However, some accounts appeared in newspapers today.
   On the changes in the Soviet Union, the report said, ``We still
cannot say that there has been a fundamental shift in the Soviet
Union's approach to human rights, but there is no doubt that the
changes in evidence in 1988 have profound implications, as advocates
of significant systemic reform appear to have gained strength.''
   By the end of 1988, all Soviet citizens who had been punished for
political dissent or unauthorized religious activity had been set
free, the report said. It added that plans for amendment or repeal
of statutes limiting political and religious activity have been
announced and that the practice of placing political dissidents in
mental hospitals is being curbed.
   Elsewhere, the report cited ``significant further advances'' in
Hungary and Poland toward a more open society, and added that the
October plebiscite in Chile generated hope that for a peaceful
return to democracy in that country.
   The report said that some of the most significant human rights
violations took place in Iraq, Burundi and Sudan.
   ``In each of these situations, innocent civilian bystanders died
as a result of guerrilla warfare or reprisals for violence by
others,'' it said.
   It accused Iraq of employing chemical warfare against Kurdish
rebels, killing and injuring thousands of civilians and causing tens
of thousands to flee.
   An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 civilians were killed during ethnic
violence in Burundi, in East Africa.

   A snowmobiler was killed
in a collision with a bison, park officials said today.
   Donald M. Anderson, 48, of Geraldine, Mont., died at a hospital
Monday night shortly after the accident, which occurred while he was
snowmobiling with several friends after dark, said park spokeswoman
Joan Anzelmo.
   Anderson's friends drove ahead and lost sight of him, she said.
They went back to find him severely injured on the ground, clumps of
bison hair nearby, Anzelmo said.
   ``It seems that he just ran into a bison on the road. Bison due
frequent that road and it's hard to see them at night,'' said
Anzelmo. ``Apparently this group had passed two other groups of
bison.''
   Anzelmo said rangers would keep watch for the bison but that the
animal may have walked away unharmed. Anzelmo said it was the first
incident she could recall in which a snowmobiler was killed in a
collision with an animal.

<TEXT>
   A soccer club on Tuesday won the
right to advertise condoms on its jerseys.
   The Frankfurt civil court ruled that the ads on the shirts of the
FC Homburg soccer team don't represent an ethical violation.
   The case went to court after the West German Soccer Federation
ruled last fall that FC Homburg was violating ``the basic principles
of ethics and morals in sport'' by advertising the brand name of the
London condom company on its uniforms.
   But in its decision in favor of the team, the court ruled against
that, saying ``morals have fundamentally changed'' in the past two
decades.
   The court also cited a federal Health Ministry campaign promoting
the use of condoms for safer sex. The court said the Health Ministry
advertising was much more direct in promoting condoms than the team.
   The ruling will permit the FC Homburg players to wear the
jerseys, which are inscribed with the brand name of the condoms
outlined by a double circle. The word ``condom'' does not appear.
   German soccer jerseys already advertise electronics goods, dairy
goods and other products.

   A friend of Navajo tribal chairman Peter
MacDonald Sr. said today he paid MacDonald thousands of dollars in
cash and gifts for arranging purchase of a 750,000-acre ranch and
that the chief participated in a cover-up of the transaction.
   Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown testified before a special Senate
committee that MacDonald asked him for $25,000 and a $55,000 BMW
automobile in exchange for arranging an inflated purchase price for
the Big Boquillas Ranch.
   Testifying with immunity from criminal prosecution, Brown told of
being wired by investigators in order to tape conversations he had
with MacDonald about the cover-up. He said the cover-up scheme began
after an investigation of the ranch sale by the local U.S. attorney.
   Brown arranged for the ranch to be purchased from Tenneco Corp.
for $26.2 million by businessman Tom Tracy and then sold immediately
to the Navajos for $33 million. Under the deal Tracy, Brown and
MacDonald split the $7.2 million profit, Brown testified.
   A portion of the MacDonald payment was made in $5,000 cash
increments by Brown, he said. The cover-up involved a $25,000
payment and the BMW car, Brown said.
   On Monday Peter MacDonald Jr. recounted the same story to the
committee, which is a special panel of the Senate Select Committee
on Indian Affairs. The cover-up called for the junior MacDonald to
be the recipient of the $25,000 and the car as a way of protecting
his father, he testified.
   The junior MacDonald also testified under immunity. His father
has not testified nor has he been told that he would get immunity if
he did testify, the committee staff said.
   The senior MacDonald's involvement in the ranch sale is being
investigated by a grand jury in Arizona. There also is a movement
underway by the Navajos to remove the senior MacDonald from his
$55,000-a-year job as chairman on the
   A Senate investigator, Eugene Twardowicz, gave the committee
documents Monday showing that the purchasers of the land had
incurred expenses in 1987 including the $25,000 loan to the
chairman, a $4,000 down payment for the leased car and two $900
monthly installments for the automobile.
   The younger MacDonald said he, his father and Brown met about
five times in 1988 to work out their story that MacDonald Jr. had
sought the loan and the car.
   MacDonald Jr., 33, said allowing it to appear that MacDonald Sr.
sought the money and the car ``looked bad,'' since Brown was
involved in the Boquillas deal. He said it was his father who asked
him to go ahead with the coverup.
   Asked by committee counsel Kenneth Ballen why he allowed himself
to become involved in the concocted story, MacDonald Jr. said,
``Because I love my father.''
   A Senate investigator who asked to not be identified said
planning to give a false story to authorities is illegal and could
qualify as obstruction of justice, obstruction of a congressional
investigator and conspiring to commit perjury.
   Brown and Tracy purchased the ranch for $26.2 million in July
1987 from the Tenneco West Co. Brown also received a $750,000
commission from Tenneco. The two men then sold the land to the
Navajo tribe for $33.4 million _ either the same day or a day or two
later, according to Twardowicz.
   Twardowicz said that based on his investigation of the finances
of Brown and Tracy, he believed the men could not have afforded to
buy the land from Tenneco unless they knew they would soon sell it
to the tribe.
   ``They had to know they coul flip _ when I say flip, I mean
re-sell it _ for a much higher amount, which they did,'' said
Twardowicz.
   Brown received 59 percent of the sale's profits and Tracy got 41
percent, according to a copy of the agreement between the two men
that Twardowicz gave the committee. The deal netted Brown $5 million
and Tracy $3 million, Twardowicz said.
   The investigator told the committee that Brown paid for a
November 1986 trip to Hawaii that MacDonald took with his family,
shortly after he was re-elected chairman of the Navajo.
   Twardowicz also said Brown signed a one-year, $5,500-per-month
consulting contract with MacDonald Jr. The chairman's son said that
agreement was merely a part of the coverup, designed to make Brown's
loan more plausible.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a committee member, said the land deal
was ``a questionable, if not fraudulent, transaction.''
   Another panel member, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said, ``In
essence, the Navajo people paid $8 million more than they had to,
assuming they wanted the property in the first place.''
   The committee launched its hearings last week, following reports
of alleged fraud in The Arizona Republic.
   The panel has come under criticism by Indians for aiming its
probe at accusations against Navajo leaders rather than problems
within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other government agencies.
   Richie Nez, MacDonald Sr.'s chief of staff who was attending the
hearing, told reporters afterward that ``this was a normal real
estate transaction,'' and that the Navajo thought the $33 million
acquisition was a good one.
   Asked if the alleged favors influenced the tribe's decision to
buy the land, he said, ``I can't comment on that.''

   Confirmation hearings for Cabinet nominee Louis
Sullivan, who put out a potential brush fire by deciding to forfeit
nearly $300,000 from his medical school presidency, will begin
Thursday, the White House said today.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the FBI had
completed its background check of the secretary-designate of health
and human services and found ``no adverse information as far as we
know.'' He said the White House expects Sullivan will be confirmed.
   The administration had asked Congress on Monday to set a new date
for Sullivan's hearing, a sign that it was satisfied with the
nominee's financial disclosure and FBI background investigation.
   A hearing scheduled last week by the Senate Finance Committee had
been postponed after the White House asked for a delay, citing
incomplete financial information from the nominee and an unfinished
FBI background check.
   But Sullivan's decision to take an unpaid leave of absence and
forgo $297,000 in severance pay from Morehouse School of Medicine in
Atlanta, the school he founded and heads as president, put his
hearing back on track and earned him praise on Capitol Hill.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said Sullivan's decision ``shows a major personal
commitment to public service.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he admired Sullivan for not
taking the money, but he said people should not be pressured to give
up money to which they are legally entitled.
   ``We have so much pressure in the government, only those born
with two gold spoons in their mouth will be able to serve around
here pretty soon,'' he said. ``It is impossible for me to understand
this pressure that comes on people who were not born wealthy and who
have earned a certain right.''
   The White House had told Sullivan that if he cut his ties with
Morehouse, he could accept $297,000 in severance pay under terms of
his contract with the school, and Sullivan was prepared to do that,
according to a senior administration official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   But the nominee became concerned when news reports cast the
arrangement ``in an unfavorable light'' and raised questions about
potential conflicts of interest since Morehouse receives federal
funds from HHS, the officials said.
   Sullivan felt he was ``taking a beating in the press,'' decided
``on balance it was just not worth it,'' and told Morehouse he would
forfeit the severance pay, the official said. Instead, he would
resign as president and take an unpaid leave of absence as a
professor of medicine.
   As president of Morehouse, Sullivan earned an annual salary of
$172,000. As head of the largest federal department, he will make
$99,500. A pay-raise measure that was headed for defeat in Congress
today was to raise that to $155,000.
   Sullivan, who wants to keep his house in Atlanta while he is in
Washington, plans to borrow money while his wife, a lawyer, plans to
go back to work so they can make ends meet, the official said.
   The official said Sullivan ``simply accepted this as unfortunate,
but this is a cost of becoming part of the government.''
   Though Sullivan's decision to forgo the money surprised many in
the nation's capital, ethics officials say it is not unusual for
people entering government to give up large sums of money due them
from former employers.
   ``There are government people who give up unbelievable sums to
take government positions ... because they are afraid it could
create a problem for them,'' said Don Campbell, deputy director of
the Office of Government Ethics.
   However, others at Sullivan's level do take large sums from
former employers, including ``deferred income'' that was earned
before they came to the government.
   For example, the new agriculture secretary, Clayton K. Yeutter,
last year while he was U.S. trade representative received $561,602
from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for an annual installment for
deferred earnings plus the after-tax proceeds of a lump sum
distribution. Yeutter had been president of the exchange before
joining the Reagan Cabinet.
   Sullivan, however, feared that the controversy over a paid leave,
in the wake of an outcry by conservative lawmakers over his
statements on abortion and the FBI's focus on his connection to a
Georgia politician convicted of extortion, could affect his
reputation and the credibility of the Bush administration, the
administration official said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana said
today he will urge the official Colorado Party to endorse coup
leader Andres Rodriguez for president in the national elections set
for May 1.
   Argana, who had been considered a front-runner for the office,
said at a news conference that he backed ``my friend'' Gen.
Rodriguez, who on Friday ousted dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   There was no immediate response from Rodriguez.
   Asked Monday if he might be a candidate, Rodriguez said: ``It is
every Paraguayan's duty to serve his country. Being president is a
great honor. If I am called to serve, I will.''
   Colorado Party officials plan to hold a convention to select
candidates for president, the 72-member House of Deputies and the
36-member Senate.
   Opposition leaders, many of whom were exiled during Stroessner's
presidency and whose parties were banned, have asked that the
election be delayed to give them time to prepare. Argana ruled that
out.
   ``The period of time is imposed by the national constitution and
is the maximum,'' he said. ``The opposition itself has no interest
in extending the deadline because by extending the deadline we also
extend the arrival of democracy.''
   On Monday, Rodriguez issued a decree dissolving Congress.
   He said the new government would serve until August 1993, the
term of office for elections that were held in February 1988. Only
the Communist Party would be banned from fielding candidates,
Rodriguez said.
   Rodriguez, at his news conference Monday, denied rumors that he
is involved in drug trafficking, saying they ``were spread by people
trying to defame me.''
   He said Paraguay, reputedly a major transit point for cocaine,
would crack down on narcotics trafficking and cooperate in
international anti-drug campaigns, including those of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   Rodriguez also denied reports that as many as 300 people died the
coup. He said the dead and wounded together did not exceed 50.
   He promised democratic reforms shortly after taking power Friday,
but the opposition expressed skepticism about his hasty calling of
elections.
   ``I personally can't even be a candidate for anything because I'm
not registered'' to vote, said Domingo Laino, a former political
exile and leader of what is thought to be Paraguay's biggest
opposition group, the Authentic Radical Liberal Party.
   ``Our people are not registered'' either, he said, because
Stroessner outlawed the party.
   Stroessner, now in exile in Brazil, ruled Paraguay for nearly 35
years after seizing power in a 1954 coup.
   Laino suggested the May 1 election date ``could be interpreted as
a trap'' set by the Colorado Party, which after 41 years in power is
rich and well-organized.
   He also said one solution to the voter registration problem would
be to instead use the national identity card that all citizens are
required to carry.
   In setting the election date, Rodriguez cited a constitutional
clause stating that in the event of a president's resignation,
incapacitating illness or death, the provisional president must call
for elections within three months.
   The government's position is that Stroessner resigned.
   The Colorado Party, with 1.4 million members, counts on an
extensive political machine that extends to the smallest towns in
the countryside.
   The electoral code mandates that the party that gets the most
votes is entitled to two-thirds majority in the House and Senate.

   Working to improve the water supply in a
remote Guatemalan village isn't everybody's dream honeymoon. But it
suited Bud Philbrook and Michele Gran, and a decade later the
rewards from their efforts are still spreading.
   The newlywed couple in 1979 spent half their two-week honeymoon
in San Miguel de Conacaste, a farming village of 1,300 people,
helping to prepare a brochure describing the village's development
efforts and a loan proposal for an irrigation system.
   From that small beginning grew Global Volunteers, a non-profit
organization with projects in Guatemala, Mexico, Jamaica and
Tanzania, and plans to begin working in a village in India this
summer.
   The organization will sponsor 18 trips to the five countries this
year, bringing 170 to 200 volunteers from around the United States
to work for up to three weeks on projects the villagers in each
country have selected.
   ``We do whatever it is the villagers ask us to do. They decide
what gets done,'' said Philbrook, a St. Paul attorney. ``We put
ourselves at their service, but we work hand in hand on the
project.''
   Though the work can be hot and the hours long, volunteers are
finding such projects a welcome alternative to traditional
vacations. Costs of the trips, ranging from $1,150 to $2,800 for the
various sites, are tax deductible if a volunteer doesn't take extra
time away from the group for pleasure.
   The volunteers come at the invitation of host organizations such
as churches or government agencies in each country, and Global
Volunteers tries to send groups to each of the villages four times a
year, Philbrook said.
   ``For many people, a Peace Corps commitment of two years is too
long,'' Philbrook said. Global Volunteers gives those people a
chance to contribute in a developing nation without giving up their
lives at home.
   The program is open to anyone, and volunteers need not speak the
native language. Volunteers have ranged in age from 15 to 73.
   ``There are no skill requirements. We've learned that everybody
here can make a contribution,'' Philbrook said.
   Volunteers have planted trees, dug trenches for water pipes and
worked with farmers identifying crop diseases and demonstrating more
effective ways of applying fertilizers. Health care professionals on
the trips have gone with local nurses to make house calls on
patients.
   ``We're very cognizant about the issue of dependency. We're not
creating dependency,'' Philbrook stressed. ``We never take control.
It's never our project. It's always their project.''
   Terri Hudoba, who traveled to Jamaica with Global Volunteers in
November 1984 and December 1986, said she made her first trip partly
out of ``the old '60s hippy guilt feeling of social
responsibilities.''
   Hudoba, who works in the Minnesota House of Representatives
information office and is now on the 40-member Global Volunteers
board, spent her time in the Jamaican village of Woburn Lawn helping
villagers with paperwork necessary to set up a coffee farm, hauling
concrete blocks to a school construction site and working on bylaws
for a new cooperative being set up in a nearby village.
   Those experiences have affected her reactions to poverty and
strife at home and when she takes pleasure vacations.
   ``The people have faces to me now when I go on other vacation
trips. That has a profound impact on me,'' said Hudoba, adding that
she is more sensitive to ``the way we deal with so-called
`minorities' at home.''
   Nancy Hall, who traveled to Guatemala with Global Volunteers in
April 1988 and will make her second trip in March, worked with picks
and shovels to level land for a central plaza in San Miguel de
Conacaste, where Global Volunteers also has helped villagers fix up
a building for their preschool program.
   ``The kids are so precious! I'm just dying to get down there and
see them again,'' Hall said. ``The hope is in the children.''

   Vandals believed to be Jewish extremists painted
swastikas and a Jewish star on the tombstone of David Ben-Gurion,
Israel's founding father and first prime minister, an official at
the memorial site said Tuesday.
   ``I was shocked,'' Motti Aberjil told Israel radio. ``Nothing
like this has ever happened.''
   The desecration apparently occurred Monday night and was
discovered by a gardener Tuesday, said Aberjil, deputy director of
the Ben-Gurion seminary the Sde Boker communal farm in the Negev
desert.
   Ben-Gurion, who died in 1973, is buried at Sde Boker, where he
had a home. The site also has a seminary that researches his works.
He was Israel's premier for 12 years after the nation was founded in
1948.
   Aberjil said the graffiti was signed ``Keshet,'' the name of a
Jewish extremist group that has attacked several secular Israeli
targets recently.
   Police arrested 10 suspected members of the group in Jerusalem on
Sunday in connection with bombings and arson attacks.
   Keshet members also are suspected of planting three firebombs on
the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway Dec. 31, apparently to disrupt
traffic on the sabbath, when religious Jews do not drive. The bombs
were found before they exploded.
   The group has been linked to desecrations of graves of other
Israeli leaders in Jerusalem. Ultra-Orthodox Jews believe a Jewish
state should exist only after the Messiah comes, and perform such
acts to show their contempt for the Zionist state.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, who worked with Ben-Gurion for more
than 35 years, said he felt ``shock and sorrow'' over the
desecration.
   ``I say with a heavy heart that they have gone far too far,'' he
said.

   Snow covered the central
mountains of Grand Canary, but it stayed comfortably warm in coastal
tourist regions of this Spanish island off northwest Africa.
   Chief meteorologist Guillermo Rivero said it snowed Monday at
altitudes as low as 4,000 feet, while in Las Palmas, the capital,
and other coastal regions, temperatures dipped no lower than 59
degrees.
   ``Aside from the wind, which made the day less pleasant than
usual, the weather was normal,'' he said. ``There was some sleet in
Las Palmas, but that's not unusual this time of year.''
   On Tuesday, Las Palmas skies were partly sunny and daytime
temperatures topped 68 degrees.
   TV reports that it was the worst snowfall in 30 years were
exaggerated, Rivero said, although the snowline was much lower than
usual in the mountains, where snow was up to 8 inches deep.

<TEXT>
   Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg was
treated at a hospital this morning, and an adviser was quoted as
saying the former Swedish tennis star took barbiturates because he
felt ill after a restaurant meal.
   Italian news agencies said Borg apparently had attempted suicide.
   The 32-year-old Borg, who has been staying at the home of his
Italian fiancee, rock singer Loredana Berte, was reported out of
danger after his stomach was pumped at the Milan Polyclinic. He was
released from the hospital after a few hours and returned home with
Ms. Berte.
   ``I'm fine, it's all over,'' Borg told reporters outside Ms.
Berte's apartment.
   ``Go away all of you,'' snapped Ms. Berte.
   A hospital spokeswoman confirmed Borg was admitted but refused to
give details.
   ``From initial police investigations, it appears to have been a
suicide attempt,'' said the ANSA news agency.
   However, a friend of Ms. Berte's, Mara Savastano, said the singer
told her Borg suffered from food poisoning.
   In Stockholm, the Swedish news agency TT quoted Borg's personal
adviser, Ingmar Alverdal, as saying Borg felt ill after eating at a
restaurant.
   ``Borg felt sick ... and took barbiturates to fall asleep,''
Alverdal was quoted as saying. ``But his nausea got worse and in the
morning, on doctor's advice, (he) went to the hospital....
   Alverdal was quoted as saying Borg was X-rayed at the hospital
and that he was released after his condition improved.
   According to ANSA, Ms. Berte telephoned for an ambulance at about
9 a.m. from her Milan apartment. She was later reported to have been
at Borg's hospital bedside.
   Borg and Ms. Berte had planned to marry in Milan on Feb. 26, but
Italian newspapers said the ceremony was postponed because Ms.
Berte's divorce has not come through.
   Borg dominated men's tennis in the 1970s and won the Wimbledon
singles title five times. He retired from tournament play in 1983 at
age 27.
   He now runs a fashion business and acts as a tourism ambassador
for Sweden.
   In January, an aide to Borg was quoted as saying the Roman
Catholic Church opposed Borg's marriage to Ms. Berte. Ingemar
Alverdal told the Swedish news agency TT he did not know why the
church intervened.
   Borg was previously married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony to
Romanian-born tennis player Mariana Simonescu.
   After his 1983 divorce, Borg began seeing 17-year-old Swedish
beauty queen Jannike Bjorling. They never married but have a son,
Robin, 3.
   Borg was reported to have amassed $75 million in winnings and
endorsements during his career. He lived for 11 years in Monte Carlo
to avoid Swedish taxes, among the world's highest, but returned to
Sweden in 1985.

   The high temperature in Canyon de Chelly in
Arizona's northeastern corner was 4 and the low was 11, the National
Weather Service reported Tuesday.
   And that's not too unusual, forecaster Mike Franjevic said. He
noted a recent day when the high temperature in Phoenix was in the
50s and the low was in the 60s.
   Highs and lows are keyed to clock time as well as the weather, he
explained.
   The high for a day is the highest temperature reached from
midnight to midnight. The high from midnight Sunday to midnight
Monday was 4 in Canyon de Chelly, he said, noting that the previous
low was minus 5. Then after midnight, Tuesday morning, the low up to
the end of the first reporting period, 8 a.m., was 11.
   It happened because clouds moved in and there were some snow
flurries, reducing heat loss through radiation and the clouds
perhaps even reflecting some back, allowing the temperature rise,
Franjevic said.

   One man has died in an outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease that has struck seven other people in central London, health
officials said Tuesday.
   Another 19 cases are suspected, but there was very little risk
anyone else would be infected, said environmental health officer Dr.
Deidre Cunningham.
   The outbreak was confined to an area southwest of Leicester
Square, where water samples were taken from 17 cooling systems, she
said. Most of the systems were shut down voluntarily, and those
operating have been cleaned and disinfected, she said.
   Waterborne bacteria that cause the pneumonia-like disease occur
in soil and water found in air conditioning ducts, storage tanks and
rivers.
   Ms. Cunningham and Dr. John Gabbay, medical officer in charge of
the investigation, said the victim died two weeks ago, but they did
not say why it was not announced until Tuesday.
   Gabbay said six patients are hospitalized, two in intensive care.
The seventh is recuperating at home.
   Between 100 and 200 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported
each year in England and Wales.

<TEXT>
   The comedy ``Three Fugitives'' has dethroned
1989 box-office champion ``Rain Man'' after the film about two
brothers learning about one another spent five weeks atop the movie
charts.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``Three Fugitives,'' an action-comedy with Nick Nolte and Martin
Short as two bank robbers on the lam, grossed $5.48 million during
the weekend. ``Rain Man,'' the road movie featuring Dustin Hoffman
and Tom Cruise, took in $5.45 million.
   In third place was the new quasi-comedy ``Her Alibi,'' starring
Tom Selleck and model Paulina Porizkova in a did-she-or-didn't-she
murder mystery.
   Though critically panned, the film collected $5 million in its
opening weekend. It was followed in fourth by the drama ``Beaches,''
with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey playing best friends, on
grosses of $4.2 million.
   ``Who's Harry Crumb?,'' a detective spoof starring John Candy as
an intrepid investigator, collected $3.9 million in its first week
of release to claim fifth place. ``Twins,'' a comedy about
non-identical twins played by Danny DeVito and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, finished in sixth place on ticket sales of $3.3
million.
   In seventh was the corporate success story ``Working Girl,''
starring Melanie Griffith, which collected $2.54 million. It was
pursued by the civil rights drama ``Mississippi Burning,'' in eighth
on grosses of $2.48 million.
   The Top 10 was rounded out by the crime comedy ``The Naked Gun:
From the Files of Police Squad!'' in ninth with receipts of $1.9
million and the moody romantic drama ``The Accidental Tourist'' in
tenth with sales of $1.5 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release. The figures for ``The Naked Gun'' are estimated.
   1. ``Three Fugitives,'' Disney, $5.48 million, 1,191 screens,
$4,591 per screen, $13.6 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Rain Man,'' United Artists, $5.45 million, 1,573 screens,
$3,465 per screen, $96.3 million, eight weeks.
   3. ``Her Alibi,'' Warner Bros., $5 million, 1,429 screens, $3,524
per screen, $5 million, one week.
   4. ``Beaches,'' Disney, $4.2 million, 1,109 screens, $3,744 per
screen, $25.9 milion, seven weeks.
   5. ``Who's Harry Crumb?,'' Tri-Star, $3.9 million, 1,197 screens,
$3,227 per screen, $3.9 million, one week.
   6. ``Twins,'' Universal, $3.3 million, 1,610 screens, $2,080 per
screen, $90.8 million, nine weeks.
   7. ``Working Girl,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.54 million, 1,133

   Discovery's astronauts boarded their
space shuttle in a countdown rehearsal Tuesday as technicians made
progress in removing suspect turbopumps from the craft's engines.
   Commander Michael Coats and his four crew members entered the
cabin for the final two hours of the two-day simulation and ran
through launch-day procedures.
   ``Everything appears to have been successful,'' said NASA
spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   The rehearsal duplicated much of the actual countdown except that
the fuel tank was not loaded and some procedures were shortened.
Discovery was powered up and its electronic and communications
systems were checked.
   Meanwhile, technicians at the base of the launch pad continued
removing the oxygen turbopumps from Discovery's three main engines.
The first was pulled Monday, and the second came out Tuesday.
   NASA said the removal of the third should be completed by
Wednesday, two days ahead of schedule.
   The pumps will be replaced by new units as a precaution because
of two tiny cracks discovered in the shuttle Atlantis after its
flight in December. Discovery's pumps went through the same
manufacturing process as the cracked one.
   The repairs delayed the launch from Feb. 23 until March 10 at the
earliest. Discovery has a March 18 launch deadline because the
Atlantis' shuttle mission must take place between April 28 and May
27 in order for its crew to dispatch the Magellan spacecraft to
orbit Venus, which will not come into proper position again until
1991.
   Arnold Aldrich, NASA national space transportation system
director, said in Washington on Monday he is certain of launching
Discovery without affecting the Atlantis launch.
   Discovery's crew is to deploy a communications satellite and
conduct medical and science experiments during five days in orbit.

   Seven Somali soccer players, fearing they
will be forced into their nation's army, are seeking political
asylum in Kenya, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees said Tuesday.
   The seven _ members of a Somali team competing in the East and
Central African Club Championship _ went to the commission's Nairobi
office for help Monday, said spokeswoman Tessa Williams.
   She said the Kenyan government has yet to decide whether it will
grant them asylum.
   The Somali team, MBC Football Club, was eliminated from the
eight-nation tournament and was to return home Tuesday.
   The defectors said they decided to defect because they fear being
conscripted into the Somali army.
   President Mohammed Siad Barre's government has been fighting the
northern-based rebel Somalia National Movement for seven years.
Nearly half a million people have fled into neighboring Ethiopia and
elsewhere since the civil war began.

   A suspected Japanese terrorist zigzagged
across 10 states buying bomb parts and visiting a New York office
building he planned to blow up in retaliation for the 1986 U.S.
attack on Libya, authorities said today.
   Yu Kikumura, whose sentencing began this morning under extreme
security, was seen by witnesses inside the Veterans Administration
building that houses a Navy recruiting center in New York City,
state Trooper Joseph Fuentes testified.
   The site was marked by felt-tip pen on a map found inside the
man's car when the suspected member of the terrorist Japanese Red
Army was arrested carrying three powerful bombs on the New Jersey
Turnpike April 12, authorities said.
   Kikumara's attorney, civil rights lawyer, William Kuntsler,
objected to the testimony from Fuentes, a member of the joint state
and federal Terrorism Task Force, saying he should have the right to
question any eyewitnesses.
   But U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. said such testimony
was admissable.
   Kikumura, 36, faces up to 100 years in prison for transporting
and possessing explosives. He was convicted Nov. 29.
   Investigators said they used hotel and store receipts to track
Kikumura's travels through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia
before his arrest.
   FBI agent Thomas Thurman said the bombs would have resulted in
``mass casualties and destruction to the point of the doors being
blown out ... chairs and tables in the room would be picked up and
shattered.''
   He testified under questioning from U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito,
who was making a rare appearance as the lead prosecutor in the case.
   Security was tight as Kikumura was brought from jail in New York
City to the courthouse. Prosecutors said the Japanese Red Army might
seek to kill him.
   Authorities closed a lane of the Holland Tunnel between New York
and New Jersey for 15 minutes in the morning, said Armando Arrastia,
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and Jersey.
   ``We do it for sensitive VIP movements,'' he said. ``We do it for
people who might be a target of some other group, or people who need
to move through quickly.''
   Extra metal detectors were set up near the courtroom, and police
carried rifles and shotguns as he was led into the courthouse.
   Alito alleges Kikumura's bombing was to have been carried out in
conjunction with the April 14, 1988, attack on a USO club in Naples,
Italy, that killed five people, including a U.S. servicewoman.
Kikumura was arrested two days before the Naples blast, which was on
the second anniversary of the U.S. air strike against Libya.
   Found in his car were 3-foot steel canisters packed with
gunpowder and lead shot, electrical fusing devices, clocks and
precision tools, authorities said.
   ``His objective was to strike, not any person or private group,
but at the United States as a nation,'' Alito said in a
pre-sentencing report.
   Kunstler and co-counsel Ronald Kuby said the report makes only
``tenuous'' ties between their client and other terrorist incidents,
and they asked for a sentence of less than three years in prison.

   The ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said today an FBI report on new allegations
against Defense Secretary-designate John Tower ``does not provide a
basis for any disqualification.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., told reporters that he was briefed by
the White House on the report, which sources ed on
new charges of drinking and womanizing, and he later briehave said centerfed
the GOP
members of the committee.
   ``The preliminary report of the investigation which Senator (Sam)
Nunn and I requested on Thursday has been made available,'' Warner
said. ``It provides, at the judgment of White House counsel, no
basis on which senators could find the factual situation that would
amount to any disqualification.''
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that
``our understanding is the FBI is close to concluding their reports
and they have found no difficulties or problems that haven't been
resolved.''
   Warner said he has asked that Nunn, chairman of the panel, also
be briefed and that the full committee assemble to see the FBI
report. The Virginia Republican said hekground checks delay his addition
to the Cabinet.
   Bush said at a White House news conference Monday that the
63-year-old Tower should not have to withdraw his name based on
unsubstantiated rumors about his personal life.
   ``I think people would not want a person to step aside, given
rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless,'' the president said.
``And the problem is the process is taking a little longer than I
would like, and yet, I think the Senate has got to do what they're
doing _ looking at these allegations very carefully.''
   Bush added, however, that if any rumors or innuendoes turned out
to be ``a substantive allegation of this nature, of course it would
concern me.''
   Warner had said Friday that the panel expected to receive the
final FBI report Monday and vote on the Tower nomination either
today or Wednesday.
   But Nunn said Monday that the panel had not received a report on
the new allegations, which congressional sources have said deal with
womanizing and drinking. Nunn also said that the panel has not
decided when it will vote on the nomination.
   Meanwhile, committee member Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., when asked
whether the new allegations centered on a relationship involving
Tower and a Russian ballerina who may have been a KGB plant, said
the report had been checked out previously and there was ``no
credibility'' to it.
   Nunn disputed a statement Bush made that the FBI has looked into
the new allegations and ``the committee now has'' the report.
``We've done some talking back and forth but we've received no
report whatsoever,'' he said.
   ``We have not had anything delivered to us, and we are awaiting
on it, so the status quo is right where it was,'' Nunn said as he
and Warner emerged from a meeting that lasted nearly two hours.
   Nunn, asked about reports that the committee had received new
allegations about Tower, said, ``I don't want to get into that.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., not a member of the
committee, said at a news conference that Tower's confirmation
chances had probably not been hurt by delay in a vote. ``We should
get the nomination out,'' Dole said.
   Bush said he fully endorses Tower, a former Texas senator who
served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services panel, but he added:
``If somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded
enough that I wouldn't take a look. But I am not going to deal in
the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down
and then reported and then knocked down.''
   Tower, meanwhile, participated in White House sessions on the
defense budget, both on Saturday and again on Monday, said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   A judge today gave a man the right to
authorize an abortion on his comatose wife in hopes of helping her
recover.
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard McCaffrey put an immediate
stay on his ruling until an appeal can be heard this afternoon from
two anti-abortion activists asking to be named legal guardians of
the woman and the fetus.
   The judge granted Martin Klein's request to be named legal
guardian for his wife, Nancy, enabling him to authorize an abortion
on the 32-year-old woman.
   Mrs. Klein is 17 weeks' pregnant and has been in a coma at North
Shore University Hospital in Manhassett since an auto accident Dec.
13. The hospital refused to allow an abortion unless Klein was named
his wife's legal guardian.
   During a two-day hearing last week, five medical experts for
Klein testified that pregnancy decreases the chances of recovery and
could threaten Mrs. Klein's life. That testimony was contradicted by
two other medical experts.
   ``Based upon the competent medical testimony and records, the
court finds that Nancy Klein is incapable of communicating and is
declared to be incompetent, and a guardian should be appointed on
her behalf,'' the judge announced today to a packed courtroom.
   ``If he so determines it be in the best interests of Nancy Klein,
(Martin Klein) may sign on her behalf any and all informed consent
and authorization forms for an abortion procedure,'' McCaffrey
continued.
   However, the judge said that testimony at the hearing convinced
him an abortion ``is not medically necessary to preserve the life of
Nancy Klein.''
   Two anti-abortion activists were to appear before an appellate
judge this afternoon to request a 24- to 48-hour stay until a full
appeals court can rule on the matter.
   Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, said his client was delighted
with the decision but wished it had been stronger.
   Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville, was accompanied by his in-laws,
Frederick and Anne Zusselman of Del Ray Beach, Fla., who supported
his motion for guardianship. He kissed and embraced his in-laws when
the ruling was handed down.

<HEAD>Smokers Switch To Chewing Tobacco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RACELAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The air may be cleaner since smoking during
City Council meetings was banned in November, but now the need for
spittoons is growing.
   ``They stopped smoking and people started chewing tobacco,'' said
Mayor Charles Clarke, who smokes two packs a day. ``That's worse
than smoking. You spill that and you've got a mess.''
   Raceland may be the first town to ban smoking in a public
building in Kentucky, which is the nation's leading producer of
burley tobacco, said Ed Griffin, director of the Kentucky Municipal
League in Lexington.
   There are no plans to regulate tobacco chewing, the mayor said
Tuesday. Two council members are among the chewers, who use any
handy container such as paper cups or soda cans rather than
old-fashioned spittoons in the council meeting room.
   Ron Morris, a regional vice president of the Tobacco Institute
based in Louisville, said he doesn't know of any other towns in
Kentucky that have such policies.
   ``Because of the agricultural importance in Kentucky, it would be
hard to get a policy in place and keep it,'' Morris said.
   Councilman Carl Traylor said he made the motion to institute the
ban for his own health as well as the health of other people. Taylor
said he underwent throat cancer surgery Dec. 30. The former smoker
said his doctor told him cigarettes were the cause of his cancer.
   ``I was taking radium treatments, and I would go to the council
meetings and I would get sick at my stomach,'' he said. ``My doctor
asked if there was a lot of smoking. He said that could be the cause
of it.''
   City Clerk Connie Phelps said the smoke was so bad ``You could
cut it with a knife. We had windows open and air conditioners on.
Nothing helped.''
   Councilman Jack Barker was the only council member to vote
against Traylor's motion, which passed Nov. 8 without discussion.

   Lawyers for Oliver North said today the
Iran-Contra trial of the fired National Security Council aide should
be stopped because jury selection procedures have violated the law.
   In a court filing, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan said the trial
should be stayed because ``the court refused to excuse numerous
prospective jurors'' who indicated under questioning that they had
been exposed to North's 1987 immunized congressional testimony.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell did not act on the motion
immediately.
   Those jurors who were questioned in open court first had stated
in written questionnaires that they hadn't watched, listened to or
read accounts of North's six days of testimony on Capitol Hill. Many
were accepted for the jury pool over the objection of North's
lawyers.
   North's lawyers said the court violated requirements of the Jury
Selection and Service Act of 1968.
   Sullivan said ``the violation of'' the 1968 law ``can be remedied
by excusing all prospective jurors'' who initially wrote on the
questionnaire that they hadn't been exposed to the North testimony,
but indicated during open court questioning that they had been.
   Prior to the filing by North's lawyers, the judge added five
people to the pool of prospective jurors, including a man who said
he tried to put a pillow over his head to avoid hearing anything
about the case.
   The man, a supervisor for a security alarm company, said he
recalls nothing about North's immunized congressional testimony in
1987.
   He said this morning when he woke up and knew he would be coming
in for possible jury selection in the North case he ``heard
something ... I tried to put the pillow over my head'' to keep from
listening to a news broadcast about the case. North lawyer Barry
Simon made no objection to the man's selection.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has instructed all
potential jurors to avoid listening, reading or watching anything
about the case.
   The addition of two men and a woman built the size of the jury
pool to 41, with 40 the minimum number necessary to pick a jury of
12 with six alternates.
   Gesell said he wants at least 44 to choose from, in case of
illness or other last-minute problems.
   A District of Columbia health inspector also was sent into the
jury pool after saying that he recalled seeing only ``little blips''
of news broadcasts on North's congressional testimony. Simon
objected to his selection.
   A retired key punch operator with eight children was qualified by
Gesell as a prospective juror after she said all she knew about
North was that ``I think he flew a plane, something about Contra
aid'' and that North was ``supposed to have delivered some goods''
overseas ``in exchange for our hostages.'' She said ``I don't know
that the mission was accomplished.'' She also said she saw ``little
bits and pieces'' on the evening news, which prompted an objection
from Simon to her selection.
   Once the pool of prospective jurors is selected, the defense may
challenge 10 of them, the prosecution six and each side may
challenge three of the candidates for the alternate juror posts.
   The selection process is in its sixth day in the search for
prospective jurors who missed or didn't pay attention to North's
nationally televised congressional testimony.
   ``I expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow,''
Gesell said after selecting five women and one man Monday.
   North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to Congress to
cover up the Iran-Contra affair.
   After Monday's jury selection proceedings, Gesell held a
closed-door hearing at the request of John Keker, head of the team
of three prosecutors, ``concerning his classified document
problems,'' according to a notice issued by the judge.
   The National Security Agency has objected to disclosure of
classified information in North's trial and took its concerns to the
Justice Department, government sources have said. But Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh declined to step in on the NSA's behalf to
halt use of the information, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Last Thursday, Gesell granted intelligence agencies four seats in
the courtroom, but he warned that he wasn't going to let ``security
gurus'' run the North trial.
   Gesell also denied a request from North's lawyers that the jury
be isolated for the duration of the trial, which could last up to
five months, according to estimates made in the middle of last
month. The judge gave no reason for denying the motion.
   North faces 12 criminal charges carrying a maximum of 60 years in
prison and $3 million in fines if he is convicted on all counts. He
is accused of allegedly concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986
his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up
from the attorney general the National Security Council's role in
diverting money from the Reagan administration's Iran arms sales to
the Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<HEAD>Death Toll from Armenian-Azerbaijani Conflict Put at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic violence in Armenia and Azerbaijan killed 91
people and injured 1,650 last year, a Soviet official said Tuesday
in releasing the highest estimates yet of the human toll of the
unrest.
   The rioting so terrified the Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in
each other's republics that nearly 300,000 people fled their homes,
according to figures reported by the official news agency Tass,
quoting Maj. Gen. Nikolai Vasko of the Soviet Ministry of Internal
Affairs.
   Less than a sixth of those refugees have returned home, according
to Vasko. That leaves local governments with a massive resettlement
problem, especially in Armenia. There, more than 100,000 refugees of
the ethnic violence have joined 700,000 left homeless by the
devastating Dec. 7 earthquake.
   Vasko said only 4,000 of the 141,000 Azerbaijanis who fled have
returned to their homes in Armenia. Nearly 44,000 of the 159,000
Armenians who left Azerbaijan have returned there. He did not
explain the disparity, but the consequences of the earthquake would
encourage refugees to leave Armenia.
   Previous reports had placed the death toll from the violence at
more than 70, with 200,000 refugees.
   Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis have a long history
of disputes, but they erupted last year with a riot in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. Violence grew with Armenian demands for
a mostly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan called Nagorno-Karabakh to
be turned over to Armenian control.
   Vasko said four soldiers of the internal troops were among those
killed in the conflict. The casualties include 117 troops and 32
militiamen injured while defending citizens and their property, he
said.
   Authorities are investigating 779 criminal cases stemming from
the violence, and they have charged 517 people, he said.
   Confirming previous reports that police in Azerbaijan failed to
halt the rioting, a second official quoted by Tass said more than
100 chiefs of internal affairs organs had been fired or reprimanded.
   In Armenia, 24 policemen have been fired, according to Armenian
Minister of Internal Affairs Usik Arutyunyan.

   A homeless man accused of raping and strangling a
pregnant doctor at Bellevue Hospital told detectives he had a second
victim picked out, according to court papers.
   Steven Smith, 22, also told a detective that a ``voice'' ordered
him to kill Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, on Jan. 7, and that she
wouldn't have died if he had received psychiatric help, according to
the detective's report.
   Smith told Detective David Argenzio that ``he had to do it and
that if we hadn't caught him, there would have been another
victim,'' said the report filed in court Monday during Smith's
arraignment.
   ``He said there was a girl known to him as Viola ... (on the 16th
floor of Bellevue) that was his age (who) could well have been his
next victim,'' the report said.
   Smith said he liked the woman, but she made him angry, according
to the report.
   Bellevue officials were unable to determine who that woman might
have been, hospital spokesman Jim Walsh said today.
   ``We asked around up there. Nobody knows of any Viola,'' he said.
   Smith pleaded innocent in state Supreme Court to charges of
murder, rape, sodomy and robbery.
   Argenzio spoke to Smith in the waiting room of the psychiatric
ward of Kings County Hospital on Jan. 9. Smith said that if someone
had given him psychiatric help, ``the lady would still be alive,''
the detective reported.
   Smith reportedly told police he came upon Ms. Hinnant while she
was working late alone in a lab. He said he punched her, robbed her
and strangled her with the help of a man named ``John,'' who then
raped her.
   Smith told Argenzio that the victim asked him why he was
attacking her.
   ``He stated to me, `It was just something I had to do,''' the
detective reported.
   Police said fingerprints and other evidence from Hinnant's office
indicate Smith acted alone.
   Defense lawyer Marvyn Kornberg consented to Smith's giving hair
and blood samples for DNA ``genetic fingerprinting'' tests to
determine conclusively whether he raped the woman.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a protein molecule found inside
each cell. Identifying a person's blood, semen or saliva through DNA
is virtually 100 percent accurate because each person's DNA pattern
is unique.

<HEAD>IRS Assistors Gave Wrong Tax Guidance 36 Percent of the Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IRS personnel gave the correct answer on only
64 percent of telephoned tax queries, and government auditors said
Tuesday a major reason was a failure to press questioners for
details.
   A survey by the General Accounting Office, involving 1,733 test
calls during the last return-filing season, also found the IRS was
even less likely to give the right answer on questions affected by
recent changes in tax law.
   ``IRS assistors' failure to probe for all of the pertinent facts
before answering GAO's questions was a primary reason for the 36
percent inaccuracy rate,'' the congressional watchdog agency said in
a report to Congress. ``Of 20 test questions, 17 required assistors
to probe to correctly understand and answer the question.''
   When answers to only those 17 questions are considered, the IRS
was wrong 39 percent of the time. Questions requiring no further
details produced correct responses 78 percent of the time, the GAO
reported.
   The GAO emphasized that the inaccurary rate applies only to the
specific questions that were asked _ and not necessarily to all the
questions taxpayers are likely to ask. However, the IRS's own check
of actual taxpayer calls last spring indicated its telephone
personnel provided the correct answer just 72.4 percent of the time.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs, in responding to the latest
GAO report, said the IRS was well into a program to improve the
skills of the telephone ``assistors'' before the current filing
season.
   ``We ... have expanded assistor training on probing skills,''
Gibbs said. ``In addition, we continue to emphasize to all managers
the need for quality review and providing immediate feedback to
assistors who fail to probe completely.''
   The IRS answered 20 million calls on its 4,359 toll-free
assistance lines last year. That represented about 85 percent of the
direct contact the IRS had with taxpayers.
   Most telephoned questions are answered by ``front-line
assistors,'' who often are part-time employees earning $6.50 to
$11.70 an hour. If they cannot answer a question, they are supposed
to turn the caller over to a backup assistor, who has received more
training, has more reference material close at hand and who is paid
up to $14.32 an hour.
   However, the GAO survey indicated that the backup assistors gave
the wrong answer to 40 percent of the questions, compared with 35
percent for the front-line employees. The GAO said that could be
attributed to the fact the backup assistors had to answer the more
difficult questions.
   Other GAO findings:
   _On questions affected by recent tax law changes _ especially the
landmark 1986 overhaul _ the IRS gave the right answer to the GAO 59
percent of the time. On questions not affected by the changes, the
IRS was correct on 72 percent.
   _48 percent of the GAO calls were placed on hold, compared with
52 percent in the earlier survey. The average wait was 39 seconds,
down from 55 seconds earlier.
   _Friday was the best day to get through to an assistor, Monday
the worst. The best time: from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., when the GAO got
through 83 percent of the time on the first try. It made little
difference whether the call was placed in February, March or April.
   The lowest number of correct responses came on a GAO question
about unreimbursed business expenses; only 16 percent of the answers
were right. A question about an Individual Retirement Account was
answered correctly 19 percent of the time, although the GAO scored
an additional 32 percent as correct but incomplete.
   A question about charitable contributions was answered correctly
99 percent of the time, the GAO found; on alimony, 98 percent; on
the earned-income credit, 88 percent, and on unemployment
compensation, 79 percent of the time.

   President Bush has nominated Maj. Gen. John J.
Yeosock of the Army for a promotion and new assignment as the deputy
commanding general of the Forces Command, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   In that post, Yeosock also would serve as the commanding general
of the Third U.S. Army at Fort McPherson, Ga. The Forces Command is
responsible during peacetime for the training and equipping of Army
forces posted inside the United States.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Yeosock would receive his third
star and the rank of lieutenant general in moving to the new post.
   The 51-year-old Yeosock is a native of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and
will replace Lt. Gen. Andrew P. Chambers. The Pentagon announced
Tuesday that Chambers plans to retire on April 1 after more than 34
years of active service.
   Chambers, 57, is a native of Bedford, Va.

<HEAD>Public Health Doctor Says He Has The Deadly Disease He Treats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Lee County's AIDS program has
revealed that he was diagnosed as having AIDS more than three years
ago, but says he'll continue to help his patients as long as he can.
   Dr. Adrian Pollock, 58, who is recovering from a type of
pneumonia associated with the deadly disease, said his decision to
publicly discuss his health came partly from a desire to make clear
that he didn't get AIDS from his patients.
   ``I was reaching a point where I knew I'd have to go public with
it,'' said Pollock. ``The higher power has a way of doing things his
way. This is when I'll find out who my friends are.''
   Pollock, who was married and has a daughter, said he got the
disease through homosexual activity, the most common means of
transmission, but doesn't know from whom.
   ``I had had a few (gay encounters),'' Pollock said. ``I guess
that's the irony of it _ there were so few _ but I have no idea when
or with whom and it doesn't really matter.''
   Pollock, director of epidemiology and communicable diseases for
the county health unit, was diagnosed as having AIDS 3{ years ago.
He said one of the things that has kept him going since then ``is
the feeling that I am doing something good for other people.''
   ``The only thing I know to do is to go ahead and do the best I
can to help the other people who are facing the same things I've
faced,'' he said Monday.
   Dr. William Hill, acting director of the county health unit, said
Pollock's diagnosis won't keep him from continuing to work.
   Pollock became ill in December with his first bout of
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the most common killer of people
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which weakens a person's
immune system and leaves them susceptible to numerous infections.
   ``I went from July into early December with a chronic cough and
post-nasal drip. I thought it was just sinusitis; it's funny how you
can see things in other people you can't see in yourself,'' Pollock
said. ``I had done just what I tell the patients never to do _ I
tapered off on my pentamidine treatments.''
   Pentamidine is a drug that helps prevent pneumonia.
   Pollock has recovered enough that by last week he was back to
six-hour work days.
   Pollock, who worked as a pediatrician in private practice for 20
years before joining the health department, said he didn't know he
had the disease when he first became the county's AIDS surveillance
officer in 1985. He found out shortly afterward when he and a
co-worker decided to test themselves.
   Pollock hopes going public will help promote understanding about
AIDS.
   ``I think the important thing to get across is that I didn't go
out hunting for this disease,'' he said. ``People who have this
disease deserve the same compassion as anyone else suffering from a
terminal illness.''
   In 1987, the Fort Myers News-Press chose Pollock and Dr. Bob
Schwartz, a infectious disease specialist and president of the
Southwest Florida AIDS Task Force, as the region's ``Men of the
Year'' for their work with AIDS patients.
   ``When I tell people there's hope, I think of Adrian,'' said
Schwartz. ``I would hope there would be a flood of respect for him
after this is made public, but God knows what will happen.''

   Edward J. Rollins, who managed President
Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, is taking charge of GOP efforts
to end Democratic dominance of the House, GOP sources said Tuesday.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the House
Republican Campaign committee, plans to announce Wednesday that
Rollins has agreed to serve four years as deputy chairman and
executive director of the committee.
   The panel has agreed to pay Rollins more than $1 million over the
four-year period, the sources say.
   Despite George Bush's 40-state victory in the 1988 presidential
election, the Republicans lost three House seats. The current House
lineup is 259 Democrats and 174 Republicans with two vacancies.
   Rollins' commitment would take him through the 1992 elections,
the first test after House district lines are redrawn to comply with
the 1990 census. Census projections indicate that the next
realignment will provide another shift of House seats to the Sunbelt
with California, Florida and Texas the big winners.
   Reagan carried 49 of 50 states in his 1984 re-election campaign.

   MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (AP) _ Soviet soldiers likely to be
among the last to leave Afghanistan say their thoughts are turning
to loved ones, and to comrades who will never share the joy of
homecoming.
   Capt. Sergei Ofitserov of Moscow is dreaming of the son he never
has seen, born during his service in Afghanistan.
   Alexander Morozov, a talkative 23-year-old officer with bright
blue eyes, remembers a friend killed by rebel shelling in August.
   Vis Ali Chagaev, 20, is thinking of his parents' reaction when
they see the changes wrought in him by a year and a half in the
unfinished war.
   All of the troops interviewed Saturday in this outpost guarding
the withdrawal worry over the fate of Afghanistan after the last
Soviet soldier leaves, and whether the nine-year struggle has been
worth the lives of 15,000 comrades. They would not say when they are
leaving, but their positions guarding the rear make it likely they
will be among the last to leave.
   Just 35 miles south of the Soviet border, a few hundred soldiers
aimed heavy machine guns and armor across the flat landscape to
protect the Soviet supply route and final withdrawal.
   The area is quiet and under government control. But it isn't safe.
   ``At any time, any place, there could be an attack,'' said
Ofitserov, a 27-year-old Muscovite from a military family whose name
means ``officer.''
   Backers of the pro-Soviet Afghan government cannot agree on
whether it will be able to hold back U.S.- and Pakistani-backed
Moslem guerrillas, he said.
   ``The Afghans will have to work it out for themselves now,'' he
said. ``We will only get in the way.''
   All Soviet soldiers are to be withdrawn by Feb. 15 under an
agreement signed in Geneva by Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, the
United States and Pakistan in April 1988.
   At an outpost down the road from Ofitserov's unit, Capt. Arkady
Anonich, 30, said the Afghan army was weak in technical expertise
and suffered from low morale.
   Even in northern Afghanistan, near the Soviet border and one of
the areas under firmest government control, the local people
probably don't support the pro-Soviet government in Kabul, Anonich
said.
   The Soviet soldiers stayed away from Marzar-i-Sharif, a city of
170,000 people whose cold and muddy streets surround a magnificent
12th century mosque with blue mosaic walls.
   A few of the stores in Mazar-i-Sharif have Russian names like
``Spring,'' ``Dream,'' or ``The Birch Tree'' printed under their
Arabic names.
   But many of the rest retain English and Arabic signs, and the
area's strong traditions are evident.
   Few women are seen on the streets and fewer still without the
traditional Moslem veil.
   At a field near the airport on Fridays, dozens of horsemen play
the traditional game of buskashi, vying to snatch up a headless goat
and score by dropping it in a circle drawn on the ground.
   Anonich said the Soviet soldiers are not guarding Mazar-i-Sharif,
but its nearby roads and the territory surrounding the airport and
its 30 Afghan air force MiG fighters and Sukhoi ground support jets.
   Despite many complaints by Afghan veterans that their service is
ignored and that they don't fit in after they have returned home,
the soldiers on duty made clear that getting home was the main thing
on their minds.
   Asked what he wants to do, Chagaev said his only goal was to get
home.
   He has been able to send tapes to his parents, who will meet him
in the Soviet border town of Termez a week or so after he returns,
he said.
   Chagaev said he cannot judge how he has changed but that after
military service, a man's priorities are different. A youth has time
to be obsessed with music, but after army service, ``you start to
think about getting married, about a home,'' he said.
   In the Soviet Union, where military service is mandatory, ``it is
thought that if a man hasn't served in the army, he's not a man,''
Ofitserov said.
   A career soldier, Ofitserov would be marking his second
anniversary in Afghanistan two days after the last Soviet soldier is
to leave.
   He said he will be told his new assignment upon returning to the
Soviet Union but hopes first to see his 1{-year-old son, Valerian,
who was born after he left.
   Morozov, a native of Zagorsk, a town northeast of Moscow famous
for its monastery, is the commander of an armored attack vehicle dug
into the brown dirt in front of a mud fort built by Anonich's
soldiers in September.
   Four days after he arrived at Kabul airport to begin his
Afghanistan tour, he and a 42-year-old officer were trapped by
rebels shelling the airport. One shell landed about 20 yards from
Morozov and killed his fellow officer.
   ``We ate together, we lived together,'' he said of his friend,
whom he refused to identify out of respect for his memory. ``It was
completely by chance that I wasn't hit.''

   First lady Barbara Bush read to about 75
elementary school pupils Tuesday, promoting literacy in her first
official visit outsdide Washington.
   Mrs. Bush, a longtime advocate of literacy programs, read from
``Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day'' by
Judith Viorst.
   The children joined in with the first lady during the refrain of
the story about a boy who faces a series of calamities: ``I could
tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad
day.''
   During a short news conference, Mrs. Bush said Pennsylvania's
illiteracy rate of 29 percent was not unusual.
   ``That's not good enough,'' she said.
   Her reading audience included pupils in grades two through four
from Henry Lawton Elementary School at the Free Library of
Philadelphia as an area Read Together Coalition kicked off its third
annual ``Love Is Reading Together Week.''
   Sheila Whitelaw, executive director of Friends of the Free
Library, first invited Mrs. Bush in early December. She called
repeatedly during December, let up around Christmas and then tried
some more before the inauguration.
   ``The next thing I knew, they called me,'' Ms. Whitelaw said
Monday.
   She said the visit by Mrs. Bush, an advocate of literacy
programs, ``will add a lot of visibility to our program, to literacy
per se and to the focus of what we're trying to do.''

   An aerobics instructor led from the opening
flip to the final toss today in the American leg of the Shrove
Tuesday pancake race, but she failed to break England's winning
streak, which grew to seven years.
   Donetta Schindler, 23, ran the 415-yard American course in 65.91
seconds, four seconds more than the 62 seconds it took Lesley Byrne,
26, to win the British leg of the race in Olney, England, six hours
earlier in the day.
   Mrs. Byrne's victory gave the English a 20-19 edge in the annual
competition, in which runners wearing the traditional garb of
skirts, aprons and head scarves carry a frying pan with a pancake
that they must flip twice, once at the beginning of the race and
once at the end.
   ``I felt like I was in good position,'' said Mrs. Schindler, who
ran in a field of 15. ``I was ready for it, but I had not trained
that much.''
   About 1,000 spectators turned out for the race, held under sunny
skies and temperatures in the upper teens.

   Soviet police are being killed by criminals who
want their handguns, which are hard to find in the Soviet Union,
Tass said Tuesday.
   Such guns are routinely issued only to police and security
officers in the Soviet Union. Soldiers typically are issued weapons
only for use in the field, and hunters must pass rigorous inspection
before obtaining a rifle.
   The news agency Tass said murders of police officers for their
guns had doubled in 1988, although it did not give any numbers. As
an example, it said two young policemen in the city of Gorky were
shot in the back by criminals wielding sawed-off shotguns who wanted
their Makarov pistols.
   The attack was part of rising wave of violence in the Soviet
Union, which until recently claimed to be immune to such events.
Crime in general rose 4 percent in 1988 and serious crime climbed 6
percent, Tass said.
   A meeting of top law-enforcement officials in Moscow blamed
organized crime, complacent police, drug addiction, and alcoholism
for the problems.

   Larry Hagman, who has played the conniving
J.R. Ewing on CBS-TV's ``Dallas,'' for 11 years, says real-life
businessmen trust J.R.'s judgment and see the Texas oil man as a
role model.
   Writing in the Feb. 11 issue of TV Guide magazine, based in
Radnor, Hagman says ``J.R. Ewing is the man who America secretly
emulates.''
   Hagman writes that people would ``be amazed how many fans I meet
who view him as a real human being and me, I guess, as a kind of
oracle who can give them the J.R. they want. On flights, troubled
businessmen have come to me and asked for advice on how to address
problems they're having with oil ventures.''
   ``Because, for a lot of these people, J.R. isn't evil at all;
he's just another executive taking care of business in a tough world
where all too often the talk from moralists is cheap and
hypocritical.''
   Hagman says the admiration of Ewing doesn't surprise him: ``Think
about it: Who are the good guys nowadays? The people who aspire to
public service? There is corruption in government everywhere. Our
financial leaders? Heck, there are a lot of mini-Ivan Boesky's out
there who, if not breaking the law, are sure bending it until it

<TEXT>
   Contra leaders Tuesday asked a federal judge to
throw out a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family
of an American engineer slain by the rebels in Nicaragua.
   At a hearing on a defense motion to dismiss the case, attorneys
for the Contras told U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus he had no
jurisdiction in the case.
   ``It is not the court's role to determine what is legitimate or
illegitimate warfare,'' said defense attorney John E. Kirkpatrick.
   Benjamin Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., was shot to death in
Nicaragua in April 1987 when U.S.-backed rebels attacked the rural
hydroelectric project he had volunteered to work on.
   A year later his family sued top Miami-based Contra leaders,
including three members of the current directorate, saying they
authorized a patrol to attack the project, as well as torture and
kill Linder.
   Kirkpatrick said Linder knowingly went into a war zone, and
contended the Linders' lawsuit was motivated by their opposition to
U.S. policy in Nicaragua.
   Outside the courtroom, David Linder, who contends his wounded son
was tortured with a needle to the face before finally being shot to
death, said politics did not enter the case.
   ``We don't consider the torture of our son, or the torture of
anyone, a political issue,'' Linder said.
   The Linders' attorneys disputed a defense contention that the
plaintiffs failed to show the engineer was specifically targeted by
the attack on the project.
   ``The targets were chosen in Miami. It was here the decision was
made to attack and kill Linder,'' said Michael Ratner of the New
York-based Center for Constitutional Rights.
   The judge said he would issue an opinion as soon as possible on
the dismissal motion, but did not give a date.
   The Linders' lawsuit, filed in April 1988, contends their son was
shot at close range by a Contra patrol raiding the hydroelectric
project.
   The action named several Contra leaders, including Nicaraguan
Resistance directors Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez and
military leader Enrique Bermudez.
   The Contras have publicly contended Linder was carrying a weapon
at the time of his death and was shot accidentally in a firefight
between Sandinista militia and the rebels.
   However, The New York Times has reported that the Contras killed
Linder because they mistakenly thought he was a Cuban adviser to
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.

   James A. Baker III's first foreign trip as
secretary of state will take him to the capitals of 14 of the 15
U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a whirlwind
outing designed to broaden his overseas experience and give the Bush
administration a peppy image.
   He does not intend to overlook the 15th country, Iceland, either.
Baker will stop at the Keflavik air base there for a brief session
with Foreign Minister Steingrmur Hermannsson in an airport lounge.
   Baker will cover a wide range of subjects, including East-West
relations and the outlook for arms control, in his meetings from
Canada to Turkey, but in visits so brief any substantive discussion
obviously will be limited.
   The eight-day trip will mostly get Baker's feet wet _ his
background in foreign policy is scant _ and set the stage for the
summit meeting President Bush and Baker will hold with leaders of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the spring.
   Announcing the schedule, Charles E. Redman, the State Department
spokesman, said Baker ``feels it's important to establish contact
with his NATO colleagues, to see them in this case on their home
territories.''
   Usually, talks between the secretary of state and his NATO
counterparts are arranged for NATO headquarters in Brussels with the
allies assembling there to see him.
   Baker sets out Friday with Bush for Canada and meets that evening
in Ottawa with Foreign Minister Joe Clark, even as Bush heads to a
weekend vacation in Maine after his own session with Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney. On Saturday, Baker and a retinue of assistants,
security guards and reporters will fly to Iceland for a few hours of
talks at Keflavik and, later, in London.
   On Sunday, Baker plans to meet with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and with Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary,
and then fly to Bonn for a late afternoon session with West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Allegations that West German firms helped Libya try to produce
chemical weapons is a likely topic. Another is the outlook for talks
due to open in March between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on reducing
non-nuclear armed forces in Europe.
   Baker goes to Copenhagen on Monday to see Danish officials, flies
back to Bonn to spend the night in the West German capital, and
visits three countries on Tuesday _ Turkey, Greece and Italy.
   On Wednesday, the secretary of state goes to Spain and Portugal,
and then to Brussels for talks Thursday with Belgian officials and
with Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general. The same day Bush
makes a quick trip to Luxembourg and The Netherlands and returns to
Brussels for meetings on Friday with leaders of the European
Community.
   Baker's last stop is Paris later Friday for talks with French
President Francois Mitterrand and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. The
secretry plans to return to Washington Friday evening.
   Five days later, Baker will travel with Bush to Japan for the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito and to China and South Korea for talks
with representatives of those governments.

   The Vatican has written a document on racism
that seeks to ``change people's attitudes and hearts'' on the
various forms of prejudice and discrimination in the world, an
official said Tuesday.
   The document strongly denounces all forms of racism, including
apartheid in South Africa, anti-Semitism, religious discrimination
and discrimination toward native peoples, said the Vatican official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Vatican's Justice and Peace Commission prepared the document
and it will be released Friday.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported the document also raises
the issue of terrorism against Jews, adding that anti-Zionism has
been used as a cover for anti-Semitism.
   The Vatican official said the document is not intended as a
series of condemnations but as a church contribution to debate on a
social issue.
   ``It's to see how the church can work to change people's
attitudes and hearts in the face of a problem that is very extensive
in today's world,'' he said. ``It's not just to condemn one
particular grouping, but to take up the debate calmly.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Says it Won't Press for Free Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told
supporters Tuesday he won't press for completely free elections
during talks with authorities because he first wants them to restore
his union's legal status.
   A spokesman for Solidarity said the union wants open
parliamentary elections eventually, but is willing to delay
fulfillment of that goal until it obtains its prime objective of
legalizing Solidarity. The Communist Party currently controls
nominations and ensures itself a majority of seats.
   In another development, government spokesman Jerzy Urban sought
to play down overly optimistic expectations for the talks that began
Monday, known as the ``round table.''
   ``One should not exaggerate the hopes evoked by the round
table,'' he said. ``It is an event of significance ... but one
should not imagine that the round table shall solve the problems
standing before Poland, that it is some magic wand.''
   At the formal talks with 57 participants, including a 25-member
opposition group led by Walesa, authorities offered Solidarity
legalization if the union endorses a package of economic and
political reforms.
   The authorities also said Solidarity must agree to take part in
``non-confrontational'' elections this spring that would give the
opposition some seats in parliament but still guarantee communist
control.
   Three working groups dealing with specific elements of the
proposed compromise _ the economy, political system and trade unions
_ begin meeting Wednesday. The negotiations are expected to last
four to six weeks.
   The proposal on entering the political system is most sensitive
for Solidarity, which does not want to be in a position of endorsing
an electoral system in which the results are determined beforehand
by the Communist Party.
   However, both Walesa and Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz indicated the union is ready to defer demands for free
elections in order to win legalization now.
   ``I publicly answer with full responsibility ... that in these
conditions (I) will not seek a confrontation on the subject of
elections,'' Walesa told a group of 500 workers and supporters at
the Technical Building Institute in Warsaw.
   ``The pluralism which we will obtain now may create such a
possibility one day,'' he said, but now ``we are not ready for
that.''
   Walesa's was welcomed warmly by the institute's director and
cheered by more than 500 supporters and workers. He spent a hour
answering questions and defending his decision to engage in talks
with authorities.
   ``The road to the table was difficult. Many people think it
doesn't make sense. Many say bluntly: `Lech, you believed in 1980.
You were naive. And now you are still naive.' My answer is: `I
didn't believe in 1980 and I don't believe now,'' he said.
   ``But there is one Poland ... I am doing everything to take
advantage of all chances to build agreement, to build a better
Poland,'' he said.
   If the talks yield ``pluralism of associations'' _ the right for
various groups to form associations and clubs _ it will give the
opposition a chance to ``prepare people, the wise and reasonable
ones, prepare them for better elections'' in the future, Walesa said.
   Onyszkiewicz, who held his own news conference at Warsaw
University for about 200 Polish and foreign journalists, said
Solidarity would not be nominating a list of candidates to future
elections. But he said some Solidarity members could run as
individuals, not as representatives of the union.
   Asked about the suggestion made Monday by Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw kiszczak that the elections be ``non-confrontational,''
Onyszkiewicz said the union understood Kiszczak to mean
non-divisive, ``not an opportunity for sharpening of conflicts, for
an open war.''
   Onyszkiewicz said Solidarity's ``priorities are obvious. We have
been for free elections for a long time, since 1981. But we allow a
certain temporary time, not too long, when those free elections can
be partial to some extent.''
   Government sources have said the authorities are willing to offer
the opposition 20 percent to 40 percent of the seats in parliament
after elections to be held in April or May.
   Polish elections are structured so that people of different
parties never oppose each other. The party controls who is
nominated, ensuring that the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party
always wins a majority of seats.

   Mardi Gras bawdiness blossomed on Bourbon
Street as men in miniskirts pranced past gay bars Tuesday in
defiance of near-freezing temperatures that kept most of the
estimated 1.7 million revelers bundled up.
   The French Quarter filled quickly despite the cold, and some
hardy parade lovers staked out spots by pitching tents along
historic St. Charles Avenue well before dawn.
   For the most part, costumes gave way to parkas and winter gear,
covering up much of the usual nudity. However, observers said the
weather had little effect on the size of the crowd.
   ``The less you wear, the more you get your picture taken,''
bragged a man in black lace corset, garters and goose bumps who
would not give his name. ``I live to just go up and down the street
and get my picture taken. It's one time of year and I'll freeze for
it.''
   Police have reported scattered acts of violence, including the
murder of a Louisiana State University employee during an armed
robbery early Monday.
   Randy Michael Robichaux, 37, of Baton Rouge, was fatally shot
after turning out his pockets to show a holdup man he didn't have
any money, a companion told police. No arrests have been made.
   Police are lenient with revelers, but they shut down the party at
midnight, ushering in six weeks of Lent in this predominantly
Catholic city.
   Wind-chill factors were in the low 20s, but some folks didn't
mind.
   ``We were colder about five years ago. We were in kilts,''
laughed Pete Fountain as he marched with his ``Half Fast Walking
Club.'' He was dressed as a clarinet-playing Samurai warrior.
   ``We left 5 below zero, so this is warm,'' said Marsha Ferguson,
one of a group of visitors from Nebraska who sipped exotic drinks in
a crowded patio bar warmed by electric heaters.
   At Lafitte's in Exile, a bar a few blocks away, female
impersonators donned dresses, wigs, heavily padded bras and gaudy
feminine makeup as they posed for gaping tourists. They batted huge
false eyelashes, smiled coyly and shouted racy propositions to male
passers-by.
   ``I guess to out-of-towners it would be kind of strange,'' said
Jan Rutherford of Bay St. Louis, Miss. ``Well,'' she said with
second thought, ``maybe real strange.''
   Costumes were not as plentiful as in warmer years, but some
showed plenty of imagination.
   Steven Sinnott of suburban New Orleans covered himself with
sections of air-conditioning duct _ cylinders of soft plastic and
flexible wire that expanded and contracted at his every step.
   A group of people in roach costumes swarmed around a hot dog
vendor, and a young woman dressed as Little Bo Peep used her
shepherd's crook to steady herself while roller skating down Royal
Street.
   Outside the quarter, the celebration was more family oriented.
Children and adults watched the traditional parades featuring
maskers on elaborate floats tossing nearly worthless, but highly
treasured plastic beads, aluminum doubloons, plastic cups and other
trinkets.
   New Orleans business and civic leader Beau Bassich was named Rex,
King of Carnival, and presided over the city's premier parade that
preceded downtown ceremonies and a champagne toast from Mayor Sidney
Barthelemy.
   Also parading was Zulu, the all-black Carnival organization that
began decades ago as a spoof of white high society's stodgy Carnival
customs. Zulu members wore their traditional black face paint and
grass skirts as they handed decorated coconuts to the screaming
crowd in the street.

   Robbers have raided 52 freight trains hauling
earthquake relief supplies to Armenia, Tass said Tuesday.
   Residents of Stepanavan hoping to rebuild on their own are unable
to obtain building materials or discover who is allocating land. And
no one in Armenia is prepared for the imminent shortage of
electricity expected when a nuclear power plant is shut down for
fear of further quakes, the official news agency said.
   The reports were just the latest problems hobbling relief efforts
since the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated northwestern Armenia and
killed more than 25,000 people.
   Thieves struck at least 52 freight trains bringing in goods to
Armenia, according to Usik Arutyunyan, Armenian minister of Internal
Affairs. Measures have been taken to increase security on the trains.
   Citizens throughout Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia will suffer a
shortage of electricity when the first unit of the Yerevan nuclear
power plant is shut down in two weeks, Tass said, quoting the
Politburo commission on earthquake relief. The commission considered
expanding the use of natural gas and complained that work is
proceeding too slowly on expanding the capacity of a thermal power
plant in Razdan.
   The commission also criticized the Armenian state construction
committee for inadequate management of the reconstruction of
quake-ravaged towns, and for the Stepanavan residents' problems in
undertaking their own rebuilding projects.
   The Stepanavan City Council also was cited for poor organization
of relief, lack of initiative and openness.

   A judge on Tuesday dropped six of 35
charges against the man on trial in the Blackstone Valley sniper
case, rejecting prosecution arguments that all the charges were
brought in good faith.
   Closing arguments were scheduled Wednesday in the trial of Peter
T. Trepanier, who is charged in a series of sniping attacks in
December 1986 and January 1987, and a series of burglaries and house
fires from April to June 1987. No one was killed. Defense attorneys
said they would call no witnesses.
   The charges dismissed by Superior Court Judge Dominic F. Cresto
involved the Dec. 11, 1987, shooting of Michael L. Clerc, a
Woonsocket truck driver whose truck was attacked in North
Smithfield, and a June 1, 1987, break-in at the Glocester home of
Muriel Winsor.
   ``It isn't like we didn't have the evidence to bring the
charges,'' prosecutor Eva Marie Mancuso said. ``We've sill got six
assaults with intent to commit murder and three first-degree arsons
that carry a life sentence.''
   Cresto said the Clerc shooting was not similar to the other six
sniping attacks with which Trepanier is charged and said no evidence
of a bullet or shell casings was discovered.
   The judge said there was no evidence that Trepanier was involved
in the Winsor break-in, but said a jury should decide whether
Trepanier is guilty of setting a fire at the Winsor house and two in
Burrillville because of similarities among the blazes.
   The trial started Jan. 27. It had been expected to last six
weeks, but Mancuso, who presented more than 40 witnesses, said it
moved more quickly than expected because of a lack of
cross-examination by defense attorneys.
   Trepanier, 25, originally was charged with seven counts of
assault with intent to commit murder and seven counts of conspiracy
to commit murder in connection with the sniping attacks n Cumberland
and North Smithfield and burglaries and house fires in Burrillville
and Glocester.
   Cresto said there was not enough evidence for counts of
conspiracy to commit murder, assault with intent to commit murder,
conspiracy to enter a house, entering a house with intent to commit
larceny, malicious mischief and firing a weapon in a compact area.
   Russell Ducharme, 24, a high school classmate, faces virtually
the same charges and will be tried later.

<TEXT>
   Some not-so-wild turkeys have been making
nuisances of themselves in suburban communities near Plymouth Rock,
perching on cars and taking over birdfeeders, state wildlife
officials said Tuesday.
   Some of the big birds have been spotted wandering down streets
and even have chased people in parts of Plymouth and Bristol
counties, according to James Cardoza, head of the state's wild
turkey restoration project.
   Richard Turner, who works for the state Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife at its Bourne office, said he received a complaint from the
owner of a Mercedes Benz, who was not happy to find a turkey
trotting over the hood and roof of his expensive car. Last year, he
came across a turkey hen nesting in a mobile home park, undisturbed
by the urban setting.
   Turner said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the birds are
apparently pen-raised wild turkeys that have been freed and don't
have the wily instincts of their truly wild counterparts. He said he
did not know how many might be loose in the two counties.
   Although it is illegal to keep wild turkeys in Massachusetts,
Turner said, chicks are sometimes sold at county fairs and
``unsuspecting people have bought them thinking it would be nice to
have some wild turkeys in their yard.''
   The problem, according to the biologists, is that the pen-reared
turkeys could interbreed with and dilute the stocks of wild turkeys
the state is trying to re-introduce to the area south of Boston.
They also could introduce disease.
   James Baird, natural history director for the Massachusetts
Audubon Society, said he was not familiar with the turkey problem.
But he noted that it is ``not uncommon'' to see ring-necked
pheasants lose of the reticence of wild birds when they have been
pen-raised and then released into the wild.
   ``Often they wind up standing by the side of the road wondering
what to do next,'' Baird said. ``Birds do become habituated to a
human presence as long as it is non-threatening. And they are liable
to turn up anywhere they can find food.''
   The state's wild turkey restoration effort began in 1972 with the
release of a few pairs of wild birds captured in New York state.
Since then the number of wild turkeys in the Berkshires, the state's
western mountains, has grown to about 5,000.
   Since 1979, the state has helping them spread east through the
state by trapping and relocating birds from the Berkshires.
   For the past nine years, the birds have been numerous enough in
some areas to allow hunting. Last year, hunters bagged a record 471
birds, most in western Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Detainees Stage Hunger Strike; White Mothers Protest Conscription</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 black detainees,
some held without charge for nearly 1,000 days, are staging a hunger
strike to demand their freedom, parents of the prisoners said
Tuesday.
   In another protest, more than 150 white women demanded the
government halt conscription.
   The hunger strike began Jan. 23 with 20 detainees at Diepkloof
Prison in Soweto, the huge black township outside Johannesburg. By
Monday, all 191 detainees there had stopped eating, parents of some
detainees told reporters.
   ``We have tried all avenues: we have gone to the courts, we have
petitioned government ministers ... but to no avail,'' explained
Wallace Montsitsi, 64, who said his son has been in detention since
December 1987.
   Several dozen parents of the hunger strikers called a
Johannesburg news conference to publicize the plight of their
children.
   About 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying
lengths of time under a 32-month state of emergency. About 1,000
people remain in detention.
   The parents distributed a statement they said was written by the
hunger strikers. It said 20 new detainees were brought into the
prison last week, including a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old.
   ``To us this hunger strike is a life and death issue and we are
prepared to take it to its logical conclusion,'' the statement said.
   Their lawyers said the strikers have been drinking only water
supplemented by sugar and salt.
   ``Why are they held?'' The Star of Johannesburg, the country's
largest daily, asked Tuesday. ``The detainees' protest should cause
all South Africans to think anew about the deprivation of basic
human rights which continues on so gross a scale.''
   The Prison Service confirmed the hunger strike, but the Law and
Order Ministry declined to comment.
   In Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, meanwhile, white women
held news conferences to demand that white men be given the choice
to perform community service rather than military duty.
   White men must serve two years of initial training, then can be
called up for up to three months a year. In recent years, some
conscripts have been sent to quell unrest in black townships.
   ``Township duty is not defending my country from some foreign
force,'' complained Scotty Morton of Cape Town, who said her son was
hospitalized for depression during his military service.
   ``Our sons are being used against my fellow countrymen ... who
are angrily protesting against unjust and discriminatory laws,'' she
said.
   Judy Bester, whose son is serving a six-year prison term for
refusing to serve, noted in Johannesburg that President P.W. Botha
never served in the military. Botha was single and in his early 20s
during World War II when thousands of South Africans fought for the
Allies.
   Military service by non-whites is voluntary.
   Also, students at a Soweto high school said at least 12 pupils
were injured Monday when police using whips and batons broke up a
prayer service for a slain activist. Police said the service was
considered illegal.
   It was in memory of Sicelo Dhlomo, who was killed last year
shortly after appearing on a CBS News documentary, ``Children of
Apartheid.''
   No one has been charged with Dhlomo's death, although activists
suspect he was killed because he said he was tortured while in
detention.

   The Tokyo Taxation Bureau said Tuesday it discovered
1,574 doctors in Tokyo and neighboring areas failed to declare
income totaling $80 million when they paid their 1987 taxes.
   Reassessed taxes on the undeclared income, plus penalty taxes,
totaled $36 million, up 18 percent from the 1986 figure, said a
bureau official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the amount of unreported income was up 21 percent from
1986.
   The bureau had rechecked 1,724 doctors suspected of tax evasion
in Tokyo and nearby prefectures where 28,442 doctors own hospitals
or clinics, he added.
   Reporting failures resulted from both intention and neglect, and
some doctors had fabricated expenses claimed as deductions, the
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has been left largely rudderless
by the travails of Defense Secretary-designate John Tower at a time
when the new Bush administration is studying big cuts in military
spending, insiders say.
   Despite uncertainties caused by the delay in approving Tower,
however, the White House says that the former senator has been
actively involved in advising the president on budgetary and other
military concerns.
   On Tuesday, senators and the White House said that the latest FBI
report on Tower showed that there was nothing to new allegations of
drinking and womanizing to disqualify him from the job. The Senate
Armed Services Committee, which last Thursday postponed a vote on
its recommendation of Tower's nomination, is now expected to vote
this week and send the matter to the chamber's floor.
   But, as the process has drawn on, Pentagon officials who are
holdovers from the Reagan administration complain that morale within
the nation's military headquarters is falling and has created
uncertainty within the department.
   The officials, interviewed over the last week, insisted on
anonymity because many want to remain in their current jobs or move
to another government post.
   Although some officials say they are concerned the delay has left
the Pentagon rudderless, others insist that Tower has maintained his
influence with the one man who really counts _ George Bush _ and
that the budget Bush will submit to Congress on Thursday will
reflect Tower's input.
   The White House says Tower has been a regular participant in the
budget meetings for several weeks and Bush is relying on his
longtime friend for military advice.
   Bush has shown no inclination to back away from Tower but instead
has defended him at every turn. At his news conference Monday, Bush
said Tower should not have to withdraw his name based on
unsubstantiated rumors about his personal life. The president said
he fully endorsed his nominee.
   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
has come under fire not only for allegations about his personal
life, but also because of lucrative consulting work he has done for
defense contractors since he left the Senate.
   Since Bush's inauguration Jan. 20, the Pentagon has been directed
on an acting basis by William H. Taft IV, who was the deputy defense
secretary under Reagan. Tower has his own team, which he plans to
move in after his confirmation.
   In the interim, Pentagon officials say there is uncertainty
within the department over the budget, the possibility that the
Pentagon might lose influence within the administration because of
Tower's problems, and worries over the Pentagon's image, already
tarnished by a huge defense contracting fraud scandal.
   By all accounts, Tower has been actively engaged in internal
budget debates with Bush aides for several days and, according to
one official, has successfully blocked a proposal to hold defense
spending to zero growth for the next four years.
   The budget for next year, however, will be cut back to zero
growth _ requiring $6.4 billion in cuts in budget authority _ even
though no one at the White House knows the effect of that move on
specific weapon programs, the sources say.
   ``Every new administration has a problem with the first budget
and the lack of time, but ... without a defense secretary or a
defense team, the White House budget people talk in abstract numbers
and have no idea what happens to specific programs when they cut
money like this,'' said one official.

to Moslem guerrillas ``who never let up in their fight for their own
country.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said the pullout also was ``a great tribute to
Pakistan who has received so many refugees.''
   ``We're very pleased that the withdrawal is virtually complete,''
Mrs. Thatcher said, answering a questioner in the House of Commons.
   The Soviets pulled out ahead of a Feb. 15 deadline under a
U.N.-mandated agreement to end their nine-year intervention to
defend a pro-Marxist government.

   France will boost subsidies to encourage production
and distribution of feature films, in order to reverse a drop at the
box office, the culture minister said Tuesday.
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said he hoped to help French producers
make each year about a dozen ``big-spectacle films that could help
movie attendence take off again.''
   The new government program will provide $32.5 million for the
French film industry in the next two years, Lang said.
   The French go to the movies less than they used to, preferring to
stay home and watch films on the six national TV channels.
   In the 1950s, French cinemas recorded 450 million ticket sales a
year. The figure has dropped ever since, hitting 130 million last
year _ a fall of 40 percent just in the past four years. France's
population is 55 million.
   Hundreds of movie houses have been forced to close, but France
still has more than Britain and West Germany combined.

<TEXT>
   A Pan American jet with 269 people aboard made
a quick return landing Tuesday after part of its engine cover fell
off, officials said.
   Flight 82, a Boeing 747 en route to John F. Kennedy Airport from
Los Angeles International Airport, landed safely at 10:48 a.m., 26
minutes after takeoff, said Fred O'Donnell, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``The preliminary report is that the craft lost part of the
engine cowling,'' he said. The cowling is a detachable metal cover
for the engine.
   Passengers and crew members remained aboard the plane as FAA
inspectors tried to determine whether a quick repair could be made
and the plane could take off again, Pan Am spokesman Alan Loflin
said.
   The debris had fallen at the end of the runway, O'Donnell said.
   Because of easterly winds, the plane departed toward the east,
over Inglewood and other populated areas, instead of toward the
west, which is normal, O'Donnell said.

<HEAD>Global Study on Climate Change, `Greenhouse Effect,' Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. panel on Tuesday launched an 18-month study
on the risk of climate changes, including global warming and rising
sea levels, that have been linked to atmospheric pollution.
   The chairman, Swedish meteorology professor Bert Bolin, called on
governments for early action to prevent a crisis.
   The study will gather data on climate change and its possible
effects and will suggest remedies, Bolin said after a two-day
meeting of the group.
   Cutting down on the use of fossil fuels is likely to be a main
recommendation in the study, to be presented to the U.N. General
Assembly in 1990, he said.
   Carbon dioxide builds up by burning of fossil fuels like oil,
coal and gas, but also through widespread cutting down of trees.
Chlorofluorocarbons, known mainly as spray propellants, also remain
a factor despite global measures to cut their use, Bolin said.
   The gases are believed to create atmospheric changes that slow
the escape of heat from Earth in a phenomenon known as the
``Greenhouse Effect.''
   Scientists fear global warming could ultimately lead to more
frequent extreme weather like frosts and heat waves, and changes in
the sea level and weather patterns.
   The group, featuring experts from 30 nations, was set up in
November by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N.
Environment Program.

<HEAD>Grandmother Arrested After Chaining Herself to Oak Tree</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ruth Ganter got up early, positioned
her portable potty and a portable telephone nearby, sat down in a
lawn chair and chained herself to the huge oak tree in front of her
house.
   As bulldozer and backhoes roared in the background, Mrs. Ganter,
60, was arrested Monday for her solitary protest to save aged trees
from a $1.8 million road-widening project.
   She could get a year in jail and pay a $1,000 fine, but Mrs.
Ganter says she made her point that neither government nor private
industry has adequate concern for the environment.
   ``I'm out to save the trees,'' she said before deputy sheriffs
came for her. ``They have sentimental value, environmental value.
What are we going to leave for our grandchildren?''
   County deputies arrived about 5{ hours after she began her
protest, cut the chain and booked Mrs. Ganter on a charge of
trespassing on a strip of land that had been hers until the county
took it for the project. She was released on her own recognizance.
   Brevard County commissioners approved the project last year over
the objections of homeowners in this eastern Florida community
between Cocoa and Cocoa Beach.
   Officials said there was no way to realign the road to save the
trees.
   Commission Chairman Roger Dobson said, ``There are just certain
things that have to go when you widen a road.''
   In December, homeowners were told that portions of their property
and the trees on them had been condemned. Mrs. Ganter received
$16,000 for an 18-foot wide, 229-foot long strip of property in
front of her house. That left her with about a 10-foot wide front
yard.
   When the workers manning the heavy equipment got to the trees in
front of her house, they carefully removed signs drawn by Mrs.
Ganter's grandchildren. One sign tacked onto the tree where she had
chained herself read, ``Save the trees please.''
   Another on a nearby oak read, ``Go Away Bulldozer.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Criticism of Negroponte as Ambassador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government rejected harsh criticism of
John Negroponte and said Tuesday his apparent selection as the new
U.S. ambassador may indicate Washington is ready for better
relations with Mexico.
   ``Contrary to what many think, the designation of Negroponte is
not necessarily bad,'' the government newspaper El Nacional said
Tuesday in a front-page editorial.
   Late Monday night, the Foreign Ministry said it had sent a letter
to Washington accepting the appointment of Negroponte, whose choice
has not been announced officially by the White House.
   ``By sending this letter, the government of Mexico expresses to
the United States of America its wish that the selection of this
career diplomat contribute to the strengthening of bilateral ties
with equality and strict respect for the sovereignty of both
countries,'' a ministry statement said.
   Negroponte, a deputy national security adviser who was ambassador
to Honduras in 1982-85, would be the first career diplomat to serve
as U.S. ambassador to Mexico in a decade. He would replace Charles
J. Pilliod, the third political appointee in a row to hold the job.
   Mexico has opposed U.S. interference in Central America and the
controversy centers on Negroponte's role in U.S. aid for Nicaraguan
rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government.
   While Negroponte was ambassador in Honduras, it became a base for
the rebels, called Contras, and the U.S. military presence grew
dramatically.
   Mexican critics of Negroponte, many of them on the political
left, have described him as an international meddler.
   He has been the target of scathing news stories, bitter
editorials, cartoons and sarcastic puns on his name, which can be
translated as ``black bridge.''
   Some compare him to Machiavelli and one cartoon depicted him in
formal diplomatic attire fashioned from military camouflage material.
   After reports of the appointment last week, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's government said nothing while the media
controversy raged.
   In breaking the official silence, the ministry said Negroponte's
appointment was in line with what President Bush and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III have said about improving bilateral
relations.
   El Nacional said it its editorial: ``Negroponte was a faithful
executor of the instructions of a government blinded by apocalyptic,
ideological visions; he may now be one of an administration that
cleans up the broken dishes left by its predecessors.''
   A clearer U.S. vision of a stronger, stable and more prosperous
southern neighbor could mean closer cooperation on pressing problems
like Mexico's huge foreign debt, the paper said.
   Many of Negroponte's critics are troubled by his close contacts
with Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, a former chief of the Honduran
armed forces.
   Alvarez Martinez is known as the godfather of the Contra movement
and was widely accused of serious human rights violations in the
military effort to quell the Honduran left.
   He commanded the armed forces from 1982 until other senior
officers removed him in 1984. Alvarez Martinez was shot to death
last month in Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras, and a leftist group
claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Bush Budget Said to Freeze Military Spending at Level of Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to send Congress a $1.16
trillion budget for fiscal 1990 on Thursday that would freeze
military spending at the level of inflation to help pay for new
domestic initiatives, administration aides said Tuesday.
   Bush himself said his budget would make a ``strong beginning''
toward the major campaign promises he made during a 1988 campaign in
which he repeatedly evoked a ``kinder and gentler nation.''
   In a major change of emphasis, Bush will reject former President
Reagan's call for a 2 percent rise in defense spending above
inflation and propose increases in dozens of categories that Reagan
sought to slash, said officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Bush's budget outline, a 125-page rewrite of the lame-duck budget
Reagan submitted last month, was pronounced ``pretty well
finalized'' by Bush on Tuesday.
   He spoke briefly with reporters during a final budget session
with Budget Director Richard G. Darman, Vice President Dan Quayle,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House economist Michael
Boskin.
   Then, Bush went to Capitol Hill, where he told both Republican
and Democratic groups he would reach out to Congress to try to forge
a consensus budget.
   ``I am under no illusions that we are going to keep everybody
happy,'' Bush told a luncheon of Senate Republicans.
   Of his new budget plan, Bush said, ``It will meet my fundamental
commitments made to the American people in terms of not going out
there and raising taxes. It will make, I think, a strong beginning
in some of the areas that a lot of us talked about in the past
campaign: the environment, education, certainly anti-narcotics...''
   ``It's not going to be without controversy,'' he added.
   Bush also visited with the Senate Democrats, delivering
essentially the same message, and then met in closed sessions with
House Republican leaders and House Speaker Jim Wright.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel told reporters afterward that
Bush also mentioned child care in his list of initiatives that would
be reflected in Thursday's budget plan.
   Bush decided on the defense freeze in budget sessions over the
weekend, including one attending by Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower, sources said.
   Defense spending would be held to the rate of inflation for
fiscal 1990, then allowed to rise slightly over inflation in later
years, the sources said.
   Reagan, in a budget largely ignored by Congress, had proposed
increasing defense spending authority to $315.2 billion for the
fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 from $298.8 billion in the
current year.
   In holding defense spending to the level of inflation, Bush would
free up a potential of about $6 billion in spending authority.
   However, in terms of cash ``outlays'' that could actually be
spent in fiscal 1990, the amount gained by Bush from the maneuver
would be closer to $2 billion.
   Bush will squeeze another several billion dollars from other
areas of the budget by making use of what one budget official
described Tuesday as ``wiggle room'' in the Reagan plan.
   The Reagan plan, which will still serve as the core of the Bush
plan, proposed steps that would get the federal deficit down to
$92.5 billion in fiscal 1990.
   But the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law, which calls for
eliminating the deficits by the year 1993 in annual steps, only
requires that the deficit be $100 billion or less in fiscal 1990.
   Bush has promised to reach the $100 billion target without
proposing new taxes, although he was expected to retain a variety of
user fees and other forms of ``new revenue'' included in the Reagan
budget.
   Bush's combined campaign pledges would cost close to $6 billion,
including proposals for a $1,000 child care tax credit for low
income families, for a $500 million National School Merit program,
for beefed-up federal programs for the homeless and for an
aggressive program to combat acid rain.
   Holding defense spending at the level of inflation _ which was
4.4 percent last year, although a slightly lower figure is used for
defense calculations _ is consistent with Bush's call for a
``flexible freeze.''
   The budget will reflect virtually all of Bush's major campaign
promises in one form or another, although in some cases _ such as
the Merit School program _ the items will be scaled back, officials
said.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, said, ``there may be a
few loose ends but not very many. ... Essentially, it's done.''

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texans aren't just watching the television
miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' _ they're participants, as actors,
history buffs and members of the real Lonesome Dove church.
   The first part of Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer-winning novel was set
in Texas and much of the movie was filmed here.
   The Austin American-Statesman has printed daily front-page boxes
advising readers on how to spot local scenes and actors appearing in
each night's episode of the four-part miniseries that started Sunday.
   Tuesday's article noted that, as the story's cattle drive moves
north out of Texas, ``the less we'll see of Austin.'' However, some
of Wednesday night's scenes were filmed east of Austin on ``some
property near Lake Walter Long that executive producer-screenwriter
Bill Wittliff used to own,'' the newspaper said.
   Central Texas papers have been interviewing Lonesome Dove stars
and writing about the series for weeks.
   Gov. Bill Clements, a history buff who owns hundreds of volumes
about the state, said McMurtry's novel was the best Texas-related
fiction he'd ever read.
   ``As an amateur student of Texas history ... certainly in my
opinion that's the best novel that's ever been written about early
Texas _ without any question. And the two episodes that I have now
watched I like very, very much,'' Clements said Tuesday.
   The CBS-TV Western tells the story of two retired Texas Rangers
who drive a cattle herd from the fictional town of Lonesome Dove, on
the Rio Grande along the U.S.-Mexican border, to Montana.
   Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis, a Fort Worth resident, said that
when the actors were to be shown in a fictional Fort Worth, ``I'll
be riding in there with them.''
   Despite all the praise, there were a few discouraging words.
   McMurtry, a native Texan, says he got the idea for the title of
his novel after seeing the Lonesome Dove Baptist Church's van pull
into a restaurant at Ponder in Denton County.
   Some members of the church don't like some of the language and
morals in the miniseries.
   ``I didn't care for all the sex,'' said Onalee Cate, 75, one of
about 400 members of the Lonesome Dove Baptist Church in Southlake,
near Fort Worth.
   But she continued: ``There are vulgar parts, but I thought the
action was real good.''
   ``I liked it as a whole, especially the back-to-earth living. I'm
old fashioned, you see,'' she added.
   ``Personally I can't be too proud of it,'' said Joseph ``Bud''
Tanner, 73, a descendant of the settlers who lived in what was known
as the Dove community, founded by a group of Missouri farmers.
   Dove was founded 142 years ago and was an area where farmers grew
cotton and cantaloupe, beans and okra.
   The Rev. Keith Wells, pastor of the Lonesome Dove church, said he
hadn't read all of the novel nor seen the first installment of the
miniseries.
   ``There's some fairly lewd comments within the script,'' said
Wells. ``It's just Hollywood trying to put something out to sell.''
   Despite his enthusiasm for ``Lonesome Dove,'' the governor said
he did have one reservation _ the cattle drive's ultimate
destination of Montana.
   ``That was perhaps the one thing in the novel that I never did
really quite understand,'' Clements said.
   ``My history has told me that an awful lot of Texans at that time
were taking cattle into Kansas and Colorado and Nebraksa, and even
to Wyoming. But really why this author picked out Montana, I'm not
sure. I think that, historically, it was in these other areas that
most of those cattle drives took place and most of the Texans went
and settled.''

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy who lapsed into a coma
after eating cyanide-tainted yogurt Jan. 3 died Tuesday after he was
removed from life support equipment, his family's attorney said.
   Thomas Lee, of Haddonfield, died at 10:33 a.m. at West Jersey
Hospital-Voorhees, said Leon Rose, a lawyer for Frances and Hsin-Yi
Lee.
   The teen-ager had been in critical condition since he became ill
after eating tainted yogurt on his way to school. The FBI and local
officials are investigating if the poisoning should be treated as a
homicide, suicide or product-tampering case, although they say the
last choice is highly unlikely.
   Rose said the boy's parents and his court-appointed guardian and
physicians met Monday night and reached a unanimous decision that
artificial life support should be terminated.
   ``The medical testimony was clear and convincing ... that there
was no chance of a recovery to a cognitive and sapient state,'' Rose
said.

<TEXT>
   The House and Senate voted overwhelmingly today
to scuttle a $45,500 congressional pay raise and sent the measure to
President Bush for his signature in time to prevent the increase
from taking effect at midnight.
   The House voted 380-48 to block the 51 percent salary boost and
the Senate concurred less than three hours later by a 94-6 margin.
The Senate had passed a similar but not identically worded measure,
95-5, last week.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would sign the
bill, which also would kill large pay raises for federal judges and
senior officials in the executive branch. ``The president will abide
by the wishes of the Congress,'' he said.
   Lawmakers in both houses said the votes were a bow to
overwhelming public sentiment against the big boost in the current
congressional pay of $89,500 a year.
   ``You can fight city hall and you can take on the Congress of the
United States with all its legerdemain and all its legislative
ability'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   The six senators voting to permit the raise were Democrats
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii; and Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont
and Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens, both of Alaska.
   It took a two-thirds vote for the repeal measure to clear the
House, and there was no doubt about the outcome.
   ``We face reality here today,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a
staunch supporter of the increase. ``We're doing what has become
inevitable.''
   ``Today, we the Congress will be reflecting the voice of the
people regarding the attitude on congressional pay,'' said Rep.
Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.
   One lawmaker spoke out forcefully in favor of the pay raise _ and
drew an ovation from the lawmakers gathered to vote against him.
   ``Each member of the House, Democrat and Republican, is worth
$135,000,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. He said that whatever
the pay and perquisites received by lawmakers, it doesn't make up
for the missed birthdays, school plays and other family occasions
that are part of life in Congress.
   Public opinion polls reflected overwhelming opposition to the
increase, and the House debated the issue before a packed gallery
with a long line of spectators waiting in the Capitol corridors
hoping for a seat.
   The repeal of the raise _ recommended by a federal commission and
endorsed by Presidents Reagan and Bush _ would leave congressional
pay at $89,500 a year.
   At the same time, it would leave intact a much-criticized system
that permits lawmakers to earn thousands of dollars in speaking
fees, permits them to earn other outside income and enables them to
have lobbyists pay travel costs for public appearances.
   Even as the House moved toward a vote, lawmakers cautioned that
without a raise for judges for senior executive branch officials,
the government would be hardpressed to find and keep qualified men
and women on the job. ``There are Supreme Court justices who make
less than their clerks the day after they (the clearks) retire and
go into private practice,'' said Fazio.
   ``This issue isn't over,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading
opponent of the pay raise who said the Congress must deal this year
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for
lawmakers.
   Raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in both
houses today, after they engineered the collapse Monday of House
Speaker Jim Wright's suggested alternative, a 30 percent pay
increase.
   The speaker conceded after his forces were beaten decisively when
they tried to adjourn the House, let the full raise become law at
12:01 a.m. Wednesday and then schedule a Thursday vote to scale back
the increase to 30 percent. The opening move in that strategy failed
on a 238-88 vote.
   Public clamor against the raise has been growing each day. A
weekend Gallup poll asked 1,001 adults from Friday through Sunday
whether they favored or opposed increasing congressional pay from
$89,500 to $135,000, the amount of the proposed increase.
   The results, with a four-point margin of error, showed 82 percent
opposed with only 15 percent in favor.
   One immediate casualty of the raise appears to be a plan to ban
lawmakers' receipt of fees for speeches and appearances. These often
are paid by special interests seeking to influence legislation.
   Many members of Congress who accept the money said they do so to
supplement an inadequate income.
   Assuming the full raise is defeated, any elimination of the
$26,850 that House members can retain in honoraria _ or the $35,800
that senators can keep _ would be a move to reduce lawmakers' pay.
Senators already have unanimously approved an honoraria ban for
themselves, but made it conditional upon the full raise becoming law.
   Also left dangling was a proposal to end a loophole in federal
law that allowed 190 House members to accumulate $39 million in
leftover campaign cash, which could be converted to their personal
use. A bipartisan House negotiating team agreed to eliminate the
loophole if the raise went into effect.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's extensive
holdings in blue-chip stocks have forced his recusal from a variety
of legal and policy issues since he took office last August.
   The attorney general's stock portfolio, which reads like a roster
of major U.S. corporations, includes AT&amp;T, Westinghouse, H.J. Heinz,
IBM, Atlantic Richfield, Amoco Corp., General Motors, Mobil Corp.,
Proctor and Gamble and Sears Roebuck.
   Before his Senate confirmation last summer, Thornburgh reported
that the value of his stock holdings was between $500,000 and
$700,000, said David Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general.
   Thornburgh's holdings in large corporations could force him to
recuse himself from a number of issues that may arise during his
tenure as attorney general, Runkel conceded.
   The companies in which Thornburgh invested have diverse
operations that could potentially become the subject of Justice
Department action on any of several fronts, including environmental
enforcement, anti-trust investigations or litigation involving
government contracts.
   Historically, the Justice Department policy and legal activities
involve large corporations, notably its extensive civil anti-trust
investigation of oil companies that ended in 1983.
   Before he took office, Thornburgh asked the agency's various
divisions to determine what cases might pose a conflict-of-interest
for the attorney general, according to Justice Department records.
   Thornburgh agreed to recuse himself ``from participation in any
matter in which he has a financial interest'' to resign as a
corporate director of Rite Aid Corp., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and ARCO
Chemical Co., the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Under the recusal policy he later adopted, Thornburgh
disqualified himself from several legal cases pending before the
department, according to records compiled by the attorney general's
office.
   The law allows Thornburgh to obtain a waiver of disqualification,
but Runkel said he doubted the attorney general would seek such
waivers. So far, the attorney general has not sought any waivers,
Runkel said Tuesday.
   Thornburgh also notified division heads that he would not
participate in decisions involving several other issues that could
involve the agency in litigation or policymaking.
   The most notable case is Thornburgh's blanket recusal from
decisions involving the enforcement of the AT&amp;T divestiture consent
decree.
   Thornburgh also has recused himself from two issues as a result
of his holding of at least $15,000 worth of Westinghouse Electric
Corp. stock.
   He declined involvement in the anti-trust division's review last
summer of Schindler Holding Co.'s proposed acquisition of
Westinghouse's elevator subsidiary.
   He also recused himself from participation from any litigation
that might arise from the cleanup of a government nuclear weapons
plant in Fernald, Ohio, operated by Westinghouse.
   Thornburgh's ownership of at least $5,000 worth of AT&amp;T common
stock in an individual retirement account makes him the third
consecutive attorney general ineligible to oversee the anti-trust
division's role in court cases following divestiture.
   In 1980, before he became President Reagan's first attorney
general, William French Smith and his wife placed their stock and
bond holdings, valued at least $2.3 million, into a blind trust.
   Smith recused himself from AT&amp;T divestiture matters because he
had been a director of Pacific Bell.
   His successor, Edwin Meese III, was criticized last month by an
internal Justice Department report for participating in matters
involving the regional Bell companies while still holding stock in
those companies.
   Thornburgh, meanwhile, also recused himself from any government
involvement in litigation arising from a Jan. 2, 1988, fuel-oil
spill near Pittsburgh because his former law firm, Kirkpatrick and
Lockhart, represents Ashland Oil Co.
   He also recused himself from any policy discussions about whether
the Food and Drug Administration should play a role in implementing
California's Proposition 65.
   The law, adopted by voter referendum in 1986, requires extensive
warnings about toxic chemicals in the workplace and in labeling
prepared foods.
   Thornburgh's biggest single holding is at least $50,000 worth
stock in H.J. Heinz Co., the prepared food manufacturer based in the
attorney general's hometown of Pittsburgh.
   The attorney general also has recused himself from reviewing any
grant application by Harvard University, where his wife, Virginia,
is the univeristy's in-house advocate of the handicapped.
   Before he became attorney general, Thornburgh was the director of
the Institute of Politics at Harvard.
   Thornburgh also recused himself from any involvement in the
government's handling of a suit against the comptroller of the
currency challenging the right of national banks to insure municipal
bonds.
   The government has successfully defended the longstanding lawsuit
by an insurance trade association challenging the comptroller's
decision to allow Citicorp to acquire and operate a municipal bond
insurance business.
   Thornburgh owns at least $5,000 in Citicorp stock and at least
$5,000 worth of notes issued by the bank corporation.

<HEAD>Soviet Death Toll in Afghanistan Put at 15,000</HEAD>

   Nearly 2,000 Soviet soldiers were killed as the Red
Army pulled out of Afghanistan, bringing the overall Soviet death
toll in nine years of war to 15,000, a Foreign Ministry official
said Tuesday.
   ``It doesn't mean that during the last months we had the
bloodiest period of the war in Afghanistan,'' insisted Yuri K.
Alexeyev, head of the ministry's Middle East Department. But he
added: ``We had shellings by the opposition of the cities ... and a
lot of civilians died, and of course Soviet servicemen.''
   The last reported Soviet death toll was 13,310.
   At a news conference, Alexeyev said the new death toll came from
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who left Pakistan, on
Monday. The official news agency Tass paraphrased Shevardnadze's
remarks at a news conference in Islamabad and said he told
reporters: ``Soviet casualties over the nine years of war reached
15,000.''
   Alexeyev said Shevardnadze had used the phrase ``up to 15,000''
and said the figure applied to the number killed.
   After they began their withdrawal May 15, Soviet forces had to
rely increasingly on Afghan government troops to protect them from
guerrilla attacks. The pullout, brokered by the United Nations, is
to be completed by Feb. 15.
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing the last of its soldiers
Saturday, and Shevardnadze said Monday the rest would be home in a
week.
   Gen. Alexei D. Lizichev told a Moscow news conference May 25 that
13,310 Soviet troops had been killed, 35,478 wounded and 311 were
missing. He said his figures applied from Dec. 27, 1979, when Soviet
troops and tanks entered the war, until May 1, 1988.
   Alexeyev did not provide numbers of wounded and missing.
   Also at Tuesday's news conference, Igor A. Rogachev, a deputy
Soviet foreign minister, reiterated the pullout of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan will be completed before the deadline.
   ``By Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldier will remain in
Afghanistan,'' he said. Nor will Soviet warplanes fly to the country
after that date, he said.
   He added, however, that supply flights will continue. The youth
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that by Friday, 3,500 tons
of flour were brought into Kabul, which is suffering food and fuel
shortages because of a blockade by anti-government Moslem
guerrillas. The paper said 3,475 tons of ammunition also were flown
into one Afghan airport.
   Tass reported 1,500 Soviet soldiers withdrew Monday and Tuesday
through Termez in Soviet Uzbekistan. Without giving figures, Tass
said Soviet troops also are returning home via the border city of
Kushka, in Soviet Turkmenia, as well as by air.
   Since the second phase of the pullout began Aug. 15, 35,000
Soviet troops have left Afghanistan, Tass reported.
   The fighting continues. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said 30,000 rebels had massed along major roads in
Afghanistan and were trying to blockade provincial centers.
Rocketing of Kabul is continuing, he said.
   Tass reported the Afghan army killed 11 rebels and wounded five
who had bombarded the Qanahar airport with rockets and mines. The
insurgents blasted the city of Khost in Nangarhar province, the news
agency said.
   In other areas, Tass said government troops killed 10 guerrillas
in Achin and Hazrat Sultan, and air strikes killed four guerrillas
in the Anjil district of Herat province.
   Tuesday's Soviet newspapers featured photographs of jubilant
Soviets returning home. Articles focused on the soldiers' joy at
having fulfilled their ``internationalist duty.''

   The Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip led to a ``substantial increase'' in human rights
violations by Israeli authorities last year, the State Department
said Tuesday in its annual report on rights conditions worldwide.
   The report, covering conditions in 169 countries and territories,
praised the Soviet Union for ``remarkable changes'' in the human
rights field, including the freeing of all prisoners detained for
political or religious offenses.
   The section on Israel was one of the harshest on that country
since the State Department began issuing human rights reports in the
mid-1970s. It said the actions of Israeli authorities ``resulted in
many avoidable deaths'' among Palestinians since they began their
uprising 14 months ago.
   The Palestinian uprising caught the Israeli army ``by surprise,''
the report said. The armed forces, ``untrained and inexperienced in
riot control, responded in a manner which led to a substantial
increase in human rights violations,'' it said.
   Shortly after the report was made public, Israeli Deputy Foreign
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu defended the actions of Israeli forces.
   ``Israeli soldiers ... maintain as best they can, apart from a
few exceptions, the standards of proper conduct that no country in
the world cold maintain,'' he said in Jerusalem.
   In a separate statement, the Israeli army's chief prosecutor
defended the legality of Israeli operations, saying Palestinian
prisoners were given due process of law.
   Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, 374 Palestinians
have been killed and thousands wounded, most by army gunfire.
   From time to time since the violence started in the occupied
territories, the State Department has expressed criticism of Israeli
efforts to bring it under control, but the report appeared to go
beyond the earlier statements.
   Two private human rights groups, Amnesty International and the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, also criticized the Israelis.
   In a report to the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, Amnesty International said that while both sides have
used violence in the Palestinian uprising, there have been excesses
on the Israeli side.
   ``Demonstrators have thrown rocks and Molotov cocktails,'' the
report said. ``However, the tactics of the Israeli army have
exceeded the use of reasonable force.''
   It said there have been ``hundreds of questionable killings'' by
Israeli security forces and that few have been adequately
investigated.
   Amnesty International and the lawyers committee questioned the
use of high velocity bullets by the Israeli forces as well as the
use of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can be
lethal.
   The State Department report cited across-the-board advances in
the Soviet Union but said it was premature to say whether a
fundamental shift on rights policy has occurred there.
   It said all prisoners detained on religious or political grounds
had been released and that plans for the amendment or repeal of
statutes limiting activities in these areas have been announced.
   In addition, freedom the leave the Soviet Union temporarily has
been significantly expanded, it said. The report said there were
also human rights gains last year in Poland and Hungary.
   While suggesting that worldwide trends have been favorable, the
report said there were severe human rights setbacks in Iraq, Burundi
and Sudan.
   In Iraq, chemical warfare was used against Kurdish rebels,
resulting in the death or injury of thousands and forcing tens of
thousands to flee the country.
   The report indicated that perhaps the single greatest
rights-related tragedy in the world occurred in southern Sudan where
it said some reports estimated that between 100,000 and 250,000
civilians died of starvation.
   The deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on each
side in Sudan's civil war interfered with or failed to cooperate
with food delivery efforts.
   Elsewhere, the report said there were significant steps toward
democracy and human rights protection in South Korea, Taiwan and
Pakistan. It said that the October plebiscite in Chile has raised
hopes for a peaceful return to democracy there.
   The section in the report on Israel was praised by James Zogby,
executive director of the Arab-American Institute.
   ``For the first time in 12 years of reporting, the State
Department has fulfilled its mandate to tell the truth,'' Zogby
said. ``The burden is now on Congress to enforce the law regarding
human rights and aid. At this point, congressional inaction would
make a mockery of our stated commitment to human rights.''

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Arafat Group for Clash With Israelis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department criticized the Palestine
Liberation Organization on Tuesday over a clash with Israeli forces
in southern Lebanon but reserved judgment on whether it would
disrupt the U.S. dialogue with Yasser Arafat's group.
   ``We take this incident very seriously,'' spokesman Charles E.
Redman said. ``It can have a negative impact on the U.S.-PLO
dialogue and the atmosphere necessary for a positive
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.''
   Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, was instructed
to take the matter up immediately with PLO officials. It would be
his fourth meeting with Arafat's representatives since the Reagan
administration broke a 13-year ban last December on U.S. talks with
the PLO.
   The attempted raid Saturday, in which four Palestinians and one
Lebanese were killed, was the first against Israel since Arafat, at
U.S. urging, publicly renounced terrorism in all forms. He also
accepted Israel's right to exist and U.N. Security Council
resolutions calling for secure borders for all countries in the
Middle East.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy and other
senior U.S. officials cautioned the PLO at the time that the
dialogue would be suspended if Arafat broke his pledge to eschew
terrorism in his dispute with Israel.
   Moshe Arens, the foreign minister of Israel, said Monday the raid
violated the pledge, while Deputy Israeli ambassador Oded Eran urged
the State Department to break off the talks with the PLO.
   Under a barrage of questions, Redman said Arafat's renunciation
of terrorism was supposed to be applied everywhere, not just in
Israel itself. But he declined to say whether the raid by two
radical wings of the PLO violated the PLO chairman's promise.
   Identification found on the bodies of the five slain guerrillas
indicated they belonged to Dr. George Habash's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Front headed by
Mohammed Abbas.
   Redman said the incident and any others that might occur would be
examined on a ``case-by-case basis'' to see if they were acts of
terrorism by the PLO. He did not say what Pelletreau would tell the
PLO representatives in Tunisia or how long it would take the State
Department to complete its investigation.
   Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, spokesman fo the PLO, said the guerrillas
were fighting the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and
defending Palestinian camps.
   ``What are the Israelis doing in south Lebanon?'' he told The
Associated Press in Paris by telephone from PLO headquarters in
Tunis. ``Is that aggression or not? We have been facing this Israeli
aggression since 1982. We have the right to self-defense. We have
the right to defend our people and our camps.''
   Asked if he was specifically denying that the five were en route
to Israel, Abdul-Rahman said: ``In fact, I don't know. We are in a
defensive attitude against the Israelis in south Lebanon.''

<HEAD>US May Ease Restraints on Trade with Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has begun a review of
nine-year-old allied trade sanctions imposed against the Soviet
Union following its invasion of Afghanistan, the State Department
said Tuesday.
   The ``no-exceptions'' policy requires allied rejection of all
Soviet requests for the purchase of items with potential military
use.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said U.S. allies in the
15-nation Coordinating Committee for Strategic Exports (COCOM)
believe that the policy should now be lifted.
   Redman said that with the Soviets' Afghan withdrawal in its final
stage, the administration has begun a review of this policy. Under
an agreement signed last spring, the Soviets pledged to have all of
its troops out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Redman said the administration continues to oppose the export of
goods or technology in COCOM that would pose a strategic risk.
   ``Whatever might come out of this review and whatever might be
decided in COCOM, lifting the `no exceptions' policy would in no way
weaken the COCOM regime or facilitate the flow of sensitive
technology to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Even if the policy is lifted, all exports of dual-use
technologies would still be subject to COCOM review, and the United
States would still block the sale of any militarily sensitive
technologies to the Soviet Union, he said.
   COCOM membership includes Japan and all NATO allies except
Iceland.

<HEAD>Koreas Resume Political Talks Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South and North Korea, bitter rivals
since the division of the peninsula 44 years ago, open political
talks Wednesday to prepare for the first meeting of their prime
ministers.
   If they take place, the prime ministerial talks will be the
highest level held between the two Koreas. They are aimed at easing
tensions by resolving political and military disputes.
   Five-member delegations, each headed by a vice minister, are to
meet at the truce village of Panmunjom to negotiate terms for the
talks.
   Two days later, lawmakers of the two sides are to meet for an
eighth round of talks on a non-aggression pact.
   Preparations also are under way to open another channel of
dialogue in March, this time for sports officials who want to form a
single Korean team for the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, China.
   The flurry of talks comes at a time when relations between the
countries are undergoing changes after many years of bitter
competition.
   ``We are getting mixed signals from North Korea,'' said Kim
Nam-sik, a South Korean who specializes in North Koean affairs.
``Although they seem flexible on some issues, their basic positions
are still very strong and show no sign of change,'' he said.
   Professor Lee Ho-Jae of Seoul's Korea University said, ``North
Korea appears to be changing, but the change is very slow and would
not bring a rapid improvement of relations with South Korea.''
   Last week, the communist government signed an unprecedented
agreement with a South Korean industrialist to undertake several
joint ventures, including a major tourist complex. But it was
unclear whether the business agreement indicated a policy change
toward Seoul.
   Any such changes will be tested when North Korea's military and
political officials sit down with their South Korean partners
Wednesday to discuss highly sensitive issues such as the U.S.
military presence in the south.
   North Korea has indicated repeatedly it will call off scheduled
meetings unless joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises are
halted. The exercises normally start in February and last about two
months.
   Pyongyang suspended all dialogue with Seoul in 1986 to protest
the maneuvers, an annual event since 1976.
   The U.S. command in Seoul last week refused to confirm or deny
whether maneuvers have begun, but said officials of the two
countries ``began planning on the training many months ago'' and
``that planning continues.''
   In the past, the maneuvers were announced well in advance. But
this year a formal announcement is being delayed at Seoul's request.
   South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon said last week the
scale and format of the exercises could be reduced if North Korea
shows a ``concrete change of attitude.''
   Military officials of the United States and South Korea say the
exercises are needed to deter a possible invasion by North Korea.
Pyongyang's forces ivnaded South Korea in 1950, starting a
three-year war.
   The high-level talks first were proposed by North Korea on Nov.
16.
   North Korea said the main agenda should include the withdrawal by
1991 of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and a
reduction of the two Koreas' armed forces to 100,000 each by the
same year.
   South Korea has an estimated 650,000 men under arms and North
Korea about 850,000.

   The Marine Corps on Tuesday completed the
administrative process needed to fire a civilian contracting
executive who has pleaded guilty to bribery in connection with a
Pentagon fraud investigation.
   Jack Sherman, the executive, ``will be officially removed from
the government (employee) rolls at midnight tonight,'' said Lt. Col.
Fred Peck, a Marine spokesman.
   ``He has been advised that today is his last day.''
   Peck added that under government regulations, Sherman would have
the right to appeal his dismissal to the Merit Systems Protection
Board. He will have 20 days, starting Wednesday, to file such an
appeal should he wish to do so, the spokesman said.
   Louis Koutoulakos, Sherman's attorney, was unavailable for
comment on Sherman's plans.
   The 52-year-old Sherman appeared in federal court Jan. 27 and
pleaded guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for providing
confidential contract information to consultants and companies.
   He could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000
when sentenced April 7.
   Sherman, until identified in court papers last summer in
connection with the probe, worked as a contracting officer in the
corps' installation and logistics department in Washington. After
being identified in federal search warrants, he was transferred to
an administrative job that did not involve the award of contracts.
   The federal investigation, known as Operation Ill Wind, has been
underway for at least two years. It focuses on allegations that
private consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagon
officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge
in securing contracts.

<TEXT>
   Americans obligated themselves to $5.4 billion
more in credit than they paid off in December as consumer debt grew
at an annual rate of 9.9 percent, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the December increase followed a
revised increase of $4.7 billion in November and a rise of $3.9
billion in October.
   December's 9.9 percent rise in the seasonally adjusted annual
rate of credit growth was up from an 8.5 percent rate in November
and a 7.2 percent increase in October.
   December's increase matched the 9.9 percent rise recorded last
August, which was the highest since a 15.2 percent increase in June.
   The December jump was paced by an increase in outstanding auto
loans, while growth in the category of debt that includes credit
cards slowed from the rapid pace of the preceding two months.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national
product.
   Economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington said
the latest report indicates that consumer finances were healthy in
December and throughout 1988.
   ``Despite the very-often-heard concerns about consumers
staggering under a debt burden, that really is not the case,'' Ms.
Shaber said. ``What we've had for two years now is people borrowing
no more than their income gains were.''
   Auto loans rose by $3 billion in December, a 12.4 percent annual
rate of growth. That followed a 5.7 percent increase during November.
   Revolving credit, the category that includes credit cards,
increased by $1.4 billion in December, a 9.1 percent annual rate of
growth, after having risen 21.1 percent in November.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$1.3 billion in December, a 9.5 percent increase in the annual rate,
after having inched up 0.4 percent in November.
   Loans for mobile homes decreased by $221 million, or a 10.3
percent drop, after rising 2.5 percent in the previous month.
   Overall, total consumer debt reached a seasonally adjusted $667.3
billion in December, up 8.9 percent from a year earlier.

   Health experts told a Senate panel Tuesday that
the defeat of the pay raise will hurt their efforts to recruit
scientists to join the government's battle against AIDS.
   They also said more money was needed for government AIDS
education programs.
   Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration ``can leave for
salaries of four and five times'' above government pay levels, FDA
Commissioner Frank Young told the Labor and Human Resources
Committee.
   The pay voted down by Congress on Tuesday would have raised
congressional pay by 51 percent, but it would have also permitted
increases in the top-level pay of executive branch officials,
including government scientists at the FDA and the National
Institutes of Health.
   Young said the FDA is in the same predicament as NIH, which he
said hasn't been able to recruit a senior scientist in the last 10
years.
   ``We're in a difficult position of knowing how to prepare a
budget,'' Young also said, because ``we can't anticipate two years
ahead'' as the budget process requires.
   For example, he said, the FDA hadn't anticipated that the number
of applications for AIDS drug research would double, that there
would be annual instead of biannual inspections of the nation's drug
supply, or that there would be problems with inspections of condoms
and rubber gloves.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   As of Jan. 2 ,the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said
there were 32,311 AIDS cases reported in the United States in 1988,
a 57 percent increase in the number of reported AIDS cases from 1987.
   Samuel O. Thier, who heads the Institute of Medicine at the
National Academy of Sciences, said the approximately $1 billion
recommended for education and other health measures by 1990 was
``too low.''
   ``A substantial sum of money will have to be spent, over and
above $1 billion a year, to provide treatment facilities for
IV(intravenous) drug users...to prevent drug abuse and to mitigate
the dangers of shared'' needles, said Thier.
   Despite the shortfall of personnel and money, the experts said
they had made considerable progress in the last year in educating
the public and in creating and expanding programs to provide
services to critically ill AIDS victims.
   Young said the FDA has been successful in its efforts to
streamline the review process of drug treatments for AIDS and
AIDS-related conditions.
   Despite ``a marked increase'' in applications from pharmaceutical
companies to the agency for AIDS drug research and development, the
commissioner said the FDA has cut the review time for AIDS drug
therapies by about 50 percent.
   He cited the examples of two recently approved drugs, flutomide
and an aerosolized pentamidine, used to treat infections and cancers
that are often fatal to AIDS patients,
   The new drug application for flutomide was submitted to the FDA
in October 1988 and approved Jan. 25, while pentamidine was approved
Monday, Young said. As of the beginning of January the FDA had
approved 213 new drug research applications.
   Although Thier could offer no specific data on the effectiveness
of his agency's education programs, he did say National Center for
Health Statistics surveys show 85 percent of adults reporting they
had seen a public service announcement on AIDS between May and
August 1988.
   Other government officials said progress is also being made in
expanding care for the growing population of children stricken with
AIDS, training police and other professionals in dealing with AIDS
victims, and computerizing AIDS information.

floor action.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the panel, said a floor
vote to confirm Yeutter to the post could come as early as Wednesday.
   Approval of the former U.S. trade representative to head the
Agriculture Department came on a voice vote at a three-minute
meeting.
   Yeutter is a former USDA official who once operated a Nebraska
cattle feedlot and went on to become president of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   As the nation's top trade negotiator since 1985, Yeutter was
known as a strong voice for Reagan administration's free-trade
policy and hd been credited with doing much to win concessions from
Japan for U.S. beef and citrus producers.
   Committee members asked him last week about a two-year
investigation by the FBI of fraud allegations at the mercantile
echange and another huge commodity futures market, the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   ``I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' Yeutter said.

   Chilean navy frogmen plunged into icy
Antarctic waters Tuesday to seal shut the fuel tanks of a crippled
ship and stop the spread of an oil slick threatening the pristine
area's wildlife, authorities said.
   A navy communique said the cutter Yelcho arrived Monday night,
the first cleanup vessel to get to the spill site 590 miles from the
tip of South America and close to the shores of the Antarctic
Peninsula.
   Crew members Tuesday morning encircled the nearly sunken vessel
Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) with floating booms designed to contain
any further oil leak, according to the communique read by a
spokesman at navy headquarters in Santiago.
   Divers then entered the frigid waters to seal shut the Bahia
Paraiso's tanks, it said.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28
about two miles from Palmer Station U.S. research base. Scientists
say the area teams with wildlife, including thousands of penguins.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. Officials of the
Washington-based National Science Foundation say oil is leaking
slowly from the ship, which gradually sank in the shallow waters.
Only a section of its superstructure remains above the surface.
   They say a slick nearly 500 feet wide and two miles long is
trailing away from the vessel toward the south, threatening the
frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled environment.
   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to arrive at
the spill later Tuesday. It carries a multimillion-dollar cleanup
mission organized by the National Science Foundation that includes
military and civilian experts and 52 tons of sophisticated equipment.
   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels are in the area of the spill and plan to
help, according to the Chilean navy. However, they await equipment
being flown from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a Chilean-run Antarctic
base 200 miles from the accident.
   An Argentine Embassy official in Santiago told reporters Monday
the government would try to salvage the Bahia Paraiso once the
environmental threat is stemmed.
   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also is at
the spill site to evaluate environmental damage, said the insitute's
acting director, Antonio Massei.
   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around the
accident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many baby
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they are
worried they could suffocate in the oil.
   Other wildlife also is threatened, including Antartic gulls and
terns, and krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean considered a vital
link in Antarctica's food chain.

   President Bush and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney will set the tone for future U.S.-Canadian relations in
talks later this week, a top White House aide said Tuesday.
   Previewing talks that Bush will have with Mulroney in Ottawa on
Friday, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft cautioned against
expecting major decisions or developments.
   Bush chose Canada for his first trip abroad, Scowcroft said, ``to
reaffirm the importance we attach to a close and productive
relationship with our neighbor to the north.''
   Scowcroft, a retired Air Force general, said Bush and Mulroney
have agreed beforehand that ``this first meeting is one to set the
tone and the agenda for subsequent meetings.''
   He did say, however, the two leaders are expected to discuss acid
rain, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, maritime borders and
military relationships, among other subjects.
   Yet, Scowcroft insisted, ``It is not a negotiating session, as
such, to get down into the nitty-gritty of issues and determine
specific milestones and so forth.''
   He acknowledged that Mulroney has been pressing the United States
hard on the acid rain pollution befouling the air and waters in the
Midwest and parts of Canada and the Great Lakes region.
   But Scowcroft said that while Bush promised to take action on the
environmental problem, the president isn't yet ready to make hard
commitments to the prime minister.
   ``I think he feels that the first step has to be the domestic
part of the acid rain agenda before he's prepared to be all that
specific with the Canadians,'' he said.
   ``This is an initial meeting,'' Scowcroft added. ``It's a very,
kind of private, relaxed meeting to set the tone of the relationship
and to determine the kinds of things that the two will want to be
talking about down the line.''

   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. was listed in stable condition Tuesday, a day after he
entered a hospital with an acute respiratory infection.
   Powell, 81, was undergoing tests Tuesday at Baptist Medical
Center and doctors had not determined when he would be released,
said Cindy Hamilton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The justice, who was in Jacksonville sitting on a panel of the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, had a dizzy spell Monday and was
taken by ambulance to the hospital.
   Powell had a comfortable night and had no fever nor signs of
pneumonia, Ms. Hamilton said.
   The justice's vital signs were good and there was no evidence of
cardio-vascular problems, she said. Powell took a walk down hospital
corridors Tuesday afternoon, she said.
   The appeals panel continued to hear oral arguments Tuesday. The
arguments were taped so that Powell could hear them and help decide
the cases.
   Powell retired from the nation's highest court June 26, 1987,
citing concerns about his health as one reason. He had suffered from
prostate cancer.
   When he left the high court, Powell took senior judge status,
which allows him to hear cases at his discretion. He has since
participated in a number of cases for the Richmond-based 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He was 64 when nominated by President Richard Nixon in 1971 and
was sworn in Jan. 7, 1972, replacing Justice Hugo L. Black.

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp, taking control of his large department, has moved to replace
nearly all of HUD's political appointees left over from the Reagan
administration, the department said Tuesday.
   Kemp, who was confirmed by the Senate on Friday, informed most
top officials of the department that day in writing that their
resignations were to be effective March 3.
   The resignations include nearly all the department's political
appointees and other senior executives who do not have
career-employee status. A department official, insisting on
anonymity, placed the number of people being let go at 126,
including most assistant secretaries, deputies and other
high-ranking posts.
   The department said in a statement:
   ``Acceptance of these resignations in no way reflects on these
employees' performance. But the Bush administration has indicated
from the outset its desire to put a new team in place to implement
the Bush-Kemp policies and programs at HUD.''
   The former secretary, Samuel R. Pierce, asked for the
resignations ``at the pleasure of the secretary'' on Jan. 3. Similar
requests for the resignations of political appointees were made
throughout government, although in some departments some officials
are keeping their jobs in the new administration.
   Kemp was sworn in Monday afternoon by the department's general
counsel, J. Michael Dorsey. A formal swearing-in ceremony
administered by President Bush is expected early next week.
   Kemp, who has received enthusiastic support in the new job from
mayors, housing officials and other groups that deal regularly with
HUD, has has announced no replacements. He so far has announced the
appointment of one official, special assistant Mary Brunette, his
former legislative director in Congress.
   Alan J. Greenwald, deputy under secretary for intergovernmental
affairs, who was at the department for the full eight years Pierce
was secretary, said that he was not surprised by the actions but
that some political appointees were upset.
   ``A lot of people are upset,'' he said. ``I don't understand it,
but they are. We've had a long run here, eight years.''

   Dastagir Husini, the Malaysian
``snake king'' who has lived with about 100 poisonous cobras for two
weeks, said Tuesday he will continue his feat for another few days.
   He broke the world record of nine days on Feb. 2, the National
News Agency Bernama reported Tuesday without saying who had held the
record. The Guinness Book of World Records does not list records in
such events.
   Husini, 63, was given a clean bill of health by Dr. A. Ganga
Daran who examined him after he stepped out of a glass cubicle at
the National Museum on Tuesday.
   A snake exhibition also is being held at the museum in
conjunction with the event, and visitors have paid more than $27,500
since he started his feat. Museum Director-General Shahrum Yub said
the proceeds would be divided equally between Husini and the museum.
   ``I am fine and ready to prolong my stay with the snakes for
another two or three days,'' Husini said at a news conference
outside the cubicle.
   ``But there should not be any condition, no pressure from anybody
for me to continue or to call off the act any time I may feel like
doing it,'' he said, adding that he was not having any problems so
far either from the snakes, museum management or the visitors.
   ``I am taking some vitamins, prescribed by the doctor, to keep up
my strength and have been one happy entertainer before huge crowds
who turn up even at the week hours, especially on weekends,'' he
added.
   The visitors came from all over the country as well as from
Singapore and Thailand and India, where snake acts are common.
   The glass cubicle measures 12.99 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet. He
steps out of it for 15 minutes every hour for his meals and vitamins.
   The cobras are fed eggs at night, and there is a bucket of water
in the cubicle.
   Husini learned how to handle snakes from his father, a snake
charmer. Husini has taught his children the art, and he said he
hoped one of his sons, Mohamad Ali, 25, would shoot for his record.
   Husini said the secret of his feat is that the cobras normally
don't attack people unless provoked.

<HEAD>Lawyers Offer Model Legislation For _ Or Against _ Surrogate Mothers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association, without endorsing
surrogate motherhood, offered states a blueprint Tuesday for
legalizing the practice and making surrogacy contracts enforceable.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, its policy-making body, approved by
voice vote a resolution offering states a proposed model act for
legalizing surrogacy.
   But the resolution also contained an alternative model that would
bar enforcement of contracts in which a so-called surrogate mother
is paid to bear a child and then give up any claim to her offspring.
   The 330,000-member ABA, the nation's largest organization of
lawyers, chose to adopt a resolution with conflicting options to
avoid going on record in favor of surrogacy.
   But opponents of the resolution insisted the measure would make
it appear the ABA supports the controversial practice.
   ``This is a mechanism to buy and sell children,'' said Kurt
Melchior, a San Francisco lawyer who opposed the resolution. ``Our
basic constitutional and humanistic principles are being deeply
offended here.''
   The surrogacy proposal was adopted as the ABA concluded its
annual mid-winter convention.
   Michael P. Sullivan of Minneapolis, a chief sponsor of the
surrogacy resolution, said the ABA must recognize that such
contracts are being made in many states and offer guidance to
lawmakers.
   ``In dealing with the new biology, you can't put your head in the
sand,'' he said. Sullivan said his main interest was in assuring
uniformity among those states that choose to make surrogacy legal.
   Proponents of the measure said surrogacy is a boon to the 15
percent of married couples that are infertile and unable to adopt
because of a shortage of babies put up for adoption.
   In the surrogacy case that attracted the most nationwide
attention, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that surrogate
motherhood for money violates the state's adoption laws.
   The state court voided a surrogacy contract but awarded custody
of the child _ referred to as Baby M _ to its biological father and
his wife.
   Baby M's biological mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, won
unsupervised visitation rights.
   The ruling fueled rather than resolved the debate over surrogacy.
   The resolution adopted by the ABA proposed that those states
legalizing surrogate contracts should limit them to agreements
between a married couple and a surrogate mother. The husband seeking
the contract would have to donate his sperm or his wife would have
to contribute the egg to establish a genetic tie between the baby
and one of the parents.
   The agreement would be approved by a judge before conception and
there would have to be proof that the wife seeking to acquire the
baby is unable to bear a child herself, the resolution said.
   Also, the surrogate mother would have 180 days after the child is
conceived to repudiate the contract and keep the baby. After 180
days, the couple that signed the contract to acquire the child would
become its legal parents.
   The ABA also unanimously adopted a resolution calling for
increased funding of the federal Legal Services Corporation.
   The resolution, which criticized the former Reagan administration
for cutting back legal services to the poor, urged President Bush to
name Legal Services Corporation directors who are committed to
helping the poor.

<HEAD>Cold Weather, Lack of Snow Cover May Have Hurt Winter Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low temperatures and lack of protective snow
cover may have damaged winter wheat in parts of the central and
southern plains, a government report said Tuesday.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility, however, said wheat in
the northern plains and the Corn Belt benefited from snow during the
week of Jan. 30-Feb. 5 as a huge arctic system caused temperatures
to plummet.
   ``In Kansas, winter wheat was mostly poor to fair,'' the report
said. ``Extreme cold temperatures late in the week may have caused
widespread winterkill, but the extent of the damage was still
unknown.''
   The cold weather ``greatly reduced greenbug activity'' in the
Oklahoma winter wheat crop, but raised the possibility of winterkill
in the western area of the state, the report said.
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. No forecasts or estimates of crop yields are included
in the reports.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures on
Tuesday closed about unchanged from the day before. Analysts said
the markets had anticipated some wheat winterkill because of the
cold.
   Moreover, forecasts for more snow in the Great Plains have had a
dampening effect on commodity markets.
   ``There is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a
back-to-back crop adversity in (the) Midwest are extremely small,''
said Richard Feltes of Refco Inc., a Chicago-based commodities
brokerage firm.
   The Agriculture Department has been saying for months that a
repeat of last year's heavy drought losses is unlikely, although
some areas are still far below normal in soil moisture.
   Norton D. Strommen, the USDA's chief meteorologist, says
precipitation from now until the end of April ``can further improve
soil moisture levels and yield potential of wheat areas'' in the
Great Plains.
   Also, he said Monday, timely spring and summer rains, along with
favorable temperatures, will be the key to crop prospects this
summer. There is ``little correlation'' between drought indicators
this winter and prospective crop yields for 1989, Strommen said.

   A preacher who authorities say has seduced and
abused 100 boys for at least two decades was sentenced Tuesday to 2{
years in prison for child sodomy.
   Mario ``Tony'' Leyva, a self-ordained pentecostal preacher who
still faces a sentencing on federal charges, took the stand in
Roanoke County Circuit Court and apologized for lying in September
when he told jurors he had never committed any homosexual acts with
minors.
   But Judge Kenneth Trabue chastised Leyva as he upheld the
sentence jurors had recommended when they convicted him of
performing oral sodomy on two teen-age boys.
   ``I suppose the thing that troubles me most is somebody of the
cloth, who knows the truth, has openly and flagrantly lied,'' Trabue
told Leyva, 43, of Columbus, Ga. ``There was an overt effort to
poison the jury on your behalf.''
   Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Randy Leach agreed not to press
perjury charges against Leyva as part of a deal in which Leyva and
two fellow preachers pleaded guilty to federal charges that they
shipped young boys across state lines on the southern revival
circuit to use them in illegal sex acts.
   Leyva, Rias Edward Morris and Freddie M. Herring could be
sentenced by late February or early March in U.S. District Court.
The three ministers pleaded guilty in October to charges they used
the Tony Leyva Evangelistic Association Inc., based in Columbus, to
gain access to young boys through the years.
   Leyva had been abusing boys since at least the 1960s, when he was
a preacher in North Carolina, the FBI said. Morris, 47, was Leyva's
ministry organist, and Herring, 50, was founder of the Lighthouse
Assembly in Douglasville, Ga. Their plea agreements call for maximum
sentences of 20 years in prison for Leyva and 15 years each for
Morris and Herring.
   Morris and Herring were not charged in the state case.
   During Leyva's state trial in September, he called his young
accusers liars and said their stories of sexual abuse were prompted
by people out to get him. But when Leyva decided to reach a plea
bargain with federal prosecutors, the FBI made him provide a
detailed account of the sex acts that had gone on for years in his
ministry.
   Lawyers said that since Leyva's testimony in federal court
contradicted his sworn claim of innocence in state court, he had to
recant the earlier testimony.
   ``I've recanted on the statements and wish to beg the court's
forgiveness for the statements, which were not true,'' Leyva told
the judge Tuesday.

Wedding Chapel _ a spouse.
   For those who prefer the more mundane, T-shirts are also
available.
   ``We felt like tourists would find it unique to be married on
Music Row,'' said Ellie Mead, one of the partners in the wedding
chapel business.
   The chapel has a steeple, six on-call ministers and piped-in
music. T-shirts for sale in the gift shop announce ``We Rang the
Bell on Music Row.''
   The owners foresee more wedding centers around the country,
franchised under the name Wedding Chapels of America.
   The Music Row chapel seats 40 and has a raised stage in the front
with electric logs glowing in the background. Two stained glass
windows feature magnolias and doves.
   A no-frills wedding with music, boutonniere and corsage is $95
and takes less than half an hour.
   The chapel's office take appointments during the day, and there
is usually a minister on call from 3 to 5 p.m. for walk-in business,
said publicist Jane Billingsley, a partner in the venture.
   ``That's for the people who come in and want to get married right

   Texans love their Blue Bell ice cream _ even when
the temperature outdoors is colder than the frost on their dessert
spoons.
   Blue Bell officials say that during the icy weather last weekend
they sold 600,000 gallons of ice cream _ a record for this time of
year _ at grocery and convenience stores in the Dallas area.
   ``We did more in those four days than we normally do in a week,''
division manager Melvin Ziegenbein said Monday. ``Today our phone is
ringing off the wall from people out of ice cream.''
   Supplies at Dallas-area stores are dwindling and officials are
not sure if they will be able to keep up with the unprecedented
demand.
   The branch manager of Blue Bell's distribution office in suburban
Mesquite had a simple explanation for the seemingly irrational
cold-weather craving.
   ``People stock up on food and stay home and sit by the fire and
eat ice cream,'' said Jerry Ferguson.

   A body was discovered on an abandoned, burned-out
ship being towed to port on the Washington coast, Coast Guard
officials said Tuesday.
   The Zhe-Sheng, a 180-foot Taiwanese fishing vessel that drifted
on the high seas for more than seven months, also has 40,000 gallons
of diesel oil on board, Petty Officer Andre Billeaudeaux said.
   Billeaudeaux said the body would be turned over to authorities
after the ship is towed to the Coast Guard station at Port Angeles.
The fuel will be salvaged, he said.
   The Zhe-Sheng had drifted about 2,800 nautical miles since it was
abandoned about 300 miles north of Midway Island after a fire last
June. Seventeen members of the 18-man crew survived, Billeaudeaux
said.
   Officials knew before the discovery of the body that one of the
crewmen was unaccounted for, but had no information about his
possible fate, Billeaudeaux said.
   The ship was spotted by a tanker Sunday about 400 miles off Cape
Flattery on the northwest Washington coast. The body was discovered
after the crew of the Active boarded the vessel Monday, Billeaudeaux
said.

   The dusky seaside sparrow, a small Florida bird
that became extinct despite a multimillion-dollar effort to preserve
it, may not have been a true subspecies after all, but just a
routine member of a bird family still thriving all along the
Atlantic coast.
   John C. Avise, a University of Georgia professor of genetics,
said Tuesday that a comparison of random samples of genes from the
dusky with those of other Atlantic coast seaside sparrows shows
almost no difference, suggesting that efforts to prevent the dusky's
extinction were not justified.
   ``The genetic results suggest that the magnitude of genetic
distinction of the dusky from other Atlantic coast populations of
seaside sparrows is very small,'' said Avise. ``In fact, we didn't
detect any differences, really.''
   The professor said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was
required by law to try to protect the small bird because the sparrow
was officially identified as a true subspecies. But Avise said that
based on a modern comparison of the bird's genetic makeup, it
appears the sparrow known as dusky was not unique.
   ``At the time they (the Fish and Wildlife Service) acted, it was
appropriate to try to save the dusky based on the available
information that they had,'' said Avise. ``In hindsight, it may have
been questionable as to whether the distinctiveness of that
population was sufficiently great to have warranted the attention
that it received.''
   Elizabeth Lipscomb, a Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman, said
experts with the federal agency are familiar with Avise's study but
believe ``it's a little preliminary to consider the dusky to not be
a subspecies because it (genetic research) is such a new
technique.'' She said the agency has ``delisted'' dusky, which she
said means the bird is considered a distinct and extinct subspecies.
   Avise said the efforts to save the dusky were based on the
existing classification, or taxonomy, of the bird.
   ``Many of those taxonomies were erected back the last century or
early in this century on sometimes very questionable, very limited
data bases,'' he said. If genetic relationships had been established
using modern molecular science, the dusky probably would not have
been identified as a subspecies and ``it probably would not have
been given any special consideration,'' said Avise.
   Avise and a colleague, William S. Nelson, report in this week's
journal Science that they compared the pattern of 11 genetic markers
in the dusky seaside sparrow with the pattern found in five other
seaside sparrow subspecies.
   The research showed, the report said, that the dusky had
essentially no difference in evolutionary history and genetic
pattern than ``other Atlantic coast populations of ammondramus
maritimus (seaside sparrow).''
   Based on the genetic pattern comparison, the study said, the last
dusky seaside sparrow ``appears to have been a routine example of
the Atlantic coast phylad of seaside sparrow.''
   Cape Canaveral in Florida was the only known natural habitat for
the dusky seaside sparrow. The bird was numerous until the 1940s
when spraying for mosquitoes and draining of swampland led to its
decline. At one point, a 5,000-acre reserve, costing $3 million, was
purchased in an effort to save the dusky.
   The last five dusky seaside sparrows, all males, were captured
several years ago and taken to a refuge on Discovery Island in Walt
Disney World. The last of these birds died last June.

<HEAD>Officials Blame Thallium Poisoning For Children's Hair Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thallium poisoning, possibly from acid rain, caused
the mysterious hair loss suffered by 150 children under the age of
14 in a Ukrainian city near the Romanian border, Tass on Tuesday
quoted officials as saying.
   But three months after the initial reports, the Ukrainian Health
Ministry is still unable to calm parents in Chernovtsy because it
has been unable to determine where the thallium came from, the
official news agency reported.
   The toxic metal has polluted the air and soil in the area since
July, and children have lost hair and suffered mild nervous and
mental problems such as irritation and hallucinations, Tass said.
   Four children remain under treatment, two at the Kiev Institute
of Pediarics and two in a sanatorium near Kiev, Tass said.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said in November that
authorities suspected thallium as the cause of the children's
ailment. Soviet media speculated that contaminated gasoline or acid
rain created by a Romanian chemical plant might be at fault.
   Chernovtsy authorities are trying to reduce the amount of
thallium in the air and soil by regularly washing downtown streets,
allowing only local drivers into the city center and banning all
traffic one day a week, Tass said.
   In addition, all children in the city aged 5 to 14 will be sent
to sanatoriums and ``pioneer camps'' during summer vacation.
   Thallium, a rare, poisonous, bluish-white, soft metallic element,
is used in antiknock compounds, photoelectric cells, rat poisons and
other products.

<HEAD>Dukakis Friends Surprised at Kitty's Alcohol Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends of Kitty Dukakis said Tuesday that despite
the blow of her husband's presidential loss and her past problems
with diet pill addiction, they were shocked to learn of her sudden
drinking problem.
   ``I was very surprised,'' said Philip Johnston, the state's Human
Services secretary and a longtime friend of Kitty and Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis.
   ``I feel very close to her,'' Johnston said. ``I think she's a
very giving person. She's very interested in other people _ warm,
giving and, I guess, vulnerable.''
   Bonnie Shershow, an aide to Mrs. Dukakis who traveled extensively
with her during the presidential campaign and has stayed close since
the election, said there were ``absolutely'' no signs of problem
drinking before Nov. 8.
   Shershow blamed the dramatic change in lifestyle that accompanied
her husband's defeat by George Bush.
   ``I think that after a year and a half of a totally full schedule
_ 18 hours a day or more _ to go to none, was very difficult,''
Shershow said.
   ``I'm surprised, I really am,'' said Marilyn Chase, who was Mrs.
Dukakis' chief of staff for the campaign. ``There wasn't any
indication of that during the campaign.''
   Chase and others said the governor's wife had an occasional
social drink while traveling. ``But there was nothing excessive,''
Chase said. ``I probably had more to drink than she did.''
   Dukakis himself, who has kept up his all-business demeanor since
the election, stuck to his public schedule after taking his wife to
the Edgehill Newport alcohol treatment center Sunday evening for the
start of a 30-day stay that will cost $7,200. The Dukakises spoke by
telephone Monday, but the governor was in his Statehouse office
Tuesday.
   At an afternoon news conference, the governor was asked whether,
in light of the defeat's effect on his wife, he would have done
anything different in the running of his campaign.
   ``No,'' he said at first. But then he added: ``I'd run to win.
And she'd probably be feeling better.''
   After the election, by all outward appearances, Mrs. Dukakis was
settling back into her role as the governor's wife and coping with
defeat in the campaign for the White House _ an office Mrs. Dukakis
was known to have pushed her husband to seek.
   Just last week, she greeted the birth of her first grandchild, a
healthy baby girl born after a difficult pregnancy.
   Then came the revelation Monday in a statement by the governor
that Kitty had used alcohol to excess _ always at home, never in
public _ on a number of occasions since the election.
   Dukakis and his wife have long fascinated Massachusetts voters by
their contrasts: between his frugality and her taste in clothes,
between his emotional discipline and her mercurial temperament,
between his sometimes righteous self-control and her chronic
addiction to cigarettes.
   In July 1987, Mrs. Dukakis announced that she had recovered five
years earlier from a 26-year dependency on amphetamines that she
took to control her weight. The governor's wife said she had
conquered her addiction, which she hid from her husband, after
undergoing treatment at a Minnesota facility.
   According to some friends and associates, Mrs. Dukakis was
committed to the presidential race before her husband and may have
wanted the White House more than he did. Now, it appears that she
took the defeat harder than her husband.
   On the day after the election, the governor took the trolley to
the Statehouse and plunged into a deskful of paperwork. He waited
weeks to take time off.
   At the Statehouse on Tuesday, the Dukakises ``received dozens of
phone calls and telegrams, of a private nature, all of them
expressing support and concern,'' Dukakis spokeswoman Susan Kaplan
said.

<HEAD>Pakistani Says Nation Won't Build A-Bomb</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan's ambassador to the United States said
Tuesday his nation is on the threshold of developing nuclear weapons
but does not intend to build them, preferring to seek accord with
neighboring India.
   ``It is right to say that we are one of the `threshold' states,''
said Ambassador Jamsheed K.A. Marker in what appeared to be the most
explicit acknowledgement to date that Pakistan is moving ahead on
its nuclear weapons program and could develop the bomb if it chose.
   ``We have deliberately chosen not to take the final step, to
build a bomb and test it, because we don't think it is right,''
Marker said in an interview on the program, ``American Interests,''
produced by public broadcasting stations WETA-TV of Washington and
WNET-TV of New York. The interview is to be broadcast this weekend.
   Marker's description of the Pakistani program differed from past
statements by officials of his government. A press release from the
Pakistani Embassy last Thursday, for example, said emphasized what
it called ``the peaceful nature of Pakistan's nuclear program,'' and
did not use such phrases as ``threshold states,'' or ``final step,''
or even acknowledge the existence of a military nuclear program.
   U.S. observers were uncertain how to interpret Marker's comments.
State Department, non-government and foreign diplomatic experts said
they did not believe Marker had intended to go beyond statements
made in December by Pakistani Prime Benazir Bhutto that Pakistan had
a purely peaceful nuclear program.
   ``If it is a new formulation of the Pakistani position, it would
be significant at this moment,'' said Leonard Spector, an expert at
the Carnegie Endowment who closely follows proliferation issues.
   ``I would say it is a surprising statement,'' said Spector. ``I
would say it was a slip of the tongue rather than a new policy.''
   Bhutto and her Indian counterpart, Rajiv Ghandi, met in Islamabad
Dec. 31 and signed an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear
facilities, viewed as a possible first step to a regional
non-proliferation accord.
   Neither Pakistan nor India have signed the 1968 Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and they have fought three wars since
achieving independence from Britain in 1947.
   A knowledgeable diplomatic source said Marker had not intended to
go beyond Bhutto's formulation.
   ``What he meant to say was the capability was there,'' said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. ``It
was in the form of questions and answer, so it may have given the
impression that he went further'' than Bhutto.
   Pakistan wants to make sure it receives the same treatment in the
international community as India, which claims not to have an atomic
arsenal but exploded what it called a peaceful nuclear device in
1974.
   ``To us, it sounded like a bomb,'' said Marker. ``We are
exercising our nuclear option. We will not remove this option until
we get assurances of equality.''
   Marker also said he was confident that Pakistan would be
certified as a non-nuclear nation by the Bush administration, a
requirement Congress has set before it will allow that nation to
receive further military assistance.

   Few members of Congress spoke out for raising
their pay Tuesday as the proposal was soundly defeated, but one who
did presented his argument in human terms that won a large round of
applause.
   ``You know how hard you work and you shouldn't be embarrassed to
say it,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., told the House before it
voted 380-48 to reject the 51 percent raise and the Senate followed
suit, 94-6.
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee reminded
colleagues, ``The hardest thing you do is tell your families that
they must sacrifice year in and year out.''
   ``Sure there are perquisites that come with the job,'' he said,
his voice rising. ``But you know as well as I do that perks can't
make up for the birthdays, ball games, holidays and meals that we
miss. When was the last time you skipped a town meeting for a school
play? If you can't remember, ask your spouse.
   ``You maintain two households but you're never home.''
   The House majority whip, Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said
Congress was ``engaged in an action that is surely self-defeating.''
   By not taking the raise and coupling the increase with
eliminating honoraria, Coelho said, Congress would continue ``a
system of compensation that revolves around special interest money.
This is no victory. It is a loss for the concept of leadership.''
   ``The score is easy to read: Ralph Nader 1, national interest
0,'' Coelho added, referring to the consumer advocate who was an
outspoken opponent of the raise, which had been proposed by a
presidential commission and supported both by Ronald Reagan and
President Bush.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., joined other speakers in
predicting that federal executives and judges would leave federal
service without more money.
   Countering arguments that judicial candidates are waiting in line
to be nominated, Early said, ``Our concern should be who's in line.''
   He criticized colleagues for making re-election ``more important
in this House than anything else.'' The most important thing, he
said, is ``long-range good government.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., introduced the resolution to reject the
raise but said he did so only to ``face reality.'' He then voted
against his own rejection resolution.
   He said that despite support from Common Cause, the self-styled
citizens' lobby, ``We fell prey to the deception of the rabble
rousers. We became cartoon cannon fodder for trash television and
talk radio.''
   He added, ``There are Supreme Court justices who make less than
their clerks the day after they (the clerks) retire and go into
private practice.''

   Japan's stock-profiteering scandal claimed another
casualty Tuesday, a leading opposition leader, and other government
opponents hope his resignation will hasten the fall of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's government.
   Saburo Tsukamoto stepped down as chairman of the Democratic
Socialist Party. He was the only one of four opposition members
linked to the scandal who had refused to step down.
   His departure opens the way for the opposition to unite and renew
demands for Takeshita and his entire Cabinet to resign when
Parliament convenes Friday.
   Many influential politicians and business leaders were offered
cheap, unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate
subsidiary of the information-based conglomerate Recruit Co.
   Shares rocketed in value immediately after they were offered for
public trading in October 1986. Tsukamoto admitted in December that
he earned about $77,000 in the transaction.
   Such lucrative dealings already have led to more than 20
resignations, including those of three Cabinet ministers of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and three other opposition
members.
   The transactions are not illegal, but they have incited public
outrage and raised questions of political ethics.
   Takeshita has denied any knowledge of Recruit stock trading by
his secretary, and has ruled out opposition demands that he resign
and call an early election.
   Instead, he has pledged to restore public trust in politics.
   Tsukamoto also denies wrongdoing. The 61-year-old party chief
resigned only after party elders demanded he take responsibility for
tarnishing the name of the third largest opposition group as it
prepares for a major legislative election in July.
   ``If my resignation can bring gains for the party, I decided it
is better for me to withdraw now,'' said Tsukamoto. The party
   Economist Takashi Ishihara predicted his action will bring
``major political changes.''
   Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic
Development, told reporters he now expects the ruling party to have
difficulty passing the fiscal 1989 budget.
   Keigo Ouchi, secretary-general of the Democratic Socialists, told
reporters Tuesday: ``We have made our position clear in our own
party ... and now we plan to cooperate with other political
parties'' in clearing up the Recruit scandal.
   Takako Doi, chairwoman of the largest opposition Japan Socialist
Party, welcomed Tsukamoto's resignation, saying it would allow the
opposition to join forces to ``question the responsibility of
Takeshita and other ruling party officials'' implicated in the
scandal.
   Tsukamoto, who has served nine terms in the House of
Representatives, will retain his seat in Parliament, where his party
has 29 of the 512 seats.
   He will remain chairman until his party's convention Feb. 22-23,
when a successor will be chosen.

   Barbara Bush has sent a personal note to Kitty
Dukakis and has expressed confidence that the Massachusetts
governor's wife will triumph over her problem with alcohol, a
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The first lady sent the note Monday after the disclosure that
Mrs. Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, was
being treated for alcohol abuse at a clinic in Newport, R.I.
   Mrs. Dukakis' problem was blamed on physical exhaustion, stress
and the letdown from the presidential election in which George Bush
defeated Dukakis.
   Contents of Mrs. Bush's note were not revealed. Her press
secretary, Anna Maria Perez, said Mrs. Bush had commented that ``her
heart goes out to Mrs. Dukakis and that she is a strong woman and
she knows she'll get through it.''

<HEAD>Comptroller Warns Banks Against Accepting Financial Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials on Tuesday warned banks
against accepting benefits from financial management firms in
exchange for placing bank funds in investments sponsored by those
firms.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in a circular sent
to national banks and examiners, said ``a number of national bank
trust departments'' may have accepted incentives from firms that
sponsor mutual funds or other investment funds in return for putting
bank assets in funds offered by the firms.
   It said the incentives appear to have included discounts or
rebates on fees for other services such as accounting and
administrative work, computer goods or services, and seminars and
travel expenses for bank personnel.
   The memo reminded banks that their investment decisions should be
``based exclusively on the best interest of trust customers.''
   It said bank laws prohibit bank trust departments ``from
receiving any financial benefits, including discounts or rebates on
goods or services purchased, or other items of value, in exchange
for investing trust funds in particular investments.''
   ``Trustees must not place themselves in a position where their
judgments concerning the optimal investment for trust accounts may
be influenced by the trustee's receipt of financial benefits for
selecting a particular investment,'' the banking circular said.
   The comptroller said banks that accept prohibited financial
benefits may be subject to ``significant liability'' for breaching
their duty and to enforcement action by the comptroller's office and
may be required to provide reimbursement for the benefits.

<TEXT>
   While House Speaker Jim Wright rapped
his gavel in Washington for a vote rejecting the congessional pay
raise, some of his constituents in Texas were sounding off against
the man they put in office.
   Calls by Fort Worth residents to a KLIF-AM radio talk show
Tuesday were highly critical of Wright's handling of the proposed
increase. The callers were not required to identify themselves, and
few did.
   ``I'm very disgusted in Jim Wright,'' said one caller. ``... I'm
going to work as hard as I can to get him out of office.''
   Another caller told listeners: ``If there's someone running
against him (Wright) who has some decent qualifications, there's no
doubt that I would probably think twice about voting for Jim
Wright.''
   Wright had planned to let the $45,500 increase take effect
automatically on Wednesday without a vote in the House. But pressure
from his colleagues and public outrage finally forced his hand, and
on Tuesday the pay raise was overwhelmingly voted down.
   Some callers to the radio show were disturbed that Wright was not
explaining his position to them.
   ``I really feel that Jim Wright's opinion of my opinion doesn't
amount to a bucket of warm spit,'' a caller said. ``I wrote him; I
sent him a tea bag; I called his office. And, so far, I've gotten
two copies of the same letter saying he wasn't going to do
anything.''
   Wright told the Fort Worth Star Telegram on Jan. 26 that he
expected to be ridiculed for some of his decisions.
   ``The speaker is supposed to take some heat. If you're a leader
in an institution, you're expected to be a lightning rod. ... I'm
doing the best I can to put it in perspective. Sometimes that is
difficult for a congressional leader.''
   Letters to the Star Telegram's opinion-editorial page over the
past few days have said Wright has lost sight of what his job should
be in Washington.
   Kester M. Hearn of Fort Worth wrote in a letter published Sunday:
``Speaker Jim Wright is preventing members of Congress from being
representatives by denying them a right to vote on the raise.
Therefore he must be opposed to representative government. ... he
should quit posing as a representative and come home.''
   Wright has enjoyed tremendous support over the years from voters
in his home district. In November he was elected to an 18th term
without opposition, despite being the subject of an ethics
investigation by his House colleagues.

<TEXT>
   National drug director-designate William J.
Bennett told the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Tuesday the war on
drugs is ``emphatically the business of the federal government,''
not just the states and cities.
   ``I don't have any ambiguity about the federal role in the war on
drugs,'' said Bennett, who, as education secretary under former
President Reagan, argued that schools were chiefly the
responsibility of state and local authorities.
   ``This is serious business,'' he said. ``This is the business of
state and local governments. But it is emphatically the business of
the federal government.''
   The gathering of mayors _ including several who asked
specifically for federal money to be granted directly to local
governments to help fight drugs _ applauded Bennett's remarks.
   But Bennett didn't say how much money he intends to try to
provide to local authorities.
   Questioned later, Bennett said budget decisions will have to wait
until he completes a national drug control strategy report. It is
due six months after he is confirmed by the Senate as director of
National Drug Control Policy.
   ``Certainly some of the effort is going to take money. ... You're
going to see some progress and some movement on this issue very
soon. The six-month report is the critical document to me.''
   He told the mayors the report ``will be straight. As secretary of
education, I played it straight, called them as I saw them. I will
call this as I see it. There will be no politics in this report.''
   The mayors are extremely worried about money because while the
drug bill called for $275 million to be spent for Justice Assistance
programs _ grants to state and local agencies _ in the current
fiscal year, only $220 million has been appropriated by Congress.
   Reagan's budget proposal for fiscal 1990 proposed no money for
justice assistance, although the drug bill called for $350 million.
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House
subcommittee on crime, told the mayors that while Congress has
passed a lot of legislation, ``What we really have not done is we
have not funded the programs realistically. ...
   ``We have to get our fiscal house in order so we can
realistically fund programs like the Justice Assistance programs so
that we are once again full partners with state and local units of
government. ... That's where the battle takes place. Ninety percent
of our enforcement takes place at the state and local level.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee who fought for creation of a drug czar position for eight
years, told the mayors, ``It's about time we stop kidding the
American people ... about what we will be able to do legislatively
to end this problem. ... We have enough laws at the federal level.
We have to see if they work.''
   Biden said the drug bill could be fully funded by raising taxes
on cigarettes, beer and liquor, saying, ``We're still 60 percent
behind what the tax was in 1954 on those commodities. ... If you
have a better idea, suggest it, or stop saying you support the drug
bill.''
   He predicted that Congress would fully fund the drug bill,
approving legislation already introduced in both houses to add $1.6
billion to this year's spending. The bills do not specify how to pay
for that spending.
   Bennett said he will pay attention to the law enforcement end of
the drug war but, ``In the end, in the real long run, this is a
question of values. ...
   ``It's asking an awful lot in moral courage to ask a 13-year-old
to give up what he's been hearing for a large part of his 13 years
is the good life, material goods, money, cars, clothes,'' he said.
   Bennett said Bush ``is serious about this. It's his number one
priority.''

   East and West should discard past conflicts and
work toward a united Europe, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
told EEC representatives on Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze met with diplomats of the 12 nations of the European
Economic Community, with which the Soviets established formal
relations last summer.
   ``There are no issues that are beyond the interests of Europe,''
Shevardnadze was quoted as saying by the official news agency Tass.
   He said the goal should be ``unity of European peoples, of all
countries that participate in the all-European process toward the
establishment of moral and legal principles that would be common for
all.''
   ``Today we're beginning to do what we should have done
yesterday,'' he said. ``To make up for the lost time we will have to
act in a resolute way, make vigorous strides and get rid of the
burden of the past.
   ``Although the integration in the East and West of Europe is
based on economic processes, both we and you feel that rapprochement
can be achieved through adding dynamism to the political dialogue.''
   Shevardnadze said discussions should address ``prospects for
Europe's participation in the life of the international community .
.. efficient participation in efforts to solve global problems, such
as poverty or ecoological degradation, and heal the bleeding wounds
of regional conflicts.''
   The 12 Common Market members are Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain and West Germany.

   Rightist political leader
Roberto D'Abuisson on Tuesday denied the government's renewed charge
that he masterminded the 1980 assassination of Roman Catholic
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero.
   ``I have put up with the basest slanders for eight years, and God
and my conscience know that I had nothing to do with this
reprehensible assassination,'' he was quoted in an interview
published Tuesday in the daily La Prensa Grafica.
   D'Abuisson said the Christian Democratic administration revived
the accusation as a political maneuver before the March 19
presidential election. D'Abuisson is founder of the rightist
National Republican Alliance, known as Arena, leads the Christian
Democrats in recent polls.
   The government long has said D'Abuisson was the architect of the
assassination but never cited any specific evidence backing up the
charge.
   On Sunday, a government television program said a commission
investigating Romero's death identified the gunman as Hector Antonio
Regalado.
   Regalado, a dentist, was security chief for the Legislative
Assembly when D'Abuisson was assembly speaker. News reports have
linked Regalado to the death squads D'Abuisson has been accused of
organizing. D'Abuisson also denies any role in the death squads.
   Romero, an outspoken critic of death squad activity and human
rights abuses by the military, was killed by a lone marksman as he
was saying Mass in a chapel in the capital on March 24, 1980.
   Nobody has been held in the slaying, and Regalado's whereabouts
were not immediately known.
   The commission said Amado Antonio Garay, the driver for a former
army captain, Alvaro Saravia, identified Regalado from photographs
as the gunman.
   Garay said Saravia was the other passsenger on the day of the
shooting and described D'Abuisson as the mastermind of the
assassination.
   Saravia was arrested on immigration charges in Miami in 1987, and
the Salvadoran government requested his extradition.
   But the Salvadoran Supreme Court in December overturned the
extradition request before Saravia could be returned to El Salvador,
saying testimony linking him to the assassination was not credible.
   Saravia, 46, was released last month from a Miami jail and lives
in the Miami suburb of Kendall. His attorney says he is seeking
political asylum.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
commission's ``announcement may reflect the Salvadoran government's
deep frustration with the failure of the judicial system to
prosecute this notorious and longstanding case.''
   ``In light of the Salvadoran Supreme Court action in withdrawing
the extradition warrant for ex-Capt. Saravia in December _ he was a
potential witness in the case _ the government of El Salvador,
through its Minister of Justice, has evidently decided to make the
facts known to the public,'' he said.
   Redman said the United States believed the Salvadoran Supreme
Court made a ``serious'' error.
   ``If that extradition warrant had been allowed to proceed, the
government of El Salvador could have obtained critical information
by which to prosecute this case. We would hope that all leads would
be investigated in this case in order to finally bring to justice
those accused of committing this crime.''
   D'Abuisson is a legislator, which gives him immunity from
prosecution.

<HEAD>Olney Wins Seventh Straight In Annual Pancake Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A gym instructor who trained on a Welsh
mountainside bested an aerobics teacher Tuesday in the annual Shrove
Tuesday pancake race, keeping the championship in English hands for
the seventh consecutive year.
   Lesley Byrne, 26, of Olney, England, ran her hometown, 415-yard
course, carrying a frying pan with a pancake, in 62 seconds. On the
Kansas course, Donetta Schindler, 23, won with a time of 65.91
seconds.
   Mrs. Byrne, who also won last year, said she trained by running
down the highest mountain in the Snowdonia range, the 3,560-foot
Snowdon in northern Wales.
   ``I'm thrilled to have won but I think the wind stopped me from
breaking the record,'' she said. ``My legs feel really bad. I
thought I was fitter because I'd been training. I'll be coming back
next year to try for the hat-trick (three wins).''
   Mrs. Schindler passed 14 competitors in Liberal.
   ``I felt like I was in good position,'' said Mrs. Schindler, a
former star tennis player at Liberal High School. ``I was ready for
it, but I had not trained that much.''
   Most of her training for the race, which she was running for the
first time, came from her job, she said.
   Mrs. Schindler's sister, Sheila Turner, set the record for the
Liberal pancake race in 1975 with a time of 58.5 seconds. The Olney
record is 59.8 seconds.
   According to legend, the race has been run in Olney since 1445,
when a harassed housewife dashed to church on Shrove Tuesday still
clutching her frying pan with a pancake in it. Others say pancakes
may have been a form of bribe to the bellringer to ring the bell
sooner to signal the beginning of the feast day celebrations.
   After a lapse during World War II, Olney revived the race in
1948. Two years later, the women of Liberal in southwest Kansas
challenged the English to see who could come up with the best time.
   Liberal won nine straight in the 1970s to build up a 19-13 lead,
but Olney now holds the edge at 20-19.
   After Tuesday's race in Liberal was finished shortly after noon,
officials here telephoned England with the results, and the winners
exchanged congratulations.
   About 1,000 spectators turned out for the Liberal race, in spite
of the temperature of around 20 degrees.
   The weather at Olney, 50 miles northwest of London, was sunny
with temperatures in the mid 50s, and about 2,500 spectators turned
out.
   Second place in Liberal was won by Lori Sharp, who led the 1988
race before falling in the final yards. ``I'm just happy to finish
the race this year standing up,'' Mrs. Sharp said.
   Runners in both races wore the traditional garb of skirt, apron
and headscarf. The winners exchange inscribed silver trays from the
two towns and other prizes.

   Nursing hangovers and sore feet,
Brazilians and tourists Tuesday reveled in a final round of Brazil's
world-famous carnival _ four days of practically non-stop dancing,
partying and seemingly endless parades.
   Throughout Latin America's largest country, from the steamy
Amazon to the concrete jungles of industrial Sao Paulo, people shed
their inhibitions and clothes to dance in the streets and in private
clubs to the rhythmic and almost hypnotic beat of samba drums.
   The merrymaking will continue through noon on Ash Wednesday, when
Carnival officially ends and stores, banks and government offices
reopen.
   Police in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil's two most
important cities, were still compiling crime rate figures but
reported that this year's carnival was mostly peaceful.
   As usual, the most lavish, unrestrained and colorful partying
took place in Rio de Janeiro which once again hosted a spectacular
parade of ``samba schools,'' actually neighborhood groups from poor
and mainly black districts.
   For hours on end, from Sunday to Tuesday, tens of thousands of
cheering spectators watched these schools march down the city's
brightly lit ``sambadrome,'' a parade ground flanked by huge
concrete grandstands.
   The ``schools'' of up to 4,000 members each work the whole year
on their colorful costumes and floats and rehearse the original
lyrics and dance steps for the big parade.
   The parades always have a strong dose of eroticism as beautiful
women, either barebreasted or scantily clad in string bikinis dance
exuberantly along the parade route or on top of the floats.
   Along Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches
Brazilians and foreigners danced to the throbbing beat of impromptu
samba bands and occasionally took a dip in the ocean.
   The wealthy partied in private clubs that threw wild and
glittering balls in which feathers or strings of beads passed as
costumes.
   More than 1,000 miles northeast of Rio, the pre-Lenten holiday
was also celebrated with the same exuberance in the cities of
Salvador and Recife _ the country's two other popular carnival
centers.
   In Salvador, thousands took to the streets to dance behind
specially built sound trucks that roamed the city blaring out
carnival music. In Recife, large crowds danced behind 10-foot-high
papier mache dolls as cups of ``cachaca,'' a potent rum-like drink,
were handed out from trucks.

   Michael Jackson thrilled hundreds of
youngsters Tuesday in a lightning visit to Cleveland Elementary
School, where five students were killed and 30 injured by a demented
drifter armed with a rifle.
   ``I think they'll remember this for a long time,'' said Stockton
Unified School District spokesman John Klose.
   Later, the entertainer paid a brief visit to San Joaquin General
Hospital, where two young victims of the attack are still being
treated.
   Hundreds of people gathered outside the school hoping to spot the
pop superstar, but he was whisked into a rear entrance in a
limousine and left the same way after about 20 minutes inside.
   He visited classrooms where kindergarten, first-, second- and
third-grade students were gathered, then dropped in on an assembly
of fourth- through sixth-graders. No reporters or photographers were
allowed to watch as Jackson met with the youngsters.
   ``He just smiled and that's it,'' said 6-year-old Lanisha, who
said she couldn't remember her last name. ``And then he left.''
   Hannah Schardt, 11, of Stockton, attends another school but came
with her mother to see Jackson.
   ``He just made a peace sign and left right away after about five
seconds,'' she said. ``He just kind of said `Hi' and nodded.''
   Barbara Knox of Stockton brought her 2-year-old son, Xzavier,
``to see Michael Jackson, to get a glimpse of him, his hair, his
glove, it doesn't matter.''
   Jackson, wearing a dark military-style jacket with red epaulets,
spent a few minutes at the hospital with Vann Sa, 7, and Long Keo, 6.
   ``It was not what I would call a dialogue,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Sharon Booker. ``It was an appearance. But five to seven
minutes with Michael Jackson _ what can you compare it to?''
   ``He was very warm, very pleasant with the children,'' said
Booker. ``They were very excited to see him.''
   Booker said Vann Sa would remain in the hospital for another week
or so; Long Keo was scheduled to be released Wednesday.
   Monday night, the Stockton City Council voted 9-0 for an
ordinance outlawing the possession or sale inside the city limits of
assault rifles like the Soviet-designed AK-47 that Patrick Edward
Purdy used to attack the school on Jan. 17 before when he killed
himself. The Los Angeles City Council voted likewise Tuesday.
   The Stockton ordinance is a misdemeanor carrying only a $500 fine
and a maximum of six months in jail, maximum penalties for a city
ordinance. It takes effect in seven days, after which any
semiautomatic weapon found in the city would be confiscated as
contraband and destroyed. Opponents said they would try to have the
ban overturned.

<TEXT>
   The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to
ban sales and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47
rifle used to kill five schoolchildren in Stockton last month.
   Holding aloft an Uzi rifle, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said,
``There is absolutely no reason why anyone should own one of these.
We are talking about offensive weapons of war.''
   After a noisy hour-long discussion by council members and the
public, many of them gun owners who opposed the measure, the council
voted 12-0 for the ban.
   Violators of the ordinance will face up to six months in jail and
a fine of up to $1,000. The ordinance applies to any semiautomatic
rifle that holds 20 or more rounds or a semiautomatic shotgun that
can be fired more than six times.
   The measure was effective immediately. Owners of such guns have
15 days to get rid of the firearms or make them inoperable.
   Mayor Tom Bradley, calling the weapons ``tools of murder and
mayhem whose sole purpose is killing human beings,'' promptly signed
the measure into law.
   More than 100 people opposing the ordinance booed those speaking
in favor of it, forcing Councilman Marvin Braude to demand quiet in
council chambers several times.
   Robert Cleaves of Los Angeles said violent crime will not be
stopped by banning military look-alike weapons, while citizen Robert
Kahn contended the law would target law-abiding citizens instead of
criminals.
   Some questioned the constitutionality of the law. But City
Attorney James Hahn said he believed it was constitutional, saying
it was ``insane to have ever allowed these weapons to have been
sold.''
   Yaroslavsky, the sponsor of the ordinance, said he believed that
Los Angeles would be only one of many cities in the area to ban
semiautomatic AK-47s, Uzis, and similar weapons.
   Indeed, County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn announced Tuesday he will
introduce an ordinance next week to make private ownership of
assault rifles illegal in Los Angeles County.
   The action follows a moves by Councilman Nate Holden, who last
month began paying people up to $300 per gun to turn in the rifles.
Holden is challenging Bradley in the April 11 mayoral election.
   Outcry against assault rifles has been strong since the Jan. 17
massacre in Stockton, where a drifter sprayed a school playground
with more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic version of an AK-47,
killing five children.
   Former President Reagan said Monday that the weapons should be
outlawed because they are not intended for hunting or protecting a
home.
   The Stockton City Council on Monday unanimously adopted an
ordinance banning assault rifles, despite protests from gun owners
who packed a meeting to argue that the ban was unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Government Plans To Ban Sale Of Human Organs For Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will ban the sale of human organs for
transplants, the government announced Tuesday after controversy over
the sales of kidneys by poor people in Turkey.
   Health minister Roger Freeman described the sale of human organs
as ``abhorrent and absolutely disgusting.''
   ``We are considering very urgently the need for legislation. We
are working on a draft bill. ... We take this very seriously and we
want to move quickly,'' Freeman said.
   Within hours, the private Humana Wellington Hospital in north
London, where kidney-for-sale transplants reportedly took place,
said it was suspending the kidney transplants. It denied it was
involved in payment to kidney donors.
   Ronald Hytoff, the hospital's executive director, said he looked
forward to legislation to ban the sale of transplant organs and to
official guidelines on transplants. He said hospital policy was to
use only organs from relatives.
   Investigations into the organ sales are being conducted by the
Department of Health and the profession's disciplinary body, the
General Medical Council, following news reports that a Turkish
organization had arranged the sale of kidneys.
   The Turkish press carried advertisements for donors, the reports
said.
   A West German businessman. Rainer Rebe Count Adelmann van
Adlemannsfelden, said on a British TV program on Jan. 28 that he
earned $8,650 for every organ deal he arranged abroad and he
expected to sell nearly 100 kidneys in 12 months.

<TEXT>
   Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg
swallowed barbiturates to ease an upset stomach, a friend said
Tuesday, but a news agency reported the retired Swedish tennis
player apparently had attempted suicide.
   Borg, 32, was hospitalized at Milan Polyclinic for three hours
Tuesday before he returned with his Italian fiancee, rock singer
Loredana Berte, to her apartment.
   The ANSA news agency said initial police investigations indicated
Borg had tried to commit suicide but that it could not get official
confirmation of its report.
   Borg's personal adviser said he had taken barbiturates after
becoming nauseous, and another friend said Borg had been stricken by
food poisoning.
   ``I'm fine, it's all over,'' Borg told reporters outside the
apartment.
   ``Go away all of you,'' snapped Ms. Berte, 41, before slamming
the door.
   During the drive from the hospital, a photographer gave chase on
foot and bumped into the couple's taxi, prompting the driver to get
out and slap him.
   Tuesday night, at around 10:30 p.m., Borg and Ms. Berte left the
apartment in a taxi with a police escort driving at high speed, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported. It was not immediately known
where they were headed.
   Hospital officials confirmed that Borg had been treated, but
refused to give any details.
   ANSA quoted unidentified hospital sources as saying Borg
apparently had swallowed about 10 pills.
   Mara Savastano, a friend of the couple, said the singer told her
that Borg had suffered from food poisoning.
   Ingmar Alverdal, Borg's personal adviser, told the Swedish
national news agency TT that Borg took barbiturates to fall asleep
after he became sickened while dining at a restaurant Monday.
   ``But his nausea got worse and in the morning, on doctors'
advice, (he) went to hospital,'' Alverdal said. He added that he
made the statement at Borg's request.
   Borg retired from tournament play in 1983 at the age of 27. He
now runs a fashion business and acts as a tourism ambassador for
Sweden.
   Borg and Ms. Berte recently announced they would be married Feb.
26 in Milan. According to recent Italian newspaper reports, however,
the date was put off because Ms. Berte's divorce from an
industrialist, Roberto Berger, has not yet come through.
   Borg previously was married to Romanian-born tennis player
Mariana Simonescu. After divorcing in 1983, Borg began seeing
17-year-old Swedish beauty queen Jannike Bjorling. They never
married but have a son, Robin, 3.
   Borg and Ms. Berte, a throaty-voiced singer whose recent hits
include ``American Angel,'' have been together since last summer.
They recently were photographed together on a trip to China.
   In an interview published Monday in the Stockholm tabloid
Aftonbladet, Ms. Bjorling said Borg had trouble with women.
   ``No woman can fulfill Bjorn's fantasies,'' she was quoted as
saying. ``Now we'll see if Loredana can do it. ... Bjorn is a twin.
A twin has two sides _ like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He's two
persons.''
   The article said Borg was considering demanding custody of his
son if he moved abroad with Ms. Berte.
   Borg was reported to have amassed $75 million in winnings and
endorsements during his tennis career. He lived for 11 years in
Monte Carlo to avoid Swedish taxes, among the world's highest, but
returned to Sweden in 1985.
   Borg beat Ilie Nastase in the Wimbledon final in 1976 to become
the first Scandanavian to win there. The victory was his first of
five on the grass courts of the tennis classic.
   He won the French Open six times, in 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980
and 1981.
   Borg never won, or made the finals, in the Australian Open. He
also never won the U.S. Open, losing four times in the finals.
   He was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.

   Almost anything can start a fight in
Lebanon, and on Tuesday soldiers and Christian militiamen thrashed
each other with ski poles over who had first crack at the lift to
the slopes north of Beirut.
   Military sources said 13 people were injured and the argument was
not political.
   One said an officer of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian
militia, and his escort tried to jump the ski-lift line at Oyoun
el-Siman, a resort town in the Christian heartland 25 miles
northeast of the capital.
   Warnings were shouted, and when the militiamen ignored them ``the
quarrel erupted,'' the source said. ``Soldiers and militiamen hit
each other with ski poles without using any firearms.''
   It was the first direct confrontation between Christian soldiers
and members of the militia in a 14-year-old sectarian war that has
seen innumerable bloody battles between, and among, Moslem and
Christian groups.
   The source, who spoke anonymously like the others, said the
dust-up was ``spontaneous, with no political significance,'' and was
``quickly contained after urgent contacts between the commands of
the two sides.''
   Sources at the Lebanese Forces command described it as
insignficant.
   Members of the Lebanese Forces, which has about 6,000 fighters,
control Christian urban centers outside east Beirut, the capital's
Christian sector. About 20,000 army troopers control the Christian
countryside.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Says Region's Foreign Ministers to Ask for U.N. Inspectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Central American nations intend to ask
the United Nations on Wednesday to send inspectors on surprise
visits to guarantee that none of the five subverts a neighbor, said
Nicaragua's foreign minister.
   The minister, Miguel d'Escoto, said Tuesday that he and the
foreign ministers of Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and El Salvador
reached basic agreement on the inspection plan when they met for
presidential inaugurations in Mexico in December and Venezuela last
week.
   The ministers agreed that the unarmed civilian inspectors would
be from Spain, Canada and West Germany, said a source close to the
talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The five will meet Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Wednesday, and d'Escoto said he was optimistic their agreement on
the plan would hold up.
   The presidents of the five nations sent a letter to Perez de
Cuellar last month proposing the inspection team. He asked for
details so the foreign ministers decided to meet in New York to
speed the process, said d'Escoto.
   He said he could not disclose the details until after all five
ministers present the proposal and Perez de Cuellar makes his
recommendations.
   The inspectors would check allegations that one nation was
harboring rebels from another nation or supporting a rebellion,
which is banned under Central American peace accords signed on Aug.
7, 1987.
   On Monday evening, d'Escoto suggested a small force, possibly 10
inspectors in each of the five capitals.
   ``They would have to have access to every single part of the
country, and they would have to be able to visit every place without
prior notification,'' d'Escoto said then. ``The element of surprise
is essential here.''
   The plan evolved from recommendations made by a joint
U.N.-Organization of American States technical mission that visited
Central America in late 1987.
   Honduras, which blocked accord on the plan at that time by
refusing to allow inspections of military sites, now agrees on a
plan to ask the secretary-general to set up the inspection teams,
said d'Escoto.
   Honduras is a key U.S. ally where U.S.-supported Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras, have bases to launch raids into
neighboring Nicaragua.
   The Contras have faded as a military force since Congress cut off
funding for weapons. Some observers believe Honduras would like to
get them out of the country so Nicaragua is not tempted to send in
its superior military forces to mop up the Contra bases.
   The foreign ministers will hold talks Wednesday and Thursday to
prepare for a summit by their five presidents in El Salvador next
Monday and Tuesday.
   The ministers will also try to work out an agreement for
monitoring the second part of the peace accords calling for
democratization and political reforms.
   D'Escoto said Nicaragua would propose an immediate regional open
door policy, in which the five nations would invite in the OAS,
United Nations, Amnesty International, the International Red Cross
and other agencies to monitor human rights.
   The Inter-American Human Rights Commission would be responsible
for verifying compliance that human, civil and social rights were
not abused; the U.N. Working Group on Forced and Involuntary
Disappearances would check on ``disappeared'' people; and OAS and
U.N. observers would monitor elections in the region, under the
Nicaragua-sponsored plan.
   Nicaraguan presidential elections are due in November 1990, and
the Contras are expected to field candidates, said d'Escoto. He said
he did not know if President Daniel Ortega would run for re-election.
   D'Escoto also called on the United States to join the five
Central American nations in an anti-drug treaty.
   ``It would be noble and good and Christian,'' said d'Escoto, who
is also a Roman Catholic priest.
   He had no details, but he said Nicaragua would not object to the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency having an office in Nicaragua.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee Tuesday asked the General
Accounting Office and the government's chief purchasing agent to
investigate charges that federal agencies are restricting their
computer procurements to favor IBM Corp.
   The investigation sought by the House Committee on Government
Operations follows a complaint last November by six IBM competitors
that they effectively have been frozen out of much of the Navy's
multi-billion-dollar computer market.
   The GAO, Congress' watchdog arm, was asked to supply to the
committee within 60 days a broad evaluation of the extent that
federal agencies restrict their procurements to IBM
``code-compatible'' systems.
   Although many of companies offer ``clones'' or duplicates of IBM
systems at lower prices, they complained in a letter to former
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci that Navy procurement officials had
tailored the bid specifications so that only IBM could win.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the panel's chairman, cited
government statistics indicating that IBM currently holds almost 55
percent of the Navy's large-scale computer base, compared with the
company's 37 percent share government-wide.
   ``The computer and telecommunications industry is one of the
fastest growing and most highly compettive segments of the U.S.
economy,'' Conyers said. ``Yet if these allegations are true, Navy
officials have apparently determined that only one company is
capable of meeting their needs.''
   The committee also asked GAO to look in more detail at
code-compatible computer purchases by the Army, the National
Aeronautics Administration and the Health and Human Services and
Housing and Urban Development Departments.
   The General Services Administration, which supervises all
government purchases from vendors, was asked by the committee to
rescind blanket approval of Navy computer purchases less than $10
million and strengthen its oversight.
   Currently, the government requires GSA to approve any purchase
above $2.5 million. But waivers raising the ceiling to $10 million
have been given to some Navy commands.
   With expenditures of some $17.4 billion last year on computer,
communications and data processing equipment and services, the
government is the industry's largest single purchaser.
   ``Faced witrh enormous budget deficits, Congress cannot sit idely
by while agencies needlessly waste scarce taxpayer dollars on
sole-source contracts,'' Conyers said.

   A judge empowered a man Tuesday to authorize
an abortion for his comatose wife in an effort to improve her
chances of recovery, but right-to-life advocates immediately moved
to overturn the decision.
   Three hours after state Supreme Court Justice Bernard McCaffrey
named Martin Klein as his wife's guardian, an appeals court judge
granted two anti-abortionists a stay blocking the ruling until an
appeals panel could review it.
   ``This has been very stressful and very tiring,'' said a
haggard-looking Klein, who had told reporters after the McCaffrey
decision that ``all I want to do is save my wife's life.''
   His wife, Nancy, 32, who is about 17 weeks pregnant, has been in
a coma at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset since a Dec.
13 car accident.
   Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville, sought an abortion for his wife
after some physicians who examined her said an abortion could save
her life and assist in her recovery. The hospital told Klein it
would need a court order to perform the abortion.
   Appellate Division Judge Vincent Balletta Jr. granted the stay to
anti-abortion activists John Short of Farmingdale and John Broderick
of Syosset. The full Appellate Division will rule on the case by the
end of this week, he said.
   Balletta issued the stay despite an appeal from Elizabeth
Bradford of the state attorney general's office on behalf of Klein.
The two activists hope to become legal guardians of both Mrs. Klein
and the fetus to block the abortion.
   ``This case is not an abortion case, it's a guardianship case,''
said Ms. Bradford. ``Clearly, if Mrs. Klein was given the choice of
husband of nine years versus a stranger ... she would opt for her
husband.''
   Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, has labeled the pair
``interlopers in a private family tragedy.''
   Short, the founder of the Long Island Right-To-Life Committee,
said Mrs. Klein was ``closer to delivering a live child. I hope that
five years from now this child will be celebrating its fifth
birthday.''
   Earlier, McCaffrey issued his decision in a courtroom packed with
supporters and opponents of abortion, reporters and relatives.
   Upon hearing the decision, Klein kissed and embraced his wife's
parents, Anne and Frederick Zusselman of Delray Beach, Fla.
   McCaffrey's ruling followed a two-day hearing last week.
   The judge said that, based on medical testimony and records, Mrs.
Klein is incompetent and a guardian should be appointed.
   He gave Klein permission to authorize any medical procedures that
may be necessary to preserve his wife's life, specifically ruling
that Klein is authorized to approve an abortion.
   Five medical experts testified on Klein's behalf that pregnancy
increased the risks for the comatose patient and could possibly
threaten her life. But the Nassau County district attorney produced
medical experts who testified the pregnancy was not life-threatening.
   McCaffrey decided that an abortion was not medically necessary to
save Mrs. Klein's life.
   He noted that if Mrs. Klein were competent, it would be her sole
decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy up to a 24-week
period for any reason without a judicial determination. Under law, a
fetus is considered viable _ meaning it can survive outside the womb
_ after 24 weeks.

   Nicaragua on Tuesday denied
allegations by two men charged in the slaying of a Nicaraguan rebel
leader that its diplomats planned the assassination.
   ``The accusations are ridiculous and completely removed from the
truth,'' said Nicaraguan Embassy spokesman Juan Jose Membrano. ``We
deny all involvement by our embassy in the assassination of the
Contra chief.''
   Manuel Rugama, the rebel commander, was shot and killed Jan. 7.
Luis Fernando Ordonez Reyes, one of the arrested, told an
army-arranged news conference Monday that ``the plan to eliminate
Rugama was prepared by the Nicaraguan Embassy in Tegucigalpa.''
   Rugama, a physician, was a regional commander of the U.S.-backed
rebels known as Contras and had been a rebel for nine years in the
war to bring down the leftist Sandinista government in Managua.
   Officers who found his body, riddled with 26 bullets, said he
apparently was alone when he was shot while driving on a highway
west of the Honduran capital.
   The Contras blamed the Nicaraguan government for Rugama's
slaying, saying he was scheduled to meet with other Contra leaders
that day.
   At the news conference, Ordonez said he introduced Jose de Jesus
Pena, whom he identified as the Nicaraguan Embassy security chief,
to one of his employees, a former police officer named Rigoberto
Matute.
   Ordonez, a Nicaraguan who operated a money exchange in
Tegucigalpa, said Pena often visited his business and paid him
between $500 and $1,500 for information about anti-Sandinista rebels
in Honduras.
   Membrano said the Nicaraguan Embassy has no security chief and
that no one named Jose de Jesus Pena worked there.
   Juan Bautista Nunez, a former detective for the Honduran National
Police, said at the news conference that Matute offered to pay him
$20,000 to help in the killing.
   ``I was the first to fire at Rugama,'' Bautista said. He said
Matute and a third man he knew only by his last name _ Cano Arteaga
_ then joined in killing Rugama.
   Matute, Nunez and Ordonez are being held in the killing. But
there was no indication why Matute did not attend the news
conference.

   Israel on Tuesday defended its treatment of
Palestinians in the face of a U.S. report that criticized Israel for
``many avoidable deaths and injuries'' during the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands.
   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said,
``We are doing our utmost to prevent unnecessary suffering and
bloodshed.''
   Palestinian leaders welcomed the report by the State Department
as a sign of a more realistic U.S. approach to the Palestinian
problem.
   Since the revolt began 14 months ago, 374 Palestinians have been
killed and thousands wounded, most by army gunfire.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said on Israel
Television that troops ``maintain as best they can, apart from a few
exceptions, the standards of proper conduct that no country in the
world could maintain.''
   The television quoted the army's chief prosecutor, Brig. Gen.
Amnon Strashnov, as terming the report ``exaggerated and unjust.''
   In a separate statement, Strashnov defended the legality of
Israeli operations, saying Palestinian prisoners were given due
process of law.
   Ahimeir told The Associated Press: ``We are already used to these
accusations. We try to defend our security and sometimes people lose
their lives. We hope the moment the uprising comes to an end life
will return to normal.''
   Palestinian Feisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO activist who was
recently released from jail after spending most of the uprising
under administrative detention, said, ``I believe this report will
help in creating an understanding between Palestinians and Americans
and I hope it is a sign of a new U.S. policy.''
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the East Jerusalem daily Al-Fajr, said,
``I don't think you can put on paper the suffering of the
Palestinian people and the human rights violations that have taken
place in the last 14 months. But it is a realistic report and we
compliment the State Department for taking such an attitude.''
   Israel's swift reaction, coming even before the State Department
officially released its report, indicated Jerusalem was concerned
the findings may figure in U.S. policy toward Israel. The Jewish
state receives $3 billion a year in U.S. military and economic aid.
   The report comes at a time when Israeli leaders are trying to
persuade the United States to end its dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, charging that the organization has broken
its promise to abandon terrorism.
   In clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Tuesday,
soldiers shot and wounded five Palestinians, Arab hospital officials
said.
   Victims included an 18-year-old struck in the neck with a plastic
bullet and a 20-year-old who was hit in the head. Both were in
critical condition, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Palestinians began the uprising in December 1987 to protest
Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The U.S. report said the revolt has ``led to a substantial
increase in human rights violations.''
   ``Soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did not
present mortal danger to troops, causing many avoidable deaths and
injuries,'' it said. The report said authorities sometimes
prosecuted or disciplined soldiers and Jewish settlers who killed
Palestinians.
   However, ``regulations were not rigorously enforced; punishments
were usually lenient, and there were many cases of unjustified
killing which did not result in disciplinary actions or
prosecutions,'' according to the report.
   It also said troops often arrest Palestinians without warrants
and demolish houses of people suspected, but not convicted, of
anti-Israeli violence.
   In defending Israel's human rights record, Strashnov reported
that of 21,000 Palestinians arrested since the start of the
uprising, 8,000 have been indicted. Of those, 4,300 have been been
convicted and 200 acquitted, Strashnov said. Others were awaiting
trial, he said.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
suggested the U.S. report was biased.
   ``When an army is fighting civilians you can never win the
sympathy of the world,'' he said.
   Human rights officials discounted Israeli claims that human
rights are protected in the territories.
   ``The rights of individuals are violated on a massive scale,''
said Joost Hiltermann, a Dutch researcher for Al Haq-Law in the
Service of Man, the West Bank affiliate of the Geneva-based
International Commission of Jurists.
   He said, for example, that evidence against administrative
detainees and Palestinians facing deportation is routinely kept
secret for security reasons and that defendants cannot respond to
charges.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis left more than $2.6 million to
pay for shutting down his Democratic presidential campaign
operation, while Republican George Bush spent almost everything he
had to win the White House, their financial reports showed.
   Dukakis campaign treasurer Robert A. Farmer said Tuesday the
Massachusetts governor ``is the sort of man who does not want a
debt.''
   During the campaign, Dukakis fostered a public image of frugality
and bragged about having a 25-year-old snowblower to clear his
driveway.
   ``If you're prudent, you keep a reserve to pay your expenses,''
Farmer said.
   However, there was some confusion among Dukakis aides over how
the surplus was reported.
   ``We definitely did not run a surplus,'' said Jack Corrigan, a
campaign aide to Dukakis who how works for him in the governor's
office.
   Nevertheless, Corrigan said he could not explain the figures on
the campaign's financial report filed with the Federal Election
Commission.
   The leftover money comes from the $46.1 million Bush and Dukakis
each got from the federal Treasury to pay for their general election
campaigns. Under federal election laws, candidates using public
money in the general election cannot also use private money for the
campaign.
   However, the law does allow the candidates to raise money for the
sole purpose of covering the costs of legal and other expenses
involved in closing down their operations after the election.
   The candidates can cover these expenses with money they got from
the federal government, but that drains cash away from the campaign
to win the election, said Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the Federal
Election Commission.
   While the Bush campaign ended with a surplus of just under
$70,000, its November victory gives it the ability to raise more
money if it's needed to close down.
   However, Dukakis does not have that ability, Farmer said. On top
of losing the presidential election, he announced he would not run
for re-election in next year's gubernatorial election.
   ``My understanding is we spent almost to the nickel the amount of
money we could spend on the campaign,'' he said.
   Farmer said it may take two years to close out the campaign.
   Dukakis' year-end report filed with the Federal Election
Commission showed he wound up with more than $3.9 million in cash,
with outstanding debts of nearly $1.3 million.
   The same report for Bush showed he had $272,359 in cash at the
end of the year and had $202,537 in debts.
   Democrat Gary Hart and Republican Bob Dole ended their campaigns
in the black. Hart, a former senator from Colorado, wound up with
$155,876 in the bank and $2,156 in debts, while Dole, the Senate
minority leader, had $28,098 in cash and $1,682 in debts.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Republican Pete du Pont of Delaware
also ended the year with their campaigns out of debt. Simon had
$454,360 in cash and $94,346 in debts, while du Pont had $50,799 in
cash and didn't owe anything, according to their FEC reports.
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson's campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination ended the year in debts with $516,158 in
bills with just $19,420 in the bank. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also
ended in the red with $53,332 in debts and $5,180 in cash, according
to reports filed with the FEC.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., also ended in debt, with $10,330 in
the bank and $427,049 in bills.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has not yet filed a year-end report on his
presidential campaign, according to the FEC.

<TEXT>
   A resolution opposing the purchase of
Montgomery's dominant commercial television station by the state
pension system failed to pass the Alabama House on Tuesday.
   The resolution was turned back after a debate pitting concern
over government control of the news media versus the possibility of
financial losses by the agency overseeing teacher and government
pensions.
   Gov. Guy Hunt filed a petition Monday with the Federal
Communications Commission to block the license transfer of WSFA-TV
to the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has agreed to purchase
the station for $70 million.
   The House resolution, sponsored by Rep. Richard Laird of Roanoke,
required a four-fifths majority to pass. It got a majority, 33-27,
but not a big enough margin for approval.
   ``We too often have government entities financed with taxpayers'
money competing with the private sector, the free enterprise system.
That's the bottom line,'' Laird said of the purchase. ``It is wrong.
We need to keep government out of the free enterprise system.''
   Rep. Roy Johnson of Tuscaloosa urged the lawmakers to leave the
battle to Hunt and David Bronner, who is in charge of investing the
state pension system's $8 billion portfolio.
   Bronner has said the state pension system would lose $10 million,
now held in escrow, if the state defaults on the acquisition of WSFA
from Cosmos Broadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C.
   ``There's ... some concern on the part of literally thousands of
retirees across the state who look at the prospects of losing $10
million,'' Johnson said.
   But Rep. Morris ``Mo'' Brooks of Huntsville, said the transaction
strikes at ``the heart of democracy.''
   ``In no way should the state of Alabama, the United States of
America or any other governmental entity get into the business of
controlling, directly or indirectly, what can or cannot be printed
in our media or spoken on our news in the radio and TV markets,''
said Brooks.

<HEAD>France Says Those Without Chemical Weapons Must Have Guarantees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France said Tuesday that global support for a ban
on chemical weapons depends on effective security guarantees for the
nations without them.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told the 40-nation Geneva
disarmament conference quick agreement on that issue could convince
nations that now hesitate over the proposed treaty.
   Swedish delegate Maj Britt said at the first 1989 session the
conference is ``racing against time'' because ``further refinement,
development and spread of chemical weapons seriously undermine our
efforts.''
   A treaty can be ready ``in 1990 or even earlier'' if all
participants have the ``political will,'' she said.
   Dumas said it is ``absolutely crucial'' that a comprehensive
approach be taken to ``undiminished security'' for all countries
during the initial 10-year treaty period in which all stocks of
chemical weapons would be destroyed.
   That would require plans ranging from an order of destruction for
existing stocks to sanctions on countries ``which delay the process
or evade their obligactions,'' he declared.
   France has dropped a proposal, which obtained no other support,
that each country be allowed a ``security stock'' of chemical
weapons during the 10-year destruction period.
   The French abandoned the idea after President Francois Mitterrand
announced to the U.N. General Assembly last fall that his country
does not have chemical weapons and will not produce any when a
treaty takes effect.
   Dumas told a news conference Tuesday his government hopes the
Geneva negotiations, which began in 1980, will finish soon with a
treaty that can take effect quickly.
   Although it does not envisage production of chemical weapons, he
said, France must limit its commitments because ``it cannot exclude
a failure of the negotiations.''
   Tuesday's session began with an appeal by Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, for more rapid progress.
   He said the special conference on chemical weapons, attended by
149 nations in Paris last month, reflected the world's consensus to
conclude a treaty ``at the earliest date.''
   ``I very much hope that this commitment, undertaken at such a
high political level, will accelerate the pace of your
negotiations,'' his message said.
   Max Friedersdorf, chief U.S. delegate, told the conference the
Paris meeting provided ``real impetus.''
   ``It is our challenge now to seize this moment and to search for
practical solutions to the problems that remain,'' he said in his
brief speech. Monitoring complience is ``clearly the major
difficulty,'' Friedersdorf said.

<UNK>1,000 Workers Strike At Nuclear Weapons Plant</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 workers went on strike at the
Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Establishment on Tuesday in a
pay dispute and formed a picket line outside the main gate, union
officials said.
   The Ministry of Defense confirmed the numbers involved.
   The plant, 45 miles west of London, produces nuclear weapons and
carries out research. Almost all its activity is secret, and labor
disputes are rare.
   Union officials said the walkout followed a breakdown of
negotiations on a new productivity agreement and the sending home of
about 50 staffers who refused to carry out tasks covered by the
existing contract.
   Bryan Reynolds, the plant's chief administration officer, said
there was no threat to safety and no risk of radioactive materials
leaking. He said the affected areas were maintenance, crafts,
cleaning and driving.
   The plant has been a target for demonstrations by the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament since 1958.

<HEAD>American Convicted In Retrial Of Killing Three In Train Station Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Rochester, N.Y., man was found guilty of three
counts of first-degree murder Tuesday in the 1984 Labor Day bombing
of a train station that killed three people and injured 47 others.
   The 12-member jury convicted Thomas Brigham, a 69-year-old
drifter with a history of mental problems, in a retrial ordered
after his 1985 conviction was thrown out last June.
   Brigham smiled, stood and leaned against the prisoner's box
before giving a five-minute speech to the court after the verdict
was announced.
   ``I appreciate the great difficulty it has been for the jury,
court, police and the media to understand what happened,'' Brigham
said. ``I don't want the jury to feel bad about its decision,
because it really doesn't matter.''
   Judge Charles Phelan of the Quebec Superior Court sentenced
Brigham to the mandatory term of life imprisonment with no
eligibilty for parole for 25 years.
   Brigham, a father of 11 whose marriage ended in divorce after 28
years, has been held at the Pinel Institute for the criminally
insane in Montreal.
   Brigham told the court he has been doing a lot of writing in
Pinel and said ``the documents go to the White House, the Vatican
and Ottawa.''
   Witnesses during the two-week trial testified Brigham told them
before the Sept. 3, 1984 bombing that Pope John Paul II would never
make it to Montreal for his visit that was scheduled to begin that
Labor Day weekend.
   Witnesses also said Brigham told them: ``If you hear of an
explosion, you will know it was me.''
   A powerful pipe bomb hidden in a locker exploded in Central
Station, Montreal's main train station, killing three French
tourists.
   Brigham was arrested hours after the bombing and the pope visited
Montreal the next day as scheduled.
   In the May 1985 trial, Brigham's ex-wife, Marjorie Keenan,
testified he was committed to psychiatric hospitals four times since
1975 because he believed he was Jesus Christ and had other delusions.
   Brigham was declared mentally incompetent by an Ohio court in
1973.
   Authorities said U.S. records showed he was a
bombardier-navigator in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II.
His plane was shot down and he was held prisoner in Nazi Germany for
one year.
   Several witnesses during the retrial testified that Brigham
claimed to be a writer and said cosmic voices warned him of such
disasters as the eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980,
which left 57 people dead or missing.
   After Tuesday's verdict, Brigham continued to prophesize that the
Soviet policy of glasnost, or openness, signaled a more peaceful
world by the year 2001, telling the court that people had 12 years
to adjust.
   At his first trial, Brigham also was convicted of three counts of
first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Last June, the
Quebec Court of Appeal ordered a new trial, citing four errors made
by the presiding judge.
   Brigham was found competent to stand trial on the charges, and
the defense did not plead insanity.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Counsels Against Rebel Election Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister argued
Tuesday against accepting a rebel proposal to delay the March 19
presidential election and said he thought the rebels were trying to
drive a wedge between the military and civilians.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front said earlier Tuesday
that the armed forces make up the ``real power'' in El Salvador and
that the proposal would fail without military support.
   The defense chief, Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, said
postponing the election from March to September, as the rebels
suggested, could mean defeat for mainstream presidential candidates
and hamper the military in its 9-year-old war against the leftist
guerrillas.
   On Friday, U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle said during a one-day
visit to El Salvador that the Bush administration will back
President Jose Napoleon Duarte if he agrees to the rebel request for
a six-month election postponement.
   Duarte initially attacked the rebels' Jan. 23 proposal as
unconstitutional because it would change the constitutionally
mandated March election date.
   U.S. officials, however, felt the proposal was worth looking into
because of the insurgents' first-ever offer to join the election
process without demanding power-sharing as a precondition.
   In a telephone call from Nicaragua broadcast by a local radio
station, a rebel spokesman on Tuesday read a statement asking the
armed forces to take a public position on postponing the election.
   Vides Casanova obliged during a news conference.
   He said the armed forces do not ``believe this is a serious
proposal.''
   ``If you want your candidates to lose, go ahead and do it,'' he
said in remarks directed to politicians now considering the
postponement.
   El Salvador's political parties are trying to arrive at a joint
position on the rebel proposal.
   Vides Casanova said the military would stand behind whatever
decision political leaders reached but he cautioned that postponing
the election would ``hand over all the advantages'' to the left.
   The Farabundo Marti offered to abandon its longstanding election
boycott and take an indirect role in the electoral process if
balloting is postponed six months. The rebels said they would abide
by election results if their conditions are met.
   They added an offer to negotiate a 60-day cease-fire with the
armed forces in the broadcast Tuesday.
   Vides Casanova said he suspected the rebels of a ``divide and
conquer'' strategy.
   ``We think they are trying to create a division between the armed
forces and the organs of state and an internal division within the
armed forces,'' he said.
   By the Farabundo Marti's own assessment, Vides Casanova's
negative reaction to the rebel proposal could sound the death knell
for the plan.
   ``If this proposal could really bring peace to the nation, we
would be obliged to accept it,'' the general said. ``But it is our
judgment that it is not going to bring peace, that it is only going
to aggravate ... conditions in the country.''

   Feuding lawyers tried to storm the Egyptian
Bar Association building in downtown Cairo on Tuesday, and nine
people were injured in ensuing clashes with other lawyers and with
police, security sources said.
   They said two policemen, a lieutenant colonel and a sergeant,
were hurt along with four lawyers and three workers who were
repairing damage to the two-story villa caused by violence last
month. All injuries were minor.
   Rival groups within the association have been bickering for
months over allegations that the association's governing council and
its chairman, Ahmed Khawaga, are guilty of financial mismanagement.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 70
anti-council lawyers tried to storm the building Tuesday, jumping
over the outer fence, racing across the small surrounding garden and
diving through windows in the villa.
   Attackers and pro-council members fought each other inside the
building with fists, stones and tree branches.
   Police forces stepped in with clubs to break up the melee, the
informants said.
   The dissidents, led by Ahmed Nasser, occupied the building on
Jan. 19 and held it for four days.
   Shots that police said were fired from inside the building
wounded a man on the street on Jan. 23, leading security forces to
storm the building. Twelve lawyers holed up inside were arrested and
remain in jail.

   Authorities in Soviet Georgia on Tuesday warned
five dissidents to stay away from a Georgian nationalist rally in
Tbilisi where they plan to demand publication of the Helsinki human
rights accords, an activist said.
   The protest in the capital of Soviet Georgia on Wednesday also
will commemorate the 900th anniversary of Georgian King David the
Builder, and it will conflict with an official celebration of that
event, said activist Svyad Gammsachurdia in a telephone interview.
   Gammsachurdia said authorities told him and four others they
would be arrested if they attended the alternate rally.
   Gammsachurdia said he expects at least 5,000 people to attend. He
said speakers will urge Georgian soldiers to do their military
service only in Georgia and for limitations on citizenship in the
southern republic, where the population is increasingly ethnic
Russian.

   Customers besieged banks Tuesday
to acquire U.S. dollars, pushing the value of the inflation-battered
Argentine national currency down by 25 percent and intensifying the
nation's economic crisis.
   The long lines of depositors waiting to change australs for
dollars resulted from the Central Bank's decision Sunday night to
restrict dollar sales in an attempt to stabilize the austral and
hold down inflation.
   Financial houses were closed Monday while the government grappled
with ways to combat the Latin American nation's economic travails,
which have forced it to keep interest rates high in order to prevent
a freefall in the austral.
   Argentines who gathered outside foreign-exchange services early
Tuesday found they had to pay up to 26 australs for the dollar they
could have purchased for 17.59 australs on Friday. But those who had
dollars received 21 australs or more, compared with 17.51 on Friday.
   During the day, the austral kept slipping and by the time
financial houses closed a dollar fetched 23.20 australs; it cost
23.50 australs to buy a dollar.
   The Central Bank during the past several months has tightened
interest rates and taken other steps to support the austral and
restrain inflation.
   But the 6.8 percent inflation rate in December and 8.9 percent
rate in January were worse than expected and suggested to many
Argentines that the government's policies aren't working.
   Inflation in 1988 soared 387 percent.
   On Monday, the government announced it would maintain a
three-tiered exchange rate system: the official rate, a ``special''
rate that is 25 percent higher, and the ``black market,'' or free
rate.
   The special rate replaces a rate used to determine how much
industrial exporters would be paid in australs for their dollars.
Farm exporters are required to sell most of the dollars to the
government at the lower official rate.
   Argentines who were unhappy with the old system aren't happy with
the new one either.
   Farm exporters, who provide the bulk of Argentina's foreign
exchange earnings, grumbled that while the ``special'' rate is
marginally higher than the official rate, they still have to sell
most of their dollars to the Central Bank at a little more than 14
australs to the dollar.
   Businessmen said interest rates which have made borrowing
prohibitive aren't likely to come down even with the exchange rate
changes.

<TEXT>
   Donated meals and gifts poured in Tuesday for a
Soviet ballet troupe whose U.S. debut tour is in danger of
cancellation after the pullout of top investors.
   Organizers of the 15-city tour announced the Donetsk Ballet from
the Ukraine would give a ``Thank You, Baltimore'' fund-raising
performance Wednesday so the dancers, most under age 25, can
continue their performances through April as scheduled.
   As producer Jan Urdzik of California-based Heart of the Art Inc.
met with Soviet Embassy representatives, troupe officials and a
member of Goskontsert, the Soviet concert managers, meals, snacks
and gifts arrived at the downtown hotel where the dancers were
staying.
   Vadim Pisarev, the ballet's top soloist, wearing fur leg warmers
as he sat by a flower-filled Russian champagne bottle at the hotel,
expressed his gratitude.
   ``I am very happy with the people of Baltimore,'' he said,
showing a letter signed by ``an adoring ballet fan'' in Baltimore,
comparing him to two of the greatest Russian male dancers, Mikhail
Baryshnikov and Rudolf Nureyev. With it, the man enclosed a gold
pinky ring he'd received years ago from his wife.
   ``You, sir, are among the stars and a worthy successor to the
others,'' the fan wrote.
   Pisarev, 24, earned the 1988 prize for best dancer in the Soviet
Union and won the gold medal at the prestigious International Ballet
Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986.
   Despite his prominence, good reviews and standing ovations from
small Baltimore audiences last week, Mexican and American investors
withheld $200,000 from the tour upon learning that stars from
well-known Soviet troupes such as the Kirov Ballet could not leave
the Soviet Union to join the tour, organizers said.
   The dancers were scheduled for performances in Detroit, Chicago,
and Columbus, Ohio.
   As Ms. Urdzik tried to extend the group's stay in Baltimore to
Thursday, the Howard Gilman Foundation of New York pledged an
undisclosed sum and worked to attract other donors to save the
troupe from loss of face on its American tour.
   ``This was one year in planning with no salary,'' said Ms.
Urdzik, who also promoted a Moscow Ballet tour in 1987. ``My home is
on the line,'' because she committed her own money to the project,
she said.
   ``They (the Soviets) don't understand business in America,'' she
said, referring to the decision to keep the Kirov stars away and its
impact on private funding, as opposed to the state-supported arts in
communist countries. Meanwhile, the dancers had dinner Tuesday at
the Belvedere Hotel courtesy of Anne C. Dodds of St. Louis, who
donated $1,000. Baltimore fans dropped off cases of vodka, and Lyric
Opera president Robert M. Pomory said he would pay the group's hotel
bill for two days.
   ``Morale is very good; these kids are really troopers,'' Pomory
said.
   Lyric workers donated fruit and breakfasts and the Belvedere
provided two dinners, at a cost of about $500, managing director Joe
Kreit said, noting the dancers ate such typical American fare as
turkey with gravy and chocolate cake.
   ``When they see chocolate cake, they forget about everything
else,'' Kreit said.
   The Lyric underwrote some hotel expenses, which were discounted
as a courtesy, but Pomory, who moved into the hotel to watch over
the dancers, said he was donating some of his own money to help.
   ``If I had room in my house I'd take them all home,'' he said.

   Congress voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to turn
down its 51 percent pay raise and rushed the legislation to
President Bush, who signed it hours before a midnight deadline.
   Lawmakers were anxious to end the public outcry against the
$45,500 increase, which left them feeling, in the words of one
representative, like ``cannon fodder for trash television and talk
radio.''
   First, the House voted to reject the raise by a vote of 380-48.
Less than three hours later, the Senate followed suit by a vote of
94-6.
   The raise would have become law at midnight without Bush's
signature on the resolution rejecting it. Bush had supported the
raise but went along with Congress, signing the measure hours after
the congressional votes.
   The votes also denied large raises for top federal executives and
federal judges. The Constitution forbids judicial raises from being
scaled back once they have taken effect.
   Bush had supported the pay raise and said in a statement Tuesday
night that ``I believe some level of pay increase is in order and I
will be working with the House and Senate leadership to develop
proposals to achieve that end.'' He cited a ``special concern''
about judges' pay.
   Some lawmakers predicted that defeating the raises would
accelerate an exodus of judges and federal managers from government
service.
   Indeed, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a statement:
   ``I deeply regret the congressional action, which has prevented
the federal judges in this country from receiving a well-deserved
pay raise. ... We will not be able to attract and retain the kind of
judges we need ... unless we pay our judges fairly and equitably.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Bush told Senate
Republicans Tuesday he might ask Congress to approve lesser raises
for the judges and executives.
   With its votes, Congress rejected raises proposed by a
presidential commission and endorsed by then-President Reagan.
Senators and representatives would have seen their salaries rise
from $89,500 to $135,000.
   During its less than 30 minutes of debate, the Senate heard Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. and a foe of the raise, proclaim that the vote shows
the American people that ``you can fight city hall and you can take
on the Congress of the United States with all its legerdemain and
all its legislative ability.''
   The Senate last week voted 95-5 against the raise, but the
wording of that resolution differed from the House version approved
Tuesday. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who had voted against the
raise, voted for it Tuesday.
   Jeffords said he cast his vote Tuesday to make clear his view
that judges are badly in need of a pay raise and because, unlike
last week's measure, this one did not curtail lawmakers' rights to
make speeches for fees.
   The other senators voting to sustain the raise were Democrats
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii; and Republicans Frank Murkowski of Alaska
and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
   Despite the overwhelming House margin, members were clearly torn
between their desire for a pay raise and the public scorn heaped
upon them for considering the increase.
   The chamber applauded loudly when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
told colleagues in a rousing speech before the vote, ``Each member
of this House, Democrat and Republican, is worth a salary of
$135,000 a year.''
   The irony of the House's dilemma was reflected when Rep. Vic
Fazio, D-Calif., a pay raise defender, introduced the resolution to
reject the increase _ but voted against the resolution.
   ``We face reality here today,'' Fazio said. ``We're doing what
has become inevitable.''
   Fazio chided his colleagues for not having ``the courage to speak
out'' in their own defense and said, ``We became cartoon cannon
fodder for trash television and talk radio.'' He added, ``There are
Supreme Court justices who make less than their clerks the day after
they (the clerks) retire and go into private practice.''
   Left dangling by Congress' action were ethics reforms that
lawmakers had hoped to pass once the raise became law.
   These included a ban on fees for speeches and appearances in both
houses. A bipartisan House negotiating group also had agreed to do
away in 1991 with a legal loophole that allowed 190 House members _
those in office before 1980 _ to accumulate $39 million in leftover
campaign cash, which can be converted to personal use.
   ``This issue isn't over,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading
opponent of the pay raise who said the Congress must deal this year
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for
lawmakers.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif. and one of those who negotiated the
package of reforms, said he's ``never seen a legislative body that
was anything but clumsy in dealing with levels of pay.''
   But he added that in rejecting the raise, the House ``will be
reflecting the voices of the people regarding their attitude toward
congressional pay.''
   Raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in both
houses Monday after they engineered the collapse of House Speaker
Jim Wright's suggested alternative for a 30 percent pay increase.
   The speaker planned to let the full raise become law at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday and then schedule a Thursday vote to scale back the
increase to 30 percent. Coupled with the planned honoraria ban, the
raise of $26,850 would have amounted to a dollar-for-dollar trade
for those earning the fee limit.
   Besides the raise for members of Congress, the presidential
commission had proposed:
   _Increasing the president's pay from $200,000 to $350,000 and the
vice president's from $115,000 to $175,000. The raises would not
have affected President Bush or Vice President Dan Quayle.
   _Raising the salaries of top federal officials, now in the range
of $75,000 to $99,500, to a range of $115,000 to $155,000.
   _Hiking the salary of the chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000
and the salaries of associate justices of the Supreme Court from
$110,000 to $165,000.
   _Raising the pay of federal appellate judges from $95,000 to
$140,000 and that of federal district judges from $89,500 to
$135,000.
   Retired congressmen, presidents, vice presidents, top federal
officials and federal judges would also have received higher
pensions under the commission's proposal.

   Japan, seeking a larger role in dealing with Third
World debt problems, wants to gain a bigger voice in the
Internatonal Monetary Fund by putting in more money, a high-ranking
IMF official said Tuesday.
   But U.S. reluctance to have its power diluted by larger Japanese
contributions to organizations like the IMF is slowing Japan's
attempts to assume greater responsibility, the official said.
   ``Japan wishes to make a special Japanese contribution to the
IMF's capital, which would enable it to obtain a higher, stronger
position within the IMF,'' Hermann Onno Christiann Ruding, chairman
of the IMF's Interim Committee, told reporters.
   ``Most members of the IMF, including Japan, want to see a
stronger IMF and World Bank, and that implies a larger capital quota
for the IMF,'' said Ruding.
   Ruding said he supports Japan's desire to increase its
contribution to the IMF as well as a proposal to raise the IMF's
total capital fund by between 50 and 100 percent.
   But the United States, which holds enough power to veto measures
it does not support, was not convinced of the need for a larger
capital fund and ``has been reluctant to support a substantial quota
increase,'' Ruding said.
   IMF contributions determine members' voting power and provide
resources for loans to developing nations. The United States holds
the largest share of voting power, 19.01 percent, and Japan ranks
fifth with 4.7 percent. IMF decisions require 85 percent support, he
said.
   At an IMF meeting last April, former Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa called for Japan's share to be raised to match its economic
stature.

   The Bush Administration is preparing a major
drug interdiction plan that will put ``several hundred'' U.S. troops
in South America to destroy drug laboratories, NBC News reported
Tuesday.
   Citing unidentified Pentagon officials for the information, NBC
reported that the troops would be Special Operations commandos who
will be placed in several South American nations.
   The Pentagon duty officer Tuesday night, Cmdr. David Thomas, said
he was unaware of any such plans.
   Meanwhile, a Defense Department source, speaking on grounds of
anonymity, said the Pentagon has named two Coast Guard admirals to
key leadership positions in the department's expanded drug
interdiction mission as called for in the 1989 Defense Authorization
Act.
   Rear Adm. William P. Leahy Jr. will head the drug interdiction
efforts in the Pacific Theater, while Vice Adm. James C. Irwin will
lead those efforts in the Atlantic, the source said. They will be
supervised by the commanders in chief of the Pacific and Atlantic
commands.
   The Pentagon also anticipates placing high-ranking U.S. Customs
Service officials in other key leadership roles in the
drug-interdiction efforts, the source said.
   The authorization act included $300 million for the Pentagon's
new drug-interdiction tasks that were added to the supporting role
it has played for several years.
   Those tasks include serving as the federal government's lead
agency for detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transport
of illegal drugs into the United States.
   The Pentagon also is to create an effective communications
network by integrating communications supporting U.S. command,
control, communications and technical intelligence assets dedicated
to drug interdiction.
   In addition, the Pentagon is to approve and fund plans by state
governors for expanded use of the National Guard to support
drug-enforcement activities while the Guard remains under the
control of the governors.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Who Suffers From Lyme Diseases Urges Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former congressman who was forced to leave
office after contracting Lyme disease urged his former colleagues
Tuesday to support new legislation to pay for research and education
efforts for the tick-borne disease.
   Berkley W. Bedell, an Iowa Democrat who served in the House for
12 years, said public education is badly needed for the disease,
which activists said is second only to AIDS as the most widespread
new infectious disease of the 1980s.
   Bedell, who left office in 1987 because of the disease, returned
to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to support legislation by Reps. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., and Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., to provide $2.5
million annually for three years for research and treatment grants
and another $1 million a year for education.
   ``Education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this
rapidly growing and very serious disease,'' Gejdenson said. ``We
need to know more about how the disease spreads, what its effects
are and how to treat it.''
   Bedell, 67, said he has an irregular heartbeat, suffers from
arthritis, experiences loss of memory and tires easily due to the
affliction. But he said his condition was diagnosed quickly and
treated. Others often do not realize they have the disease until it
becomes debilitating.
   Karen Vanderhoof-Forschner of Tolland, Conn., who has become a
leading activist for Lyme disease education and research, said she
contracted the disease while pregnant and passed it on to her son.
Ms. Vanderhoof-Forschner is president of Lyme Borreliosis Foundation
Inc., a non-profit foundation in Connecticut devoted to education on
the disease.
   ``Because of lack of education and awareness, my son and I went
undiagnosed for Lyme disease,'' she told a news conference. Her son
now is blind and deaf and must be fed intravenously due to the
disease.
   Lyme disease, named after Old Lyme, the Connecticut town where
the disease was first diagnosed in 1975, is spread by blood-sucking
ticks _ the size of a comma in newsprint _ that are found on deer.
   The disease has been reported in 34 states, but is most prevalent
in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Wisconsin and Minnesota. An estimated 5,700 cases were reported last
year, the lawmakers said. Bedell contracted the disease while
fishing in Quantico, Va., in 1985.
   Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause arthritis, paralysis,
meningitis, heart disease, encephalitis, and in very rare cases
death.

<HEAD>Dome of Arctic Air Covers Most of Nation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Much of the nation was under a dome of arctic air on Tuesday with
the coldest spots in California, Colorado and Utah, where readings
were as low as minus 50.
   Several record lows were set or tied, including one in Richfield,
Utah, which for the second straight day reached its all-time low of
33 degrees below zero.
   Other record lows in Utah were recorded in Delta, minus 27, and
Dugway, minus 29. Record-tying lows were set in Bryce Canyon, Utah,
minus 32 and Vernal, Utah, minus 38.
   Utah's low was 50 below at Logan Canyon. Roosevelt and Woodruff
both recorded minus 44.
   Numerous records were also set in California. Travis Air Force
base at Fairfield recorded 24 degrees, a record low for February,
and Boca Reservoir near Truckee was 43 degrees below zero, the
coldest February reading ever in California and 2 degrees shy of the
state's all-time low.
   Other records lows for the date included: Alexandria, La., 23
degrees; Bakersfield, Calif., 26; Colorado Springs, Colo., minus 11;
Ely, Nev., minus 29; Eugene, Ore., 7; Fresno, Calif., 24; Las Vegas,
16; Oakland, Calif., 34; Reno, Nev., minus 16; Sacramento, Calif.,
23; San Francisco, 34; and Seattle, 20.
   The cold air extended to Brownsville, Texas, which had 28
consecutive hours below freezing.
   Strong, gusty winds in the northern Plains caused blowing snow
conditions and reduced visibilities to near zero in some areas.
   Lake-effect snow continued across eastern portions of the lower
Great Lakes over New York state. Some 9.5 inches fell in Buffalo.
   Showers and some thunderstorms were scattered ahead of a cold
front from northwest Florida to eastern North Carolina.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees below zero at Baker, Ore., to 84 degrees at Avon Park, Fla.
The low in the nation Tuesday morning was 50 degrees below zero at
Logan Canyon, Utah.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for rain showers scattered over
northern Florida and coastal sections of southern California and
rain along with some freezing rain scattered over portions of
Alabama and Mississippi. Snow showers were expected over northern
portions of the upper Great Lakes, all of the lower Great Lakes and
northern New England. Winds were to be strong and gusty along the
east slopes of the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were to remain below zero over northern
Minnesota; in the single digits over much of the upper Mississippi
Valley, the northern Plains, western Wyoming and southeast Idaho; in
the teens and 20s from the northern and central Intermountain
region, the northern and central Rockies, the central Plains,
Oklahoma, the middle Mississippi Valley, Arkansas, much of the Great
Lakes and the Ohio Valley to northern New England; in the 50s and
60s over coastal sections of central and southern California,
southern Arizona, northern Florida, southern Georgia and coastal
portions of the Carolinas; and in the 70s and 80s over the southern
Florida peninsula. Much of the remainder of the nation was expected
to have high temperatures in the 30s and 40s.

   An explosion and fire ripped through the fourth
floor of a downtown skyscraper Tuesday afternoon, spreading smoke
throughout the 34-story tower and forcing the evacuation of office
workers, authorities said.
   There were no injuries, but damage to the fourth floor appeared
to have been severe, Houston Fire Chief Robert L. Clayton said.
   The fire erupted at about 3 p.m. in an area where construction
crews were removing asbestos from the office building, Clayton said.
Smoke rose up stairwells and elevator shafts to the uppermost floors.
   Firefighters searched the entire building and found no one,
despite early reports that some office workers were overcome by
smoke and trapped in an upper stairwell, said fire department
spokesman Mike Warnke.
   Warnke said an explosion of unknown size apparently sparked the
blaze, but that the exact cause was not yet known. The fire was
controlled within 30 minutes, he said.
   ``Some of the walls were blown out, but we haven't been able to
tell yet just how bad the damage is,'' Warnke said.
   Authorities said they would look into reports that office workers
were unable to activate the building's fire alarm.
   The building, Allen Center, has an occupancy of about 1,900
people, Warnke said, but many people had taken the day off because
of icy Houston streets and it was not known exactly how many were
evacuated.

<HEAD>U.N. Monitoring of Cuban Withdrawal From Angola To Cost $19.4 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RETRANSMITTING a0683 to fix byline</HEAD>

   The U.N. peacekeeping mission to verify the
31-month withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola will cost
$19.4 million, the U.N. chief announced Tuesday.
   In addition to vehicles and communications equipment, the cost
includes the distinctive blue berets and helmets of the U.N.
peacekeepers and fragmentation jackets _ a reminder of the hazards
of their work.
   The 70 military observers staff of the U.N. Angola Verification
Mission, known as UNAVEM, are to oversee the withdrawal of the
Cubans as part of the southwest African peace accords signed in
December at U.N. headquarters by Cuba, Angola and South Africa.
   Under the accords South Africa will also grant independence to
the former Germany colony of Namibia, which the Pretoria government
has ruled since World War I.
   The Security Council now is deadlocked over the cost of a
peacekeeping force for Namibia's independence elections, a force
separate from the Angola verification group.
   The black African front-line states want 7,500 peacekeepers in
Namibia, which could cost $700 million.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has bowed to
cost-cutting pressures from the United States, Soviet Union and
other permanent Security Council members. He has recommended sending
4,650 peacekeeping troops and about 500 police supervisors at a cost
of $416 million.
   In Perez de Cuellar's report Tuesday to the General Assembly,
which must approve the cost of the U.N. Angola force, he suggests
the UNAVEM mission will cost $9.2 million in 1988 and $19.4 for the
entire 31-month withdrawal.
   The Security Council has already approved $4.2 million for the
Angola force. Its mission began Jan. 3 and the U.N. observers have
already verified the early withdrawal of hundreds of Cuban soldiers.
   The U.N. chief's report calls for a peak strength of 70 military
observers, up to 26 international support staff and 12 locally
recruited staff based in the Angolan capital of Luanda.
   Among the equipment needed by the force, as detailed in the
report, are 33 jeeps, nine automobiles, a mini-bus and a mobile
workshop.
   Communications equipment includes a satellite station for
$120,000, radio and teletype equipment, a coded fax machine for
$28,000 and a coded text machine for $27,000.
   Protective clothing, such as fragmentation jackets, and U.N.
uniform equipment including berets, helmets and insignia are
budgeted at $17,000.
   The budget includes $116,000 for payments in case of the death,
disability, injury or illness of the military observers resulting
from their assignment.

   A Roman Catholic priest who won nearly $7
million playing the California lottery said Tuesday he plans to go
away to a retreat and reflect on God's will.
   Father Boleslaw Wdowiak, who goes by the nickname ``Father
Bosco,'' said he was ``happy, confused and thankful the Lord has
been good to me all of my life.''
   ``I have tried to serve him as a priest and this I will continue
to do. Because of the new responsibilities the prize creates for me,
I'm going away on retreat to pray and reflect on God's will for
me,'' he told a reporter.
   Wdowiak, a priest at St. Joseph's Parish in Auburn, will receive
his prize in 20 annual payments of $276,000 after taxes. He won the
jackpot in last Saturday's Lotto 6-49 drawing with a ``Quick Pick''
ticket, in which a computer randomly selects the player's numbers.
   Auburn is a Sierra Nevada foothills community about 100 air miles
northeast of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Strike Over Pay in Central Poland</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 workers have gone on strike for
higher pay at a coal mine and electric power plant in central
Poland, government and union spokesmen said Tuesday.
   The stoppage began Monday at the Belchatow brown coal mine and
power plant about 90 miles southwest of Warsaw. But it has not
interrupted electric service provided by the plant, one of the
largest generating stations in Poland.
   On strike are employees in the plant's repair department and
workers who deliver coal to the power station from the mine, said
government spokesman Jerzy Urban.
   They are seeking pay increases of $59 a month, an amount
considered ``unfeasible'' by management, the state PAP news service
said. It was not immediately known what the workers' current wages
are.
   The mine continued to function Tuesday during negotiations with
management, said Wojciech Maziarski, a spokesman in Warsaw for the
outlawed Solidarity trade union movement. But workers have
threatened to shut down the mine beginning Wednesday unless their
demands are met, he said.
   Maziarski said the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, meeting with
communist government officials in an effort to legalize the
organization, is sending two personal representatives to the
strikers, presumably to try to moderate in the dispute.
   Urban said the strike was symptomatic of ``alarming'' wage
pressures breaking out across Poland. He said 173 pay disputes were
reported to the government in January, compared to about a third
that number in December.
   Thirty-nine of the January disputes resulted in strikes, the
longest lasting four days, he said.
   ``The government consistently applies the principle that these
disputes are between the management and the workers, and the
management should pay as much as it can'' without threatening an
enterprise's finances, Urban said.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer denied he is beholden to the
City Council members who elected him, saying Tuesday in the city's
only mayoral campaign debate that ``nobody has pushed me around.''
   Sawyer went on the defensive quickly in the televised debate with
front-running Richard Daley, the Cook County state's attorney and
son of the late longtime Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   Alderman Lawrence Bloom, a long-shot challenger, opened by
attacking Sawyer. He contended the mayor's policies have been swayed
by old-guard aldermen who elected him 14 months ago and are
resistant to reform.
   ``Nobody has pushed me around, nobody will push me around,''
Sawyer countered at the start of the live debate televised by public
TV station WTTW.
   Bloom also charged that electing either Sawyer or Daley probably
will racially polarize the city.
   ``People say, `White people are voting for Daley becuase he's
white ... black people are voting for Sawyer because he's black,'''
Bloom said, maintaining that he, a white alderman from the heavily
black South Side, is the only candidate who can unite the city.
   Despite repeated complaints from Bloom that he was not answering
the questions, Daley refused to spar, saying the public was
concerned about issues, such as education, crime, housing and taxes.
   ``They're sick and tired of a council fighting ... the personal
attacks,'' he said. ``People are saying `Let's get on and talk about
the real issues.'''
   The 90-minute debate was the only one scheduled among the three
candidates before the Feb. 28 Democratic primary.
   Bloom, 45, had the most to gain from the debate, observers said
prior to the event.
   ``Let's just say it's very important,'' said Michael Meshenberg,
Bloom's campaign coordinator.
   Sawyer, 54, had a technical advantage as the winner of two
drawings that enabled him to deliver the opening and closing
statements.
   But one pundit said Sawyer may have hurt his chances by
unleashing a series of TV ads criticizing Daley's intelligence on
Monday.
   ``The debate is overrated. But Sawyer raised the stakes by those
commercials. And in effect Daley can put him away by not doing
anything more than acting like a regular candidate,'' said Paul
Green, a political analyst at suburban Governor's State University.
   Sawyer's strategists defended the commercials Tuesday.
   ``People have enjoyed the humor'' in the ads, said Horist. ``The
humor, however, is designed to draw attention to the point _ that
Daley is a trained candidate, that he is being handled.''
   Halperin said the the 44-year-old Daley, who is white, was
confident, but not complacent because of his front-runner status.
   Recent polls have shown Daley with a commanding lead. Support for
the county's top prosecutor has been hovering at about 50 percent,
against about 30 percent for Sawyer, 10 percent for Bloom and 10
percent undecided. The winner of the primary will face independent
candidate Alderman Timothy Evans and the Republican candidate chosen
in the GOP primary in an April 4 special election to serve the
two-year balance of the late Mayor Harold Washington's unfinished
term. Washington died of a heart attack in November 1987.

   Police on Tuesday rescued a Colombian
industrialist and an American 11 days after they were abducted in
this western city, but their captors fled into the night,
authorities said.
   Norman Echavarria, a wealthy construction materials producer, and
Michael Ray, a psychologist from Philadelphia, were found in good
health after police, tipped off by local farmers, moved in on a
suburban house where they were being held, said police commander
Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla.
   The heavily armed kidnappers, as yet unidentified, had made no
ransom demands, Padilla said. They seized Echavarria and Ray on Jan.
27 while they were driving in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest
city.
   Police believe Ray, 36, who was visiting Echavarria, was abducted
accidentally because the group's apparent objective was to obtain a
ransom for the wealthy Echavarria.
   The abduction prompted a search by 1,000 men backed by
helicopters in the mountainous region, said police Col. Carlos
Otalora.

   Idaho National Guard troops Tuesday helped rescue livestock
stranded by 15-foot snow drifts that have buried hundreds of other
animals, while the nation's deadly cold snap pushed temperatures to
record lows in several states.
   Some California citrus growers feared the arctic air caused
millions of dollars in crop damage. And in Las Vegas, which dropped
to a record low 16 degrees, sheets of ice covered casino fountains
and backyard swimming pools.
   It got so cold in Houston that even criminals stayed home, police
said.
   But Mardi Gras revelers didn't let a little cold stop them. Men
in miniskirts pranced through New Orleans' French Quarter in
near-freezing weather, as others pitched tents along parade routes.
   ``I live to just go up and down the street and get my picture
taken,'' said a man in black lace corset, garters and goosebumps who
refused to be identified.
   At least 83 deaths have been blamed on the cold weather since
Jan. 31, when frigid air blew out of Alaska and into the lower 48
states.
   In Kentucky, doctors tried to save a 7-year-old boy who had been
submerged for about 40 minutes in a pond. They used a heart bypass
pump that removed the boy's blood, rewarmed it and put it back into
his body. But the boy died, 17 hours after he was rescued. His
9-year-old brother, who also fell through thin ice, had died earlier.
   Schools were closed in parts of Alabama, Colorado, Idaho,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and elsewhere. Scattered
power outages were reported in several states, including Texas,
Utah, Colorado and Mississippi.
   Snow fell over parts of New Mexico, Texas, from northern New York
state across northern Ohio, the upper Great Lakes, Minnesota and
North Dakota.
   Record low temperatures were reported in several cities: Alamosa,
Colo., had 30 degrees below zero; Sacramento, Calif., broke a
106-year-old record low for the date with 26 degrees; San Francisco
hit 32; and Milford and Vernal, Utah, had their coldest February
days ever with minus 29 and minus 38 degrees respectively. Boca
Reservoir near Truckee, Calif., was 43 degrees below zero, the
coldest February reading ever in California, forecasters said.
   In Dubois, Idaho, two dozen National Guard troops used front-end
loaders to battle snow drifts up to 8 feet tall that have blocked
city streets since last week.
   ``People can't even get out of their driveways,'' said Reed
Fanning of the Idaho Bureau of Disaster Services.
   A Guard helicopter flew over the surrounding countryside in
search of surviving livestock stranded in snow-covered fields.
Hundreds of animals were already dead. Guardsmen prepared to use the
helicopter to drop hay to stranded cattle and sheep.
   County Commissioner Ab Laird said fewer than 300 of his 980 sheep
had survived the snow and cold, and only seven of 787 cows had been
found alive on his property in eastern Idaho. Snow had accumulated
as deep as 15 feet.
   Gordon Wanek, an Oregon cattleman with ranches in La Pine and
Fort Rock, said he took newborn calves into his house because of the
cold.
   ``I had three calves in my house Saturday night _ two in the
bathroom and one in the kitchen,'' Wanek said. ``If we don't get to
the calves within 20 minutes after they're born, we just have to
kiss them off. There's no way to revive them.''
   In Angleton, Texas, the cold drove rats into one home.
   A group of residents rounded up 22 rats that tried to warm up
next to a clothes dryer vent blowing warm air. The rats were put in
an empty cooler and let loose in a field.
   The cold took its toll in California, where citrus growers in the
San Joaquin Valley used smudge pots and large fans in an effort to
save their fragile crops. Some growers predicted the freeze damaged
25 percent of their citrus crops.
   ``The lemon crop in the San Joaquin Valley may have been
obliterated,'' said Richard Pescosolido, farm manager for Sequoia
Orange Co. in Exeter, Calif.
   Washington's apricot crop was wiped out by the cold, according to
county extension agents.
   But the cold apparently spared Texas citrus growers, said Bill
Weeks, vice president of the Texas Citrus and Vegetable Association.
   More than 400 people jammed homeless shelters in Reno, Nev., as
the temperature fell to a record minus 16.
   ``We took in more people than we were supposed to,'' said
Salvation Army Capt. Kenneth Osbourn. ``We can't turn anybody out in
this kind of weather.''
   In Las Vegas, workers at glitzy Caesars Palace shut down
fountains in front of the resort to keep water from freezing in the
valves that produce the display, spokeswoman Debbie Munch said.
   A thin sheet of ice covered the fountain pools. Residents'
swimming pools also were frozen and thousands of people had broken
water pipes.
   It's been so cold in Texas that criminals are staying off the
streets, police said.
   ``We haven't had a doggone call up here all day,'' said Sgt. Dan
Silva of the Houston Police Department robbery division.

<HEAD>German Chemical Plant Owner Said To Be Consultant To Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman under criminal
investigation in the Libyan chemical plant case said he has been a
consultant for the North African nation since 1984, the West German
news magazine Stern said Tuesday.
   Stern also quoted Iraqi-born Ihsan Barbouti, owner of the
now-defunct Frankfurt company I.B.I. Engineering, as saying he is an
avid admirer of radical Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``If you really understood him, you would idolize him,'' Stern
quoted Barbouti as saying.
   Barbouti said he has had a five-year consultancy contract with
Libya's Energy Ministry since 1984 and that Libya has approached him
about renewing it, according to the magazine.
   Barbouti said he receives about $266,000 from Libya a year
``whether I do anything or not'' and is provided a 16-room house,
six servants and a ``great chef'' on his visits to Tripoli, the
Libyan capital, Stern said.
   Stern said its report would appear in its Thursday editions. The
magazine telexed the report to other news organizations in advance
of publication.
   Alleged participation by German firms in helping Libya build a
suspected poison gas factory has embarrassed the Bonn government and
strained U.S.-West German ties. Washington says the plant at Rabta,
60 miles south of Tripoli, can make chemical weapons. Libya says the
plant produces pharmaceuticals.
   Barbouti, who lives in London, is suspected of organizing
involvement by several West German companies in building the plant.
   Stern quoted Barbouti as acknowledging that his company delivered
construction materials for the Libyan plant but as denying the
factory was for producing poison gases or that he had done anything
wrong.
   In 1986, Barbouti told his company manager at I.B.I. Engineering
that ``Libya wants certain construction materials for a
pharmaceuticals project,'' Stern reported. The company closed down
its office in Frankfurt last summer.
   According to Barbouti, Libya plans to produce ``about 40
different pharmaceutical products'' at the Rabta complex for sale to
European and Arab countries, Stern reported.
   Barbouti said he was last in Tripoli in January, according to
Stern.

<HEAD>`Last Emperor,' `Fish Called Wanda' Nominated for British Awards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Last Emperor,'' which swept last year's
Academy Awards, and ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' a possible for this
year's Oscars, topped the nominations Tuesday for the 1988 film
awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
   The two movies will compete for best picture alongside Frenchman
Louis Malle's semi-autobiographical ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' and
last year's Oscar-winning Danish movie ``Babette's Feast,'' by
Gabriel Axel. All four filmmakers were nominated for best director.
   The four best picture nominees received 30 of 68 nominations in
17 categories honoring films from around the world released in
Britain during 1988.
   Winners in the craft division will be announced March 5 and those
in the production and performance categories on March 19. Both
ceremonies will be televised live.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film about the
Chinese emperor who ascended the throne at the age of 3, led with 11
nominations, and ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' the sleeper comedy hit
about Anglo-American differences, followed with nine.
   ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is expected to figure in this year's
Oscar race, which begins with the announcement of the Academy Award
nominations Feb. 15. Its director, Charles Crichton, last week
received a nomination from the Directors' Guild of America.
   Besides competing for best picture, ``Au Revoir Les Enfants,''
and ``Babette's Feast'' are nominees for best foreign film alongside
the Italian movie ``Dark Eyes'' and Wim Wenders' German-language
``Wings of Desire.''
   ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' received 11
nominations between them. Each was nominated for best adapted
screenplay and in numerous technical categories.
   Last year's much-lauded ``Moonstruck'' received four nominations,
including best actress (Cher), best supporting actress (Olympia
Dukakis), and best original screenplay (John Patrick Shanley). All
three won Oscars in the same categories last March.
   John Cleese and Kevin Kline, who first appeared together in the
movie ``Silverado,'' are both best actor nominees for ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' along with Robin Williams for ``Good Morning
Vietnam'' and Michael Douglas for ``Fatal Attraction,'' not ``Wall
Street,'' for which he won the Oscar.
   Best actress nominees besides Cher include Jamie Lee Curtis for
``A Fish Called Wanda,'' Stephane Audran for ``Babette's Feast'' and
Maggie Smith for ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne.''
   Judi Dench, a previous winner in the category, was nominated for
best supporting actress for ``A Handful of Dust,'' Charles
Sturridge's movie adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel.
   Her competitors are Olympia Dukakis, Maria Aitken for ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' and Anne Archer for ``Fatal Attraction.''
   Best supporting actor candidates are Peter O'Toole for ``The Last
Emperor,'' Joss Ackland for ``White Mischief,'' Michael Palin for
``A Fish Called Wanda,'' and David Suchet for ``A World Apart.''
   The failure of ``A World Apart,'' a movie about apartheid, to
receive more nominations came as a minor surprise. Screenwriter
Shawn Slovo is its only other nominee besides Suchet.
   Such Oscar hopefuls as ``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Rain Man,''
``Working Girl,'' and ``Dangerous Liaisons'' were ineligible because
they have not yet been released in Britain.

   An accused international terrorist convicted
of transporting bombs through New Jersey was sentenced Tuesday to 30
years in prison after renouncing the United States for the ``state
terrorism'' of trying him and bombing Libya in 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. told prosecutors he
believed their claims that Yu Kikumura, 36, was a member of the
terrorist group the Japanese Red Army and that he plotted to kill
U.S. citizens to retaliate for the Libyan bombing.
   ``There is no other conclusion that can be drawn, but that you
are an international terrorist,'' Lechner said. ``There is only one
conclusion to draw from the design and construction of the bombs.
They were intended and designed for flesh and blood, not for bricks
and mortar.''
   Kikumura told the judge before sentencing that the case against
him was a ploy by the U.S. government to justify the bombing of
Libya.
   ``I denounce the government of the U.S. for the legal handling of
my case and for using this case to justify the attacks on the
country and people of Libya,'' said Kikumura in heavily accented
English.
   ``I am not linked to Libya. I do not have the background claimed
by the United States,'' he added.
   Kikumura said the attacks against Libya violated international
law.
   ``So I denounce these immorals acts of state terrorism,'' he said.
   Dressed in an olive shirt and tan pants, Kikumura stroked his
chest-length black beard, smiled and chuckled through much of the
six-hour hearing. He repeatedly left his seat to examine government
evidence against him.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said Kikumura planned to use the bombs
to destroy a military recruitment office in the Veteran's
Administration building in lower Manhattan.
   ``He's a terrorist and he has been a terrorist,'' said Alito,
arguing that Kikumura's attorney offered no other reason why
Kikumura had the three bombs.
   Attorney William Kunstler argued that prosecutors offered no firm
evidence that his client Kikumura planned to use the bombs.
   Investigators testified that they used hotel and store receipts
to track Kikumura's travels through New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee,
Kentucky and West Virginia as he picked up bomb parts before his
April 12 arrest on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   Alito argued for the maximum 100 years in prison for the
explosives and firearms charges. Defense attorneys argued for 27 to
33 months imprisonment.
   Alito said outside the courtroom that he was pleased with the
judge's sentence.
   ``The sentence was based on what he did, and what he intended to
do,'' he said. ``That was to set off those bombs and kill people.''
   Kunstler and an associate, Ronald Kuby, said they would appeal
the case on grounds that include whether the search of Kikumura's
car was constitutional.
   State trooper Joseph Fuentes testified at the sentencing hearing
that witnesses told investigators they saw Kikumura at the
recruitment center in the Veterans Administration building in lower
Manhattan. Fuentes also said the building was marked by felt-tip pen
on a map found inside Kikumura's car when he was arrested.
   Also circled on the map were Columbia University, New York
University and a lower-Manhattan state university campus, Fuentes
said.
   Kunstler objected to Fuentes' testimony, saying he should have
the right to question any eyewitnesses, but Lechner said such
testimony was admissible at a sentencing hearing.
   FBI Agent Thomas Thurman, who testified as an expert in
explosives, said the bombs were capable of causing many deaths and
extensive damage.
   ``There would be mass casualties and destruction to the point of
the doors being blown out ... chairs and tables in the room would be
picked up and shattered,'' he said.
   Courtroom security was heavy for all of Kikumura's court
appearances. U.S. marshals toted rifles and shotguns and extra metal
detectors were set up.
   Authorities also closed a westbound lane of the Holland Tunnel
between New York and New Jersey for 15 minutes as Kikumura was
brought to and from a New York City jail.
   Prosecutors said Kikumura is a member of the terrorist group
known as the Japanese Red Army, which may want him killed.
   Alito said Kikumura planned to carry out the bombing in
conjunction with the April 14, 1988, attack on a USO club in Naples,
Italy, that killed five people, including a U.S.
servicewoman.Kikumura was arrested two days before the Naples blast,
which was on the second anniversary of the U.S. air strike against
Libya.

<HEAD>Court Officer Will Decide Whether to Charge Michael Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Reagan, the former
president's son, met Tuesday with a hearing officer who will decide
whether he should be prosecuted for allegedly making a threatening
call to a photographer.
   Reagan, 43, arrived for the hearing at the City Attorney's Office
with his sister, Maureen, said office spokesman Ted Goldstein.
   ``She was here for moral support for her brother,'' Goldstein
said.
   Reagan and free-lance photojournalist Roger Sandler, who filed a
criminal complaint against him, attended a 35-minute meeting with
court hearing officer Connie Seim.
   ``It seemed to be a civil, congenial meeting. The door was
open,'' Goldstein said.
   Seim will decide within 10 days whether Reagan should be charged
with a misdemeanor crime, Goldstein said.
   Details of the meeting were not disclosed.
   Afterwards, Reagan and his sister were met by photographers as
they tried to leave, but Maureen Reagan blocked a stairwell to
prevent them from pursuing her brother, Goldstein said.
   Sandler filed his complaint after a caller identifying himself as
Reagan left an obscene and threatening message on Sandler's
answering machine Jan. 15.
   The caller threatened Sandler with physical harm and said ``I
hope your (expletive) family dies in a plane crash with you in it.''
   Reagan has acknowledged leaving a message on Sandler's machine
and apologized.
   ``I lost my cool, which I should not have done,'' Reagan said.
   The call was made after Reagan received a subpoena from Sandler.
In a small claims action, the photographer is seeking $1,500 for
copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in Reagan's 1988
book, ``On the Outside Looking In.''
   Under California law, it is a misdemeanor for a person to call
another individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or
threaten to inflict injury. The charge carries a maximum six-month
jail term and a $1,000 fine upon conviction.

   A student is suspected of starting a fire
that caused extensive damage to a utility room at a high school
Tuesday, but no one was injured, authorities said.
   The fire at Shadyside High School in this eastern Ohio city was
reported at 2:55 p.m., about the time students were leaving for the
day, firefighter Norman Davis said. The blaze was contained about 1{
hours later, he said.
   Teachers spread word of the fire from classroom to classroom and
the school's approximately 270 students escaped before smoke was
visible in the main building, authorities said. No injuries were
reported.
   A juvenile who is a student at the school is suspected of setting
the blaze, said Shadyside police Chief Mike Valloric. Police would
not release the boy's age and turned the case over to prosecutors.
   Fire damage was confined to the utility room, although
firefighters also opened two holes in the gymnasium roof,
Superintendent Robert Henry said.

   Hundreds of troops
infuriated over the size of a pay award rampaged through the streets
of the capital Wednesday, assaulting people and destroying
government property and a police vehicle.
   Witnesses said the soldiers blocked traffic and attacked
journalists who tried to cover the rally and stole their cameras.
Local radio said police fired tear gas to disperse the troops when
they arrived at Parliament House from the Murray Barracks.
   The reports said the soldiers tore up trees and plants and
smashed traffic signals as the government met in emergency session
to discuss their grievances.
   The witnesses spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Australian Associated Press said the soldiers were angry over a
pay raise they claimed benefited only officers. It said the pay
increase was the first since independence in 1975. It gave no
comparative figures.
   Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu was out of town but was reported
flying back to Port Moresby because of the outbreak.
   A former U.N. Australian trust territory, Papua New Guinea became
a fully independent state on Sept. 16, 1975. Its more than 3 million
inhabitants occupy the east half of New Guinea island and nearby
islands in the southwest Pacific.

   A bomb exploded in the northern city
of San Pedro Sula on Tuesday, damaging a telephone exchange and
nearby buildings. A leftist terrorist group claimed responsibility.
   No one was hurt in the pre-dawn blast and one man found under
suspicious circumstances in the area was arrested for questioning,
according to police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
sources refused to elaborate.
   Isidoro Martinez, the telephone company manager, said in a
telephone interview the explosion at 4:45 a.m. (5:45 a.m. EST) badly
damaged the two-story exchange building, a movie theater on the
first floor and a hospital across the street.
   The blast also smashed window panes in the area, Martinez said.
   Martinez said the explosion caused more than $25,000 in damage
and cut communications service in a large area in San Pedro Sulas,
Honduras' second-largest city about 125 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
He said it will take about a week to restore service.
   An anonymous telephone call to San Pedro Sula's Radio Norte a few
hours later said the ``Cinchonero'' Popular Liberation Movement, a
small leftist terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The group has claimed responsibility for kidnappings,
assassinations and bombings in Honduras in the past eight years, and
such anonymous claims have usually turned out to be true.
   ``Cinchonero'' is Spanish slang for a make of horse saddle-belts
and the group takes its name from Serapio Romero, a saddle-belt
maker who led an abortive peasant revolution and was executed by
firing squad in 1869.
   The ``Cinchoneros'' and other small leftist groups have been
protesting the Honduran government's policy of supporting the United
State in trying to isolate the leftist Sandinista government in
neighboring Nicaragua.
   The U.S.-supported Contra rebels, fighting the Sandinistas for
the past seven years, are allowed by the military to keep supply and
training bases inside Honduras, along the Nicaraguan border.
   As part of that police, the United States maintains a permanent
military presence in Honduras and troops hold joint exercises
regularly.
   Also Tuesday, a leftist group claimed responsiblity for a
shooting attack last week on a convoy of about 30 U.S. soldiers.
   ``We will not rest until we have kicked out all the Yankee
troops,'' an anonymous caller, claiming to be a member of the
Morazanist Patriotic Front, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   No one was injured in the Feb. 1 incident in Yoro province, about
125 miles of Tegucigalpa.

<HEAD>Financial Adviser Pleads Guilty To Embezzlement, Wire Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial planner Henry Gherman, who fled to the Far
East last summer with nearly $10 million in investors' money,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal embezzlement and mail fraud
charges.
   Under a plea bargain agreement negotiated by federal officials
and Gherman's attorney, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
the defendant faces a possible maximum penalty of 35 years in prison.
   Gherman, 52, also could be fined $1.75 million. The question of
restitution depends on bankruptcy court proceedings, according to
U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Crockett.
   Although Gherman was arrested in Tokyo in early October 1988 and
was returned to Miami late last December, he had never been indicted
by a federal grand jury when plea negotiations got under way.
   The plea agreement was filed Tuesday with the U.S. Attorney's
office, and is subject to approval by a federal judge, who will hand
down the actual sentence.
   The court document charged that Gherman ``willfully and
unlawfully devised a scheme to defraud, obtain money and property
from clients'' of Financial and Investment Planning Inc. in North
Miami Beach.
   At one point, the document said, Gherman made false claims to
solicit funds from clients, most of them prominent southern Florida
physicians.
   From December 1982 to August 1983, Gherman embezzled
approximately $9.8 million in funds entrusted to him, according to
the information. Of those funds, about $7.5 million were from
retirement plans he set up for clients, the document said.
   Soon after fleeing the United States early last August, he set up
offshore bank accounts at the Swiss-American National Bank in
Antigua, West Indies, to transfer and launder the embezzled money,
the document said.
   But even as he entered the guilty plea, Gherman told U.S.
District Judge Stanley Marcus, ``I didn't solicit any money. The
money did go into'' Financial and Investment Planning.
   ``I'm guilty of all the charges, but I was not hustling money. I
didn't go out and live it up.''
   Gherman, who had left behind photocopied notes apologizing to his
clients, was first located in Taiwan and later arrested at a posh
Tokyo hotel.
   ``With this guilty plea the ends of justice have been served,''
said Dexter Lehtinen, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
Florida. ``This is a very stiff possible sentence for white-collar
crime.''
   The judge set sentencing for April 26.

   Southwestern farmers struggled to save their citrus crops today
and Idaho ranchers searched for livestock smothered in seemingly
bottomless snow drifts as a deadly arctic air mass shattered more
weather records across the nation.
   Ice covered vast parts of the Southeast and Texas, causing power

glassy roads. New Orleans went ahead with its soggy Mardi Gras, but
other Louisiana towns decided that this Fat Tuesday would be spent

   At least 61 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31,
when frigid air broke out of Alaska.
   Among the latest was a 59-year-old Chicago man found frozen to

   Congressional leaders are offering cautious
praise for President Bush's plan to bail out the savings and loan
industry, but many are wary of his proposal to sock the taxpayers
for about half the $90 billion initial cost.
   Bush on Monday offered a complex financing scheme mixing tax
dollars with higher insurance premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls.
   He also called for an overhaul of the financial regulatory system
aimed at preventing S&amp;L problems from recurring, vowed to pursue
wrongdoers in the industry and pledged to protect insured deposits.
He recommended no direct fee on depositors.
   ``In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savers
have not lost one dollar of insured deposits and I am determined
that they never will,'' the president said at a news conference.

   Exhaustion from the presidential campaign and
post-election letdown led Kitty Dukakis to a drinking problem, Gov.
Michael Dukakis said in announcing that his ``courageous'' wife has
begun treatment for alcohol abuse.
   At a news conference Monday, Dukakis said his wife, who conquered
a 26-year addiction to diet pills, had entered a private alcohol
treatment center in Newport, R.I.
   He said his wife's underlying chemical dependency flared into
bouts of excessive drinking after his loss to George Bush in the
November presidential election.
   ``As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or is
solid, if you are chemically dependent, you are chemically
dependent,'' Dukakis said.

   Kitty Dukakis' recent episodes of heavy drinking
after overcoming a long dependence on diet pills is a sadly typical
pattern of switching from one abused substance to another, doctors
say.
   ``It is obviously the case, especially nowadays, that addiction
or dependence on more than one substance is rather common,'' said
Dr. Peter Nathan, director of the Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies
in Piscataway, N.J.
   For reasons that are not well understood, people who have trouble
with one mood-altering substance are especially susceptible to
excessive use of others.
   ``Drug switching does occur, and the drug that's easiest to
switch into is alcohol,'' said Dr. Roger Weiss of McLean Hospital in
Belmont. ``It's easy to get, cheap, legal and the most socially
acceptable.''

ethical conflicts after several of his top appointees faced
questions on that very issue.
   Bush on Monday said that two of them, White House legal counsel
C. Boyden Gray, who is also Bush's top ethics adviser, and Cabinet
nominee Dr. Louis Sullivan, had gone beyond what was legally
required by disentangling themselves from outside business
arrangements.
   And Bush said he had seen nothing so far beyond rumor and
innuendo regarding a third, Defense Secretary-designate John Tower,
whose confirmation is on hold while a Senate committee checks new
allegations of drinking and womanizing by the former senator.

   Opposition politicians who have for
years pushed for free and fair elections say coup leader Gen. Andres
Rodriguez' setting of elections for May 1 will not give them time to
organize campaigns.
   Some say they believe Rodriguez set the early date precisely
because the opposition cannot possibly be ready by then to mount a
serious challenge to the long-entrenched ruling party.
   Rodriguez, who ousted dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a
bloody coup last week, dissolved parliament on Monday and set the
May 1 date for presidential and congressional elections.
   He said only the Communist Party would be banned from fielding

   Barbara Tuchman was remembered upon her
death as the popular historian whose 1962 ``The Guns of August''
reminded the superpowers of the dangers of diplomatic miscalculation
as they teetered on the brink.
   The two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and author of 10 books,
including the current best seller ``The First Salute,'' died Monday

   ```The Guns of August' had a tremendous impact on President
Kennedy and all who went through the Cuban missile crisis,'' said
William Manchester, author of ``The Death of a President'' and
writer-in-residence at Wesleyan University in Middletown.
   Tuchman's latest book, ``The First Salute,'' a look at the

years, has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than
nine weeks.

   Insurance companies developed the technique
hundreds of years ago: The larger the pool of those paying for
insurance, the lower the risk and the cost to any one of them.
   And now it has been confirmed politically, as it has been before,
by the Bush administration's proposals for dealing with the problem
of paying off the obligations of bankrupt savings and loan
associations.
   The reverse of the insurance concept is that whenever costs,
risks or obligations are confined to a few the pain is likely to be
so great and the threat so imminent that whatever plan is offered
will be deemed unacceptable.
   When the pool is shallow there is no security. Those involved
complain about the high risks and high costs, and they demand that
both be distributed more widely. A bigger pool distributes all these
_ the complaints too.
   In the S&amp;L case, the idea of placing the cost directly on
depositors at savings and loan and banking institutions was rejected
before it was even formally proposed. The pool was too small, the
pain too great.
   Under the formal plan described Tuesday by President Bush, the
government would add $50 billion in bonds to the $40 billion already
earmarked by Washington, with interest costs shared by taxpayers and
the savings industry.
   Banks and thrift institutions, such as savings and loan
associations and credit unions _ would be charged higher federal
insurance premiums to help pay the bills. Insurance for depositors
would not be raised, at least directly.
   In addition, government would spend from budgeted funds some $50
billion to finance a Justice Department program to monitor financial
activities and prosecute illegalities. Eventually, more funds could
be needed for regulation.
   In effect, the pool was made so large that, conceivably, everyone
will pay _institutions, depositors (through lower earnings on
savings), and the general taxpaying public (which finances
government enterprises).
   It would not set a precedent if, in retrospect, it was seen that
the bulk of the proposal's costs fell on the general public.
   The reasoning for such speculation is that:
   (1) When conditions permit, business tends to pass on rather than
absorb additional costs. Tax business and the added expense filters
down to the buyer of the product. Add expenses to lenders and it
shows up in their rates.
   (2) Any governmental expense eventually becomes a charge to the
taxpayer. It might be impossible to trace the route by which this
occurs, but sooner or later it shows up in such things as budget
deficits and taxes.
   Perhaps hoping that the potential $100 billion cost of the rescue
program might somehow be absorbed in the intricate filtering system,
Bush nevertheless concedes there is no guarantee that costs won't be
passed down.
   More realistically he added at his news conference: ``Nothing is
without pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude.''
   Experience suggests he is right.
   That experience shows the pain can be lessened for the few by
spreading it among the many, but that there is no machinery of
government, ingenuity of industry or wishful thinking of ordinary
citizens that can make it disappear.

   The Plaza Hotel was in for a jolt when four
mopheads from Liverpool settled in a 12th floor suite for a short
winter's stay in February 1964.
   They dove into room service: J&amp;B Scotch with Coca-Cola. They
binged on ``jam butties'' (butter and jelly sandwiches), corn flakes
and ice cream, and left bowls full of stubbed out ``ciggies.'' The
first morning, 37 sacks of mail arrived. And girls.
   Lots of girls.
   Screaming, screeching, silly schoolchildren who would kill their
grandmothers for a glimpse of John, Paul, George and Ringo.
   The lasses dressed as chambermaids and tried to sneak into the
suite. They posed as record company representatives. Anything. They
stormed the hotel's revolving doors only to be dumped
unceremoniously on the street with legions of their shrieking
sisters.
   It was the first magical mystery tour for The Beatles. They
landed at Kennedy Airport on Feb. 7 to make their legendary first
appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Feb. 9.
   For 15 days, the country became inflamed with Beatlemania, and it
would be years before the fever would die down.
   They were cocky and sure at their news conferences. At one, John
Lennon was asked how much money he expected to earn during the tour.
His response: ``About half a crown. Depends on the tax. How much
have you got?'' And to what did they owe their success? ``Good press
agent,'' John replied.
   Ringo Starr was asked what he thought of Beethoven. His reply:
``Great. 'Specially his poems.''
   It was a lark.
   No one at that moment realized the rich gift and legacy to emerge
from the four musicians. They went on to sell more than any group in
pop history. Indeed, after their appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show,'' the Beatles sold 2.5 million records in the United States in
less than a month.
   Lennon is dead now, shot outside his Manhattan apartment building
on Dec. 8, 1980.
   George Harrison lives with his second wife, Olivia, and
9-year-old son, Dhani, in a fortress-like Gothic mansion with spires
and turrets at Henley-on-Thames in western England. He has lived out
of the limelight for nearly 20 years, but reemerged somewhat in 1987
to give his first full concert in 15 years in July at Wembley Arena
and to record a hit single, ``Got My Mind Set On You,'' which topped
the U.S. Cash Box music chart in January 1988.
   He also has recorded with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty in
a tongue-in-cheek group known as the Traveling Wilburys, and he is
co-owner and an executive producer of the independent British film
company, Handmade Films (``The Missionary,'' ``Life of Brian'').
   Starr spent five weeks in an American alcoholism clinic last fall
with his wife, actress Barbara Bach. They live in a secluded estate
near Ascot in southern England. He became the first Beatle
grandfather when his 20-year-old son, Zak Starkey, eldest of three
children from his first wife, Maureen, became a father on Sept. 7,
1985.
   Paul McCartney is working on an album, which includes some songs
co-written by Elvis Costello, to be released later this year. He has
too many commitments to consider the 25th anniversary, his spokesman
Bernard Doherty said. ``There have been a number of anniversaries in
recent years. There will be lots of anniversaries coming up. He's
still very busy making music.''
   McCartney said in a live radio phone-in on the BBC's Russian
Service last month that the Beatles will never be revived because
``to find a replacement for John is impossible.''
   McCartney has four children. His family lives on a fortified
forest estate in Sussex in southeast England.
   But in 1964, the Beatles had scarcely begun. Although wildly
popular on the continent, the fabulous four and their records did
not catch on in the United States until Jan. 17 when ``I Want to
Hold Your Hand'' hit No. 1 on the Cashbox chart.
   Within a year, they grossed $1.6 million in the first week's
showing of their movie, ``A Hard's Day Night,'' and Lennon's kooky
book, ``In His Own Write,'' climbed best seller lists overnight. In
rapid succession, they made six hit albums, including 1967's anthem
to the Summer of Love, ``Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.''
   ``Sgt. Pepper'' sold 2.5 million records in its first three
months and stayed on the charts for a staggering 113 weeks. Capitol
Records estimates the album's worldwide sales at 15 million since
1967.
   This alternately melancholy, terrifying and exhilarating record
captured as no other the complex textures of its time: a
supercharged, corrosively contradictory summer when hippies grooved
at the Monterey Pop Festival, black emotions exploded in riots in
Detroit and Newark and a war grew bloodier in Vietnam. Youthful
listeners somehow heard all of this in ``Sgt. Pepper,'' an album
whose themes included Eastern culture, sweet and terrifying
psychedelic fantasies, the widening gulf between young and old and,
above all, loneliness.
   ``To me, the Beatles created an excitement about being in the
business itself,'' says songwriter and performer Christopher Cross.
``They stick out to me as the greatest thing in pop music. Paul
McCartney has always been, and remains, my biggest influence of all
time because of song structure. He and John taught me how to write
songs.''
   Cross, who won four Grammy Awards in 1981 for his song and LP,
``Sailing,'' was 12 when he saw the Beatles on ``Ed Sullivan.''

line to the operator of the PAVE PAWS radar installation two miles
south of the airfield.
   The radar operator flips a switch, and for several minutes until
the plane lands safely, one-half of the $90 million radar, built to
provide instantaneous warning of any submarine-launched missile off
the southeastern United States, is shut down.
   Since November 1987, the Air Force now acknowledges, the north
face of PAVE PAWS at Robins has been turned off an average of 14
times a month _ for a total down time of about an hour a month _ to
allow planes carrying externally mounted EEDs to land.
   The interruptions in the operation of the high-tech strategic
defense system are intended to avoid accidental detonations of the
EEDs, tiny explosive charges that are found in virtually every
military weapons system and in the planes and ships that deliver
them.
   EEDs are used, among other things, to trigger weapons, drop
bombs, or jettison fuel tanks. They normally are detonated by an
electrical circuit, but they also can be set off by high levels of
electromagnetic energy from such environmental sources as radio
waves, radar emissions, static electricity and lightning.
   The Air Force insists that the periodic interruptions of the
Robins PAVE PAWS have not hindered the effectiveness of the nation's
early warning system, because the shutdowns are random and other
radars are available as backups. Routine maintenance, the Air Force
says, shuts the radar down for about 40 hours a month.
   ``Our primary concern at Robins with PAVE PAWS is safety of
flight,'' said Lt. Col. John Harmon, commander of the base
communications squadron. ``We want to make sure that we have
procedures in effect so there is no possibility of any plane having
externally mounted EEDs flying in a dangerous situation.''
   PAVE PAWS stands for Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased
Array Warning System. The 10-story, pyramid shaped installation at
Robins, one of four PAVE PAWS facilities nationwide, consists of
thousands of computer-directed antennas that can scan 240 degrees
for 3,000 miles. The radar reportedly can identify an object the
size of a basketball 1,500 miles away.
   The radar near Robins is the only one located near an active
runway; there have been no problems reported near the others.
   PAVE PAWS had been in operation for a year at Robins before top
Air Force officials became convinced that its powerful
electromagnetic emissions might endanger their aircraft.
   They then instituted the periodic shutdown procedures and
established a restricted zone around the radar of one nautical mile,
about 6,000 feet, for all aircraft flying at or below 6,400 feet.
   The Air Force contends it has taken a conservative, safety
conscious approach at Robins. But critics, such as Patricia Axelrod,
coordinator of the HERO Project, charge that the location of the
radar, near a runway and a base where ordnance is handled, is a
disaster waiting to happen. The air base, Georgia's largest, is
located near the community of Warner-Robins, population 40,000.
   The HERO Project, which derives its name from the Navy acronym
Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance, is part of a
coalition that has filed suit in federal court in Washington
alleging that the military has not shielded its weaponry
sufficiently to prevent accidents.
   Axelrod, and the defense specialists who are assisting her in the
lawsuit, contend that the 6,000-foot hazard zone around PAVE PAWS is
not sufficient. She cited Navy documents recommending that the EA-6
Prowler airplane, laden with electronic-warfare equipment far less
powerful than PAVE PAWS, be kept at least 8,000 feet away from areas
where ordnance is handled.
   Axelrod also argues that the flight restrictions at Robins force
pilots into ``a trapeze act without a net'' because of the
possibility of human error in the chain of communication required to
shut down the radar when an at-risk plane is landing.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, also has criticized the restrictions because of their
reliance ``on the potentially fallible human links between the
pilot, control tower, and PAVE PAWS radar operators.''
   Nunn has asked the Air Force for an official evaluation of the
potential hazards of the radar emissions to aircraft flight safety
at Robins and the long-term adequacy of the current procedures for
minimizing that hazard.
   Lt. Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, who heads the Air Force Space Command
that has jurisdiction over PAVE PAWS, acknowledged in a recent
interview that he would rather have the radar someplace else.
   ``Based on what I know today, the radar may not hurt anything,
but there is some concern, otherwise there wouldn't be any flight
restrictions,'' he said. ``If I had the choice, all things being
equal, I would put the radar where I would not have to impose any
safety zone.''
   The Air Force said the initial environmental assessment for PAVE
PAWS concluded that the restricted zone needed around the radar
would not interfere with the flight paths of any aircraft using the
Robins runway.
   That conclusion was changed in 1987 when new calculations were
done while the Air Force was developing plans to triple the power of
PAVE PAWS to enhance its other mission, tracking satellites in
space. The new calculations indicated that a larger restricted zone
was needed.
   The key difference in the new calculation was the way the radar's
power was determined. The first assessment used the average power of
the radar pulses over time, while the later one used the peak power
of each pulse.
   Air Force officials acknowledge that the contractor who did the
initial assessment recommended using peak power to calculate the
restricted zone. The recommendation was rejected because Air Force
experts at the time did not believe brief exposure of and EED to the
radar pulses would constitute a hazard.
   ``We were on the cutting edge of technology with PAVE PAWS at the
time we made that initial environmental assessment,'' Kutyna said.
``To have learned something new since that time does not say that
you were making a mistake before.''
   The Air Force already has spent $600,000 on a study of the
problem by the Raytheon Corp., which built the radar system. The
study recommended moving the installation, at a cost of $37.7
million, or modifying it, at a cost of $27 million, so it would shut
down automatically if a plane breached the restricted zone.
   Kutyna said moving the radar is not a viable option but the
modification proposal remains under consideration. He said a panel
of senior Air Force officers has been convened to make
recommendations by June on a permanent solution that will end the
flight restrictions.
   In the meantime, the Air Force has shelved plans to triple the
radar's power so it could take over the space tracking functions of
the outdated radar system at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, at an
annual savings of $11 million.
   ``Unless there is a solution in the books that comes out of this
study, I would say the chances of putting that upgrade on there at
this time are not high,'' Kutyna said.

<TEXT>
   Ivan, the Soviet Union's GI Joe, is marching home
from Afghanistan after 9 years and 1{ months of combat. As many as
15,000 of his comrades died in the war he fought there against
Moslem guerrillas; 35,000 others were wounded.
   Dispatched to Afghanistan in December 1979 ostensibly at the
request of the pro-Moscow government, Ivan leaves now with the
stability of the Marxist regime apparently as menaced as ever. And
his government learned the lesson that Vietnam taught the United
States 15 years ago: Even a superpower can't win someone else's war.
   As a convoy of more than 100 Soviet tanks and trucks set out for
the border Feb. 9, President Najib of Afghanistan assured reporters
that ``state power is in full control of the situation,'' but as he
spoke to reporters in Kabul, his capial, explosions and artillery
fire echoed throughout the city.
   Some 120,000 strong, the Soviets battled the Afghan resistance
for more than twice as long as it took their fathers to drive Nazi
invaders back from Stalingrad, Leningrad and Moscow and all the way
to Berlin in World War II.
   But as the Red Army pulled out of Afghanistan, the mujahedeen
rebels were able to block regular shipments of flour and kerosene
even to the 2 million inhabitants of Kabul. Other cities, including
Gardez and Khost, were also besieged, the Soviets reported.
   Like Vietnam for the Americans, Afghanistan confounded the
Kremlin's best and brightest. Their cause, they said, was building
socialism in a poor, mountainous land that even Afghan Marxists say
is ``99 percent Moslem'' and where every invader through history has
met ferocious resistance.
   ``We obviously overestimated our possibilities and underestimated
what one might call `the resistance of the medium','' said one
Soviet commentator, Alexander Bovin. ``And in Afghanistan, we paid
the highest price of all _ the price of blood.''
   ``An incorrect prediction was made,'' author Alexander Prokhanov
wrote last year. ``Experts were wrong in their assessment of the
situation in the country. Mistakes were made by specialists in
Islam, diplomats, politicians, the military. Because, I repeat, the
main aims were not achieved.''
   Leonid I. Brezhnev, the the Soviet president, said he ordered
tanks and troops to cross the 1,300-mile border with the Soviet
Union's Texas-size neighbor Dec. 24-27, 1979, to counter what he
described as Western efforts to create a foyer of Islamic
fundamentalism at the Soviet doorstep.
   For the Kremlin to have done nothing, Brezhnev said soon after
the intervention, would have been ``to watch passively the formation
on our southern border of a serious danger to the security of the
Soviet state.''
   The decision to intervene was opposed by some in Moscow.
   Oleg Bogomolov, now an economic adviser to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, disclosed last year that the think tank he heads, the
Institute of Economics of the World Socialist System, sent a message
to the Kremlin within weeks of the intervention opposing it as
``futile and damaging.''
   The memo, Bogomolov recalled, said the invasion blocked detente
with the United States, eliminated chances for limiting the arms
race and sapped Kremlin influence in Moslem countries and the Third
World.
   Indeed, the Western world reacted with outrage. And the shock
waves rippled far from Afghanistan, prompting the United States to
suspend grain sales and the export of high-technology electronic
gear coveted by a Soviet society left far behind by the information
explosion. Sixty-four nations joined a boycott of the 1980 Summer
Olympics in Moscow, and the Kremlin, stung by criticism of its
actions, banished human rights activist Andrei D. Sahkarov to
internal exile after he protested the invasion.
   President Jimmy Carter called the Soviet drive into Afghanistan
``the most serious threat to peace since the Second World War''
because it brought the other superpower within easy striking
distance of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, which Carter proclaimed vital
to U.S. security.
   Even top members of the Kremlin hierarchy were caught by surprise.
   ``There are even candidate members of the Politburo who learned
that troops had entered Afghanistan only after reading the
newspapers,'' editor Grigory Baklanov said in a speech last year.
   What may have beguiled the Soviets was the apparent similarity of
Afghanistan to their own heavily Moslem Central Asian republics,
where Bolshevik rule was imposed in the 1920s by Communist
commissars leading Red Army troops against local tribal bands.
   Portrayed by the Soviet press as liberators, Red Army troops went
to help their Afghan comrades build a Marxist-Leninist society, or
so the official thinking went.
   But in Afghanistan, Prokhanov said, ``sobering events dispelled
many illusions. ... Crowds of many thousands, carrying the green
Moslem banner and shouting `Allah Akhbar,' stormed the (party)
district committees.''
   He blamed Najib's party, the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan, both for doctrinaire measures _ ``the persecution of
mullahs and the flouting of customs'' _ and for abandoning the goals
of the country's 1978 Marxist revolution.
   ``Since those December days when the U.S.S.R.'s troops went into
Afghanistan, the Kabul government's political course has changed
many times,'' Prokhanov said. ``The original aims proclaimed by the
PDPA were not achieved. They have been renounced by the party
itself. ... And that being so, the presence of Soviet troops in the
country loses its meaning. Departure is inevitable, logical.''
   In a 1986 speech, Gorbachev placed the blame for the continuing
strife in Afghanistan on the West, but he voiced the Soviets'
growing desire to get out.
   ``Counterrevolution and imperialism,'' he said, ``have turned
Afghanistan into a bleeding wound.''
   Although the horrors of the Afghan war, unlike Vietnam, were
never brought regularly into Soviets' living rooms on television,
the loosened restraints on expression inspired by Gorbachev's drive
for ``glasnost,'' or openness, increasingly emboldened Soviets to
voice objections to the war.
   A documentary film titled ``The Return,'' which made its way into
theaters last year, showed wounded Soviet soldiers and blown-up
tanks for the first time. It also showed troubled veterans and a
bereaved mother.
   ``I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' said a tearful Klavdia
Ilyin, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the
background. ``I don't see why our children are there.''
   In February 1988, Gorbachev said the Soviets were pulling out
whether or not Najib's efforts at ``national reconciliation'' were
successful. In effect, the Soviets abandoned any claim they had on
``safeguarding'' the gains of socialism in Afghanistan.
   Like the British cavalry whose noble but futile charge in the
Crimean War is honored in Tennyson's poem ``The Charge of the Light
Brigade,'' Ivan the soldier is now praised for his valor in a noble
cause _ but not for victory.
   ``Planes carrying soldiers are flying out of Afghanistan,''
Pravda wrote the other day. ``Military columns are starting out on
the road, or are just about to. For home. For the motherland.
Soldiers are coming back from the war, having done their duty.''
   Despite such ritualist talk of duty, a stanza from a song of
Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan shows the bewilderment and futility
many felt:
   ``They fight for the Prophet Mohammed,
   ``While we defend only our Soviet truck.''

   The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
leaves the rugged, South Asian country physically and economically
ravaged, its political future uncertain and large numbers of its
people scattered in safer havens.
   More than a third of the country's 15 million Pathans, Tajiks and
people of other tribes have fled to Pakistan and Iran as fighting
continues between forces of the communist government and Moslem
guerrillas.
   Much of the country's agricultural-based economy is in ruins. Its
roads are lined with wrecked implements of war. Its lunar landscape
remains littered with mines.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which seized
power in a 1978 military coup, still sits in Kabul but its mainly
conscripted army has only tenuous control of the cities.
   The mujahedeen (Islamic ``holy warriors'') claim to hold 90
percent of the countryside.
   Their stated goal is to rout the communists and establish an
Islamic republic of Afghanistan but their myriad factions have
failed repeated attempts to forge a united political front.
   ``It shows the futility of military solutions,'' said Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on a recent visit to Pakistan
which, in addition to the United States, has backed the guerrillas
for a decade.
   In human terms, the cost is estimated at more than 1 million
Afghan and 15,000 Soviet war dead.
   It was the Marxist coup which set off the civil war. Soviet
troops and armor intervened in December 1979 to replace one
pro-Moscow government with another but the Moslem insurgency only
intensified.
   Afghanistan's President Najib, who uses only one name and has
shortened it from Najibullah, insists that his forces can hold
Kabul, the capital, without the Red Army's help.
   However, the mujahedeen claim his army is demoralized and that
several of its leaders are bargaining to surrender.
   Even Najib's own party is divided from within between his urban
Parcham (Banner) wing and the Khalq (Masses) faction, which
predominates the military.
   Western diplomats speculate that a great deal of terrorist
bombings and gunfire in Kabul are related to this factionalism and
not to the war with mujahedeen.
   United Nations officials say Afghanistan will need massive
reconstruction once the fighting stops. No one has been able to
predict when.
   Many of the country's once thriving orchards, cottonfields and
vinyards have been destroyed by Soviet-Afghan carpet bombing or have
grown wild for lack of care, according to U.N. estimates.
   Its mineral mining industry is damaged or lies idle for lack of
trained workers. Most of them either are fighting the war, living as
refugees or are dead.
   The United Nations is planning a $1.1 billion relief and
recontruction project named Operation Salaam, which means ``peace''
in Arabic. Officials say they can't begin the gargantuan task until
fighting in Afghanistan stops.
   ``This is a very crucial time and we have to give peace a
chance,'' said Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan, the U.N. Special
coordinator of the project, who has been shuttling between
Islamabad, Kabul and Moscow to oversee the logistics.
   The organization's High Commissionerate for Refugees has
predicted that the repatriation of more than 3 million Afghan
refugees from Pakistan and 2 million from Iran will be the biggest
human transmigration in U.N. History.
   Even if peace lures the refugees home, millions of landmines and
smaller, explosive booby traps await them.
   Teams from the United States, France and Turkey already have
begun visiting refugee camps along Pakistan's Frontier to teach the
Afghans how to identify the devices and defuse them.
   Exacerbating the Afghans' suffering has been one of the worst
winters in recent memory. Snow and mujahedeen attacks on supply
convoys have left Kabul and other Afghan cities desparately short of
food and fuel.
   The first stage of Operation Salaam is an airlift of food,
blankets and medicines.
   Mujahedeen factions, though organized in the field, have failed
to unite in a political front that can form an alternative to the
Kabul government.
   The seven most powerful groups are Sunni Moslems and comprise the
loose, seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahedeen headquartered
in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   At least eight other, smaller groups are Shiite Moslems and
operate from Iran.
   The two sides frequently have traded gunfire during the war, as
have the component parties of the two alliances. All profess a
desire to form an Islamic government but personal rivalries among
the rebel leaders appear to be the biggest obstacle.
   It reflects Afghanistan's history as a feudal society ruled by
tribal leaders and local warlords who for centuries spurned the
notion of centralized government.
   ``This entire war has been one of partiality. That has not
changed,'' said Hamed Karzai, a spokesman of the Pakistan-based
rebel alliance. ``We are Moslems, but very peculiar Moslems.''
   The war nudged Pakistan closer to Washington as the pipeline for
U.S. arms to the mujahedeen. It helped distract the
Democrat-controlled Congress in Washington from the issue of
Pakistan's nuclear program, which some suspect is developing or has
developed nuclear weapons, and over to generous military and
economic aid treaties with Islamabad.
   ``Let's face it, Pakistan has become a good friend in a part of
the world where we don't have many,'' said U.S. Ambassador Arnold
Raphel before he wa killed last year.
   Raphel was returning to Islamabad with President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq and most of his top generals from a demonstration of the U.S.
M-1 Abrams tank in August when their Pakistani air force plane
crashed, killing all 30 people aboard.
   Investigators said the wreckage indicated sabotage. Pakistani
officials privately said the top suspects were Moscow and Kabul in
an alleged plot to eliminate the mujahedeen's staunchest patron.
   Pakistanis claim the war has cost them hundreds of lives of their
own in terrorist bombings, a glut of firearms and a burgeoning
heroin trade.
   Weapons earmarked for the rebels frequently have wound up with
the drug barons of Pakistan's North West Frontier.
   Pakistani narcotics officials claim the fighting in Afghanistan
has diverted much of its opium and heroin production to Pakistan.
   The drugs find their way to Europe and North America via the
Arabian Sea port of Karachi, the agents say.

<TEXT>
   The defense in the first Wall Street fraud case
to go to trial is suggesting that disgraced broker and star
prosecution witness Boyd L. Jefferies may have obstructed justice
with the government's knowledge.
   Defense attorney Arthur Liman asserted in the GAF Corp. stock
manipulation case Monday that Jefferies threw out notes about his
dealings in violation of a subpoena and shortly after reaching a
plea agreement with the government.
   Liman implied before a federal jury that Jefferies intentionally
disposed of daily notes he wrote on yellow legal pads.
   Nervous under cross-examination, Jefferies said he had informed
prosecutors he was going to clear out his office.
   ``No one said you had to preserve the yellow pads?'' Liman asked.
   ``Not that I recall,'' the witness said.
   Jefferies, 58, also testified anew that GAF in October 1986 asked
him and his Los Angeles-based securities firm to manipulate the
stock price of Union Carbide Corp. and agreed to pay $40,000 to
cover losses in the deal.
   The case in federal court in Manhattan has been viewed as a key
test of the government's ability to obtain criminal convictions from
a spinoff of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe last month declared a
mistrial in the case after concluding that prosecutors withheld a
key piece of evidence from the defense.
   GAF, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and building
materials, and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, were indicted
last July for allegedly trying to inflate the price of Union Carbide
stock.
   The purpose of the alleged manipulation was to maximize GAF's
gain from the sale of its holding in Carbide after a failed attempt
to take over the much larger chemical company.
   Appearing confident under questioning from Assistant U.S.
Attorney Carl Loewenson Jr., Jefferies said he bought shares of
Union Carbide in late October 1986 at Sherwin's request to boost the
price to $22 a share. Sherwin guaranteed to cover any losses
sustained by Jefferies &amp; Co.
   ``Mr. Sherwin said if we wanted Union Carbide to close at a
specific price or higher for a few days, do you think you will be
able to do that? I said yes,'' Jefferies testified.
   Jeffries offered similar testimony at the original trial.
   Under cross-examination, Jefferies testified that on March 30,
1987, he emptied his office of notes on his daily activities after
October 1986. Liman seized on the matter to point out that Jefferies
earlier that month had agreed to cooperate with the government.
   Liman said Jefferies' subpoena from the Securities and Exchange
Commission called for all notes relevant to his activities from
January 1984 to the present.
   ``Are you saying that you don't recall whether you threw out
notes that were under subpoena?,'' Liman asked.
   ``I know I did not throw out anything when I left the company on
March 30 that pertained to any request from the government, from the
SEC,'' Jefferies countered. ``I have nothing to hide, Mr. Liman.''
   Possibly seeking to question the government's relationship with
Jefferies, Liman said destroying subpoenaed notes would constitute
obstruction of justice and said Jefferies had not been granted
immunity for destroying the notes.
   Jefferies struck a plea agreement with the government after he
was implicated in the scandal with Boesky, the jailed speculator who
agreed to turn state's evidence in late 1986.
   Jefferies agreed to plead guilty in March 1987 two securities law
violations, to quit his brokerage and to stay out of the securities
business for at least five years. He awaits sentencing.

   President Bush wants to require banks and
thrift institutions to pay higher deposit insurance premiums as part
of a plan to bail out the troubled savings and loan industry, but is
recommending no direct fee on individual depositors.
   ``We intend to restore our entire insured deposit system to
health,'' the president said Monday at a meeting with reporters at
which he outlined a comprehesive program to save the troubled S&amp;L
industry.
   The president recommended changes in the federal supervision of
the savings and loan industry, which is struggling to resolve the
difficulties of an estimated 350 faltering institutions. The
president also said he would recommend increased Justice Department
investigation of alleged wrongdoing in failed thrifts.

   U.S. workers increased their productivity by
1.4 percent last year, the government reported, an improvement over
1987 that nonetheless revived doubts about economic projections at
the heart of President Bush's spending plans.
   The 1.4 percent gain in non-farm business productivity was up
from 0.8 percent in 1987 and matched the average 1.4 percent annual
gain experienced since the end of the 1981-82 recession, the Labor
Department reported Monday.
   Total business productivity, including farming, fell at a 2.0
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1988 because of a drop
in farm productivity. Manufacturers reported a 3.2 percent increase
in productivity last year, down from 3.4 percent in 1987, the Labor
Department said.

   Policy-akers at the Federal Reserve, meeting
this week to map monetary strategy for the year, will likely set the
central bank on a collision course with the new administration and
call into question the underlying tenets of President Bush's budget,
private economists said.
   Analysts predicted Monday that the Fed will drive a variety of
interest rates, including mortgage rates and banks' prime lending
rate, higher in coming months in an effort to slow the economy to a
more sustainable pace of growth.
   Those actions will run counter to the hopes of the Bush
administration, which is looking for falling interest rates and
robust economic growth to boost government revenues and make it
easier to trim the budget deficit without breaking Bush's
no-new-taxes pledge.

   A U.S. offer of a $3.5 billion emergency loan
remains open, officials said, even though Mexico has decided not to
borrow the money and is trying to renegotiate payments on its
crippling foreign debt.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe was beginning talks in Washington,
armed with what aides described as a ``menu of options'' for
repaying the $106 billion Mexico owes foreign creditors. Late
Sunday, the Treasury Department issued a brief statement saying
Mexico would not use the $3.5 billion short-term loan the U.S.
offered in October.

   American Airlines' planned multibillion-dollar
jetliner purchases will make its fleet much younger than the
competition's, part of what some analysts called an innovative
marketing strategy to sooth the flying public's safety concerns
about old planes.
   To revamp its fleet of older wide-body jets, American is expected
to announce Tuesday orders of between 50 and 60 McDonnell Douglas
Corp. MD-11 jets, which carry about 320 passengers, and up to 100 of
the smaller MD-80s.

   The governor said Monday an important reason he could not make a

   The chairman of the opposition Democratic Socialist
Party plans to resign from his party office, a party spokesman said
Tuesday. He would be the latest politician to fall in a far-reaching
stock-profiteering scandal.
   The resignation of Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, had been expected for
weeks after he confirmed in December he had profited from selling
shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co., an information-based
conglomerate at the center of the scandal.
   Three members of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet quit
because of the scandal, a member of the Japan Socialist Party
resigned his Parliament seat, and more than a dozen other government
officials, business leaders and media executives quit their
positions because of links to Recruit.
   Since the scandal erupted last summer it has raised political
ethics to the forefront of national debate. Although the share
transactions were not illegal under securities law, they had a taint
of bribery and influence-peddling. Prosecutors have questioned
Recruit executives as well as government officials in a bribery
probe.
   Yukio Hayashi, spokesman of the Democratic Socialists, told The
Associated Press that Tsukamoto told party leaders Tuesday morning
he was resigning, and he would meet with the party's Central
Committee on Tuesday afternoon to confirm his intention to quit.
   Press reports said Tsukamoto told reporters at his home Tuesday
morning he would not run for a third two-year term as chairman when
the party holds its convention Feb. 22.
   Tsukamoto was not resigning his nine-term seat in the House of
Representatives, where his moderate party, with 29 of 512 seats, is
the third largest opposition bloc after the Japan Socialist Party
and Komeito, or the Clean Government Party.
   The Democratic Socialists had formed a tacit alliance last year
with Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party to give a semblance of
unity when Parliament passed the government's tax bill.
   Tsukamoto's links to the Recruit scandal then were seen as
helping the governing Liberal Democrats push the tax bill through
because the Social Democrats were as hobbled by the taint of scandal
as the governing party and could not take any high moral position.
   The opposition party leader earned about $77,000 by selling
shares in the Recruit real-estate subsidiary, Recruit Cosmos, which
Recruit offered him at a bargain price before the shares were listed
for public trading in 1986.
   Cabinet members who have resigned are Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa and Ken Harada, director
general of the Economic Planning Agency.

<TEXT>
   Interest rates, including mortgage rates, are
headed higher as the Federal Reserve keeps trying to dampen
inflationary pressure by slowing economic growth, many economists
predict.
   This effort will put the central bank on a collision course with
the new administration and make it more difficult for President Bush
to keep his campaign pledge to lower the budget deficit without
resorting to new taxes, analysts say.
   Fed policy-makers were gathering today for two days of
closed-door meetings to set monetary growth targets for 1989. Their
actions will not be revealed until Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan testifies to Congress on Feb. 21.
   Private economists are widely predicting that the Fed will
continue pushing interest rates higher because of fears that the
economy is still growing too rapidly to keep inflation under control.
   ``There is no question that there will be a tightening. The
question is how much,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co.
   Some economists would not rule out a one-half percentage point
increase in the Fed's discount rate, which now stands 6.5 percent,
but other analysts argued that the Fed would probably avoid such a
dramatic change in favor of more subtle behind-the-scenes tightening
moves. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges to make
loans to commercial banks.
   Since last March, the Fed has been draining bank reserves from
the system, thus making money more scarce and the cost of money _
interest rates _ higher.
   Analysts keep track of this process by watching the federal funds
rate, the interest banks charge to make loans to each other. The
federal funds rate now stands above 9 percent and analysts predict
it is likely to rise by about one-quarter percentage more in the
coming two months.
   This will likely force banks to boost their prime lending rate,
which now stands at 10.5 percent, already its highest level since
mid-1985, economists say.
   Economists also say that home loans, both adjustable and
fixed-rate mortgages, are headed higher, with some predicting that
fixed-rate mortgages will climb to around 11 percent. Currently,
fixed-rate mortgages are averaging 10.6 percent, according to a
nationwide survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., up from
9.9 percent a year ago.
   Bush has pledged to reduce this year's expected $160 billion
budget deficit by more than $60 billion in the fiscal year which
begins next Oct. 1, but such a goal would be jeopardized by the
Fed's inflation-fighting efforts.
   Bush's budget, which he will unveil on Thursday, will use the
same optimistic assessment of the economy employed by then-President
Reagan in his final budget last month.
   Fed credit-tightening already has pushed short-term interest
rates a full 2 percentage points higher than the administration's
estimate of 6.3 percent for 1989 and Fed officials are working to
slow economic growth to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent,
significantly below the 3.2 percent forecast by the administration.
   Both of these discrepancies are significant because they spell
lower government revenues, higher interest payments to finance the
$2.7 trillion national debt and a larger budget deficit.
   ``Everybody knows the administration's economic forecast can't
work,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.
``Greenspan is running the economy and Bush isn't.''
   The administration has been trying to convince the Fed that its
worries about inflation are overblown. Bush himself said last week
that Greenspan was ``more concerned about inflation than I am right
now.''
   But the Fed will likely withstand the political pressure for a
looser monetary policy, analysts said, especially in view of
business statistics showing an economy with tight labor markets and
industries operating at peak capacity.
   Fed officials hope to slow the economy enough to ward off another
inflationary spiral without dampening demand so much that it risks a
recession.
   Roger Brinner, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., said he
believed the Fed would be able to achieve this ``soft landing.''
   ``I don't think there will be a recession through 1990 because
the Fed acted early to fight inflation and continues to avoid any
panic moves which would mean very large and sudden increases in
interest rates,'' Brinner said.
   The Fed policy-making group is known as the Federal Open Market
Committee, made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board
in Washington and five of the 12 presidents of Fed district banks.

   The multibillion-dollar purchase of jetliners
expected today by American Airlines is the latest in a series of
gigantic orders from carriers that not only want to modernize their
fleets, but want to make sure the planes are ready in the near
future, industry analysts say.
   The order also is indicative of an airline that picks its
equipment in a smart, precise way, says a spokesman an aircraft
maker that lost out on the deal.
   Fort Worth, Texas-based American scheduled a news conference for
today to disclose details of its purchase, which some industry
experts believe could total $7 billion. The airline is expected to
order 50 to 60 MD-11 jumbo jets and as many as 100 smaller MD-80
twinjets from McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The purchase would be the first huge aircraft order in 1989,
after a year that saw at least nine carriers _ including American _
place jet orders for $1 billion or more.
   They included a $5.04 billion order in May by International Lease
Finance Corp. for 130 planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie,
and a September order-and-option package by Delta Air Lines for 215
planes, split between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, that could be
worth $6 billion to $10 billion.
   The big three commercial jet builders shattered order records in
1988. Boeing, with about two-thirds of the market, announced firm
orders for 636 planes worth $30.1 billion, surpassing 1987 orders by
49 percent. McDonnell Douglas had orders for 246 planes and Airbus,
the European consortium, 167, but neither announced dollar values.
   Few believe 1989 will approach those marks, but Boeing estimates
there's plenty of room in the new plane market _ more than $450
billion worth, in 1989 dollars, between now and 2005.
   Demand for new planes is so great that it's tough for operators
to get them when they want them.
   ``In general, the industry is running flat-out at capacity and is
pretty much booked into the 1992-93 time frame,'' Wolfgang Demisch,
aerospace industry analyst for Union Bank of Switzerland in New
York, said Monday. Being able to provide delivery spots ``seems at
least one factor in American deciding for the MD-11, besides what
may be a very advantageous price.''
   MD-11s normally sell for $90 million to $100 million, but
analysts said American's actual purchase price could be for $80
million to $85 million each, partly because of the large number
ordered.
   American already has 118 MD-80s and 60 DC-10s, a predecessor to
the MD-11, along with a wide variety of Boeing jets.
   The MD-11 is a three-engine widebody, capable of carrying 405
passengers 8,000 miles. McDonnell Douglas bills it as a long-haul
jet to serve routes that don't have the passenger volume to justify
a Boeing 747. Boeing's new 747-400 also can fly 8,000 miles,
carrying about 479 passengers.
   Boeing was at a disadvantage, said analyst William Whitlow Jr. at
Dain Bosworth Co. in Seattle, since American flies such routes as
Dallas-Tokyo, with fewer passengers than, say, Tokyo-Los Angeles.
   ``It just looks to me that they probably weren't in the hunt
based on what they are able to provide,'' Whitlow said. ``The 747 is
so much bigger.''
   Boeing is considering a smaller long-haul plane, a new version of
its 767 widebody, but that's only in the talking stage. Airbus is
taking orders for its four-engine A340, which will carry about 295
passengers 7,500 miles, but Airbus spokesman David Venz in Herndon,
Va., said it was effectively eliminated from the American bidding
because the first A340 won't be available until 1992.
   Likewise, Venz said, Airbus would have loved to sell American a
slew of its hot-selling A320s, a smaller plane that competes with
the twin-jet MD-80 and Boeing's 737 family. But ``we're essentially
sold out on that airplane up to the '92-93 period,'' he said.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said Monday there is a waiting
period for new Boeing jets, negotiable with each order, but
``usually a couple of years out.'' He said he did not have
particulars on the pending American order, but said Boeing had
talked to American about buying planes.
   Don Hanson, McDonnell Douglas spokesman in Long Beach, Calif.,
said his company's delivery dates generally extend into 1993.
   ``However, there are always ways to be able to swap delivery
positions to satisfy a customer,'' Hanson said. He declined to
discuss the American order Monday.
   Though American may favor McDonnell Douglas today, it has spread
its business in the past. Airbus is delivering 25 A300-600R
widebodies that American ordered in 1987, and American last year
gave Boeing a $2 billion order for 50 mid-sized 757s, with options
for 50 more.
   Venz said American officials like to get the precise plane for
the job.
   ``They buy in a very smart and sophisticated way. They go out and
look at the market and look at what airplanes are there to do
specific jobs. That can bring them great rewards,'' he said.
   Analysts say the need to replace aging fleets has spurred the
recent orders.
   Traumas involving older planes, including the accident last
spring in which the top came off an Aloha Airlines 737 over Hawaii,
focused attention on the safety of older jets. Airplane makers,
regulators and operators say a jet is safe to fly indefinitely if
properly maintained, but note that maintenance costs climb with an
aircraft's age.
   Also, many older planes don't meet tougher noise regulations,
burn more fuel and require a crew of three instead of two, the
configuration of many newer jets.

<HEAD>First Dividend In 3 Years Signals Confidence In Turnaround</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp.'s decision to resume paying
dividends to stockholders signals management's confidence that the
company has bounced back from three years of losses, the bank's top
executive said.
   The holding company for Bank of America, the nation's
third-largest bank, announced Monday it would pay a dividend of 15
cents per share of common stock, the first such payment since the
fourth quarter of 1985. Preferred stock dividends also will resume,
the bank's chief executive said.
   ``By reinstating our cash dividend we're marking a very important
milestone in our financial recovery,'' A.W. Clausen, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters. ``It assures
our customers that BankAmerica has put behind it a very difficult
period in our history.''
   The San Francisco-based bank has for several months been
pronouncing itself cured of a variety of financial ills that brought
three years of red ink starting in 1985. The problems are traced to
losses on a variety of loans, including Third World debt and real
estate and farm lending in this country.
   BankAmerica returned to the black last year, posting a year-end
profit of $726 million, or $3.79 a share, in contrast with a $955
million loss the previous year. The 1987 results were depressed by
the addition of $1.1 billion to the bank's loan-loss reserve.
   The common stock dividend is payable March 10 to stockholders of
record Feb. 23. It was declared by the board of directors at a
meeting here.
   BankAmerica's last dividend was paid in the fourth quarter of
1985. The dividend reached a high of 38 cents a quarter in 1984, and
was reduced the following year.
   BankAmerica stock closed at $20.50 a share in composite trading,
down 37{ cents from Friday's close.
   Analysts had expected a resumption of the dividend, said Dan
Williams, who follows the company for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco,
and stockholders could be expected to begin agitating for dividends
given the bank's recent strong performance.
   The move signals management confidence, he reasoned, since
executives would be unlikely to risk being forced to reduce or stop
dividends once they are restarted.
   Clausen said the bank's directors decided to pay the dividend
because the institution had returned to profitability through its
daily operations, as opposed to profits sustained through the sale
of assets.
   In December 1986, the company sold its retail bank in Italy for
$603 million; in February of 1987, it agreed to sell the Charles
Schwab discount brokerage company for $230 million. The company also
closed various branches and eliminated thousands of jobs over the
past two years.
   Clausen said the bank's base of assets has been rebuilt to the
point that it exceeds federal regulators' minimum requirement for
risk-based capital for year-end 1992.

   Share prices firmed and volume accelerated at
midday Tuesday, shrugging off a weak start, traders said.
   The recovery was due partly to the futures market, where the
March Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index showed an
18-point advance on its Monday close, and on strong buying in
chemical, pharmaceutical and other dollar-earning stocks, traders
said.
   However, they said they remained unconvinced that the market has
fully shaken the profit-taking pressure which sent the index
tumbling 25.6 points Monday.
   At about 12:20 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was 8.0 points, or 0.3 percent, higher than Monday's close of
2,052.3, and up from the low of 2,040.5 reached in the first hour of

   Volume was 335.4 million shares, compared with the 339.0 million

   News of a dividend increase at General Motors set
a positive tone on Wall Street today and moved stock prices higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 5.89 at
2,326.96 as of 11 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of about
2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 751 higher, 390 lower
and 582 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.66 million shares as of 11 a.m.
   GM announced after the market closed Monday it was sharply
raising the dividend on all three classes of its common stock. While
the move was anticipated, it came earlier than expected.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, was up 3 to
92{ in heavy trading.
   Investors remained concerned about high rates on short-term debt
securities such as Treasury bills. Those high rates hamper the stock
market by providing an attractive alternative to investors.
   Today, for the first time since April 1982, yields on three-month
Treasury bills were even higher than rates on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond.
   The yield of the long bond stood at 8.85 percent in morning
trading. Meanwhile, the bond-equivalent yield of the three-month
Treasury bill was at 8.87 percent.
   The dollar, which often provides direction for stock prices,
failed to do so today as foreign exchange markets sought a trend of
their own.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide, up
\ to 28\.
   Burlington Resources, which rose nearly 10 a share on Monday, was
off 2] to 46}. The stock had jumped after Pennzoil said it acquired
8 percent of the company's shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.60 at 166.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.80 at 325.80.

   Pepsico Inc. said its earnings rose 28 percent in
the fourth quarter, with improved results in its soft drink and
snack food businesses and flat earnings from restaurants.
   Pepsico said its quarterly profit rose to $187.7 million, or 72
cents a share, from $147 million, or 56 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 22 percent to $4.19 billion from $3.44 billion.
   Besides Pepsi, holdings of the Purchase, N.Y.-based company
include Frito-Lay, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell.
   For the full year, Pepsico said its profit rose 28 percent to

<TEXT>
   Analysts say a bidding contest for Champion Spark
Plug Co. may follow Cooper Industries' $800 million cash buyout
proposal, which tops Champion's earlier agreement for a $590 million
takeover by Dana Corp.
   Cooper, a diversified maker of commercial and industrial
products, announced its $21 a share buyout proposal on Monday and
indicated it might be prepared to bid even higher.
   Champion's board of directors met today in a previously scheduled
session, and company spokesman Anthony Mougey said the board agreed
to consider the Cooper offer.
   ``No definitive action was taken by the board at a regularly
scheduled meeting today beyond the decision to explore the Cooper
proposal,'' he said.
   Cooper's proposal sent Champion's stock up $3.25 to $22.62{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange Monday on speculation that Dana
might have to raise its $17.50 a share cash-and-stock buyout offer.
   Cooper's offer still is subject to confirmation by the company's
board of directors, which next meets Feb. 21.
   Dana, an automotive parts manufacturer based in Toledo, Ohio,
signed an agreement last month under which it would pay $17.50 in
cash and securities for Champion's outstanding shares.
   Robert Cizik, chairman and president of Cooper, said Monday he
had no objection to Champion's agreement to pay Dana $15 million if
their buyout fell through.
   Cizik also said in a letter to Champion's board of directors that
Cooper ``would be prepared to increase the purchase price of our
proposal if you and your advisers can demonstrate to us additional
values inherent in Champion Spark Plug Co.''
   Dana spokesman Don Decker said the company had no comment on
Cooper's action and declined to say if Dana would increase its bid.
   
   Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for
all types of internal combustion engines. It also manufactures Anco
windshield wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and
automotive maintenance products. It has annual revenue of about $720
million and employs about 9,200 people worldwide.
   ``Strategically, this is a significant opportunity for Cooper,''
Cizik said.
   ``Champion has strong brand recognition and market leadership and
would provide an excellent entry into its two market segments,'' he
said.
   Under the Dana agreement, Dana would pay $17.50 cash per share up
to half of Chamption's outstanding common shares, with the rest
being exchanged for Dana stock with a value of $17.50 a share.
   Wall Street analysts have said Dana's attempt to buy Champion may
be hampered because Champion's stock remains above $17.50. Some
analysts say Dana is buying Champion for a bargain price.
   A member of Champion's founding family, Stephen Stranahan,
recently quit the board because he was unhappy with the Dana deal.
   The Stranahan family in 1986 established the Chinook Partners
L.P. to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs. Chinook
controls 35 percent of Champion's common stock.
   Chinook has yet to tender its shares to Dana, which some Wall
Street analysts have said would have locked up the deal.
   Houston-based Cooper, with 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion, is a
diversified, worldwide manufacturer of products for the electrical,
electronic, commercial, industrial, compression and drilling market.
   Dana, which had 1987 sales of $4.9 billion, makes a variety of
automotive parts including drive-train components, engine parts and
chassis products.
   The two companies have said the merger would unite Champion's
famous name with Dana's far-flung distribution system.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, then turned narrowly mixed with
little fresh news to influence prices.
   The slight early losses reflected some follow-through selling
after Monday's steep declines in the corn and soybean pits.
   Analysts said forecasts for more snow this week in the Great
Plains and the Midwest have put grain traders on the defensive.
   The snow means more moisture in areas stricken by last summer's
drought.
   ``There is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a
back-to-back crop adversity in Midwest are extremely small,'' said
Richard Feltes, director of commodities research with Refco Inc., a
Chicago-based commodities brokerage firm.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to } cent lower with March at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 1{
cents to 2} cents lower with March at $2.13 a bushel; soybeans were
2 cents lower to { cent higher with March at $7.53{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .15 cent lower with February at
75.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent lower
with March at 84.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .55
cent lower with February at 42.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .72 cent to .95 cent lower with February at 38.10 cents a pound.
   Pork futures prices fell sharply Monday on indications that the
movement of hogs to market had not been slowed by adverse weather in
the Midwest. Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
today gave a general endorsement to the Bush administration's effort
to rescue the savings and loan industry, as members of Congress said
they intended to act on a bailout package as quickly as possible.
   Volcker, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said
that while he had not had a chance to review the Bush proposal in
detail he believed that it addressed all of the major problems
facing the S&amp;L industry.
   ``I welcome the administration's initiative this early in the
(congressional) session,'' Volcker said. ``The president's program
provides a very good base for your consideration of legislation.''
   Volcker said he was concerned that the deposit insurance premiums
on savings and loans and the nation's commercial 13,000 banks not be
raised so high that it put the institutions at a competitive
disadvantage with other financial entities.
   ``My sense is that the increased insurance premiums goes to the
edge of viability in terms of not undermining the health of the
financial industry, which is under heavy competition,'' he said.
   Volcker also said he disagreed with the administration's proposal
to abolish the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as an independent
regulatory agency. President Bush's plan would retain only the
chairman of the bank board, making him the head of an S&amp;L regulatory
agency that would be placed under the jurisdiction of the Treasury
Department.
   Volcker said that instead of abolishing the three-member bank
board he would prefer leaving it as an independent regulatory agency
but split off its oversight of the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund.
   Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said he and Sen. Jake
Garn of Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, plan to introduce the
administration's package as soon as it was submitted and schedule
early hearings in an effort to vote the measure out in as short a
time as possible.
   ``I am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match
the speed of the administration,'' Riegle said at the beginning of
the hearing. Both Riegle and Garn called on the other committee
members to set aside partisan differences and work with dispatch to
report a bill to the full Senate.
   ``This problem is serious enough that we don't have time to be
partisan about it,'' Garn said. ``I hope we can get together in the
next few months to pass legislation.''
   Volcker said the problem was of such a serious nature that if
necessary Congress should consider exempting the necessary
government spending from the overall deficit limits established by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   He said this could be justified because sale of the government
bonds being used to finance the bailout effort was different from
ordinary government expenditures and would not have the same
inflationary impact on the economy as raising spending in such areas
as defense.
   On the question of raising the deposit insurance premiums,
Volcker did not provide a specific amount that he would like to see.
But he said the Bush recommendation came very close to the limits
that the banks could bear.
   ``The banks are having enough trouble competing now and I don't
like to see any additional burdens put on them,'' Volcker said.
``This goes toward the limits of what is tolerable.''

<HEAD>Illinois Central Neutral On Prospect's Bid, Will Seek Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prospect Group Inc. is calling ``constructive'' a
move by the Illinois Central Transportation Co. that could raise the
railroad's price tag above the $436 million that Prospect is
offering.
   Illinois Central said Monday it was taking a neutral stance on
Prospect's unsolicited $20-per-share cash tender offer and indicated
it would entertain competing bids.
   The Chicago-based railroad said it was exploring ``alternatives
which might result in greater shareholder values'' and that it had
directed its financial adviser, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.,
to begin discussions with New York-based Prospect and other parties.
   Illinois Central spokesman Frank Allston would not expand on the
company's carefully worded statement.
   In New York, Prospect Chairman W. Wallace McDowell Jr. issued a
statement saying: ``We welcome the constructive response from
Illinois Central and look forward to talking with the company and
its investment bankers.''
   An industry analyst said the railroad appeared to be inviting
other bids.
   ``They are opening the door and they want to make sure anyone
interested can take advantage of that if they're so inclined,'' said
John Landschulz, a transportation-industry analyst with Cowen &amp; Co.
in Chicago.
   Prospect, a conglomerate that operates a regional railroad in the
Southeast, launched its tender offer for Illinois Central on Jan.
27. Illinois Central has 21.8 million shares outstanding.
   Illinois Central's stock price rose $1 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, closing at $22.
   Analysts say the firm's high stock price relative to the Prospect
offer indicates that Wall Street expects a higher bid for the
company.
   Prospect owns about 4.7 percent of Illinois Central, a spin-off
of the Whitman Corp. that began trading as an independent company on
Jan. 3 at $11 a share.
   Illinois Central is a major carrier of freight between Chicago
and the Gulf of Mexico.
   One of the railroad's largest customers, grain-processing giant
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, has also been an active buyer
of Illinois Central's stock.
   ADM owned 9.8 percent of Illinois Central at the end of January
and has indicated its intention to to increase its stake to 25
percent.
   But ADM has maintained that its acquisition of the railroad's
stock is for investment purposes only, and analysts have said they
do not believe ADM wants to own the railroad.
   In addition to MidSouth, a railroad that Prospect built partly
from track purchased from Illinois Central, Prospect owns Murray
Bakery Products Inc., the largest supplier of cookies to the Girl
Scouts of America; Children's Discovery Centers Inc., the country's
fifth-largest daycare chain; Forschner Group Inc., which distributes
Swiss Army knives; and Ivy Insurance Corp., a casualty insurance
company.

   Prices advanced broadly on Wall Street today on
news of a dividend increase at General Motors and in anticipation
that Congress and top government officials will be denied a pay
raise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 18.22 at
2,339.29 as of noon EST.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of better
than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 872 stocks higher,
415 lower and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 88.76 million shares at midday.
   Jack Barbanel, a vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the
market's advance was due in part to an expected vote in Congress
that would kill a pay raise for House and Senate members and top
Bush administration officials. A pay increase was expected to have
worsened the federal budget deficit.
   Prices also moved higher in response to President Bush's
announcement of a bailout plan for the savings and loan industry
although the proposal would put pressure on the bond market,
Barbanel said. Bush's plan called for the issuing of $50 billion in
new government bonds.
   The bond market displayed some resilience today, as did the
dollar, and this spilled over to stocks, Barbanel said.
   The market also got a boost from GM's announcement that it was
sharply raising the dividend on all three classes of its common
stock. While the move announced late Monday was anticipated, it came
earlier than expected.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, was up 3| to
93[ in heavy trading.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide, up
2 to 30.
   Burlington Resources, which rose nearly 10 a share on Monday,
fell 2[ to 47. The stock had jumped after Pennzoil said it acquired
8 percent of the company's shares.
   IBM was up 1\ to 127~ after announcing improvements for its
mainframe computers.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
1.03 at 167.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.99 at 325.47.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines announced one of the biggest
aircraft orders in history today, calling for the carrier to acquire
at least eight new long-range McDonnell Douglas Corp. jetliners with
options to buy another 42 plus options for 100 smaller planes.
   The order announced in New York by senior executives of both
companies will make American the first U.S. carrier to obtain
delivery of the MD-11, a widebody, long-haul plane designed to
replace the older DC-10. The smaller MD-80 would replace the Boeing
727.
   Neither company would place a value on the deal but it is
potentially worth several billion dollars and marks a major coup for
McDonnell Douglas, which has been aggressively seeking orders for
the MD-11 in the high-stakes aircraft competition with Boeing Co.
and the Airbus Industrie consortium of Europe.
   The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline's aircraft acquisitions come
amid rising concern about aging U.S. commercial aircraft fleets and
whether older planes are less safe.
   The new aircraft will replace some older planes in American's
fleet, which is an average of 9.4 years old, compared with 12.4
industrywide.
   The MD-11s have a list price of $100 million, but analysts said
American's actual purchase price will probably be in the range of
$80 million to $85 million per plane.
   ``American has done quite a lot of expansion since deregulation,
entered the international service, opened new hubs, and has
announced further intentions to expand further in the international
service. That's what the purchases are all about,'' said Lee Howard,
executive vice president of Airline Economics Inc. in Washington.
   ``Knowing how tough American is about demanding favorable terms
on these purchases, my guess is McDonnell Douglas must be giving
them a good deal,'' said Andrew B.S. Kim, an analyst with Robert
Fleming Inc. in New York.
   ``They (American officials) are doing this to get a younger
fleet,'' said Julius Maldutis, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst in
New York. ``What it does simply is to position American Airlines for
the rest of the decade (the 1990s) and gives them enormous
flexibility because of the maintenance problems everyone else is
having with their older fleets.''
   But Robert J. Joedicke, an advisory director for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York, downplayed airline safety as an issue
behind the purchase.
   ``I recognize the public perception. But aircraft do not wear out
as long as they are properly maintained,'' he said. ``It does cost
too much money to maintain the older planes. But an aircraft does
not become unsafe. American will be looking at lower unit costs and
aircraft more dedicated to the operations they have with the new
planes.
   ``American is doing a lot more overseas operations,'' Joedicke
continued. ``The MD-11 is better suited to the routes that American
does fly overseas, based on the density of the routes.''
   Kim said the MD-11s are long-haul aircraft that will replace
American's DC-10 fleet. The DC-10 was the predecessor of the MD-11.
   He said the MD-80s are short-haul twinjets that will help replace
American's Boeing 727s, which comprise the largest percentage of
American's 470-jet fleet.

<HEAD>Bush Will Propose Freezing Defense Spending at Level of Inflation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose freezing defense
spending at the level of inflation in his Thursday budget message to
Congress to help pay for expanded domestic programs, administration
sources said today.
   Bush, meanwhile, proclaimed his document ``pretty well
finalized'' and headed for Capitol Hill for a series of meetings
with congressional leaders.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would go
over his budget in general terms with lawmakers of both parties.
   ``The president will assure them that he has tried to make a
workmanlike effort to produce a budget that is the beginning of
negotiations,'' Fitzater said.
   The spokesman called the budget ``a starting point,'' and said
Bush ``wants to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis'' in coming
up with a budget consensus.
   Earlier, Bush declared most of the work finished during a
picture-taking session as he met with his budget director, Richard
Darman; Vice President Dan Quayle and others to put the finishing
touches on the spending plan.
   Asked by reporters whether he had found enough in his budget to
pay for his ``kinder, gentler nation'' campaign promises, Bush said
only, ``Stay tuned.''
   The president will prepare his proposed revision of President
Reagan's $1.15 trillion budget plan for fiscal 1990 in a speech to a
joint session of Congress on Thursday evening.
   Bush decided on the defense freeze in budget sessions over the
weekend, said officials who declined to be identified by name.
   Reagan had proposed raising defense spending authority by 2
percent above the rate of inflation, to $315.2 billion, for the
fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. That's up from $298.8 billion
in the current fiscal year.
   However, in terms of actual outlays _ cash to be spent in fiscal
1990 _ Bush's decision to freeze defense spending at the inflation
level would free up about $2 billion.
   That's only about a third of what some analysts say Bush's
combined campaign pledges would cost.
   Although the president's budget was expected to ask for increases
in defense spending in later years, the freeze for fiscal 1990 is in
keeping with his call for a ``flexible freeze.''
   According to officials familiar with the budget, Bush's plan
calls for increases over the Reagan levels in dozens of categories,
with the largest increases coming in the areas of education and
cleaning up the environment.
   The budget will reflect virtually all of Bush's major campaign
promises, although in some cases _ such as his proposal for a $500
million National Merit School program _ the items will be scaled
back, the officials said.
   Still, ``the Reagan budget will be the core of the Bush budget,''
said one official.
   Rather than doing a complete rewrite of the Reagan budget, as
Reagan did of former President Carter's lame-duck 1981 budget,
Bush's plan will be more in the form of amendments to Reagan's plan,
officials said.

   Complaints of lost and mishandled baggage received by airlines in
December, shown as the number of complaints per 1,000 passengers on
the airline.
   Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be
comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of
reporting. For example, some airlines count in their complaint data
courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other
airlines find lost baggage. In addition, reporting methods vary for
problems with carry-on baggage and late arriving passengers.

   News that General Motors was increasing its
dividend reinvigorated Wall Street today and sent stock prices
broadly higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 27.50 at
2,348.57 as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of better
than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 992 stocks higher,
422 lower and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 141.58 million shares at
mid-afternoon.
   The market was boosted by GM's announcement that it was sharply
raising the dividend on all three classes of its common stock. While
the move announced late Monday was anticipated, it came earlier than
expected.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, soared 4\ to
93} in heavy trading.
   Jack Barbanel, a vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the
market's advance also was due in part to an expected vote in
Congress that would kill a pay raise for House and Senate members
and top Bush administration officials. A pay increase was expected
to have worsened the federal budget deficit.
   The House voted down the raise today and sent it to the Senate.
   Prices also moved higher in response to President Bush's
announcement of a bailout plan for the savings and loan industry
although the proposal would put pressure on the bond market,
Barbanel said. Bush's plan called for the issuing of $50 billion in
new government bonds.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide, up
2[ to 30[. The chemical company was the subject of takeover rumors,
but some of the buying came from investors trying to take advantage
of Carbide's upcoming dividend payment.
   Burlington Resources, which rose nearly 10 on Monday, fell 2] to
46}. The stock had jumped after Pennzoil said it acquired 8 percent
of the company's shares.
   IBM was up 1] to 128 and Chrysler rose 1 to 28{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
1.62 at 167.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.56 at 326.04.

   For those who hope to avoid living in Donald
Trump's buildings, flying in Donald Trump's airplanes, gambling in
Donald Trump's casinos and reading Donald Trump's book, there is a
new hazard:
   Playing Donald Trump's game.
   The ubiquitous mogul appeared with representatives of Milton
Bradley Co. on Tuesday at a Trump Tower news conference in midtown
Manhatta to announce that ``Trump _ The Game'' would appear on
toy-store shelves this spring.
   ``I think that you can really learn a lot about yourself, in a
business sense, by playing the game,'' Trump said.
   ``Trump'' is somewhat like Monopoly, in that the player with the
most money wins. But the Trump ``T'' has replaced Monopoly game
pieces like the shoe, the thimble and the iron, and the highest
Trump denomination is $100 million instead of $500.
   Nor does Monopoly feature pictures of Donald Trump on the money,
the game board, the playing cards and the box. Trump _ The Game does.
   ``It's a much more sophisticated game than Monopoly,'' Trump
said. ``I like to play Monopoly _ I've played it all my life, in
many forms.''
   Capitalists aged 12 and older are invited to ``share in the
exciting high-stakes risk-taking I get to do every day. ... If you
are clever, aggressive and cut the best deals, you can earn millions
... even billions of dollars. Just remember: Play to win ... or not
at all!''
   This enterprise will not line Trump's pockets. His proceeds from
the $25 game will go to causes like cerebral palsy, AIDS and the
homeless, he said.
   The developer appears in a commercial for the game. In it,
financiers and average New Yorkers ponder ``what's Trump's game,''
and Trump himself is chased by inquiring reporters. His game, he
says, is ``Trump _ The Game.''
   ``I think you'll like it,'' Trump says, at the commercial's close.
   Trump insists that he likes the game, which he expects will
become a toy standard. He has played it himself against ``bright
people.''
   ``I've done very well at the game ... but on occasion, I got
clipped,'' he said.

   New loans by the World Bank, biggest source of
aid to the Third World, will reach a record $21 billion in the year
ending June 30, bank officials predicted on Tuesday.
   Ernest Stern, vice president for finance, estimated that $16
billion would go to the somewhat more prosperous countries which
still need easy loans to raise their living standards. They pay
interest at a variable rate, now 7.65 percent a year.
   Sheldon Rappaport, the bank's financial spokesman, said over $5.5
billion will go to the poorest countries from the bank's
International Development Association (IDA). It makes loans at less
than 1 percent interest.
   New loans in the previous year totaled $19.2 billion.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed nearly
unchanged Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a quiet period of
adjustment after two days of volatile price movement.
   New supply-and-demand developments were scarce. The Agriculture
Department issued a report in the afternoon that said last week's
cold temperatures and lack of snow cover may have damaged winter
wheat in parts of the central and southern Plains, but the markets
had anticipated some winter kill.
   Export demand for U.S. grains and soybeans remained slack, which
weighed on prices. But farmer selling was also slow, prompting some
domestic processors to raise their bids on the cash market, which
helped support futures.
   Analysts said forecasts for more snow this week in the Plains and
the Midwest contributed to the generally bearish tone.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to } cent lower with March at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to

   A bevy of positive developments, including an
increase in General Motors' dividend, reinvigorated Wall Street
today and sent stock prices broadly higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 35.89 to
2,356.96 as of 3 p.m. EST after falling 10 points on Monday.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of 5 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,060 stocks higher, 404 lower and
482 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 176.62 million shares with one
hour of trading left.
   Jack Baker, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said a variety of factors combined to boost prices, including the
fact that an increase in the Federal Reserve's discount rate that
had been expected during the morning did not materialize by late
afternoon.
   The market also was boosted by GM's announcement that it was
sharply raising the dividend on all three classes of its common
stock. While the move announced late Monday was anticipated, it came
earlier than expected.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, soared 4{ to

<HEAD>Champion Board Considering Cooper's Offer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Champion Spark Plug Co.'s directors met
Tuesday to consider an $800 million cash takeover offer from Cooper
Industries Inc., and there were indications a deal could be worked
out.
   A Cooper takeover of Champion would derail a previously announced
$590 million cash-and-securities deal for Toledo-based Dana Corp. to
acquire the spark plug maker.
   ``No definitive action was taken by the board at a regularly
scheduled meeting today beyond the decision to explore the Cooper
proposal,'' Champion spokesman Anthony Mougey said.
   But Mougey added that Champion has begun meeting with Cooper to
discuss the deal.
   O. Lee Henry, Champion's president and chief executive officer,
met Monday with Cooper officials at Cooper's Houston headquarters.
Henry agreed to Cooper's request for access to confidential
financial information, as well as granting access to its plants and
offices.
   Cooper on Monday offered to buy Champion for at least $21 a
share, outbidding Dana's $17.50 a share agreement to acquire the
company announced last month.
   A member of Champion's founding family, who also is chairman of
the board, said he would probably go along with Cooper's offer.
   ``I haven't had time to digest it,'' said Robert Stranahan Jr.,
74. ``But they've been around for a good many years, and they've
diversified a great deal, have a lot of different products and are a
very strong company.''
   Stranahan said he couldn't predict whether Champion's board or a
family run limited partnership that controls 35 percent of the
company's stock would approve the deal. The Stranahan family in 1986
established the partnership to maintain a dominant voice in
Champion's affairs.
   Cooper, a diversified maker of commercial and industrial
products, indicated it might bid even higher for the company.
Spokeswoman Ellen Myers said the two sides were moving forward with
the deal.
   Dana spokesman Don Decker declined comment on Cooper's offer and
would not say whether the automotive parts maker would increase its
bid.
   Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst wih Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, said Champion would fit well into
Cooper's product lines.
   ``There's no product overlap, and spark plugs provide them with
another product line for the automotive aftermarket,'' he said.
   Phillippi also said Cooper is aggressive in reducing costs.
   ``Saying they do a lot of streamlining is putting it mildly,'' he
said.
   Cooper has owned Toledo-area companies. The company closed Magnum
Electric Co. of Erie, Mich., and Magnum Tool of Toledo, a division
of its Belden Eletronic Wiring &amp; Cable unit in 1986, idling 120
workers.
   Ms. Meyers said Cooper probably would move Champion's corporate
headquarters from Toledo to Houston and keep the Toledo plant intact.
   Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for
all types of internal combustion engines. It also makes Anco
windshield wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and
automotive maintenance products. It has annual revenue of about $720
million and employs about 9,200 people worldwide.
   Cooper, with 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion, is a diversified,
worldwide manufacturer of products for the electrical, electronic,
commercial, industrial, compression and drilling market.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts A Must To Overcome Mexican Economic Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government must further slash its budget
deficit and raise $36 billion in fresh foreign credits over the next
six years to pull Mexico out of an economic crisis, a private study
concluded Tuesday.
   The study by the Panamerican Private Management Institute was
released as Mexico's Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe was in Washington
attempting to renegotiate payment terms on Mexico's $106 billion
foreign debt. Mexico has rejected a $3.5 billion aid package in U.S.
short-term loans as too onerous.
   The Panamerican institute said the government must lower its
budget deficit to at least 6.4 percent of gross national product,
the value of the total output of goods and services, from 14.9
percent in 1987 and estimated 10 percent this year.
   It also said President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration
should seek an average of $6 billion annually over the next six
years in long-term loans from abroad so the economy, which remained
virtually stagnant during the preceding administration, can resume
growth.
   The institute is an arm of the private, highly regarded
Panamerican University. Its findings appeared to reinforce Salinas's
prescription of strong medicine for the sick economy.
   The study also said the administration must sharply restrict the
money supply to restrain inflation, which hit an all-time high of
159 percent in 1987.
   It dropped to 51.7 percent last year as a result of tight
restrictions on wage and retail price increases that began in the
last year of President Miguel de la Madrid's six-year
administration. The plan was extended for another six months by
Salinas when he took office Dec. 1.
   A Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
recent interview Mexico would not use the U.S. loan offered in
October because it would mean even more burdensome debt payments.
   Instead of borrowing more money, Aspe is reportedly trying to
reduce the existing debt as well as lower interest payments.
   Mexico has paid a total of $18 billion in principal and interest
to foreign creditors in the past two years, money that could have
been used for investment and public works.
   The study warned that unless the deficit was cut and new money
brought in ``inflation will start growing again, at an enormous
political cost that would result in social unrest and loss of
control by the government over its economic policies.''
   A measure of relief is apparently in sight with recent increases
in world prices for crude oil, a major source of Mexico's foreign
income, the newspaper El Financiero said Tuesday.
   Mexico exports an average of 1.325 million barrels a day, about
half of it to the United States. Price drops in 1987 cut oil income
from $7.8 billion to about $5.2 billion in 1988.
   El Financiero also quoted unnamed government officials as saying
the government plans to crack down on tax evaders so that tax
revenues this year ``will surpass the income from oil exports.''
   Tax collecting became increasingly lax during the de la Madrid
administration, mostly because people and businesses were short of
money because of the crisis, which began in 1982 when the bottom
fell out of the international oil market.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Electric
Corp. emerged as the big winners Tuesday in an American Airlines
contract for up to 142 planes, potentially one of the biggest
aircraft orders in history.
   American said it signed an agreement with McDonnell Douglas to
acquire at least eight new long-range MD-ll jetliners with options
to buy another 42. The airline also took options on 100 MD-80s, a
smaller plane designed to replace the Boeing 727.
   The order will make American the first U.S. airline to obtain
delivery of the MD-11, a widebody aircraft designed to replace the
older DC-10, company officials told a news conference.
   Company officials wouldn't disclose the value of the deal, but
industry experts estimate it could total around $7 billion. It marks
a major coup for McDonnell Douglas, which has been aggressively
seeking orders for the MD-11 in the high-stakes aircraft competition
with Boeing Co. and the Airbus Industrie consortium of Europe.
   American also announced that it has signed an agreement with
General Electric to acquire up to 200 CF6-80C2 engines for use on
most of its widebody jets, including the MD-11.
   American had considered competing engines made by Pratt &amp; Whitney
and Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC, American officials said, but decided
that the GE engines provide more flexibility since they can be used
on both the MD-11 and other aircraft.
   In a related development Tuesday, McDonnell Douglas announced
that in addition to American, four other airlines have signed orders
for new MD-11s. The four carriers _ Air Europe of Britain, Aero
Lloyd of West Germany, ZAS Airline of Egypt and Finnair, the
national airline of Finland _ have ordered a total of 26 MD-11s, the
aircraft maker said.
   American chose the MD-11 over Boeing Co.'s rival 747-400 largely
because the McDonnell Douglas aircraft will be available sooner,
said Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman and president.
   The acquisitions by American, the nation's second-largest
carrier, come amid rising concern about aging U.S. commercial
aircraft fleets and whether older planes are less safe.
   Some airline analysts view the purchases as part of an innovative
marketing strategy at American to reassure the public about safety.
   The new aircraft will replace some older planes in American's
fleet, which is an average of 9.4 years old, compared with 12.4
years industrywide.
   The agreement gives American great flexibility in planning for
fleet growth and aircraft replacement in the 1990s and beyond,
Crandall said.
   ``One of the most valuable commodities an airline has is the
confidence of the flying public,'' he said. In addition to upgrading
its fleet, American also is paying strict attention to inspecting
and maintaining its older aircraft, he noted.
   As a result of the new acquisitions, American's fleet will be the
youngest in the U.S. airline industry by the end of 1991, Crandall
said.
   American plans to spend around $10.5 billion through the end of
1993 to modernize its fleet, Donald J. Carty, the airline's senior
vice president for planning and finance, told the news conference.

   A judge temporarily barred a national penny-stock
brokerage house from soliciting new business in New York state
Tuesday after the state attorney general said there was evidence it
had defrauded millions of dollars from thousands of investors.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams said records showed that Power
Securities Corp. of Las Vegas participated in ``a massive fraud and
swindle'' that involved manipulating stock prices, creating
artificial markets and marking up stock prices by 100 percent or
more.
   State Supreme Court Justice Jawn A. Sandifer issued a temporary
restraining order barring Power Securities from soliciting new
business in or from the state. The judge also ordered the company to
provide documents and sworn testimony.
   Power Securities issued a statement saying it would cooperate
with the inquiry and present relevant information at a Feb. 22
hearing. ``However,'' the statement said, ``the company intends to
vigorously oppose the existing restraining order and any
restrictions order and any restrictions on its business activities.''
   Penny stocks are inexpensive securities sold over the counter.
They are not listed on any major stock exchanges.

   It employs 106 salespeople in four offices in New York state and
400 more around the country are registered to solcompany grew 20-fold in
just over 18
months, and that the company claimed it had grown 50-fold. He said
some brokers made $100,000 a month.
   Under state securities law, the attorney general can apply for a
restraining order if he shows that investors are in danger of being
defrauded.
   Abrams said ``deception and fraudulent conduct are at the very
heart of their business enterprise.'' He said the temporary order
would help the state gather information that could lead to a lawsuit
to permanently bar the company from doing business in the state.
   According to an affidavit signed by Assistant Attorney General
William H. Mohr, salespeople used coordinated buy-and-sell campaigns
to create an ``artificial, intramural market'' and make a profit.
Salespeople would tell one group of investors to sell while telling
another group to buy, he said.
   Abrams cited as an example the alleged manipulation of Genexus
International Inc. stock from Oct. 19 to Oct. 25, 1988.
   Salespeople allegedly convinced one group of investors to sell 82
million shares back to Power for 2.2 cents per share or less, and
within five days resold the shares to another group for 3 cents a
share, leaving a profit of at least $650,000 for Power, Abrams said.
   State and federal authorities have recently focused on potential
fraud in penny stock deals, which offer the illusion of quick
profits for investors and involve little-known companies.
   Abrams said the penny stock market ``is ripe for fraud. Companies
like Power Securities find it an easy market in which to use lies
and deception to enrich themselves.''
   Mohr's affidavit was based partly on records filed with the state
to register salespeople; tape recordings of phone sales pitches;
statements and records of companies whose stocks are sold by Power;
and interviews with former salespeople and disgruntled investors.
   The affidavit also said there was evidence that Power marked up
the price of shares it bought from other brokers by as much as 100
percent and resold them without disclosing the original price.
   The judge's order also froze the assets of Star Publications Inc.
of Colorado and sought records of its principals. Abrams charged
that in conjunction with Power Securities, Star fraudulently claimed
it had marketing rights to a folding disposable razor and claimed
the Defense Department was about to buy large quantities of them.

<HEAD>Thunderbird-Cougar Problem Found, Delivery Resuming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has resumed delivery of
Thunderbird and Cougar automobiles after holding thousands of them
because of a bad bolt in the steering gear mount, the company said
Tuesday.
   Spokesman John Spelich said about 10,600 cars were withheld after
being built at the company's assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio, after a
rattle found by inspectors Jan. 25 and by two customers later.
   Delivery off the assembly line resumed Monday, Spelich said.
   Inspectors will check each of the cars that were withheld and if
defective bolts are found, they will be replaced, Spelich said. Most
of the cars withheld were parked at a lot at the Cedar Point
amusement park, about 30 miles west of Lorain.
   The rattle, noticed in all versions of the Ford Thunderbird and
Mercury Cougar, was caused by a bad bolt in a small percentage of
the cars being checked, Spelich said. He declined to specify how
many cars had the defective bolts.
   He said Ford officials knew of no safety problems or accidents
linked to the problem.
   There are no plans for recalling the cars, Spelich added.
   The steering mount bolt was the latest piece of bad news for the
plant. Production of the Thunderbird SC and Cougar XR7 has been
curtailed pending a changeover from cast to forged crankshafts on
the supercharged engines both cars carry.
   Spelich said the company expects to resume full production of the
two models next month. The Thunderbird SC last month was named Motor
Trend magazine's ``Car of the Year.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Tuesday in trendless trading marked by speculation over
interest rates.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was thin because of
holidays in Asia and West Germany, and other European markets were
uncertain after Monday's interventions by central banks to bring
down the dollar.
   Traders were reluctant to buy or sell dollars in large amounts
without having a clear idea of whether the Federal Reserve is likely
to push up short-term U.S. interest rates, which would help the
dollar, analysts said.
   ``The currency markets probably want to get a picture of the
interest rate situation here in the U.S.,'' said Craig Sloane, a
currency analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The main event affecting the dollar this week is likely to be
President Bush's budget speech to Congress on Thursday, dealers
said. Reassuring words about cutting the federal deficit would
bolster the dollar, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 129.50 Japanese yen from Monday's
129.60. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at 129.43
yen. In New York the dollar rose to 129.48 yen from 129.41 on Monday.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.7377 late Tuesday from $1.7345 on
Monday. Later in New York the pound rose to $1.7370 from $1.7366.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York compared with
Monday's late rates included: 1.8716 West German marks, down from
1.8725; 1.5893 Swiss francs, down from 1.5898; 1.1828 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1823; 6.3680 French francs, down from 6.3705; and
1,364.8 Italian lire, down from 1,366.5.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.8810;
1.5913 Swiss francs, down from 1.5969; 6.3700 French francs, down
from 6.3950; 2.1140 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1200; 1,365.50
Italian lire, down from 1,370.50; and 1.1813 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1840.
   Gold bullion prices were higher in Europe and lower later in New
York.
   The late gold price in London was a bid $392.55 a troy ounce, up
from $388.95. The Zurich late price was $392 bid, up from $387.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $392 an ounce from $394. Later, Republic National
Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at $390.10 an ounce from
$391.90.
   Financial markets in Hong Kong were closed for the Chinese lunar
new year celebrations.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.91 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.82. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.858 an ounce from $5.897.

<HEAD>Salomon Posts Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. on Tuesday reported a $38 million
loss in the fourth quarter, due to a special $150 million charge for
repatriating foreign earnings to the United States.
   The financial services and commodity trading company said the
loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 resulted from a previously
announced decision to remit more than $1 billion in foreign earnings
to the United States and pay taxes on those earnings.
   Partly offsetting that $180 million charge was a $30 million
reduction in loan-loss reserves ``permitted by a significant
reduction in the lending activities of the commercial finance
segment.'' Before the charge, the company's net income was $112
million.
   In the year-ago fourth quarter, Salomon had reported a $74
million loss. Revenue totaled $1.8 billion, up from $1.3 billion in
the fourth quarter of 1987.
   For all of 1988, Salomon's net income nearly doubled to $280
million, or $1.65 a share, from $142 million, or 86 cents a share,
in 1987. Revenue rose to $6.15 billion from $6 billion the previous
year.
   Salomon said the company's 1988 earnings were bolstered by strong
results from its oil operations.
   ``The performance of the energy segment was exceptional, and
provided a counterbalance to sluggish securities markets,'' said
John Gutfreund, Salomon chairman and chief executive officer.
   The fourth-quarter results, despite the loss, were helped by the
energy division's record $143 million pre-tax earnings versus $4
million in the same period of 1987.
   The company's Salomon Brothers financial subsidiary earned $68
million before taxes compared with a $90 million loss in the 1987
quarter. Its commercial finance unit earned $83 million, including
the $30 million reduction in loan-loss reserves, up from $45 million
in the year-earlier quarter.
   Partly offsetting those improvements was a decline in the
commodities unit's pre-tax earnings to $16 million from $57 million
in the 1987 quarter, Salomon said.

   Crude oil futures rebounded Tuesday after an
early slide.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
32 cents higher at $17.70 a barrel after trading as low as $17.22
during the session. On Monday, the contract lost 15 cents. Other
contract months also ended the day higher.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contract
for domestic heating oil fell 0.49 cent to close the day at 49.87
cents a gallon. Other contract months also lost ground.
   Unleaded gasoline for March delivery closed up 0.52 cent at 49.26
cents a gallon with other contract months ending the day mixed.
   Market observers said the gains were partly to internal market
influences of supply and demand.
   But a combination of mostly OPEC-related factors also influenced
the market, including speculation over the possibility of a new
price-stabilization agreement emerging from the the cartel's
price-monitoring committee meeting scheduled for March, said Nauman
Barakat of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Investors also are anticipating a meeting of non-OPEC producers
that may include the Soviet Union could also result in higher
prices, he said.
   ``The fact that they want to meet again is keeping the market
excited,'' Barakat said.
   Several non-OPEC oil producers met last month with Soviet
representatives attending as observers. The meeting produced no
substantial results, but the group said it hoped to find ways to
help the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries stabilize
world oil prices.

   Nearly half the companies in a national survey
plan to increase their capital spending this year, more than in the
past two years, Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Tuesday.
   About 46 percent of the 5,000 companies surveyed planned higher
spending in 1989, reflecting the strength of the economy, according
to Joseph W. Duncan, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's corporate economist.
   In contrast, 33 percent had projected higher spending for 1987
and 41 percent for 1988. Consistent results are not available for
earlier years.
   ``To keep pace with the growing export market for U.S. goods and
services, U.S. businesses are continuing to increase investments to
modernize and expand productivity,'' Duncan said in a statement.
   Among particular sectors of the economy, 50 percent of
manufacturers planned to increase spending, as did 49 percent of
service companies, 40 percent of construction firms, and 39 percent
of wholesale and retail companies.
   The survey was conducted in late November and was statistically
representative of companies of all sizes in all industries.

   President Bush's plan to dismantle the
independent regulatory structure for savings and loan institutions
may be the beginning of the end of the specialized system of home
mortgage lending, industry officials and analysts said Tuesday.
   Bush's proposal, in addition to hitting taxpayers for half of a
$90 billion problem, calls for the most sweeping regulatory overhaul
since federal deposit insurance agencies were established in 1933.
   Specifically, the president would:
   _Strip the S&amp;L insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., from its parent agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, and merge it into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
guarantees bank deposits.
   _Take what's left of the bank board and make it part of the
Treasury Department. The comptroller of the currency, part of the
department, has regulated national banks since the Civil War.
   ``This is the most comprehensive restructuring of the thrift
regulatory structure that we will see in our lifetime,'' said
Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of Independent Bankers
Association of America.
   Guenther, whose group represents small commercial banks, said the
Bush proposal addresses one of the root causes of today's S&amp;L
problems: coziness between the bank board and the industry it was
supposed to be regulating.
   ``The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has been the sweetheart
regulator of the thrift industry,'' Guenther said. Bush's plan
``ensures that never again will there be such sweetheart regulators
and never again will we have to undergo this type of comprehensive
restructuring.''
   The enlarged FDIC within two years would force S&amp;Ls to comply
with stricter regulatory standards that now apply only to banks.
   S&amp;L owners will also be required to put up more of their own
money. By June 1991, the capital standard for S&amp;Ls would double from
the current 3 percent to 6 percent, which is now the standard for
banks.
   Thus, S&amp;Ls would lose many of the competitive advantages they
have enjoyed while still operating with one major disadvantage. As
they have since 1985 and are expected to into the forseeable future,
thrifts would pay higher deposit insurance premiums than banks.
   The Bush plan raises S&amp;L premiums from $2.08 per $1,000 in
deposits to $2.30. Bank premiums would go from 83 cents to $1.50.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said thrifts would have so much trouble raising new capital and
paying higher premiums that the Federal Reserve Board could be
pressured into allowing bank holding companies to buy S&amp;Ls.
   ``We're going to see a lot of cross-industry mergers,'' he said.
   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, said S&amp;Ls should be given more time to meet the
capital standard and warned that the government could wind up
creating more failures.
   ``What they've done is put the industry in a straitjacket, put it
into the corner and said, `We're going to tax you out of
existence,''' Koch said.
   Meanwhile, FDIC officials estimated at a briefing Tuesday that
the premium increase could put several dozen weak commercial banks
in danger of failure, but said premiums might be eased for those
banks.
   Robert Litan, a banking expert with the Brookings Institution,
said the bank board, as part of the Treasury Department, would not
necessarily be any less receptive to influence by S&amp;Ls.
   ``I think this is just a very initial tentative step toward
merging the two industries. ... The way I read between the lines is
the Bush people have decided not to tackle the very tough political
issue of ending the thrift industry. ... I clearly think they're
looking at this in stages, but they're not going public on what the
next stage is,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, the S&amp;L industry's chief lobbying group, the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions, is gearing up to fight.
   ``It is a proposal. It is no more of a done deal than a budget is
when the president sends it to Congress. The fact is, it is the
White House and the Treasury's wish. That does not translate into it
becoming fact,'' said Mark Clark, a senior vice president of the S&amp;L
association.
   A key S&amp;L ally in the fight will be Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
the chairman of the House Banking subcommittee with jurisdiction
over thrifts. Annunzio is a longtime advocate of an old-fashioned
thrift industry catering to home mortgage borrowers.
   ``Treasury has long shown that it does not favor a separate home
lending agency. Once it got its hands on control of the Feeral Home
Loan Bank Board, it would move to eliminate the industry,'' Annunzio
predicted.
   Thrift executives are pointing privately to Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady's ties to Wall Street, where he headed the
investment banking firm of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., as evidence of a bias
against thrifts.
   According to a financial industry source who spoke on condition
of anonymity, the question of subsuming the bank board into the
Treasury Department was hotly debated within the Bush administration.
   Richard Breeden, the Bush aide in charge of S&amp;L matters, pushed
strongly for the Treasury oversight and was backed by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan at a luncheon meeting with Bush
Saturday at the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, the source
said.

   Schlumberger Ltd.'s 1988 fourth-quarter earnings
tumbled 62 percent because of weaker oil prices although its
full-year earnings rose, the energy exploration giant said Tuesday.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Schlumberger's net income
totaled $118.95 million, or 49 cents a share, down from $315.8
million, or $1.15 a share in the same 1987 period. Operating revenue
was flat at $1.24 billion, compared with $1.23 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   For all of 1988, the New York-based energy concern said earnings
rose 35 percent to $476 million, or $1.80 a share, from $352.6
million, or $1.27 a share, in 1987.
   Its operating revenue rose 12 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.4
billion in 1987.
   Schlumberger said the year's earnings included the sale of one
division and a one-time gain of $22 million from an award by the
Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, formed to resolve property disputes
between Iran and the United States after relations deteriorated in
1979.
   Schlumberger's chairman Euan Baird earlier had predicted that
weak oil prices would have a negative impact on the company's
exploraton and development budgets.

   President Bush refused to prohibit a proposed
acquisition of Monsanto Electronic Materials Co. by a German firm
because the deal posed no national security threat, the White House
said Tuesday.
   Bush's decision against intervening in the proposed purchase of
Monsanto by Huels AG of West Germany came after an investigation _
the first to be carried out under trade legislation passed by
Congress last year.
   Monsanto Electronic Materials Co. manufactures silicon wafers for
use in making semiconductors, the building blocks of computers.
   The investigation was carried out by the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States, headed by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. The probe looked at various issues related to
silicon wafers, including reliability of supply and technology
transfer.
   During the investigation, U.S. officials met with representatives
of Monsanto and Huels.
   A provision in the legislation which overhauled U.S. trade laws
authorizes the president to investigate and, if necessary, to
suspend or prohibit a foreign acquisition of a U.S. business engaged
in interstate commerce.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Continue Rally As Supply Fears Reawaken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures rallied for the fourth straight day Tuesday as
reawakened fears of tightening supplies stirred New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.
   On other markets, copper futures prices gained following an
extended string of losses, gold and silver futures fell, livestock
and meat, energy, and grain and soybean futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled 1.55 cents to 3.34 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $1.4134 a pound, the first close
above the psychologically important $1.40 level since Jan. 23.
   The March contract has risen by 9.23 cents a pound, a gain of
nearly 7 percent, over the past four sessions. The advance has been
fueled partly by concerns about the tight availability of coffee for
delivery against the March contract and partly by fears that a
continuation of the sharp price decline witnessed during the last
two weeks of January could trigger a cutback in producer shipments.
   The International Coffee Organization, a price-control group
composed of the largest coffee producer and consumer countries,
would be required to order a 1-million-bag reduction in exports of
robusta coffee beans if an indicator based on the 15-day moving
average of cash coffee prices falls to $1.20 a pound.
   The indicator stood at $1.2259 at the close of business on
Tuesday.
   Although the indicator would have to drop even further before
affecting shipments of the arabica coffee beans traded in New York,
``it makes some people apprenhensive that if the cut were imposed,
it would lead to shortages,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The prospect of a general labor strike in Brazil, the world's
largest coffee producer, also contributed to the bullish tone.
Brazil's two major unions have scheduled a meeting on Feb. 13 to set
a strke date.
   Copper futures surged on New York's Commodity Exchange after
falling sharply in five of the six previous sessions.
   Analysts attributed the advance to technical factors and
increased buying of actual copper.
   Copper settled 1.15 cents to 2.60 cents higher with March at
$1.315 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on the Commodity Exchange
in reaction to the dollar's gains against other major currencies and
the continuing outlook for low inflation.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.70 lower with April at $395.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4.7 cents lower with March at $5.89 a
troy ounce.
   Hog futures prices steadied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
following Monday's steep decline but pork belly futures fell again
on selling linked to an unexpected increase in hog slaughters.
   Most cattle futures moved higher, boosted by strong cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .22 cent to .45 cent higher with February at
75.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with March at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with February at 42.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .22 cent to .92 cent lower with February at
38.60 cents a pound.
   Among energy futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .15 cent to .32 cent
higher with March at $17.70 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent to
.49 cent lower with March at 49.87 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .04 cent lower to .52 cent higher with March at 49.26 cents a
gallon.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean and corn futures advanced
late in response to firmer cash prices for soybeans and soybean
meal. Wheat finished narrowly mixed.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1} cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.27\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{
cents higher with March at $2.67 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{
cents lower with March at $2.14 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{
cents higher with March at $7.57{ a bushel.

   A bevy of positive developments, most notably an
increase in General Motors' dividend, reinvigorated Wall Street
Tuesday and sent stock prices sharply higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 26.07 to 2,347.14,
its highest close since the October 1987 crash. The last time the
average closed higher was Oct. 15, 1987, two trading days before the
crash, when it stood at 2,355.09.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declilners by about 11 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,095 stocks rising, 425 falling and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 217.26 million
shares, up from 150.98 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 264.07 million shares.
   Analysts said a variety of factors revived the market after a
five-session pause.
   A major impetus came from GM's announcement that it was splitting
its stock and sharply raising its dividend. Analysts said the
automaker's action indicated the company had confidence in the
market, and its optimism proved to be infectious.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, soared 4] to
93~ in heavy trading. The jump accounted for 6.25 points of the gain
in the Dow Jones average.
   Another surging stock that lent support to the rest of the market
was Union Carbide, which jumped 2[ to 30[ and was the most actively
traded issue on the NYSE.
   Carbide, often the subject of takeover rumors, was once again
said to be a target, but analysts said a chunk of the buying Tuesday
came from investors who wanted to take advantage of the chemical
company's upcoming dividend.
   Jack Baker, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said Wall Street had expected the Federal Reserve to raise its
discount rate Tuesday, but when the anticipated hike failed to
materialize, stocks rallied further.
   Other factors contributing to the advance were the vote by
Congress to kill a pay raise for House and Senate members and top
Bush administration officials, and positive reaction to President
Bush's announcement Monday of a bailout plan for the savings and
loan industry.
   ``You couldn't get much more positive news across the board,''
Baker said.
   Some of Wall Street's recent gains have come from its own upward
momentum as investors have jumped into the market to avoid missing
the rally.
   Such was the case again Tuesday, said Alfred E. Goldman, a market
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Tuesday's developments ``created all kinds of intestinal problems
for those on the sidelines,'' Goldman said.
   Goldman said the market appeared to have returned to an upward
track following its pause, which included a 10-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Monday.
   ``The market was ripe for a good rally,'' he said, and predicted
more gains before the president delivers his budget message to
Congress in a speech Thursday night.
   Big gainers Tuesday included Ford Motor, up 1[ to 55~, and IBM,
up 1 to 127|.
   A big loser was Burlington Resources, which fell 2} to 46]. On
Monday, the stock soared 10 points after Pennzoil said it acquired 8
percent of the company's shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $30.09 billion, or 1.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.83 to 168.02.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index closed up 3.82 to 346.41, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 3.59 to 299.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was up
3.19 to 409.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index picked up 1.90 to close at 326.38.

<HEAD>Chicago Show Opens Saturday; Japanese Sports Cars In Spotlight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The automobile spotlight turns to Chicago this
week as the nation's oldest auto show gets under way Saturday,
featuring a trio of new Japanese sports cars.
   Mazda Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. each
have scheduled introductions of two-seaters for the nine-day show.
   Mazda's MX-5 is, in some sense, a throwback to a simpler time in
motoring history. Honda's offering is a futuristic-looking new model
for its upscale Acura line, and Nissan's is an updated version of
its 300ZX.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. market small numbers of
two-seaters in the United States. GM sells the Buick Reatta, the
Chevrolet Corvette and the Cadillac Allante, whose body is made in
Italy. Chrysler offers the TC, made by Maserati of Italy using many
Chrysler parts.
   Ford got out of the two-seater business earlier in the 1980s when
it dropped its Escort EXP to devote production capacity to its
regular Escort line of subcompacts.
   ``They're all two-seaters, but they're different classes,'' auto
analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
said of the U.S. cars.
   ``It's a niche here and a niche there,'' she said. ``Everybody is
going to be niched to death.''
   The new Acura will have an estimated sticker price of $55,000.
Honda has released few details on the model.
   Mazda's latest entry into the two-seater market resembles the
Lotus Elan from the 1960s, inside and out, according to photos in
trade and auto-buff magazines. Missing is a lot of today's glitzy
digital instrumentation, replaced by basic dials and gauges. It's
expected to cost about $13,000 when it arrives in showrooms this
summer.
   The 300ZX is a new design under an old name. It's shorter and
wider than the current 300ZX, the latest in a series of ``Z-cars''
that began in 1969 with the 240Z, then a Datsun.
   Nissan also will exhibit for the first time its Axxess minivan
the company plans to import from Japan later this year. The
minivan's future is cloudy, however.
   The Treasury Department may rule that imported sport-utility
vehicles and minivans, including the Axxess, will be subject to a
25-percent tariff that now is imposed on vehicles classified as
trucks. Nissan's Thomas Mignanelli, executive vice president for
U.S. operations, has said that the company may keep the Axxess out
of America if it is subject to the tariff.
   Few new products from U.S. manufacturers are expected at the
Chicago show, which is being challenged by a restyled auto show in
Detroit. That show, which ran Jan. 7-15, attracted more than a dozen
concept cars and a variety of new-car introductions, including those
of two Japanese luxury lines.
   Organizers of the Detroit show said they wanted to bring the
biggest and best auto show in the country back to Motor City. It
attracted more than 636,722 people this year, 35 percent more than
the show record set in 1986.
   But the Chicago show, in its 81st year, consistently has outdrawn
the Detroit show and has been the nation's foremost display of new
vehicles. Last year it drew 974,432 people.
   Both shows are sponsored by local automobile dealer associations,
but the Chicago show also includes displays from allied industries _
from car-wax companies to drag-racer makers.
   More than 1,000 vehicles will be on display in Chicago, about 300
more than in Detroit.
   Organizers in Detroit argue they are limited by the size of Cobo
Center, which opened a 200,000-square-foot addition just in time for
the show, giving the center a total of 600,000 square feet of
display space. The Chicago show uses McCormick Place, which is
slightly larger at 650,000 square feet.

   President Bush's proposal for bailing out the
savings and loan industry is receiving a lukewarm reaction from
Texas depositors, but many in the state worst hit by the crisis say
they're glad to see some action.
   S&amp;L depositors visiting downtown Dallas branches Tuesday said
they know that any bailout plan will cost them, whether through the
institution they use or as taxpayers.
   ``One way or another, we'll still end up paying for it _ either
through lower interest rates (on accounts) or higher service
charges,'' said Jeff Estrachan, a depositor at Murray Savings, which
has been losing money but is not insolvent.
   Estrachan said he doesn't know if anyone will find a better way
to solve the thrift crisis, which has afflicted many savings
institutions in Texas, ``but I'm glad somebody's doing something.''
   Cheryl Harris, 33, another Murray depositor, is worried about
interest on her savings account. ``I can finally put something
(savings) away and now it looks like it won't be worth it.
   ``It'll probably end up the money I save will go to new taxes,''
she said.
   Under Bush's plan, insurance premiums paid by S&amp;Ls would increase
from 20.8 cents to 23 cents per $100 deposit. The premiums on bank
deposits would rise from 8.3 cents per $100 to 12 cents.
   The thrift plan would make the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
the insurer or thrifts as well as banks.
   It also would tighten S&amp;L regulatory procedures and boost funding
for investigation of wrongdoing by $50 million.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said any plan now is worth looking at.
``This program does face up to it (the S&amp;L crisis), but it's sort of
like kissing your mother-in-law.''
   Kevin Bain, a depositor at Sunbelt Savings,, a new thrift that
resulted from the merger of eight troubled savings institutions
rescued by the government last year, blames Congress for the
deepening crisis.
   ``A policy gets put into place to protect us,'' he said. ``Then
some crook finds a way around it and everyonepays. The warning signs
were out there for Congress years ago.''
   ``Now it looks like we'll (the taxpayers) get screwed again,''
Bain said.
   All three thrift customers agreed that fraud within the system is
not being handled well by the justice system.
   ``It's just like armed robbery,'' Estrachan said. ``Those guys
ought to be sent to Huntsville (prison), just like any other felon.''
   ``They seem to be going too slow on catching the guys
responsible,'' Harris said.
   Gramm, reached in Washington on Tuesday, said he will support
Bush's proposal, but predicted it will be hard to sell to the
industry and taxpayers.
   ``After looking at every option, I like this better than any
alternative,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   In a deal that would be worth $365 million,
Williams Telecommunications Group Inc. announced Tuesday it has
entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Lightnet, a
Delaware-based fiber-optic network.
   Williams has a nationwide fiber-optic network that extends for
about 6,400 route miles. Fiber-optic technology allows strands of
optical glass as thin as hairs, encased in underground cables, to
carry huge volumes of information via bursts of laser light.
   The transaction to acquire Lightnet's 4,500-mile fiber-optic
system would link the company to nearly all major metropolitan areas
in the country, said Williams President Roy Wilkens.
   Lightnet is owned by subsidiaries of Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp. and CSX Corp. Completion of the
transaction, scheduled by early April, is subject to government
approval.
   Williams Telecommunications, about 84 percent owned by The
Williams Companies, Inc., in the past three years has become one of
the nation's leading telecommunications common carriers for long
distance companies and the private networks of corporations and
institutions.
   Lightnet's network serves 38 major cities including Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, New
Orleans, Jacksonville, Tampa and Miami.
   Williams Telecommunications has primarily served the midwestern
and western United States. The Williams Companies, Inc., also is
engaged in the pipeline transmission of natural gas and petroleum
products.

<HEAD>Hightower's Plan Still Getting Chilly Reception from Feds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower
continued his push Tuesday to allow exports of hormone-free Texas
beef to Europe, but federal officials say Hightower is hindering
their own negotiations in the latest U.S.-European trade dispute.
   Hightower is proposing a plan to that certify beef is
hormone-free based on guidelines from European Economic Community
veterinarians. He contends Texas suppliers and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture could quickly meet the standards ``and regain this
export market.''
   ``This is, in essence, the same verification procedure used by
all of our competitors for their sales of this specialty product to
European importers. If they can do it, we can do it better,''
Hightower said.
   The EEC has banned imports of hormone-treated beef because of
health concerns over the growth stimulants, cutting off a $100
million market for U.S. producers. The United States retaliated by
setting $100 million in higher tariffs on a variety of Common Market
goods.
   USDA officials said they would not comment on Hightower's plan
until they review it. Jane Adams, a spokeswoman for the agency's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said a copy of Hightower's
proposal had not been received by Tuesday afternoon.
   But on Monday, acting Secretary Peter Myers said: ``The bottom
line is here we have a trade representative trying to negotiate with
Europe and one person trying to to their own thing. It doesn't help
our negotiation process.''
   At his confirmation hearing last week, Agriculture
Secretary-designate Clayton Yeutter said Hightower's actions were
undercutting U.S. efforts ``in a very major way'' and that it would
help to have him ``on our side rather than their side.''
   Myers, who is running USDA pending Yeutter's Senate confirmation,
said he would have to review Hightower's proposal, but ``anything we
do will have to fit any packing company in the United States...if
and when we do it.''
   Myers said Hightower ``obviously does things for political
reasons, so you have to suspect what's going on.''
   Hightower, a Democrat, contends he simply is trying to expand
markets for Texas producers.
   ``National leaders on both sides of the Atlantic should help
agriculture make trades, not war,'' Hightower said Tuesday.
   Under Hightower's plan, producers would file federal affidavits
certifying their cattle were produced without artificial growth
stimulants.
   Texas beef shipped to Europe would receive the same USDA
certification now authorized for selling hormone and growth
stimulant-free beef to U.S. customers, Hightower said.
   USDA alao would perform urine and fecal tests on one of every
2,000 live animals destined for European export to determine if
synthetic hormones were present.
   He said top European veterinary inspectors were in Austin, Texas
last week to review the EEC's new import regulations.
   ``As we suspected, meeting the EEC's technical requirements turn
out not to be the `impossible task' that USDA officials claimed it
was. Practically all of the verification procedures required by EEC
are either already being practiced by USDA or can easily be
incorporated into their current practices,'' Hightower claimed.

   The Federal Reserve's war against inflation
passed a milestone Tuesday as short-term interest rates exceeded
long-term rates by one widely watched measure for the first time
since April 1982.
   The Fed's tight-money policy could mean higher rates on mortgages
and consumer loans in the weeks ahead, but in the long run it should
bring down inflation and interest rates, analysts say.
   ``The ultimate message is that markets expect future inflation to
be lower than current inflation,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chief
economist of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Some other analysts said the switch could spell trouble, noting
that past flip-flops in short- and long-term rates often reflected
credit crunches that led to recessions.
   If banks raise their prime lending rate to cope with the squeeze
by the Fed, a whole range of consumer rates that are tied to the
prime automatically would rise. The prime rate is 10.5 percent and
many analysts predict it soon will be raised to 11 percent.
   Long-term rates are ordinarily higher than short-term rates
because investors demand higher yields in return for the risk of
keeping their money locked up for longer periods.
   But for the last year, short-term rates have been rising and
long-term rates falling, trends that culminated in Tuesday's
flip-flop.
   The rise in short-term rates has been brought about by the
Federal Reserve, which uses the higher rates to discourage
borrowing, cool off the economy and prevent inflation from getting
out of hand.
   Meanwhile, the Fed's tactics have won the confidence of
inflation-wary investors. Because they are no longer demanding such
a big premium to keep their money tied up in bonds, long-term rates
have fallen.
   The so-called inversion of the yield curve occurred Tuesday
morning. By the end of the day, the yield on the Treasury's
three-month Treasury bill was at 8.82 percent and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.79 percent.
   By some other measures _ say, comparing yields on the 30-year
bond and the one-year note _ the inversion in yields had already
occurred.
   Kudlow said the inversion in yields signals a decline in
inflation that will be good for both stocks and bonds.
   Skeptics say the Federal Reserve does not have a delicate hand on
the tiller of the economy and is very likely to cause a recession by
pushing short-term rates too high.
   Since the Civil War, all 22 times the yield curve has inverted
there has been a recession or a ``growth'' recession, in which
industrial production declined, according to Raymond Dalio,
president of Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn.
   Dalio said Tuesday that a flat yield curve is necessary for now
because the United States needs high short-term rates to attract
foreign money and prop up the value of the dollar. But he said if
the Fed overdoes the tightening, which he expects, there will be ``a
deep downturn emerging at the end of '89 or the beginning of '90.''
   The current situation perplexes money managers who have to decide
whether to put money into short-term or long-term debt securities,
said Dale Krieger, managing director of Carnegie Hill Asset
Management in New York.
   On one hand, managers can get guaranteed annual returns of 9
percent by putting money into short-term instruments. But by doing
so they miss the chance to get in at the start of what some believe
will be a bull market in bonds brought on by declining inflation.
   Krieger said his firm's clients are playing it safe, passing up
speculation in the bond market and pulling in unusually high yields
on short-term debt. ``For us, this is a gift,'' he said.

<HEAD>Polaroid Loses $7.5 Million in 1988 Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. on Tuesday posted a $7.5
million loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 it attributed to the
costs of a corporate restructuring earlier in the year.
   Polaroid, which has been battling to fend off a hostile takeover
bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc., said sales for the period totaled
$533 million, up 4.7 percent from $509 million in the corresponding
1987 quarter.
   The loss included a $54.9 million charge to cover remaining costs
the restructuring, which included elimination of 1,300 workers under
a voluntary severance plan, planned global distribution of 35mm film
and a $300 million employee stock ownership plan.
   The loss compared to earnings of $42.3 million in the same
quarter the previous year.
   For the full year, Polaroid said it lost $22.6 million on sales
of $1.86 billion, compared with earnings of $125 million, or $2.02
cents a share, on revenue of $1.76 billion in 1987.
   The full year figures include a $152 million charge for the
restructuring, which was announced in July, and other expenses to
fend off Disney family-owned Shamrock, the instant camera company
said.

   Federal regulators, wasting no time in
implementing portions of President Bush's savings and loan rescue
plan, announced Tuesday that they had begun taking control of more
than 200 insolvent savings and loans institutions which are still
operating.
   Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
deposits at commercial banks, and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which performs the same function for S&amp;Ls,
announced that combined regulatory teams from the two agencies had
been put into place at four insolvent S&amp;Ls located in Maryland,
Florida, California and Texas.
   Within a month, officials said they hoped to have federal
regulatory teams in place at approximately 224 S&amp;Ls which are still
operating even though they are technically insolvent.
   The announcement came just a day after Bush unveiled the
administration's plan to overhaul the S&amp;L industry. Officials said
they were moving with dispatch to emphasize the urgency of the
problem.
   Officials said that all of the insolvent S&amp;Ls would continue
normal operations. However, their operating decisions will be
subject to approval from the federal regulators. The institutions
will remain under government control until regulators can find
buyers.
   Regulators were urged to take this action last week by the
General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress. The GAO
said that the sick S&amp;Ls needed to be ``effectively isolated'' from
the healthy segment of the industry.
   In the past, the sick S&amp;Ls have been able to offer higher rates
of return in an effort to attract depositors' money, thereby bidding
up the cost of funds for the total industry and increasing the
ultimate cost to the government of bailouts.
   Estimates have been that the industry's losses, including the
insolvent institutions which were allowed to continue operating, was
adding $1 billion a month to the total bailout cost.
   The four institutions taken over on Tuesday were Baltimore
Federal Financial of Maryland; Freedom Savings and Loan Association
of Tampa, Fla.; Pacific Savings Bank of Costa Mesa, Calif., and Gill
Savings Association of Hondo, Texas.
   Two of the institutions, Freedom and Gill, were already under
government control in a supervisory program run by S&amp;L regulators.
Under the new initiative announced Tuesday, the S&amp;L regulators will
be joined by regulators from the FDIC and other federal banking
agencies.
   ``If you walked by the institution the next day, the only way you
are going to be able to tell we are in there is there will be a few
more people in the offices,'' said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman.
   Officials said that between 1,200 and 1,500 government regulators
will be involved in the massive supervisory undertaking, half from
the FDIC and the S&amp;L agencies and the other half from the Federal
Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Seidman said that the government regulators would be seeking to
minimize operating losses at the institutions, eliminate speculative
lending practices and seek out and halt any continuing practices of
insider abuse and fraud.
   Bush's plan to overhaul the S&amp;L industry, which the president
unveiled Monday, calls for the FDIC to take administrative control
of FSLIC, the S&amp;L insurance fund.
   While the funds contributed by banks and S&amp;Ls would be kept
separate, the FDIC would manage both insurance funds in Bush's
proposal. The total takeover of the S&amp;L insurance fund by the FDIC
would require congressional approval.
   However, the joint supervisory effort did not need congressional
approval to be implemented.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which oversees FSLIC, emphasized that the employees of both the FDIC
and FSLIC would strive to work in ``full cooperation and harmony.''
   Officials said that while about three or four of the 224
insolvent institutions would be closed, in most cases the government
regulators would keep the insolvent institutions open until Congress
comes up with the $50 billion rescue package recommended by Bush.
   Wall said the institutions were being taken over by government
regulators on a priority basis which would deal first with the
largest insolvent institutions that were losing money at the most
rapid clip. The four institutions taken over on Tuesday all had loan
portfolios and other assets in excess of $1 billion.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday pledged to seek a
bipartisan solution to the S&amp;L crisis and praised Bush for acting
decisively in the early days of his administration.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said he
and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, would
jointly sponsor the administration's package. Riegle said he hoped
to schedule hearings in the next two weeks in his committee to begin
ironing out differences concerning the plan.
   ``I am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match
the speed of the administration,'' Riegle said. ``When we are losing
on the order of $33 million a day (from S&amp;L operating losses), all
of us are under enormous responsibilities to get this package done.''
   His counterpart, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas., also pledged quick action by his committee,
saying he hoped to vote on the bill in the committee by the first
week in March.
   The Bush proposal, in addition to making changes in the way S&amp;Ls
are regulated, proposes raising the estimated $90 billion cost of
bailing out the S&amp;L industry through a combination of tax dollars
and higher insurance premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls.
   Some members of the Senate Banking Committee questioned whether
the funding approach represented the proper mix between taxpayer
money and industry funds, but senators were generally supportive of
the overall approach.
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, testifying before
the committee on the S&amp;L crisis, also urged quick congressional
action on the Bush package, saying he believed it addressed all the
major problems facing the S&amp;L industry.
   Volcker did say he was concerned that deposit insurance premiums
not be raised to such a level that they harmed the ability of S&amp;Ls
and banks to compete with other industries in offering financial
services.

   Holly Farms Corp.'s board of directors on
Tuesday recommended the company's stockholders approve a merger
agreement with ConAgra Inc. instead of a rival proposal from Tyson
Foods Inc.
   The board said ConAgra's stock-swap proposal was substantially
equal to a Tyson proposal to pay $63.50 per share if Holly Farms
agreed to a merger, and had less strings attached. Tyson also has an
outstanding $60 a share hostile cash tender offer for Holly Farms.
   The company said a stockholders meeting would be convened as soon
as possible to vote on a merger with ConAgra.
   ConAgra's deal has been valued at about $1.06 billion and Tyson's
$1.09 billion.
   The Holly Farms board said there were reasons to doubt that a
deal with Tyson could be completed.
   ``This was due to the prospect of protracted litigation between
ConAgra and Tyson Foods,'' the company said.
   The Holly Farms board said an opinion from investment banker
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said the terms of the ConAgra agreement were
fair to Holly's stockholders.
   Holly Farms shares lost 12{ cents to close at $61.62{ in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Tyson on Monday extended its cash tender offer for the company
for another week. Officials for the company deferred calls Tuesday
to attorneys in New York who were not available for comment.
   ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb.-based food and poultry processor, and
Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., have been seeking Holly Farms for months.
   Holly, based in Memphis, Tenn., had intended to merge with
ConAgra but later encouraged both suitors to up their offers in
order to maximize the gain for shareholders in the event of a sale.
   The board's announcement was the second major setback to Tyson in
the past several days. Last Monday, a federal judge barred Tyson
from issuing false or misleading information about its takeover
offers for Holly Farms.
   ``The company, since its board meeting of Jan. 20, had invited
Tyson and ConAgra to improve the terms of their respective
proposals,'' the Holly statement said. ``ConAgra had made no
changes. Tyson had added a condition to theirs, and that, along with
the prospect of litigation between Tyson and ConAgra had led the
board to conclude that their concerns over the Tyson proposal were
even more acute than before.''
   Holly spokesman Ted Bailey said the company would mail statements
to shareholders soon seeking their approval of the ConAgra deal.

<HEAD>GE Yearly Earnings Up Nine Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. on Tuesday said fourth-quarter
earnings for 1988 were down 2 percent from the same period the
previous year, when the telecommunications company benefited from a
property sale that boosted net income for the quarter by $26 million.
   The company reported fourth-quarter net income of $326 million,
or 96 cents a share, on consolidated revenues and sales of $4.3
billion, compared to net income of $334 million, or 99 cents a
share, on consolidated revenues of $4.1 billion for the same period
a year ago.
   Excluding non-operating items, quarterly profits would have risen
6 percent, GTE said.
   For the full year, net income rose 9 percent to a record-high
$1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion earned in 1987. Earnings per
share totaled $3.58, also up 9 percent over the $3.29 reported a
year ago. Consolidated 1988 revenues and sales were $16.5 billion, 7
percent more than the $15.4 billion reported for 1987.
   James L. Johnson, GTE chairman and chief executive, noted that
the price of GTE stock rose by 26 percent in 1988 and said the
company has taken several steps to enhance future earnings growth.
   ``These included reducing our holdings in US Sprint and in our
network-switching business, divesting certain other businesses not
earning an adequate return as wellin a prepared statement.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday denied Polaroid Corp.'s
request to block a hostile takeover bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc.,
which the camera giant had accused of violating federal securities
laws.
   Polaroid last week sought a preliminary injunction against the
bid, charging that Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock made false and
misleading statements in soliciting proxies from Polaroid
shareholders.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington also denied Polaroid's
motion for expedited proceedings.
   ``The lawsuit will continue and will proceed in due course,''
Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said.
   Shamrock, the investment vehicle of the Roy E. Disney family, is
offering $45 a share in a bid that values Polaroid at $3.2 billion.
Shamrock has vowed a proxy fight for control of the Cambridge-based
company's board of directtors.
   Shamrock has filed suit against Polaroid in Delaware Chancery
Court asking that Polaroid be barred from implementing a proposed
stock buyback and a new stock issue.
   The takeover battle between the two companies began last July.

<HEAD>Plessey Rejects As ``Outrageous'' Revised GEC-Siemens Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plessey Co. PLC on Tuesday rejected as
``outrageous'' a revised proposal by Britain's General Electric Co.
PLC and West Germany's Siemens AG aimed at obtaining British
government approval for a joint bid for Plessey.
   ``This is absolutely no way to decide on the future of key
sectors of the British and European electronics industry,'' Stephen
Walls, Plessey's managing director, said in a statement.
   GEC and Siemens announced new proposals Monday for dividing up
various Plessey businesses should their takeover bid for the
electronics and defense contractor succeed.
   The revised plan, submitted to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which is investigating the bid, was an attempt to calm
British government concerns about maintaining competition in the
electronics industry.
   Walls called the new restructuring proposals a ``good
old-fashioned carve-up of an aggressive competitor by two tired
European monolithic enterprises.''
   The Plessey official also complained about the timing of the
move, which ``provided only the minimum amount of time for proper
discussion and review.''
   The $2.96 billion bid for Plessey was referred to the monopolies
commission nearly a month ago. The commission was given three months
to conclude its investigation and decide whether the bid should be
allowed to procede.

<HEAD>Eastern Baggage Handlers Walk Off Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Eastern Airlines employees represented
by the Machinists union staged a brief walkout Tuesday at Miami
International Airport, a company spokeswoman said.
   Details on the walkout were sketchy. Two Machinists sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity said the walkout was prompted by the
belief that workers were forced to work overtime. Some union members
have drawn five-day suspensions in recent days, the sources said,
for refusing to work extra hours.
   The Machinists and Eastern are locked in a contract dispute that
could determine the future of the loss-plagued airline, a subsidiary
of Texas Air Corp. of Houston.
   Eastern said the walkout had little effect on Eastern's
operations.
   ``The flights at the terminal have been covered by management
personnel with no significant disruption,'' Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell said. He added that there had been ``some delays up to about
15 minutes.''
   Matell said the workers who walked out would be ``disciplined in
the normal course and the normal manner.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Cori Zywotow, another Eastern spokeswoman, said no other airports
were affected.
   She said management would meet with Machinists officials
Wednesday for ``a continuation of a meeting held (Tuesday) to
discuss disciplinary action that was taken over the weekend on
employees who refused to work overtime as provided in the contract.''
   Union sources said the midafternoon walkout wasn't called by
union leadership. They said the walkout began with baggage handlers
and was joined by other union members. Estimates of those
participating ranged to 1,000.
   After declaring an impasse last week, the National Mediation
Board set a 30-day cooling-off period ending March 3 in the Eastern
contract dispute with the Machinists. The union cannot strike before
then.
   If no settlement is reached by then, Eastern's largest union
could strike the Miami-based carrier and the company could impose
its last contract offer, calling for $150 million in wage cuts.
   Some of the largest cuts have been directed toward union baggage
handlers, whose average earnings last year were in the mid-$30,000
range.
   Machinists locals around the country began this week voting on
whether to authorize a strike if the March 3 deadline passes. Union
officials expect overwhelming support for strike authorization.
   Mechanics make up about half of the 8,500-member union,
comprising more than one-fourth of all Eastern employees, while the
other members are baggage handlers, ramp agents and other ground
services workers.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 new graf after 5th graf Demand is...to RESTORE Boeing
estimate of new plane market.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Few industry analysts expect a repeat of last
year's record orders for commercial jets, but one manufacturer says
the demand to replace aging aircraft is high enough to cover $450
billion in new orders by 2005.
   American Airlines got the 1989 sales year off to a big start
Tuesday by announcing a contract with McDonnell Douglas Corp. for up
to 142 planes. The deal was estimated to be worth as much as $7
billion.
   The order, potentially one of the biggest ever, could eclipse
last September's order by Delta Air Lines for up to 215 planes from
Boeing Co. and McDonell Douglas, valued at $6 billion to $10 billion.
   Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium and third
player in the commercial airliner manufacturing market, split a
$5.04 billion order for 130 planes placed last May by International
Lease Finance Corp. for 130 planes.
   Demand is outpacing production at all three, say analysts who
noted that American's order from McDonnell Douglas ensures the
carrier will have planes ready in the near future.
   Furthermore, the overall new plane market shows signs of strength
in coming years, according to Boeing. The company estimates the n`we're
essentially sold out on
that airplane up to the '92-93 period,'' he said.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said Monday there is a waiting
period for new Boeing jets, negotiable with each order, but
``usually a couple of years out.''
   Don Hanson, McDonnell Douglas spokesman in Long Beach, Calif.,
said his company's delivery dates generally extend into 1993.
   ``However, there are always ways to be able to swap delivery
positions to satisfy a customer,'' Hanson said.
