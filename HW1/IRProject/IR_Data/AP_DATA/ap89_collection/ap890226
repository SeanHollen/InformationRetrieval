<HEAD>Chinese Weekly Accuses Japan of Rewriting War History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An authoritative Chinese weekly has accused Japan
of ``war responsibility phobia'' for trying to gloss over its role
in World War II.
   The Beijing Review, in its edition for Tuesday, said attempts by
Japanese leaders to deny Japan's wartime crimes represent ``a
chronic, political disease of an epidemic nature.''
   The article was summarized Sunday by the official Xinhua News
Agency.
   China has reacted strongly to recent statements by Japan's Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita that judgement on whether Japan was the
aggressor in World War II should be left to future historians.
   China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in Tokyo to attend the
funeral of Japan's wartime head of state Emperor Hirohito, told
Japan's Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno that Japan ``should avoid
hurting our people's feelings by denying and distorting history.''
   A member of China's legislature accused Takeshita of ``a gross
deception which nobody will believe'' and a commentary in the
English-language China Daily said Takeshita's ``cynical utterances''
will ``smear the image of Japan as a trustworthy member of the world
community.''
   The Beijing Review recalled the 1982 furor over Japanese history
textbooks which China and other Asian nations said were attempts to
whitewash Japan's wartime aggression.
   It also noted the 1986 controversy caused by Education Minister
Masayuki Fujio, and a similar dispute last year involving National
Land Agency head Seisuke Okuno. Both were forced to resign their
cabinet posts after making statements justifying Japan's invasions
of Korea and China.
   ``It is to avoid a repeat of such a historical tragedy that we
Chinese pay so much attention to and criticize those irresponsible
speeches, which not only whitewash past aggressors, but may also
pave the way for militarism,'' the weekly said.
   It said Japan's refusal to recognize its responsibilities in the
war could impede its drive to become a major diplomatic power.
   ``If the statesmen of a country lack the courage to face history
and accept its reality, and cannot obtain trust from the
international community, the country can hardly play a major role in
world politics.''

<HEAD>Brother of Armed Forces Chief Says Confiscated Explosives Were His</HEAD>

   A brother of the armed forces chief
said Saturday that the 80 tons of explosives confiscated by the army
belongs to the petroleum exploration company for which he works.
   Military officials had said earlier that the materials belonged
to ``leftist subversives'' planning a campaign of terror.
   But Julio Regalado, brother of armed forces chief Gen. Humberto
Regalado, said they were innocent exploration materials.
   ``These materials were used by the company where I work for
petroleum exploration,'' he said. However, the government did not
immediately confirm Regalado's claims.
   Regalado said the dynamite, detonators and liquid explosives were
awaiting delivery to the eastern province of Gracias a Dios near the
Nicaraguan border for the U.S.-based exploration company Geosource
Enterprises.
   ``I'm no subversive,'' he said.
   Regalado, 40, said his brother had helped him reclaim the
dynamite, which was under guard at a military installation to keep
it from being stolen ``or used by leftist guerrilla groups.''
   Police and soldiers found the dynamite Thursday in an abandoned
house near Hector Caraccioli Air Base in La Ceiba, about 250 miles
north of the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   Col. Erick Sanchez, chief of the 4th Infantry Batallion, told
reporters the dynamite was ``to be used by subversive groups to
continue the chain of terrorist acts that lately have unleashed
panic in Honduras.'' He said the military was searching
``intensely'' for the terrorists.
   On Saturday, Sanchez refused to confirm or deny Regalado's
account of the explosives to reporters. Government sources said
there would be an official announcement on the matter within the
next few days.
   He said only that ``our guerrilla search operation continues,
particularly on the north coast of Honduras.''
   Four bombs have gone off in Honduras in a week, the latest in La
Ceiba at the offices of the New York-based Standard Fruit Co.
   Other targets have included the Tegucigalpa city hall, an
Interior Ministry office in the capital, a national telephone
company office in San Pedro Sula and a bus carrying U.S. soldiers
and Honduran civilians in Comayagua.

   A 9-year-old boy who fell through the ice
on a lake with another child Saturday drowned after hoisting his
playmate to safety, authorities said.
   The second child, Michael Lewis, also 9, ran for help, but Andrew
D'Alesio apparently suffered cardiac arrest in the icy water and
died two hours later at Columbus Children's Hospital, officials said.
   ``Basically, by the time they got back (to the lake), it was a
search for the body,'' said police Detective William Fineran.
   Fineran said Andrew had managed somehow to push Michael out of
the water and onto the ice before sliding back in again.
   Andrew had disappeared from sight by the time firefighters and
other rescue workers arrived, he said.
   The accident occurred on a private lake in a Columbus suburb,
said Lt. Wayne Allspaugh of the Reynoldsburg Fire Department.
   ``It was thin ice _ it couldn't have been more than a few inches
thick,'' Allspaugh said.
   He estimated Andrew had been in the water about 30 minutes before
he was pulled out by firefighters who used boats and long poles.
   Michael was treated at Mount Carmel East Hospital in Columbus and
released, a nursing supervisor there said.

   The Rev. Fredrick Axel Schiotz, the
first president of the American Lutheran Church, died Saturday. He
was 87.
   Since retiring as head of the 2.5 million-member denomination in
1971, Schiotz had taught at seminaries and colleges and carried out
special tasks for the ALC and Lutheran World Relief.
   Schiotz, a native of Chicago, was elected president of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1954. He worked in merger
negotiations that led to the formation in 1960 of the ALC and was
elected to a six-year term as its first president. He was re-elected
in 1966.
   The ALC, based in Minneapolis, merged with the Lutheran Church in
America and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1987
to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which has its
headquarters in Chicago.
   Schiotz also helped organize the Lutheran World Federation at
Lund, Sweden, in 1947 and served as its president from 1963 to 1970.
   In addition, Schiotz served on the executive committee of the
Lutheran Council in the United States and was a member of the
Central Committee of the World Council of Churches.

   While President Bush met Sunday with the leaders
of modern China, Barbara Bush sipped tea, watched Chinese dancers
and heard a Chinese rendition of ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' within the
walled compound of the last emperor.
   She then strolled through the royal family garden. ``This is
marvelous,'' she said.
   Although the U.S. first lady lived in the Chinese capital city
when her husband served as U.S. liaison officer in the mid-1970s,
neither the compound nor the Forbidden City, which Mrs. Bush also
planned to visit, was open to the public at the time.
   Mrs. Bush attended services Sunday morning with her husband at
the Chongwenmen Protestant Church, where they worshipped when they
lived in China. She then toured the Mansion of the Regent Prince.
   The elegant and traditional walled compound was the home of the
Xuangtong Emperor, better known as Pu Yi.
   Pu Yi, whose life was told in the award-winning 1987 movie ``The
Last Emperor,'' was enthroned in 1909 at the age of 3, but a
revolution three years later forced him to abdicate.
   Mrs. Bush, wearing a blue wool suit and her trademark pearl
necklace, had tea and cookies with Chinese and American women in the
garden of the compound.
   A Chinese band clad in blue traditional robes played string
instruments while young women performed dances with a traditional
flavor. At the close, they gave a rendition of Yankee Doodle Dandy,
and Mrs. Bush stood up and clapped enthusiastically.''
   Pu Yi's family mansion alongside a northern Beijing lake is
guarded by huge red doors and an ornate gate, and remains off limits
to ordinary sightseers.
   Like dozens of other aristocratic mansions of old Beijing, it was
taken over by the Communists who took power in 1949. Now, it houses
the Public Health Ministry.
   Its stately halls have been divided into tiny offices where
hundreds of bureaucrats work under dim light bulbs.
   However, Mrs. Bush had tea and watched the music and dance
program in a separate reception area with about 30 Chinese women.
Among those invited was Premier Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin.
   In the afternoon, Mrs. Bush was to view a newly opened exhibit on
Pu Yi's life in the imperial palace in the heart of Beijing, known
as the Forbidden City.
   Inside two faded wooden halls in a small inner courtyard of the
vast palace complex, the exhibit contains Pu Yi's English-made
bicyle, gramophone, childhood toys, set of Encyclopaedia Britannica
and wedding robe, its multicolored silk threads still brilliant 67
years later.
   It also includes a small piano on which Pu Yi sometimes composed
traditional-style tunes, and a taped recording of one, titled
``Generals On A Southern Expedition,'' that is played repeatedly for
visitors.
   ``On the day peace is restored, my gentlemen, I shall bid you
return and divest you of your battle robes,'' Pu Yi wrote in the
lyrics.
   For Pu Yi and the feeble forces of monarchial restoration,
however, there was no victory, even though he continued to live in
the palace for 12 years after abdicating.
   The exhibit is a poignant testimony to the aimlessness and futile
hopes of those 12 years. Pictures show him in full court dress
seated on a throne during a brief period when he hoped for
restoration, and later taking the throne as the puppet ruler of a
Japanese-created kingdom of Manchukuo in northeast China.
   Finally, he is shown in padded peasant clothing, exercising with
other prisoners in a Communist prison for war criminals.
   Mrs. Bush's itinerary is very different from Nancy Reagan's, who
visited the city in 1984.
   During her two-day tour, Mrs. Reagan toured the Beijing Zoo, a
temple where emperors once offered sacrifices for good harvests, an
acupuncture clinic and a kindergarten. Mrs. Reagan also had tea at
the home of a teacher.

   A car jumped a guard rail and hit a group of
sledders Saturday, killing a 4-year-old girl and injuring three
other children and three adults, authorities said.
   A 20-year-old woman lost control of her car around 2:30 p.m.
while driving south on the Garden State Parkway in southeastern New
Jersey near Atlantic City, said State Police Sgt. Stacy Cranmer.
   The car went over the guard rail and hit the group, which was
standing on top of the embankment, then slid 75 feet to the bottom
of the hill, Cranmer said.
   A 6-year-old boy was in critical condition with head injuries
after being airlifted to Cooper Medical Center in Camden, nursing
supervisor Helene Zehnder said. The other injured children, a
7-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl, were treated at Atlantic City
Hospital's mainland division and released, Cranmer said.
   A 31-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man and a 41-year-old man were
all in serious but stable condition at the medical center with
broken bones and head injuries, the sergeant said. The driver's
condition was not immediately known.
   The victims all were from the Absecon area. Neither the victims'
nor the driver's names were released.
   When the accident occurred, about 50 people were in the area,
which is within walking distance of homes, Cranmer said.
   ``It's a good sledding hill. The thing is they weren't supposed
to be there,'' Cranmer said, adding that a trooper had told a group
of people to leave the area about 45 minutes before the accident.
``This is an ongoing problem that we've had for years.
   ``How do you stop it? Do you arrest people for trespassing?''
Cranmer asked. ``I don't know how you prevent it.
   ``When there's snow and there's kids, all the reasoning in the
world won't stop it.''

<HEAD>Poll: Majority Of Americans Say Bush Doing Good Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans approve of the job
President Bush is doing, according to a New York Times-CBS News Poll.
   Bush received a 61 percent approval rating for his first month in
office, higher than the 55 percent rating given President Reagan in
his first month in office in a 1981 Gallup poll, the Times reported
in Sunday's editions.
   In the new poll of 1,223 adults, only 9 percent of those surveyed
disapproved of the young Bush administration. Thirty percent of the
respondents said they did not know enough about Bush to venture an
opinion.
   The Feb. 18-19 survey was completed before the Senate Armed
Services Committee voted against the nomination of John G. Tower to
be Secretary of Defense, and did not include any questions about the
Tower nomination.
   But in followup interviews, many respondents expressed relief
that the committee had voted against Tower, though they also said
that they did not think the vote would hurt the president, the Times
said.
   Bush scored high in all geographic areas and with all age groups,
the Times said. Geographically, he got his highest approval rating,
67 percent, in the South. His lowest, 54 percent, was in the West.
   Among respondents who said their families earn more than $35,000
a year, 73 percent voiced approval of Bush, while 6 percent voiced
disapproval, the Times said. Among those families earning less than
$12,500, 52 percent of respondents approved of Bush, while 17
percent disapproved.
   The poll had a 3 percent margin of error.

   President Bush on Sunday traded banter with senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, got ``right down to business'' on a
range of topics with Premier Li Peng and returned to a church where
he and his wife Barbara had worshipped in 1974-75.
   The president was bid a ``hearty welcome'' by Deng as they two
began a session at the Great Hall of the People.
   During a picture-taking opportunity, Deng, 84, thanked Bush for
visiting China ``shortly after you took office'' and said, ``we two
have been good friends.''
   ``I'm delighted to see you looking so well,'' Bush told the
Chinese leader, who appeared healthy.
   The session followed a meeting between Bush and Chinese Premier
Li Peng.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, called the meeting with
Li ``a remarkable and unprecedented dialogue, covering issues
ranging from Kampuchea (Cambodia), South Korea, North Korea, the
Middle East, trade, Afghanistan, Taiwan and nuclear proliferation.''
   ``It was an engaged conversation. We got right down to business.
We thought it was an extraordinary conversation,'' Fitzwater said of
Bush.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters Sunday afternoon, said that Bush
and his wife, Barbara, were ``quite pleased with the pace and
substance of the trip and with the extraordinarily warm reception''
by the Chinese.
   During the meeting with Li, Bush said that ``I come here at an
interesting time, both an opportunity and a challenge,'' according
to the Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. It quoted the
president as saying that ``I'm delighted that'' Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit China in May. ``It's a good thing,''
Bush said.
   Xinhua said that Li told Bush that China hopes to establish
good-neighborly relations with the Soviets, but not the bond of
alliance that existed in the 1950s.
   In his meeting with Deng, the two talked about sports and cards.
   Deng told Bush: ``you're an athlete. That's why you're in good
shape.''
   Bush replied: ``I keep trying.''
   Deng agreed that sports were important, and said that the one
sport they had in common was ``playing bridge.''
   ``I gave up bridge a long time ago, too complicated, too
difficult,'' Bush said.
   Deng said he expected Bush's job as president would make it even
harder to find time to play the card game. ``I know it's a hard job
to be the president of the United States and you will be the
champion of the world in terms of having the busiest work
schedule,'' he said.
   Bush apologized to Deng that his visit to China was ``very
short,'' just 40 hours.
   Earlier, the Bushes attended a church that Bush called ``our home
away from home'' in the heart of the Chinese capital.
   He told the Chongwenmen Protestant Church congregation that a
strong faith in God helps people cope with seemingly insurmountable
problems.
   Just before going into his meetings with top Chinese officials,
Bush mixed secular and spiritual talk in brief remarks to roughly
1,400 worshippers seated in the sanctuary of the church hidden
behind high stone walls.
   Speaking through an interpreter, he said that while relations
between the United States and China are basically sound, ``Sometimes
our problems can seem bigger than life itself _ intractable and
fearsome. But I am convinced that, with each other, with our faith
in God, we can meet any challenge, and we will.''
   Bush met later Sunday with Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk. Fitzwater said there were no new developments at
that meeting, and that Bush had reiterated his support for a
reconcilation government in Cambodia with the prince at the head of
it.
   Fitzwater also said Bush assured Chinese leaders that the United
States continues to subscribe to its one-China policy and believes
that the problem of Taiwan is one that should be resolved ``by the
Chinese people'' without pressure from outside.
   He also said that Chinese leaders assured Bush that the Chinese
would not sell missiles to other nations, with the exception of
Saudia Arabia, with which the Chinese has contractual commitments.
   ``This relationship is as important as any we have anywhgere in
the world,' Fitzwater quoted Bush as telling his hosts. ``They will
not be affected by rapid changes in other relationships,'' the
president said.
   Bush and his wife lived here in 1974-75 when Bush was the head of
the U.S. Liaison Office in the period just before the formal
restoration of diplomatic relations between the two world giants.
   During his talk Sunday, Bush noted that his daughter, Dorothy
LeBlond, had been baptized at the Chongwenmen Protestant Church here
in 1975, when she was 16.
   ``That gives us a special feeling of identity and warmth,'' he
said.
   To the predominantly Chinese congregation seated in the octagonal
brick building with dark wood paneling and a neon cross, Bush
praised ``our church away from home.''
   ``It's a little different, though,'' he said. ``Today we came up
with 20 motor cars, with a motorcade, and I used to come to church
on my bicycle, a Flying Pigeon,'' he said.
   At one point he picked up a Chinese baby and cuddled it, and the
baby said ``grandfather'' in Chinese.
   Bush presented church with a gift Bible, saying ``it comes to you
with our heartfelt thanks and our love.''
   ``This church, in a sense, was our home away from home,'' he said.
   On Saturday, Bush mingled with people at a downtown landmark,
delivered a ``thank you'' in Chinese and presented Li with a pair of
black leather boots from Texas.
   Bush, here for a two-day working visit, and Chinese President
Yang Shangkun toasted each other at the banquet in the Great Hall of
the People with vows to strengthen relations, while both hinted at
issues that remain sources of friction.
   Bush made veiled references to human rights concerns and weapons
proliferation while Yang cautioned that ``twists and turns and
relapses may occur in the process of relaxation.''
   But Yang told Bush that his visit, coming so soon after his
inauguration, was a ``big event'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
   ``The Chinese leaders attach great importance to your current
visit. ... The Chinese people know you well, and so do you know
them,'' Yang said.
   Bush returned the praise, claiming ``the world as a whole is
watching the larger movement of our two great nations as we build
even firmer bonds across the vast ocean that joins us.''
   The first lady had a separate schedule for part of the day,
visiting the childhood home of China's last emperor, Pu Yi, and
touring the Forbidden City, the sprawling walled residence of the
imperial rulers.
   On Monday, the president and his wife head to Seoul, South Korea,
for a visit that will conclude their Far East trip. The Korean
government has put 120,000 police on alert in anticipation of
anti-American protest demonstrations.

   A preliminary investigation has raised the
possibility that stress, and not a bomb or metal fatigue, ripped
open a jumbo jet, hurling nine people to their deaths, federal
officials said Saturday.
   Navy and Coast Guard ships, meanwhile, spent the day searching
3,000 square miles of ocean for debris from the United Airlines jet,
which made an emergency landing Friday with a 10-foot-wide,
40-foot-high hole in its side.
   The Boeing 747 had been en route to Auckland, New Zealand, with
336 passengers and 18 crew members aboard.
   ``Nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo
area, but we are not drawing any conclusions yet,'' Lee Dickinson,
an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board told a
news conference Saturday night.
   Dickinson said FBI agents searched the United Airlines Boeing
747's cargo area with dogs earlier Saturday, but found no evidence
of explosives.
   Michael Marx, the NTSB's senior metallurgist, said there was no
evidence that metal fatigue caused the hole. Marx said the condition
of the hole's edge indicated that ``overstress'' _ a stress greater
than the plane could stand _ had been placed on the aircraft, but
did not say what it might have been.
   However, neither Marx nor Dickinson would rule out metal fatigue
as a possible cause.
   A key question for investigators is whether the loss of a cargo
door was a cause or a result of the plane tearing open.
   ``If a door opened in flight, it could possibly cause
overstress,'' Dickinson said in response to a reporter's question.
Dickinson added that the condition could be caused by other factors
he declined to explain.
   The government last July ordered airlines to improve cargo door
lock systems on older Boeing 747s after one partly opened in flight.
   United followed the directive as far as an initial inspection,
but had not added an aluminum and steel part required to be
installed on the door by Dec. 31 of this year, spokesman Russell
Mack said in Chicago. United has completed the addition on six of 25
aircraft it applies to, he said.
   Dickinson said the pilot and co-pilot of United Airlines Flight
811 told investigators Saturday there was no indication of trouble
closing the cargo doors. Dickinson said a warning light in the
cockpit would indicate if the doors were not closed properly.
   The hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door ``exactly'' and
flares further up the aircraft, Dickinson said.
   Investigators began examining the damaged jet earlier in the day.
   A dozen people involved in the investigation peered into the
exposed cargo hold as workers removed baggage from the jumbo jet and
a military police officer armed with an M-16 rifle kept reporters
and photographers at least 50 yards away.
   Aviation experts said earlier the most likely cause was metal
fatigue. However, three FBI bomb experts from Washington were sent
to join the investigation.
   Between 70 and 100 people are participating in the investigation,
including 16 from the NTSB, to look into every possible cause, said
Dickinson.
   ``The FBI is also here working with us because, as I've said
earlier all doors are open,'' said Dickinson. ``All doors are
completely wide open.''
   Investigators may make some preliminary findings, but it will
take nine to 12 months to determine the cause of the incident,
Dickinson said.
   One of three Coast Guard cutters searching the ocean south of
here Saturday afternoon retrieved part of an overhead compartment,
said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Ellner, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   The Coast Guard also found safety instruction cards with ``United
Airlines'' on them, seat cushions and personal items including shoes
and a teddy bear, Ellner said.
   Six Americans, two Australians and a New Zealander aboard United
Flight 811 were instantly blown through the opening, and at least
one was sucked into one of the jet's engines, authorities said. The
airplane was at 20,000 feet when the accident happened.
   Honolulu hospitals reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor
injuries.
   Officials said three people remained in hospitals Saturday: a
48-year-old flight attendant in fair condition with broken bones in
her neck and upper back and abdominal injuries, a flight attendant
recovering from surgery on a fractured arm, and a 73-year-old New
Zealand man in fair condition with heart problems.
   More than 200 people boarded other flights; those who didn't want
to fly were put up in hotels.
   Early Saturday, 110 passengers from Flight 811 arrived in New
Zealand aboard a special United flight.
   ``It was a nightmare and I'm glad I got back on that plane today
because if I'd waited I don't know if I would have ever flown
again,'' said Cathy Mehan, of Washington, who said she was sitting
about 10-12 rows behind the hole in the fuselage of Flight 811.
   ``I think that the United crew did an excellent, incredible job.
The pilot should be recommended, commended _ he was fantastic,'' she
said. ``I was afraid, I didn't think we were gonna make it ... I
thought that this was the end.''
   At dawn, three Coast Guard and Navy ships and helicopters resumed
their search of the Pacific about 100 miles south of here for debris
from the plane. A vessel Friday found two airline seat cushions and
a 4-by-6-foot piece of metal believed to be from the jet, Coast
Guard spokesman Keith Spangler said.
   Authorities had not decided late Saturday whether the search
would continue Sunday, Spangler said.
   The nine missing passengers were identified as Susan Craig and
Harry Craig of Morristown, N.J.; Rose Harley of Hackensack, N.J.;
Anthony Fallon and Barbara Fallon of Long Beach, Calif.; Mary T.
Handley of Bay City, Mich.; Lee Campbell of Wellington, New Zealand;
and Dr. John Michael Crawford and John Swann, both of Sydney,
Australia.
   According to Hawaii Department of Transportation spokesman
Marilyn Kali, the 18-year-old Boeing 747, the oldest in United's
jumbo jet fleet, took off for New Zealand at 1:34 a.m.
   Pilot David N. Cronin heard ``a loud thump'' just before the No.
3 engine failed a few minutes into the flight. A short time later,
the No. 4 engine fire indicator activated and Cronin shut it down.
   At 2:16 a.m., Cronin radioed the traffic control tower, asking
for emergency vehicles, which were standing by when the plane landed
at 2:33 a.m.
   United said Cronin would have no comment.
   Investigators recovered small body fragments and pieces of
clothing in the jet's No. 3 engine, according to the Honolulu
Medical Examiner's Office.
   Susan Starrett, a medical examiner investigator, said it was
unlikely officials would be able to identify the remains, even as
male or female.
   Bill Speicher, United's Pacific Division vice president, said he
hopes to have the plane repaired and returned to service in three or
four months.
   United spokesman Lawrence M. Nagin said the jet had undergone a
complete four-day inspection 88 days before the accident, and a less
intensive check Feb. 16.
   ``It has no history of maintenance problems. This aircraft had a
routine maintenance history,'' Nagin told reporters in Chicago.
   Bobbie Nardis, a spokeswoman for the FAA in Oklahoma City, where
safety records are kept, said cracks were once found near the
structure that holds the engine to the wing. She said the plane also
once had an engine fire.
   But Ms. Nardis said ``people who work with these reports all the
time'' said the plane had nothing on its record that particularly
distinguished it from other jumbo jets.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
toasted ``new progress'' in Sino-American relations Sunday, and Bush
assured Deng that their ties would not be weakened by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to visit Beijing this spring.
   Bush also raised previously expressed U.S. concerns about
proliferation of nuclear missiles. China is one of the world's
biggest arms merchants.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Premier Li Peng
reaffirmed an earlier commitment by Deng that China would not sell
missiles to any country other than Saudi Arabia.
   Later, however, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said Fitzwater had misspoken. Popadiuk said Li did not discuss
specifics but merely restated assurances given last October that
China would act in ``a responsible manner'' regarding missile sales.
   The United States has said it is satisfied with that policy.
   Before heading for South Korea en route home to Washington, Bush
appeared on the government-run television network for a live,
15-minute interview by Chinese journalists _ an unprecedented event
for a foreign visitor here.
   He also entertained his Chinese hosts at a farewell banquet
featuring a Texas-style barbecue and Lone Star beer. But one of
Bush's invited guests, leading Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, was
barred at the front door of the hotel by Chinese police, according
to an American witness.
   Bush had invited Fang, a respected astrophysicist, as a gesture
of support for a small group of Chinese intellectuals who have
called for greater political freedom. ``This really shows China's
attitude toward human rights,'' Fang said later in a telephone
interview. ``At the most, I would have been able to say hello to the
president.''
   White House officials, when asked about the incident, had no
immediate comment. It was not known if Bush was aware of Fang and
his wife's forcible exclusion from the banquet. Fitzwater had said
earlier it was unlikely that Bush would have spoken to Fang at the
dinner.
   South Korean authorities meanwhile braced for the threat of
violent anti-American demonstrations when Bush flies to Seoul on
Monday for a three-hour visit that will include talks with
government leaders and an address to the National Assembly. An
estimated 120,000 police, security agents and commandos were put on
alert.
   During the TV interview, Bush expressed hope for expanded
U.S.-China trade, which he said already had grown from $800 million
in the mid-1970s to $14 billion today.
   ``We are prepared to go the extra mile in terms of investments,
in terms of business, exports and imports,'' he told a questioner.
   In his toast at the farewell banquet, Bush said he was leaving
Beijing ``convinced that U.S.-China relations are strong.''
   ``We have great responsibilities and also great possibilities,''
the president added, promising to work with China's leadership to
``help make this world a safer, more peaceful place for us all.''
   Deng, 84, the country's senior leader, expressed ``a hearty
welcome'' as he greeted Bush in the cavernous Great Hall of the
People. ``We two have been good friends,'' Deng told his visitor.
   Throughout the final day of his visit to Beijing, Bush emphasized
a U.S. desire for warm relations with China.
   As his rode around Beijing in a black limousine, Bush repeatedly
used a microphone in the car to say ``thank you, thank you'' to
thousands of Chinese people who lined the streets.
   However, the air of cordiality was marred when Chinese security
guards pushed and shoved people away from Barbara Bush when the
president's wife toured the Forbidden City, ancient home of Chinese
emperors.
   Carol Powers, a White House photographer accompanying the first
lady, was pushed face-first into a door.
   Mrs. Bush interrupted the tour to declare, ``This girl's job is
to take my picture and she got hit. She works for my husband.'' Mrs.
Bush said the security guards should ``calm down.''
   Later, Mrs. Bush produced Ms. Powers at a news conference and
reported that ``she's fine.''
   The president and Deng established a warm relationship during
Bush's tenure as U.S. envoy to Beijing in the mid-1970s, before
formal diplomatic relations were restored between their two
countries. On Sunday, they bantered about playing bridge, one of the
Chinese leader's passions.
   ``I gave up bridge a long time ago _ too complicated, too
difficult. You are the expert,'' Bush told Deng.
   ``Now it's even more difficult for you to find time to play
bridge,'' Deng responded. ``I know it's a hard job to be the
president of the United States and you will be the champion of the
world in terms of having the busiest work schedule.''
   Bush conferred separately with Li for two hours. ``This
relationship is as important as any we have anywhere in the world,''
Bush said.
   In the past, the United States has expressed concern over human
rights in China, but the White House said Bush did not raise the
subject during his two-day visit this time.
   Bush, dressed in a Western business suit, and Deng, wearing a
gray Mao suit, spent most of their hour-long meeting discussing
East-West relations, focusing on Gorbachev's scheduled trip to
Beijing in May. It will be the first Sino-Soviet summit meeting in
three decades.
   Fitzwater said the president told Deng that the United States
welcomes Gorbachev's trip as an ``important and useful step in
providing stability to the region and the world.''
   ``He (Bush) wanted to assure the chairman that U.S. policy with
regard to China would not be affected by the outcome of those
discussions,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Deng spoke at length about the history of
Soviet-Chinese relations and ``the difficulties he faces in having
this meeting'' with Gorbachev as part of a ``normalization process.''
   Deng almost never hosts luncheons for foreign leaders, but made
an exception for Bush.
   Deng said he wouldn't give a speech but added: ``Let us all raise
our glasses to the health of President and Mrs. Bush and other
American friends and to the new progress in China-U.S. relations.''
   Deng downed a small glass of mao-tai, a potent sorghum liquor.
Bush did the same.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Deng the United States was encouraged by
developments on the Korean peninsula and hoped China would use its
influence with North Korea to engage in talks with the Seoul
government.
   On the delicate issue of Taiwan, Bush said the United States is
committed to a ``one-China'' policy and that the future of Taiwan,
home of the Chinese Nationalist government ousted from the mainland
in 1949, must be worked out by Taiwan and the Beijing government.
   China is unhappy about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and has urged
Washington to be more aggressive in promoting contacts between
Beijing and Taiwan.
   Bush also met on Sunday with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia
and said that ``we strongly support'' the exiled resistance leader
in his campaign for withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation forces from
Cambodia.
   Both the United States and China want Sihanouk to lead a
coalition government in Cambodia.

<HEAD>Government Trying To Keep Secrets About How It Nabbed Lebanese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the hijacking trial of Fawaz Younis, under
way in federal court, the government is trying to keep secrets about
how it nabbed the Lebanese militiaman in an undercover operation in
the Mediterranean.
   Younis is the first suspect arrested overseas and tried under the
1984 Hostage-Taking Act, which gives the government ``long arm''
jurisdiction in cases involving American hostages.
   Younis, 29, is a relative small fry, said Neil Livingstone, an
expert on terrorism. ``This is not the John Dillinger of the
terrorist world. He is a relatively low-level terrorist,''
Livingstone said.
   But to nab him federal authorities cast a multi-million dollar
net involving undercover agents, an aircraft carrier, helicopters
and a fleet of aircraft, according to court arguments and documents
in the case.
   Four days after his arrest on Sept. 13, 1987, Younis was flown to
the United States in a 13-hour flight aboard a plane that refueled
several times in the air, avoiding any contact with foreign
governments that might have clouded U.S. jurisdiction in the case.
   U.S. agents used sensitive intelligence methods in making the
arrest, and a number of the key players in the case are living under
new identities in the federal witness protection program,
prosecutors said during a pretrial hearing on Wednesday.
   At the hearing, U.S. Distrist Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr.
denied requests by defense attorney Francis D. Carter for access to
classified information in 12 categories, ranging from the names of
high-level policymakers who helped plan the arrest to details about
U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and intelligence assets used in the case.
   Younis is accused of leading a band of men who, armed with AK-47
assault rifles, shot their way past security guards and boarded a
Royal Jordanian jetliner in Beirut on June 11, 1985.
   Younis was a member of Lebanon's Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem
faction. He was under orders to fly the plane to Tunis, where an
Arab League meeting was under way, and read a statement demanding
the withdrawal of Palestinian guerrillas from Lebanon, defense
counsel Carter said Wednesday.
   Tunisian authorities denied the plane permission to land and it
returned to Beirut.
   The evidence against Younis includes a videotape of him on the
Beirut tarmac, armed with an assault rifle, announcing that the
Boeing 727 would be blown up.
   One of the passengers, William L. Slade, has also testified that
Younis emerged from the plane's cockpit several times during the
39-hour hijacking and ordered other hijackers to stop beating
Jordanian skymarshals. The beatings resumed when Younis returned to
the cockpit, Slade testified, identifying the defendant in the
courtroom. No one was killed in the hijacking.
   In Septmeber 1987, Younis was lured to the Mediterranean island
of Cyprus by a friend, identified by federal authorities as Jamal
Hamdan.
   Court papers contain the transcript of a conversation
clandestinely recorded at Hamdan's apartment on Cyprus, in which
Younis said he was picked for the hijacking by the head of Amal,
Nabih Berri, who is also Lebanon's justice minister.
   Berri has denounced the arrest as ``an attack against the honor
of Lebanon.''
   During pretrial argument, the defense attorney said he would not
contend that Berri ordered the hijacking, but that his client would
testify that he was under orders to pirate a plane to Tunis.
   According to the defense attorney's arguments in court, Jamal
Hamdan and his brother Ali lured Younis from Cyprus to a two-masted
sailboat with the promise of a drug deal and a party.
   Two FBI agents, a man and a woman, were aboard the yacht, which
was located in international waters to avoid the need for
extradition hearings.
   In the struggle to arrest Younis, both his wrists suffered
hairline fractures, federal authorities said when they announced the
arrest.
   Younis was transferred to a naval supply vessel, the USS Butte,
which took four days to carry him to the western Mediterrean, where
he was moved to the carrier USS Saratoga, Carter said at the hearing.
   Carter asked to introduce evidence that five doctors were flown
by helicopter to the Saratoga beforehand in the event that Younis
was hurt, but that the defendant was not treated until after he
confessed.
   ``The only medication my client received was a bag of ice,'' the
defense attorney said.
   The court, said the judge, ``will allow the defense to argue that
four days is a long time to transport the defendant from the eastern
Mediterranean to the western Mediterranean'' and that ``that there
was not a normal complement aboard the ship,'' said Robinson.
   The defense, in debating whether the ``confession was free and
voluntary,'' will be allowed to argue that there was ``undue delay''
in diagnosing and treating Younis, the judge said.

   A warning light indicated there was a fire aboard a
jumbo jet that landed at Heathrow Airport on Sunday, but
firefighters who rushed to the scene discovered it was a false
alarm, British Airways said.
   The light came on after the Boeing 747 had landed safely on a
flight from Miami and the passengers had disembarked at Heathrow's
Terminal 4, said an airline spokesman, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom.
   ``The emergency services were called as a matter of precaution,''
he said.
   The warning light on British Airways Flight 292 suggested there
was a fire in the plane's auxiliary power unit, located in the tail
of the plane. The unit provides power for the aircraft when the main
engines are switched off.

   A strike at the European space center in French
Guiana has forced postponement of Tuesday's scheduled launch of a
Japanese communications satellite and a European weather satellite,
Arianespace said Sunday.
   Claude Sanchez, spokesman for the European consortium, said a new
date will be set for launching the Ariane 4 rocket after the strike
is settled. He said it was the first time a strike has led to
postponement of an Ariane launch.
   In a statement, Arianespace said it was staying in close touch
with the French company Thomson CSF, whose 230 workers at the space
center in Kourou, French Guiana, have been on strike since Wednesday
seeking higher pay and better insurance and social benefits.
   Many of the Thomson employees are technicians manning radar
controls, operating computers or performing other tasks vital to the
launch, Sanchez said. Negotiations were continuing through the
weekend at Kourou, on the Atlantic coast of South America, but there
was no report of progress.
   The flight scheduled for Tuesday night was to have placed two
satellites in orbit: the first Japanese commercial communications
satellite JC-SAT, and the European meteorological satellite MOP-1.

   Three men, including a Hong Kong resident, have
been executed for drug smuggling in the southern province of Yunnan,
the official press reported Sunday.
   Two others were sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   The Xinhua News Agency said Cao Guojun, of Hong Kong, came to
Yunnan last year and recruited Wu Yinggang and Yang Chunseng for a
scheme to buy heroin abroad and transport it to Hong Kong via
Kunming and Guangzhou.
   In June, Cao returned to Yunnan from Hong Kong, bringing with him
Liang Hongen, from Hong Kong, and Wang Weitong, from Guangzhou, to
work on the scheme.
   Police cracked the case when they found Yang with about 10 pounds
of heroin on July 4, it said. Cao and the three others were picked
up later.
   The report only said that Cao was executed. It did not identify
which two of the remaining four men also died.

   President Bush met with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia on Sunday and expressed support for the resistance leader's
efforts to end Vietnam's 10-year occupation of his country.
   ``We wish you well and respect the resistance you represent,''
Bush told the 66-year-old Sihanouk during their 20-minute meeting at
the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where both were residing.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush made no
new commitments to the prince.
   The United States provides non-lethal aid to the Sihanouk faction
and a second non-Communist group seeking the withdrawal of
Vietnamese occupation forces from Cambodia.
   The third resistance force is the Khmer Rouge, which took power
in 1975 and killed an estimated 1 million of their countrymen with
fanatic agrarian policies before Vietnam invaded and drove them into
the jungles in late 1978.
   China is the main supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge, which
receives no U.S. support.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Chinese Premier Li Peng on Sunday that
the United States rejects a dominant role for the Khmer Rouge in any
future Cambodian government.
   Li repeated China's position that Vietnam should withdraw all its
troops and that Sihanouk should head a four-party coalition
government, which would include the three resistance groups and the
Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government. Li said no single party should
dominate the coalition.
   Fitzwater said he could not recall any discussion between Bush
and Li on the question of Chinese arms supplies to the Khmer Rouge.
China tentatively has agreed to end arms shipments to the guerrillas
if Vietnam fulfills a pledge to withdraw all its troops by September.
   The mercurial Sihanouk, who is noted for his frequent quarrels
with his resistance partners, arrived at Bush's villa after a
limousine ride from his own residence about 100 yards away.
   The prince was greeted by U.S. Embassy officials and Assistant
Secretary of State Gaston Sigur, but stood outside Bush's villa for
about 10 minutes, apparently reluctant to enter until the president
appeared at the door.
   When Bush showed up, Sihanouk greeted him warmly and they went
inside together.
   Sihanouk was driven from the Cambodian throne in 1970 in a coup
he claimed was engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency. Then
strongly anti-American, he returned to his homeland in 1975 when the
Khmer Rouge gained power but was immediately placed under house
arrest.
   Sihanouk fled Cambodia when Vietnam invaded and has spent the
past decade wandering in exile in Beijing, North Korea and Paris. He
has been living at the Diaoyutai guest house here for more than a
month.
   Last month, he resumed presidency of the three-party resistance
one year after he quit in anger over alleged Khmer Rouge attacks on
his troops. He has since directed recent peace negotiations with
Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government.

   China's state-run media gave President Bush's
visit unprecedented coverage, broadcasting the first live interview
of a foreign leader in China and portraying the new president as a
man of the people.
   The two-day visit was front-page news on all of the country's
major newspapers Sunday morning, and it led the nation's radio
broadcasts throughout the day.
   In an unusual move, stations carried a broadcast of Bush speaking
in English to a welcoming banquet. A Chinese translation followed.
   The visit also led the nationwide television news on Saturday and
Sunday nights. On Sunday, the broadcast showed Bush shaking hands
warmly and exchanging toasts with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Bush
was also seen meeting Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang.
   The news also broadcast pictures of Bush during and after his
television interview.
   ``With many thanks,'' the president wrote to China Central
Television as the camera zoomed in. ``The biggest audience I've ever
had _ by far.''
   As with all Chinese reports, sensitive topics were dropped from
the written copy. Chinese media made no mention of Bush's call for
respect for individual rights and his opposition to arms sales ``in
regions of the world marked by conflict.'' The references, however
veiled, were to U.S. hopes for greater personal freedoms in China
and that the nation stop selling arms in the Middle East.
   Still, the coverage was exhaustive.
   The English-language service of the Xinhua News Agency churned
out about 30 stories and one exclusive interview with the president
in less than 24 hours.
   The media blitz is an indication of Beijing's hopes for even
better ties with Washington. It also is a sign of growing Chinese
curiosity in the United States.
   Finally, it shows the Chinese leadership's fascination with
George Bush himself, a man they describe as an ``old friend'' and
who they openly supported in last year's presidential election.
   A waving Bush beamed from the front page of the People's Daily,
the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party and the nation's
biggest paper, printing 4 million copies a day. It ran three stories
on the presidential visit.
   The Beijing Daily, the main newspaper for the capital, portrayed
the new president as a man of the people.
   ``If the visit wasn't such a short one, maybe President George
Bush and his wife would ride their `Flying Pigeon' bicyles once
again to Tiananmen Square,'' the report said.
   The reference was to Bush's 13-month sojourn in Beijing as head
of the U.S. Liaison Office in 1974-75.
   ``At that time,'' the story said, ``he and his wife, Barbara,
often rode their bikes along the big and small roads of Beijing for
exercise, to directly understand Chinese society and have more
contact with the people.''
   In an editorial, the People's Daily said Bush has put ``clean
government'' and ``cooperation with Congress'' on the top of his
agenda. An analysis last week said ``the new president has already
walked out from under Ronald Reagan's shadow.''
   But the top item in the media blitz was Bush's 15-minute
interview on China Central Television.
   ``I've spoke to the American people about a new breeze blowing,''
Bush said in his opening statement before the interview began.
``China was one of the first nations to feel this breeze.''
   Sitting in front of a painting of scenic Guilin, Bush smiled
often as he answered questions mainly about trade relations with
China.
   The questions were asked in English and appeared in Chinese as
subtitles along the bottom of the screen. A State Department
interpreter translated for the president.
   ``This is the first live interview ever with a foreign leader,''
said an editor earlier Sunday. ``We're pretty excited about it here.
We're expecting at least 100 million people to be watching.''

   Everywhere George Bush went on Sunday he ran into
old Chinese friends, from Chairman Deng Xiaoping to the fellow who
used to cut his hair and his onetime tennis partner.
   With Deng, Bush engaged in casual chatter and shook off the old
chairman's suggestion that they get together for a game of bridge
some time.
   ``You're too good,'' said Bush. He lived in China during 1974-75
as head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, before establishment
of U.S.-Sino diplomatic ties.
   Bush stopped at the International Club to have a word with a
``Mr. Wong,'' the tennis pro, who, Bush claimed, has been quoted in
the newspapers back home as saying that he used to beat Bush
regularly at tennis.
   ``I had to stop off and talk to him about that story,'' Bush said
in later apologizing to the staff at the American embassy for being
late.
   He said he also had wanted to look up his barber at the
International Club, a meeting place for foreigners in China.
   The barber, Li Bo, now assistant manager of the club said Bush
sends the club greeting cards every new year and Christmas. ``We're
old friends,'' he told the official Xinhua News Agnecy.
   Mrs. Bush practiced Chinese ``tai qi'' exercises at the club, the
agency said.
   Enroute from the club to the embassy, Bush used a loudspeaker to
shout ``Thank You'' from his limousine to Chinese crowds congregated
along the way.
   At the embassy, he said, he was delighted to have run into
``several of our Chinese friends, co-workers that worked with
Barabara and me right in this very house.''
   In the courtyard on the way out, Bush paused to pose with a group
of American Cub Scouts and Brownies who had waited in the breeze for
more than an hour.
   Who are these kids? someone asked.
   Replied their adult leader: ``Frozen brownies.''
   Bush's most emotional reunion came at the pulpit of the
Chongwenmen Christian Church, where the Rev. Yin Jizeng led the
services. Yin had baptized the Bush's daughter, Dorothy, when the
family lived in Beijing.
   From the pulpit, Bush recalled those days. He said he used to
arrive at Sunday services on his Flying Pigeon bicycle, instead of
at the head of a flashing 20-car motorcade that carried him on
Sunday.
   Back then, only foreigners could attend church services in
Bejing. Sunday 1,400 worshippers crowded into the octogonal church.
China has a billion people; 4 million of them are Protestants.
   When Bush pulled in at the International Club a handful of
Americans awaited him outside. They broke into song: ``God Bless
America.''
   Among them, symbolic of the new China and the new relationship
with the United States, was Jack Law, a poultry geneticist from
Colorado State University, who said he was involved in a joint
business venture to teach the Chinese how to raise their own
breeding chickens. The Chinese must import breeders now, but in a
few years will be raising 10 million of them, he said.
   Bush kidded the staff at the embassy about the exhaustive
preparations that are made when a president comes calling.
   ``I know something about a visit from a president,'' he said.
``We had one when I was out here before this was an embassy. And I
sure was glad to see him go!''
   The visiting president in Bush's past case was Gerald R. Ford.
   ``And if that wasn't enough,'' Bush added in reference to the
former globetrotting secretary of state, ``we survived two (visits)
from Henry Kissinger!''
   That was the sort of day it was for the visiting American
president _ light-hearted interludes between bouts of diplomacy.
   When Barbara Bush, who had gone off by herself to see the
Forbidden City, joined him for lunch at the Great Hall of the
People, Bush was just finishing shaking the hands of some Chinese
potentates. He saw her, and shook hers, too.
   ``How do you do?'' he asked her with artificial formality.
   She gave him a look, and a friendly pat on the back.
   With tiny Chairman Deng, who comes up about to Bush's midriff,
the talk was exceptionally casual.
   Deng is famous for his interest in playing bridge. During the
Cultural Revolution, when he was ousted from power, he passed his
days at a bridge table.
   Deng told Bush it is a sport they have in common. He challenged
the president to a game sometime.
   Bush: ``You're too good.''
   Deng:''It's hard to say. We haven't played together. But even if
we play bridge together, it will be a friendly game.''
   Bush: ``I gave up bridge a long time ago. Too complicated. Too
difficult. You are the expert.''
   Then they went off to one of those big Chinese luncheon banquets.
   Afterward, as he hurried down the steps of the Great Hall to his
limousine, Bush was asked how it went at lunch.
   ``Ate too much,'' was the cryptic reply.

<HEAD>More Inflation-Fighting Moves, Higher Interest Rates Seen Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board's decision last week
to boost its key lending rate to combat inflation is likely to be
followed by further credit-tightening moves and even higher interest
rates, many analysts believe.
   They say the central bank's move to increase the discount rate by
a half-percentage point to 7 percent on Friday came too late and was
too mild to effectively quell an inflation spiral, and that further
steps to cool the overheating economy will be necessary.
   ``The Fed is signaling that it's definitely trying to encourage
higher rates in order to fight the inflationary pressure,'' said
Donald Ratajczak of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University.
   ``The only question is whether they're signaling a little late
and a little timidly,'' he said. ``They definitely are late and a
half-point (increase) is a little timid.''
   Boosting the discount rate, the fee the central bank charges for
short-term loans to banks, is the strongest signal the Fed can send
of its concern about inflation.
   The Fed also has been employing more subtle credit-tightening
moves for the past year, reducing the availability of cash and thus
driving up the interest rates that banks charge when making loans.
   Major banks last week boosted their prime rate _ charged to the
most credit-worthy commercial customers _ for the second time in two
weeks to 11.5 percent as lenders continue to pass along their higher
costs for funds.
   A variety of lending rates covering everything from home
mortgages to new cars are expected to ratchet upward as a result of
the latest round of Fed tightening, and the pattern is expected to
repeat itself.
   ``Until the Fed sees some clear evidence that the economy is
slowing down, it is going to continue to tighten,'' said economist
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``It believes
the economy is running too fast, inflation is accelerating and it's
going to put on the brakes. But it takes awhile for the brakes to
work.''
   Higher interest rates are used to gradually moderate economic
growth in an effort to avoid the higher prices caused by tight labor
markets and supply bottlenecks.
   Concern about inflation heightened last week after the Labor
Department reported that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent in
January, the biggest increase in two years. Earlier reports showed
wholesale prices were up 1 percent last month and indicated the
economy has yet to slow down in response to the Fed's efforts to
maneuver a so-called ``soft landing'' to the 6-year-old economic
expansion.
   Ratajczak said that with inflation unlikely to flag in the near
future, interest rates are bound nowhere but up.
   ``I think we're going to see some more bad inflation numbers and
I think we're going to see some higher interest rates,'' he said.
``Cumulatively, the higher interest rates will slow down the
economy.''
   A similar theme was sounded by economist David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston &amp; Co. in New York, who said the Fed's latest action brought
it ``at best, roughly even with the inflation curve.''
   ``The inflation numbers will continue to show a tendency to
accelerate and it will require further Fed tightening steps,'' Jones
said.
   Most economists are expecting inflation this year to be in the
range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the last
two years. While still far short of the double-digit levels of the
1970s, the current inflation rates have been labeled
``unacceptable'' by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``If inflation emerges, I think a recession will move up on us
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be
a prolonged one,'' he warned in congressional testimony last week.
   Wyss said that while boosting interest rates is not the ideal
cure for inflation, ``it's the only lever the Fed has.''
   ``I don't think they have much alternative but to pull it.''

   Thousands of people jammed a restaurant in Tokyo on
Sunday that sold $15 steak dinners for 55 yen, or 42 cents, to
celebrate its 55th anniversary.
   Lines began forming outside the Suehiro restaurant in the Ginza
shopping district three hours before the steak house opened late
Sunday morning.
   Three hours before the 10 p.m. closing time, 8,000 people had
enjoyed a steak dinner, and the total was expected to reach more
than 30,000 before the three-day offer ended Tuesday, said one
restaurant official, Masao Moriyasu.
   The bargain dinner included seven ounces of imported beef, salad
and rice. The restaurant usually serves about 3,000 people a day, he
said.

   First Lady Barbara Bush, returning Sunday to
favorite sites in the old imperial palace, patted an ancient
``Republican elephant'' statue for luck and asked that heavy-handed
Chinese guards go easier on photographers with her.
   During the rushed one-hour tour of the vast palace complex, Mrs.
Bush said she missed the leisurely pace of her visits there in
1974-75, when President George Bush was stationed in Beijing as U.S.
Liaison officer.
   ``I'm glad I'd seen it before,'' she said as she strode across a
wide, stone-paved plaza between towering gold-roofed halls of the
Forbidden City, now called the Palace Museum.
   ``Before I used to ride my bike over, give someone 2 cents and
spend the afternoon with a houseguest,'' she said. The 2 cents was
the bike parking fee.
   Mrs. Bush greeted a familiar bronze statue of a kneeling elephant
near the palace's rear gate with delight, crying out, ``There's my
Republican elephant.''
   ``Do you think it's good luck to touch it?'' she asked her
escort, museum director Yang Xin. When he nodded, smiling, she
reached out and stroked its tusk.
   She also stopped to admire a pine tree in the palace garden with
speckled silver bark, saying, ``It's really very unusual. I used to
know its name.''
   Hundreds of Chinese tourists, kept to the sides by security
guards, watched bemused and curious as Mrs. Bush's entourage of
about 100 guards, aides and journalists walked the more than 1.5
miles of the complex.
   ``Oh, so the president's wife is coming,'' said a gap-toothed
peasant from northwest China who was visiting Beijing for the first
time with a group of friends. ``No, I don't recognize her name.''
   Chinese security was heavy. Inside the Forbidden City, one guard
slammed a White House photographer, Carol Powers, face-first into a
door as he tried to maneuver her back from Mrs. Bush.
   Mrs. Bush said to her escorts, ``Ask them to calm down,''
referring to the security guards. ``This girl's job is to take my
picture and she got hit. She works for my husband.''
   Mrs. Bush said later that Ms. Powers was not hurt. But she warned
other photographers running to take her picture to be careful,
calling out, ``I don't want to worry about you like I'm your
mother.''
   Mrs. Bush, wearing a blue suit by American designer Arnold
Scaasi, low-heeled shoes and her trademark pearls, stopped to see a
new exhibit about the life of Pu Yi, China's last emperor, who was
the subject of the award-winning 1987 movie ``The Last Emperor.''
   The exhibit in two faded wooden halls contains Pu Yi's
English-made bicycle, piano and other personal memorabilia.
   When Yang complimented her on her youthful appearance, the
63-year-old Mrs. Bush laughed heartily and said, ``I'm in high
spirits, not young.''
   She joked that she would have qualified to attend a banquet one
18th-century Chinese emperor gave in the palace for ``people 60 and
over.''
   ``That's my crowd,'' she said.
   Earlier Sunday, Mrs. Bush accompanied her husband to a church
service presided over by ministers they knew when they lived in
Beijing.
   They also went together to Beijing's International Club to visit
Chinese barbers who used to cut their hair and Bush's former tennis
partner.
   The rest of the day, while the president met with Chinese
leaders, Mrs. Bush and Bette Bao Lord, the wife of the U.S.
Ambassador, went on tour.
   She chatted over tea with several dozen Chinese women, including
scholars and the wives of Cabinet ministers, in a theater on the
grounds of a garden once owned by Pu Yi's relatives.
   While a band played Chinese tunes on traditional stringed
instruments and dancers performed on a low stage, Mrs. Bush
table-hopped, thanking the guests for coming.
   ``She hasn't changed,'' said He Liliang, who met the Bushes in
1971 when her husband, Huang Hua, became China's first ambassador to
the United Nations. ``She is still so energetic and warm.''
   The gardens and theater, which once belonged to Pu Yi's great
uncle, Prince Gong, served as a police barracks for many years, then
were restored and opened to the public last year.
   Mrs. Bush said later that China was more Westernized now than
when she lived here, ``but that's part of growing.''
   The 13 months the Bushes lived in Beijing ``was a very happy time
in our lives and we feel lucky to be able to be back again,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Don't Ignore Obvious Differences In Rearing Unbiased Child, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a guide for rearing an unbiased child, a
group of educators says the place to start is with a 2-year-old just
beginning to notice that people come in different shapes, colors and
sexes.
   The advice continues: Don't assume simple exposure to diversity
is enough to kill the seeds of prejudice, but, on the other hand,
don't pretend such differences do not exist.
   The 65,000-member National Association for the Education of Young
Children group says teachers and parents likewise should not pretend
that differences don't matter but rather explore them fully through
discussion, stories, books, games and multiracial ``persona'' dolls
with a range of physical characteristics and disabilities.
   ``Those people who say `I don't notice if a person is brown or
green or purple' exemplify the colorblind approach,'' says Louise
Derman-Sparks. ``It arose as the progressive approach against racial
bigotry, but it doesn't work.''
   Derman-Sparks, author of the teacher guidebook and a professor of
early childhood development at Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena,
Calif., recommends discussing with children the differences they see
and the ways people are the same and different.
   ``Talking about differences doesn't encourage prejudice,'' she
says. ``In fact, responding positively can discourage it. It is a
lack of response, or a negative one, that can promote bias.''
   Most attempts to teach tolerance and understanding are aimed at
older students. But in ``Anti-Bias Curriculum,'' Derman-Sparks cites
research findings that by age 4, children to a large extent have
internalized gender stereotypes, racial bias and fear of disabled
people. Thus her focus on toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarteners.
   ``Pre-prejudice'' can appear as early as age 2 when a child runs
away from a classmate in a leg brace or refuses to hold a black
child's hand, insisting it is ``dirty,'' according to the manual. It
says such children need special attention to overcome their fears
and misconceptions.
   Teachers are admonished not to ignore or try to excuse
discriminatory behavior. If children insult or exclude one another
on the basis of race, sex, handicap or ethnic origin, the manual
advises, immediately intervene to explain, comfort and set firm
standards of acceptable behavior.
   One of the thorniest problems addressed in the teachers' guide is
what to do when parents transmit racist or sexist messages to their
children. Among the examples given: A parent says she doesn't want
her child sitting next to any Mexican kids or a white parent says he
doesn't want his daughter playing with a black doll because that
will lead to interracial dating and marriage.
   The easiest response, says Derman-Sparks, is to simply say all
children in the classroom sit with everyone and children can play
with any doll they want. But ``the easiest approach is ultimately
the least effective'' because parents don't change and kids receive
mixed messages, she says.
   The best but admittedly risky way to handle such a situation is
to try to talk to the parents about their fears and prejudices,
according to the manual. If no agreement is reached, it recommends
calling a parents meeting and airing all points of view before
making a decision on which if any anti-bias activities to curtail.
   A companion parents' brochure, available free from the
association, describes in detail how to respond to a young child's
sometimes awkward questions. When asked, ``Why is that girl in a
wheelchair?'' a parent should reply: ``She's using a wheelchair
because her legs are not strong enough to walk. The wheelchair helps
her move around.''
   Inappropriate responses would be ``Shh, it's not nice to ask'' or
``I'll tell you another time.'' The brochure says such responses do
not satisfy a child's curiosity or teach him or her how to interact
comfortably with a disabled person, the brochure says.
   A parent asked ``Why is Jamal's skin so dark?'' should not merely
answer that ``his skin color doesn't matter. We are all the same
underneath.'' Rather, toddlers should be told that ``Jamal's skin is
dark brown because his mom and dad have dark brown skin'' and
preschoolers given a simple explanation of melanin, the substance
that determines skin color in humans.
   Teachers are given similar guidance. In one example, a
student-teacher tells a boy in a swing, ``What wonderful, big
circles you are making.'' To a girl in the next swing, she says,
``Be careful, you might hurt yourself.'' The teacher then steps in,
saying ``I think Pam is making wonderful, big circles, too.''

   Two moderate earthquakes rattled
Costa Rica on Sunday morning, causing minor damage to an airport
tower and cracking the pavement on some rural roads, officials said.
   Red Cross officials said they had no reports of injuries.
   The first temblor occurred at 6:23 a.m. and measured 4.3 on the
Richter scale, the seismological institute at the National
University said. The second quake struck at 8:40 a.m. and measured
3.9 on the Richter scale.
   The quakes were centered near San Marcos de Tarrazu, a town 45
miles southwest of San Jose, according to institute spokesman Jorge
Barquero. They were felt throughout Costa Rica.
   He said the temblors cracked the walls of the tower at the Tobias
Bolanos Airport, a general aviation facility two miles from San
Jose, and the pavement of some rural roads. Airport Director William
Alvarez said damage to the tower was minor and it would probably be
reopened within hours.
   He and Barquero spoke to The Associated Press by telephone.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage
and a quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion monitored on a seismograph.

<TEXT>
   Nearly all of Sudan's doctors stopped
working Sunday and said they will resign in a week unless the
government improves conditions to end shortages of basic medical
supplies.
   ``Many people have died due to the lack of soluble insulin in the
hospitals. Blankets are torn up and used instead of medical cotton.
How can we work in such conditions?'' said Abdul-Rahman Abul-Kul,
chief of the Physicians' Association of Sudan.
   He led 1,000 of the striking physicians on a march through
Khartoum, the capital, to present resignations of 2,761 doctors at
the Ministry of Health. He said they represent 98.3 of the nation's
doctors.
   The strike comes as Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government tries
to meet ultimatums of rebellious military officers and the capital
is inundated with refugees from the southern civil war. Many
refugees are starving and others need medical attention.
   The physicians said they are protesting shortages of medical
supplies such as disposable syringes, antibiotics and life-saving
medication like the insulin needed to treat high blood sugar levels.
   ``We will not withdraw the resignation until we make sure that
the implementation of our demands has started,'' Abul-Kul told
reporters.
   He said limited voluntary work would continue and that private
clinics would be open two hours a day.
   Abul-Kul said this East African country needs to spend at least
$24 million to upgrade health conditions. ``This is only for the
next six months, not in the long run,'' he added.
   ``No one can deny the deterioration of the medical services,''
said Dr. Abdul Hamid al-Sayed Osman, an undersecretary of health and
a physician. He said he too would resign if there were no
improvements.
   Osman said the government has allocated $25 million for
medication, but he could not explain why there were terrible
shortages.
   Refugees fleeing the civil war in the south to
government-controlled towns apparently have aggravated the need for
medical supplies and hospital care, though Abul-Kul said his
association has been demanding improvements in health care since
August 1987.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms in 1983
against the Moslem-dominated government to fight for economic and
social reforms in the mainly Christian and animist south.
   On Friday, Mahdi bowed to army demands and promised to seek peace
with the rebels, address domestic problems and change his Cabinet
and foreign policy.
   About 150 army officers led by military commander Gen. Fathi
Ahmed Ali put the ultimatum to Mahdi. The officers insist there is
no threat of a military takeover.

   It wasn't like the ``French Connection'' heroin
bust. There was no careening car chase, no colorful ``Popeye'' Doyle
cracking the case.
   But agents who smashed a Hong Kong-to-Chinatown narcotics ring
last week stumbled onto the largest heroin haul in U.S. history when
they seized $1 billion worth of the drug packed in hollowed-out golf
cart tires.
   ``This seizure is much bigger than the `French Connection,'''
said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney, who prosecuted some of the
cases stemming from the drug ring that inspired the Oscar-winning
1971 film.
   ``The biggest seizure from the whole `French Connection' was
about 220 pounds. But this _ everybody was amazed by the size of
this seizure.''
   Federal authorities on the night of Feb. 20 hit three locations
in the borough of Queens, grabbing 828 pounds of 90 percent pure
heroin from Southeast Asia _ enough to supply one out of every five
U.S. heroin addicts for a year.
   The amount of heroin was so big that when Assistant FBI Director
James M. Fox arrived at his office Tuesday morning, he cautiously
asked if a radio report he had heard was correct: Had 300 pounds of
heroin really been seized?
   ``No,'' replied a colleague, with a straight face. ``It was 828
pounds.'' ``We didn't know if we were going to get just a couple of
pounds (of heroin) or what when we went in,'' Fox said three days
later. ``What a way to start the week.''
   Eighteen suspects were arrested in New York City and 13 in
Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Singapore, Hong Kong
and Canada. Seized along with the drugs was $3 million cash.
   Fox, putting the seizure in perspective, said the FBI had taken
in just over 500 pounds of heroin in all of 1988. The celebrated
Pizza Connection case, in which heroin was distributed nationwide
through pizzerias, produced 18 convictions but no major drug seizure.
   Operation White Mare _ named for the heroin's color and its
street name, ``horse'' _ started with an informant's tip that
Chinatown businessman Peter Woo, one of the 31 people arrested, was
involved in drug trafficking, court papers indicated.
   When the probe ended 18 months later, more than 100 law
enforcement officials were involved and the FBI had taped more than
100 conversations between New York and Canada, Singapore and Hong
Kong.
   ``Unlike the French Connection, this was a whole new culture we
were dealing with,'' said Maloney. ``We had hours and hours of
conversations in part Chinese, part English, different dialects.''
   As a result, the FBI combed its offices across the country for
Chinese-speaking agents to translate the wiretaps. Complicating the
language barrier was a code used by the alleged dealers: Heroin was
called ``shrimp'' or ``vegetables,'' for example.
   ``They were very careful in their use of the telephone,'' said
Fox. ``The times they used the phone, they were very conscious of
what they said.''
   But there were tip-offs that the end was near for the suspects,
who are accused of shipping drugs from Southeast Asia's ``Golden
Triangle'' via Hong Kong to Los Angeles, where the heroin was
trucked across the country.
   Wiretaps indicated that Woo, 71, a prominent businessman in
Manhattan's Chinatown, believed he was under surveillance; two other
busts of the operation turned up 183 pounds of heroin in Boston and
more than 100 pounds in Los Angeles.
   ``This guy Peter Woo is hurting,'' said Fox. ``His friends are
out all the heroin, plus the money. I think his people are going to
be kind of upset, don't you?''
   While a bust of this size will hurt the heroin trade, Maloney
acknowledged it was no death blow.
   ``We're making heavy dents, but there's always somebody waiting
to step in and take over,'' said Maloney. ``They keep spitting it
out as fast as we make seizures.''
   Which means this record-setting bust will someday be surpassed?
   ``I hate to say no. I guess you have to assume there always a
bigger fish in the lake,'' said Fox. ``But I think it's going to be
a long time before that happens.''

   This Bold New City of the South is
raising a stink in an attempt to shed its reputation as one of the
smelliest places in the nation.
   Paper mills produce odor, and chemical companies use a smelly
byproduct from the mills, terpene, to produce flavorings and
perfumes.
   ``The combination creates an odor which sometimes is totally
unbearable,'' said Ann Shorstein, deputy chief administrative
officer in Mayor Tommy Hazouri's office.
   When Hazouri took office in 1987, he pledged an odor-free city
within two years. Although officials say he may have been overly
optimistic, they say conditions have improved, particularly since
the City Council last March passed a toughened anti-odor bill. Under
it, the city has negotiated with companies about reducing their
emissions.
   It's even fined its own sewer plant.
   Not everyone in this north Florida city of 600,000 agrees about
the extent of the problem.
   George Robbins, president of SCM Glidco Organics Corp., one of
the companies that has run afoul of the anti-odor campaign, conceded
that part of Jacksonville's reputation as a smelly city is earned.
   But, he said, ``part of that is cities competing with
Jacksonville for growth couldn't find much else to be negative
about. Frankly, Jacksonville's got a lot going for it.''
   He called the odor issue a ``cosmetic personal preference
problem,'' saying the more important problem is health hazards in
the air such as ozone.
   Countered Ms. Shorstein: ``We have people who have been driven
inside by the odors to the point they are not even capable of
opening their doors or going into their back yard.''
   Homeowner Jeanne Oster put it more bluntly last year, about the
time the new anti-stink law was passed: ``I'll tell you exactly what
the air smells like. It's like being locked in a Port-O-Let at the
county fair. There's no escape.''
   There were 4,200 odor complaints last year, up from 2,165 in
1987, before the new ordinance was passed.
   ``I don't think that says that odors got worse,'' Robbins said.
``There's a heightened public awareness. Contrary to what the number
of complaint says, I think things are getting better.''
   Robbins also pointed out that more than half of last year's
complaints were not about the paper mills and chemical companies.
   In fact, Robbins said, the city's sewage plant got more
complaints than his company. The city recently fined the sewage
plant $28,357.
   As for SCM Glidco, Robbins said the company has spent $1.5
million to $2 million on odor reduction, changing equipment and
procedures at the plant. SCM Glidco is one of several companies
negotiating with the city over their efforts to come into compliance
with the law.
   Under the civil section of the ordinance, the city can impose
fines of up to $10,000 per day per violation and can order
corrections of problems if negotiations fail. The law's criminal
sanctions were recently thrown out by a judge as unconstitutionally
vague.
   People can report objectionable odors by calling a 24-hour
hotline. If a company receives five complaints within a 90-day
period, it can be cited.
   Robbins said the city needs to establish objective standards to
what is malodorous. For now, an odor is deemed objectionable if
someone complains.
   ``All we need is somebody tell us that these compounds and these
concentrations are by legal definition malodorous, and you emit them
we're going to get you,'' he said. ``We've had complaints about
emitting sweet-smelling odor.''
   Many view the odor as the price of having industries that provide
jobs. Ms. Shorstein sees it from a different perspective.
   ``It's hard to attract the kind of businesses we are looking for
when someone flies into this community and at 4,000 feet they are
smelling the odor,'' she said.

<HEAD>Insurgents Says Thousands of Soldiers Have Defected From Afghan Army</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas claimed Sunday that
nearly 11,000 Afghan troops have joined the resistance and
surrendered large quantities of weapons during recent fighting
around Afghanistan.
   Radio Kabul said Sunday that five civilians died Saturday in a
guerrilla rocket attack on the eastern city of Jalalabad and that
another civilian died in a similar attack in northeastern Laghman
province.
   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency said 68 Afghan
soldiers were killed and about 90 wounded in fighting around
Afghanistan since Tuesday.
   And the Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan soldiers killed 97
guerrillas and captured two major ammunition depots in fighting
Saturday.
   Tass said the Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a statement
criticizing the Moslem guerrillas for forming a government-in-exile
in Pakistan, where they are based, and for predicting they will soon
take power in Afghanistan.
   The statement, the first official Afghan reaction to the interim
government, said it violated the U.N.-mediated accord that led the
Soviet Union to withdraw its 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   Tass also quoted the Soviet newspaper Izvestia as saying the
guerrillas plan to attack Kabul in a bid to topple the Moscow-backed
regime of President Najib. It said they also plan to attack
Jalalabad and hope to install their government there.
   None of the reports could be confirmed independently.
   If the Afghan military defections are confirmed, they would be
the largest reported in the war between the U.S.-backed guerrillas
and the communist regime in Kabul. The Afghan army is estimated to
have 50,000 soldiers.
   A spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sunday
that three Afghan regiments, or more than 10,000 men, defected to
the insurgents in northern Takhar and Badakhshan provinces on Feb.
16, the day after Soviet troops ended nine years of military
involvement in Afghanistan.
   The Afghan soldiers surrendered 10,000 weapons and 90 military
vehicles, spokesman Mohammad Shoaib said from his headquarters in
Peshawar.
   Ismail Khan, a Jamiat field commander, claimed 600 Afghan
soldiers defected Feb. 18 from the garrison town of Rubat Sangi near
Herat, the western provincial capital. Statements by Jamiat, one of
the most powerful rebel military groups, have generally proved
reliable.
   The Afghan News Agency of the rival Hezb-i-Islami rebel group
said another 101 government soldiers surrendured during a guerrilla
attack Wednesday near Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh
province.
   Earlier this month, a council of Afghan guerrilla leaders met in
Pakistan and formed a government-in-exile. They called on foreign
countries to recognize the proposed government, which hopes to take
over if Kabul is overthrown.
   Tass quoted the Afghan Foreign Ministry as saying the interim
government was formed ``under the direct pressure of Pakistani
secret services and their imperialist patrons in violation of the
U.N. charter.''
   Tass said the ministry ``described this move as an interference
in domestic affairs of the sovereign and non-aligned state.''
   Afghanistan's major cities are under siege by the guerrillas, who
reportedly control 90 percent of the countryside.
   Guerrilla field commanders have said they oppose major offensives
on urban areas that would result in high civilian casualties.

<HEAD>Armenians Gather to Recall Victims of Ethnic Riots</HEAD>

   Tearful Armenians laid flowers before pictures of
their dead brethren Sunday to mark the anniversary of three days of
ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people a year ago and
galvanized a nationalist movement.
   ``Events have shown that we can't automatically trust the
authorities. The time for automatic trust has passed,'' activist
Eduard Gevandov told a crowd of several hundred gathered at the
steps of Moscow's Armenian church.
   Authorities sanctioned the gathering, held to commemorate rioting
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait on Feb. 28-29 and March 1 last
year.
   Speaker Arkady Semyonov called them ``three black and
unforgettable days.''
   Soviet officials say 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis died in
the violence, but Armenians insist the toll was much higher.
   Photocopies of pictures of victims and their death certificates
were displayed on a wall of the brick church. Armenians laid lilies,
red carnations and tulips before the pictures and raised candles as
funeral music played.
   Banners raised at the gathering demanded that political leaders
of Azerbaijan, a republic neighboring Armenia in the Soviet Union's
southern Caucasus region, be found responsible for the rioting, and
that Soviet authorities denounce the violence.
   Speakers criticized the Soviet press for what they said was an
unfair characterization of Armenians as extremists.
   A resolution called for authorities to recognize the rioting as
an act of genocide, construct a monument to the victims in Moscow
and release members of the activist Karabakh Committee.
   The Sumgait riots broke out several weeks after thousands of
Armenians staged protests demanding annexation of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is populated predominantly by ethnic Armenians,
and they consider it to be historically a part of Armenia, even
though Soviet officials turned it over to Azerbaijan in the 1920s.
   Kremlin authorities have rejected the annexation demands.
   Most Azerbaijanis are Moslem and most Armenians are Christian.
But Father Tiran Gureghian of the Armenian church in Moscow told the
crowd, ``The problem is not religious, not political, but purely
national and territorial.''
   Almaz Yestekov, one of the founders of Islam and Democracy, a new
movement in the traditionally Moslem republics of Soviet Central
Asia, appealed for understanding between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
He said he had appealed to Azerbaijanis for calm in an interview
with foreign radio stations.
   ``We are children of the same tribe, roots of the same tree,''
Yestekov said.
   After the deadly riots in February, ethnic unrest erupted into
violence again in Armenia and Azerbaijan in June, July and November.
More than 60 people were killed, and in January the Kremlin imposed
direct rule over Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Under the direct rule, the region's local legislature was
dissolved and a special commission was given the power to suspend
all local governing councils and administrative bodies, any informal
organizations, and oversee the media, health and education.
   The Armenian protests began as an appeal to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for annexation and were fueled by his reform policies.
   When Moscow authorities rejected the appeals, the movement grew
to incorporate economic, cultural and environmental grievances. Some
activists called for outright independence for Armenia.
   When Gorbachev visited Armenia following the Dec. 7 earthquake
there that killed 25,000 people, authorities began rounding up
members of the Karabakh Committee who had been among the organizers
of large demonstrations and general strikes.
   Gevandov said the events showed authorities were incapable of
controlling crowds motivated by anything other than slogans they
themselves place before the people.
   ``It is impossible to build a national structure without the
cement of truth and sincerity,'' he said.

<HEAD>``We're Fresh Out of Cash Here in Washington,'' Governors Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget
committee told the nation's governors Sunday that ``we're fresh out
of cash here in Washington'' and warned them there is more fiscal
pain ahead for the states.
   Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee disclaimed any intention to
``launch an assault'' on President Bush or his budget, but added
that the White House was following ``a most unorthodox approach'' to
the deficit negotiations.
   Sasser was the principal speaker at the opening session of the
midwinter meeting of the National Governors' Association.
   The administration was not represented at the session because
Richard Darman, White House budget director, declined an invitation
to appear.
   ``All the governors understand we have to take our fair share of
cuts to deal with deficit reduction and we've done that,'' said
Democratic Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan.
   But he went on to say that the states were hard pressed to deal
with new obligations mandated by the federal government without
funds to pay for them.
   ``We can't take continued mandated automatic expenditures,'' he
said.
   Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, a Democratic who is NGA
chairman, opened the session by pointing out that the federal budget
item for interest on the debt ``now exceeds spending on all domestic
discretionary programs.''
   Sasser disputed some of the economic assumptions made by the new
administration, particularly the forecast that interest rates will
decline to 5.5 percent in 1990.
   Sasser said that while the administration predicts a balanced
budget by 1993, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $75
billion deficit for the same year.
   Blanchard, a former member of Congress, said he was confused by
the process being used to reach a budget agreement.
   ``We're confused ourselves this year,'' said Sasser. ``This is a
most unorthodox approach.''
   The Tennessee senator said the administration had simply left
many budget areas blank and left it to Congress to suggest where
cuts ought to be made.
   ``It's a little like you going to your state legislatures with
your budget and just taking about half of it and throwing it up in
the air and saying, OK, fellow, here it is, you solve it.''
   He said that in his negotiations with Darman ``we sort of shadow
box around on this program and that program. ...It's a very unusual
budget process.''
   Sasser said that while Bush is asking for a line-item veto, a
budgetary tool that many governors have, ``he refuses to offer the
Congress this year, a line-item budget.''
   ``The sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that there's
substantial pain to be portioned out to the American people and I'm
sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state
and local government is, once again, very substantial,'' said Sasser.

<HEAD>Labor Gaining On Conservatives, Opinion Polls Suggest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party is more popular than the
governing Conservative Party for the first time since October 1986,
according to an opinion poll published in the Observer newspaper
Sunday.
   The Harris poll suggests Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives have fallen six points in the last month to 41
percent, while Labor has improved five points to 42 percent, its
highest level since before the 1983 general election.
   A Gallup Poll published in The Sunday Telegraph has Labor, under
leader Neil Kinnock, even with the Conservatives, each with 35
percent.
   Both the independent Observer and the conservative Sunday
Telegraph suggested Labor's gains were at the Conservatives' expense.
   Both polls indicated support for the centrist Social and Liberal
Democratic Party was holding steady at 10 percent.
   Harris said support for the splinter Social Democratic Party was
little changed at 3 percent, and Gallup said it was 4 percent.
   The newspapers said dissatisfaction with the government has
probably resulted from its proposed radical overhaul of the mostly
free National Health Service, high inflation, interest rates and
mortgage rates, and plans to privatize the country's water industry.
   On Saturday, thousands of young people rallied in London in a
generally peaceful protest of government plans to freeze financial
aid for university students and institute a system of loans.
   The marchers, estimated by police at 8,000, grouped on the
Victoria Embankment beside the Thames in central London, then made
their way past Whitehall's government office buildings and across
Lambeth Bridge to the south bank of the Thames and a rally in
Kensington Park.
   The route was heavily policed because a similar demonstration in
November ended in battles between officers and students.
   Beginning in 1990, the government plans to freeze the existing
student grants and introduce student loans to make up the growing
gap between the grants and actual costs. Details of the plans have
not been announced.
   The Harris Research Center poll of 1,027 Britons was conducted
Wednesday and Thursday, before the results were known of two special
elections for vacant parliamentary seats. No margin of error was
given.
   The Conservative Party narrowly retained one of its safest
parliamentary seats, the wealthy Richmond district in northern
England, although its majority tumbled Thursday from nearly 20,000
votes to 2,600.
   Labor kept its seat at Pontypridd in South Wales.
   The Sunday Telegraph did not provide Gallup's sample size or
margin of error and did not say when the survey was conducted.

   Bobby McFerrin, fresh from copping a fistful
of Grammies, topped off his week with a Bammy, San Francisco's
answer to the national music awards.
   McFerrin was honored Saturday for best jazz album of the year at
the 12th annual Bay Area Music Awards, a star-studded affair
honoring rock, jazz and blues performers with regional roots.
   ``The real reward in life is having friends,'' said McFerrin
after winning the award.
   He won for his album ``Simple Pleasures,'' which contained
``Brothers,'' the song that won him a Grammy for outstanding jazz
vocal performance. In all, McFerrin won four Grammy awards
Wednesday, including one each for best pop song and record of the
year for ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
   Among other Bammy winners, Huey Lewis &amp; the News was named
outstanding group; guitarist Carlos Santana, known for such hits as
``Black Magic Woman,'' was named musician of the year; and pop
singer Pebbles, who had a No. 1 hit with the song ``Mercedes Boy''
last year, won outstanding female vocalist.
   Music fans chose the winners through mail-in ballots.
   The gala affair mainly was a benefit for Project Open Hand, a San
Francisco volunteer organization that delivers meals to AIDS
patients.

while the track star was making an appearance in honor of Black
History Month, police said Sunday.
   The Olympic medalist was making an appearance at a grocery store
Saturday afternoon when the car she was using was stolen, according
to police and Terrie Williams, a spokeswoman for Joyner-Kersee.
   Williams said the car contained a $15,000 Waterford Crystal vase
that Joyner-Kersee was awarded Wednesday by the Sporting News as
athlete of the year; another piece of crystal she received Friday at
the Mobil Indoor Grand Prix track and field championship; her
luggage; her husband's luggage; and the luggage of a representative
from 7-Up, a sponsor of Saturday's event. The car was provided by
7-Up.
   Police said the car _ a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice _ was probably
stolen for parts. There were no leads.
   Joyner-Kersee won the heptathlon and the long jump at the 1988

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haiti's latest government, headed by Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril, has continued the human rights abuses of its
predecessors, three human rights organizations charged Sunday.
   ``The persistence of serious human rights violations suggests an
ongoing refusal by the military to relinquish power to an elected
civilian government,'' the groups' report said.
   The 159-page report, issued by Americas Watch, the National
Coalition for Haitian Refugees, and Caribbean Rights, noted that
Avril's 5-month-old government has vowed to hold elections and
promote human rights.
   But it said peasant organizations, trade unions and church
activists are still subject to military and paramilitary violence,
and that ``demonstrations and outspoken critics are also regularly
targeted.'' The Avril government has never prosecuted those involved
in political violence, it added.
   It also said that the government, rather than establishing an
independent electoral council, has proposed a procedure for
selecting a new electoral commission ``that would be highly
susceptible to military control.''
   Since the report was compiled, Avril has agreed to set up an
independent electoral council, as recommended by a forum of
political and civic leaders. In a decree Thursday, the government
said the council would organize and set a date for elections and
supervise the vote.
   Avril assumed the presidency Sept. 17 in a coup led by
rank-and-file soldiers demanding democratic reforms. The coup ousted
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, whose rule saw widespread repression,
including mass killings.
   The three human rights groups said their report was based on
seven missions to Haiti since November 1987.
   Haiti has been racked by political strife for decades,
particularly during the reign of President-for-Life Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971; and his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby
Doc'' Duvalier, who was ousted in a coup three years ago.

   While Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel
is confined to a Prague jail, authorities in Poland are not only
allowing performances of his plays, but the prime minister showed up
for the opening.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski's appearance at the theater
Saturday illustrates the different paths the East bloc countries are
taking in confronting their critics.
   While Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader, Milos Jakes, has
chosen to crack down on dissent, Rakowski's government has started
negotiations on political and economic reforms with the opposition
it once tried to crush.
   Many Western countries have criticized the Feb. 21 decision of a
Prague court to sentence Havel to nine months in jail on charges of
inciting citizens to take part in a banned demonstration last month
and obstructing police officers.
   But nowhere in the East bloc has Havel's jailing aroused such
interest among officials and anger among independent intellectuals
as in Poland.
   Even the decision to allow the performance of the highly
political and critical works is a reversal of the authorities'
attitude toward Havel, whose works have been published here only in
the underground press.
   Havel's plays first were staged in Poland in late 1981, but
production was suspended after only 12 performances when authorities
imposed martial law that December to suppress the independent
Solidarity trade union movement.
   Filmmaker Feliks Falk, who directed the current production of two
one-act Havel plays, ``The Audience'' the ``The Protest,'' said he
has tried for a long time to get permission to stage the plays.
   The cast began rehearsing in January and Havel originally was
invited to the premiere, he said.
   ``It's just a coincidence that Havel is in prison,'' Falk said in
an interview. ``For us and for the actors, of course, the
performance is very important because of Havel, and because the
plays are very good.''
   Rakowski's appearance added a dramatic twist to the performance
of the two one-act plays.
   Assistant theater director Krzysztof Rudzinski blanched and tried
to stop a young activist from selling underground copies of
``Thriller,'' a collection of Havel's political essays, in the
theater lobby.
   Rakowski witnessed the scene as he arrived.
   But the prime minister ignored the fuss and calmly took a regular
seat in the theater, five rows away from Adam Michnik, a leading
Polish opposition theorist who like Havel has spent years in jail
for his writings and political activities.
   For two hours the audience was spellbound, first by ``The
Audience,'' the tale of a simple brewery worker being pressured by
police to inform on a writer whom authorities have forced to work in
the brewery as punishment for his political activities.
   ``It shows the drama of the average man,'' historian Bronislaw
Geremek said during intermission.
   But it was ``The Protest'' that particularly touched the audience
of officials and intellectuals.
   The story concerns the behavior of an official writer who appeals
to an opposition writer to arrange a petition against the detention
of a musician involved with his daughter. But the writer balks when
asked to sign the protest the opposition already had formulated.
   As the crowd applauded at the end of the play, Michnik jumped on
stage to read a personal hand-written appeal to Czech authorities to
release Havel. But his protest was drowned by music blaring through
loudspeakers.
   Michnik has met Havel several times at clandestine meetings of
Polish and Czechoslovak political activists in the mountains along
the border that separates the two countries.
   He called Havel a friend and symbol like Nobel Peace Prize
winners Andrei Sakharov from the Soviet Union and Poland's
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   He urged ``competent authorities to stop repression'' and urged
the Czechoslovak leadership ``to take the same road as other East
European countries are taking _ reconciliation with the nation.''
   Havel was arrested Jan. 16 during an attempt with other
opposition activists to lay flowers in memory of Jan Palach, a
student who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Polish opposition groups quickly rose to his defense.
   The national leadership of Solidarity; the independent
Polish-Czech Solidarity Group; and the Polish chapter of the
international writers' P.E.N. Club all have appealed to authorities
to release Havel.
   The Polish government declined to comment on his jailing, saying
it was an internal affair of Czechoslovakia.

   Her product will help make them fat and
juicy, but an owner of a company that manufactures more than a
million pounds a year of worm ``bedding'' does not want anything
else to do with the slimy creatures.
   ``I can't believe people love worms,'' said Dolores Gruhn, who
owns Buss Manufacturing Co. with her husband, Marvin. ``Personally,
I wouldn't touch one.''
   The northwestern Illinois company manufactures Buss Bed-ding, a
gray lint-like material that serves as food and habitat for worms,
sold to fisherman through sporting goods stores and bait shops,
mostly in the Midwest and Northeast.
   Add only water, the package says, and worms become ``fresh,
lively and full of fish-catching flavor.''
   ``It's No. 1,'' says Chuck Shuck, owner of Chuck's Bait and
Tackle in Muscatine, Iowa, where bedding sales are brisk. ``It
conditions them, fattens 'em up. Buss Bed-ding works good, always
has.''
   Buss Bed-ding was invented by Mrs. Gruhn's father, Donald Buss, a
tireless self-promoter in the town 20 miles east of the Mississippi
River.
   Gruhn was a Buss employee before he bought the company from his
father-in-law in 1974.
   The Gruhns won't disclose how much money they earn off Buss
Bed-ding _ they won't even divulge how the stuff is made _ but they
produce 1.5 million pounds a year. It usually sells at $1.25 for a
one-pound bag.
   ``I sit here and get amazed,'' Mrs. Gruhn said, leaning over a
typewriter one day while her husband sat at the only other desk.
``We make a living off a product that keeps worms alive.''

   Vip and Gigi, the couple everyone's talking about
at the Metropolitan District Commission's zoos, are getting along
famously, and the gorillas' handlers are upbeat about the prospects
of a fruitful relationship.
   A computer-arranged tryst brought Vip from a Texas zoo last month
to replace Gigi's old flame, Sam, after the spark went out of their
lives and three years passed without any offspring.
   Zoo officials hope Vip, 9, and Gigi, 16, will produce a family of
lowland gorillas to inhabit a new $26 million facility at a
revitalized Franklin Park Zoo, which once ranked among the 10 worst
zoos in the nation.
   Vip and Gigi are due to make their first public appearance as a
couple in their temporary digs at the Stone Zoo in Stoneham on
Monday, but the two have been warming up to each other during about
a half-dozen introductory meetings over the last week.
   Both gorillas have spent their entire lives in captivity. They
were matched by the species survival program of the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which traced their
family trees to make sure they were not closely related.
   After an initial get-acquainted period of slamming walls with
their fists, the two 250-pound gorillas began chasing each other in
circles, and each chase ended with the two resting closer and closer
together.
   Behaviorist Deborah Shildkraudt said the reaction was natural.
   The gorillas were just learning to relinquish the personal space
many wild beasts demand.

<HEAD>Channel Tunnel Protesters March Through London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 demonstrators marched through
central London on Sunday to protest British Rail's proposed
high-speed rail routes linking London with the Channel Tunnel,
organizers and police said.
   Residents representing almost every southeast England town and
village that could be affected by the project joined the mass
protest, the first demonstration against all four of British Rail's
proposed routes.
   ``This march is unique because it is not political,'' said Kay
Lyons, spokeswoman for the Channel Action Residents Group Executive
which organized the march. ``We are of all colors. Mrs. Thatcher has
got to listen to us.''
   People who live near the proposed routes say the rail link will
hurt the environment, be a noisy eyesore and lower property values.
   A jazz band led the three-mile parade to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's 10 Downing St. residence, where organizers left a protest
scroll, a tape recording of children singing a protest song and a
bunch of flowers which they said represented the environment that
could be harmed.
   ``We don't want it, no one wants it,'' chanted one group.
   Scotland Yard said the march was peaceful.
   Although the individual groups oppose the four rail links for a
variety of reasons, they all want more consultations and more
consideration of the environmental impact before British Rail
selects a route.
   British Rail is expected to announce in early March which route
it prefers for the trains, which will run at up to 180 mph.
   The trains will link up with the Channel Tunnel, the 34-mile
tunnel being bored under the English Channel simultaneously from
England and France. It is expected to be completed in 1993.

<HEAD>Crippled Ecuadoran Orphan Learns New Way of Life With Adoptive Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Maria Andy lived in a remote
Ecuadoran orphanage where she owned two dresses, ate soup every
night and crawled around, dragging her two crippled legs behind her.
   These days, Maria is an active second-grader at an elementary
school just outside Boston. She celebrated her ninth birthday last
week in the home she shares with James and Joyce Kidd, who have
cared for her since September 1987 and plan to adopt her.
   It is a far cry from how she began life. Shortly after birth,
Maria was rescued by nuns who spotted her just as her parents were
about to throw her in a bonfire because of her deformities.
   She was brought to Boston in May 1987 for leg surgery under the
sponsorship of Por Cristo, a Brockton-based charity organization.
The Kidds took her in after reading about her in a Boston newspaper.
   Her legs were amputated and she was fitted with prostheses. She
defied doctors who doubted she would ever walk by taking her first
steps shortly after getting her artificial legs.
   Maria said she was ``scared'' when the director of the orphanage
told her she was going to the United States. ``I cried,'' she said.
``I didn't want to go.''
   Now, Maria said, she has nightmares about returning to the
orphanage high in the Andes, where she slept in a room filled with
other children and never celebrated a birthday.
   She is fluent in English and has a roomful of toys and stuffed
animals _ many of them elephants because the Kidds are active in the
Republican Party. She has a best friend, Rebecca, at school, and her
favorite class is spelling. She watches the ``The Brady Bunch'' on
TV every afternoon.
   She walks easily on two prosthetic legs with the aid of a single
crutch and is beginning to take steps without it. In fact the only
clue to Maria's past is her diet.
   Chicken.
   ``She eats it for almost every single meal,'' said Mrs. Kidd, 33,
a kindergarten teacher. ``I feel like asking Frank Perdue if he
wants to use her as a poster child. It's all she wants to eat.''
   Mrs. Kidd said she discovered that children in the orphanage were
allowed chicken only on special holidays once or twice a year.
   When she was first brought to Children's Hospital in Boston,
doctors were unsure if they could do anything except strengthen her
legs. She was born with severe scoliosis, or curvature of the spine.
But Maria proved strong enough for doctors to decide to amputate her
legs and fit her with new ones.
   Maria is still learning to walk without crutches. She was up to
25 steps without crutches when she returned to the hospital last
summer for spinal fusion surgery. She spent five months in a body
cast and wheelchair.
   Her new goals, she said, are to learn to ice skate and ski. But
she said she is still enjoying life with the Kidds.
   ``I always wanted a family,'' Maria said. ``At the orphanage,
there was one girl who had (relatives) visit her and I was jealous.''
   But when asked to describe the very best thing about her new
life, Maria was succinct.
   ``Chicken,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A plane returning from a supply run
to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels slammed into a hillside, killing
all 10 people on board, aviation officials said Sunday.,
   The DC-6 crashed at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday near La Tigra, a
village seven miles northeast of Tegucigalpa, said Capt. Francisco
Aguilera, head of operations for Civil Aviation.
   Officials did not release any information on the crash until
Sunday. They said the victims were all employees of a local firm
that has a contract to deliver supplies to the rebel camps.
   ``Our company rents planes to the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) to transport supplies to the Contras,'' said
Antonio Molina, one of the proprietors of Circle G Aviation Co.
   He said the plane had delivered more than 15 tons of clothes,
food and medicine to Bocay, a town near the Contra camps in
northeastern Honduras, and was on its way home when it crashed.
Bocay is about 250 miles from the capital.
   He and Aguilera spoke to The Associated Press in telephone
interviews.
   Aguilera said high winds and turbulence may have been a factor in
the crash. The plane slammed into a hillside when it began its
approach to Toncontin International Airport in Tegucigalpa, he said.
   ``All the occupants of the plane died in the accident,'' Molina
said. ``Radar at the airport control tower (in Tegucigalpa) lost
track of the aircraft at about 2:32 p.m. The crew never reported any
problems.''
   He identified the crew as pilot Rene Gonzalez Molina, co-pilot
Juan Ramon Caceres and engineer Wilfredo Castro. He said the
passengers were also employees of Circle G.
   ``Their bodies were recovered today at midday and will be brought
to the capital by a Honduran Air Force helicopter even though it
will be diffcult because the site of the crash is inaccessible,''
Aguilera said.
   About 11,000 Contra rebels and their families have been holed up
in base camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border for the last 10
months.
   They have not received overt U.S. military aid in a year, but
humanitarian aid continues.

<HEAD>Democratic Congressmen Feud In Arkansas; State Chairman Offers Mediation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas' three Democrats in the U.S.
House are divided two against one in a feud about party loyalty,
political philosophy and personalities. Rep. Tommy Robinson's
bashing of his national party raises Republican hopes that the
tough-talking former sheriff might change party affiliations.
   Their words have been so heated that the state's Democratic Party
leader called Saturday for Robinson and fellow Reps. Beryl Anthony
and Bill Alexander to sit down and work out their differences.
   But there are apparently no prospects for peace between the
conservative, outspoken Robinson and his two colleagues, whom he
labels as too liberal to represent Arkansas.
   Robinson is scheduled to get a personal pitch to switch to the
GOP this week, when he meets Tuesday afternoon with Sen. Phil Gramm
of Texas, who defected from the Democrats six years ago.
   As of last week, Robinson said that he was still a Democrat, but,
``I can foresee the day when people will be jumping ship right and
left.''
   He had strong criticism for his colleagues.
   ``I don't care what those liberals do in Washington, D.C., I vote
the convictions of my constituents here,'' Robinson told a chamber
of commerce banquet Friday night in Bald Knob, about 50 miles
northeast of here.
   Anthony and Alexander are ``two pigs squealing because they have
been stuck and don't like it,'' Robinson said.
   State Democratic Party Chairman James ``Skip'' Rutherford said
the congressmen ``have some personal differences that need to be
resolved.''
   Robinson, a thrird-term congressman, fell out with Anthony when
the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee denied him a seat last
month on the Education and Labor Committee of the House.
   Robinson said the vote was his punishment for appearing last
November on radio ads supporting fellow Armed Services Committee
member Jack Davis, R-Ill., who was defeated by Democrat George
Sangmeister.
   Anthony, an ex officio member of the steering committee, chairs
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money
for House Democrats. While acknowledging that he told the steering
committee about Robinson's efforts on behalf of a Republican,
Anthony said Robinson is responsible for his own problems.
   ``He is the one who campaigned for a Republican. He was the one
who was unloyal,'' said Anthony, a House member since 1979.
   Robinson has never been a buddy of Alexander, who's been in
Congress since 1969. Among other issues, they have clashed about
Cuba _ Alexander wants to sell Arkansas rice to Fidel Castro, while
Robinson distrusts the Cuban leader.
   Alexander said last week that Robinson has ``ruined himself in
Washington'' because of party disloyalty: ``I don't know what he
does _ just mostly run his mouth.''
   Robinson responded: ``The problem with Alexander and Anthony is
that they do not understand the Arkansas meaning of loyalty. To an
Arkansan, loyalty is representing the wishes of your constituency. I
consider it disloyal to go to Cuba ... as Alexander did.''
   Such exchanges trouble Rutherford, who said he would be willing
to mediate the flap.
   During a meeting Friday, Rutherford urged Robinson not to switch
parties.
   ``I wanted him to know that, as chairman, I very much wanted him
to remain in the party and that we knew he was being heavily
recruited by the Republicans, and that there is room here for his
views,'' Rutherford said.
   ``In his own way, he is trying to bring the party back to the
center,'' Rutherford said. ``I think there's room to raise
legitimate questions. I think you're seeing a lot of political
posturing right now, which is very much a part of the process.''

   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex., seeking to ease what
he called the ``human tragedy'' of Central Americans denied
political asylum in the United States, says he will introduce
legislation requiring would-be refugees to apply before they enter
this country.
   As of last Thursday, about 625 Central Americans who had been
denied asylum were under detention in the 315-acre Port Isabel
Service Processing Center run by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service just north of Brownsville, Texas. They were awaiting
deportation.
   ``They have the very real human tragedy of having to walk home
after spending their worldly goods to get here,'' Gramm said. ``It's
not humane. I want to let them know if they're accepted (as
political refugees) before they come.''
   The Central Americans were detained under a policy that took
effect last Dec. 16, denying those who seek polical asylum the right
to travel within the country while their applications or appeals are
processed.
   Gramm, in an interview Friday, said 98 percent of the Central
American refugees who arrive in Brownsville are being denied
political asylum.
   ``Having thousands a month come into Brownsville creates a huge
overload, many bring communicable diseases that we long ago stopped
worrying about, they have no housing, and have been a tremendous
burden on the local economy,'' Gramm said.
   Under his proposal, refugees from El Salvador or Nicaragua could
apply for asylum in Honduras or Mexico.
   Gramm said he discussed the bill last week with Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh and is confident of gaining administration
support. Gramm said he would introduce the bill Tuesday.
   Under the new policy, INS officials are speeding up the review of
applications while detaining the applicants. Previously,
applications could take weeks to process and aliens were released on
their own recognizance while awaited appeals or deportation.
   As many as 2,000 refugees a week had been crossing the Rio Grande
into Texas, but the number has slowed to a trickle under the new
policy.
   Only immigrants who can prove they have suffered political
persecution are entitled to asylum. Those who come for economic
reasons are subject to deportation. INS officials say most Central
Americans arriving in South Texas do not qualify for refugee status.

<HEAD>Vegetable Damage Bad In Central Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The record weekend freeze caused some of
the worst crop damage in a decade for central Florida vegetable
growers, who supply produce sold across the country, growers and
industry officials said.
   But fields farther south and along the coast fared better in the
cold wave that hit Thursday, Friday and Saturday, growers and
industry officials said. Temperatures moderated Sunday.
   With a value to Florida farmers of more than $1.1 billion
annually, produce ranks near the state's agricultural leader, the
$1.3 billion-a-year citrus industry, which appeared to have suffered
only minimal damage.
   ``From talking with several growers yesterday, we did experience
quite a bit of damage on the real cold-sensitive crops _ cucumbers,
watermelons and squash _ and some damage on peppers and tomato
crops,'' Reggie Brown, spokesman for Orlando-based Florida Fruit and
Vegetable Association, said Sunday.
   ``That damage varies quite a bit with the locality,'' he said,
adding that the Tampa Bay area, the northernmost area where crops
are in the ground this time of year, was hit the worst.
   ``Overall, this particular cold, for the most part, has not been
one that has wiped out a crop, with the exception of Ruskin-Palmetto
(near Tampa), but appears to be one that has pushed crops back, with
a 25 to 30 percent loss of potential yield,'' Brown said in a
telephone interview from his Naples-area home.
   ``What I see is a disaster,'' Roger Harloff, a Palmetto tomato
grower and packer, told the St. Petersburg Times in a story
published Sunday.
   Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost
$490 million in 1987, the latest figures available from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   Elsewhere Saturday, Tampa hit a record low of 31 degrees, Daytona
Beach had a record low of 29, Orlando hit a record 30 and Pensacola
had a record 27. Tallahassee, in the northern part of the state, had
a record low of 18.
   ``Every cucumber in the state of Florida is gone, from what I
understand,'' Tom Burgin, a produce broker in Plant City, told the
Times. ``There won't be any cucumbers for about 60 days.''
   ``I had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south
Hillsborough (County) call me this morning to tell me that they're
completely gone,'' Burgin said. ``And the Ruskin tomato people lost
everything. They're completely wiped out.''
   The Ruskin Vegetable Corp. in Hillsborough ships fresh produce to
some of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in
North America, including those in Atlanta, New York, Toronto,
Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New Orleans and St.
Louis.
   ``Our main suit is tomatoes,'' said Bill Butler, Ruskin
Vegetable's general manager. ``The damage to the tomato crop was
considerable. I've seen a lot of kill today. I've seen total loss in
some fields, and just a little bit in a few fields because they were
close to the (warming) water, but I've seen at least some damage in
every field, up to total destruction.''
   Butler said the damage was the worst in the 10 years that he's
worked at Ruskin Vegetable.
   Ready-to-pick tomato crops in the vast fields of Collier County,
around Naples, and southern Dade County, which includes Miami, fared
much better, said Brown.
   Ironically, unseasonably warm weather this winter before the cold
snap contributed to the losses. Warm, sunny days induced farmers to
plant early and rapid growth then made plants especially tender and
more vulnerable to the cold.

<HEAD>Parks Chief Says Don't Feed Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KUGLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeding hay to elk and
bison starving in this fire-scarred preserve could do more harm than
good, and even if many animals die the herds are in no danger of
extinction, says the head of the National Park Service.
   The reduction in natural grazing by last summer's drought and
huge fires, combined with a severe winter, have driven elk and bison
out of the park into southern Montana, where the state is allowing
hunters to kill hundreds of the animals. The state claims they carry
disease that could infect livestock.
   In the small town of Gardiner, Mont., just north of the park,
starving elk are eating hay donated by sympathetic people, along
with hedges and trees. Small herds of elk and buffalo have
congregated in parking lots.
   ``They are skinny and eak,'' said Trudi Taylor, who joined with
others in town to raise money to feed the animals after one elk died
in her yard. She admits the winter will probably claim older
animals, but hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve.
   ``In this town, most of the people make their money off these
animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said,
referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists.
   But feeding hay to elk allows diseases to spread among the
animals when they gather in tight groups at feeding stations, park
service director William Penn Mott said at a news conference
Saturday at Yellowstone's headquarters.
   And if park rangers started feeding hay to elk in Yellowstone,
the expensive practice could go on forever as the animals become
dependent on it, as they have at the national elk refuge at Jackson,
Wyo., south of Yellowstone, Mott said.
   Mott was sent on a fact-finding trip to Yellowstone by new
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan following national publicity about
the hunting in Montana and high mortality in the park's northern elk
herd _ the largest migratory elk herd in the world.
   Mott said one option he thought he could support was to have the
federal government acquire more winter game range north of the park
in Montana. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation of Missoula, Mont.,
announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding
winter range for Yellowstone's elk herd.
   Mott also said he will ask the Park Service and other state and
federal agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report on
Yellowstone's total wildlife management program, which he called
fragmented.
   ``We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage
wildlife,'' he said. ``If land is being overgrazed, we should look
at this.''
   Both elk and bison populations in Yellowstone are near all-time
highs because several mild winters before this year allowed more
animals to survive than in normal years.
   Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montana
and 250 additional permits have been issued. And more than 2,350 elk
from Yellowstone's northern herd of 19,000 were shot by Montana
hunters this winter. Last year, only 39 bison were shot in Montana's
hunt.
   Inside Yellowstone, rangers have counted more than 300 elk
carcasses.
   This year's hunting has been denounced as a slaughter by such
animal-welfare activists as Cleveland Amory of New York, president
of the Fund for Animals.
   Mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into
Yellowstone, not only because wolves could help keep big-game
populations in balance, ``but because wolves represent the West and
part of biological diversity.''
   That proposal is strongly opposed by ranchers outside the park.
   Mott said Yellowstone's herds are in no danger of extinction, but
in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year.
   ``Even if winter kill (of elk) is 50 percent, there would still
be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said.
   ``Bison have the biological capacity of recovering from low
numbers,'' said Mary Meagher, a Yellowstone research biologist,
noting that the park's bison started from a remnant population of 22
animals.
   Montana officials said they authorized the bison hunt because
about half of Yellowstone's bison carry the disease brucellosis,
which causes domestic cows to abort their calves.
   But Meagher said her best information from Montana's state
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in Montana had ever
been traced to Yellowstone animals. She also pointed out that
ranchers vaccinate their calves against the disease.

   A bomb exploded at a guard house outside
the British Consulate in Karachi on Sunday night, killing a
Pakistani guard, police said.
   There was an unconfirmed report that another person was injured
in the blast, which eyewitnesses said occurred around 9:35 p.m. when
the mission was closed.
   Police quickly cordoned off the posh area of Clifton Bridge at
the port city's western seaside.
   Officers, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said a
guard was killed instantly. They said the blast was almost certainly
a bomb but that an investigation was under way.
   None of the consulate staff was believed to be inside the
building when the blast occurred. Witnesses said another person was
injured, but police could not confirm that.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion,
but Moslems here have been protesting British writer Salman
Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Six people died and almost 100 were injured when a mob attacked
an American cultural center Feb. 12 in the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad to demand that the United States ban the book.
   The novel, which some say insults Islam, has been banned in many
Moslem countries, including Pakistan.

<HEAD>Students to Sleep Outside, Eat in Soup Kitchen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of university students plan to get a
firsthand look at life through the eyes of the homeless, spending a
night on campus streets and queuing up in soup kitchen lines for
bread and broth.
   The program is the brainchild of Sister Nancy Bramlage,
coordinator of the University of Dayton's Office of Justice, Peace
and Community Outreach.
   ``What we want to do is first of all raise the awareness of
students that there is the growing problem in the United States with
the homeless and also give them a little bit of an experience of
what it must be like _ even to a tiny extent _ to be homelesss,''
said Sister Bramlage.
   She said the program, which is scheduled to begin Thursday, is
also designed to encourage students to lobby for more affordable
housing.
   Students in the program will be encouraged not to return to their
houses or residence halls for 24 hours and to sleep on the campus
plaza. Next day, they will be expected to take their belongings with
them to classes.
   Breakfast will consist of coffee and stale bread. The lunch soup
line will offer bread, vegetable soup and water.
   The alternative to sleeping on the plaza will be attendance at
hourly prayer vigils in the chapel all night long, she said.
   Sister Bramlage said she came up with the idea after students
showed a strong interest in the hunger issue. Enrollment at the
Catholic university is 6,500.
   ``I think the fact that families are homeless is just a real
serious problem for society,'' she said. ``If we're going to allow
that, what's that going to do to the fabric of society?''
   William Faith, director of the Ohio Coalition for the Homeless,
said he thinks the cause is noble, but the students need to
understand that they are sleeping outside out of choice.
   ``It's not terribly different than winter camping,'' Faith said.
``People that are out there on the streets are out there because
they have no other options and they have no other choice. And
they're doing it night after night after night.''
   About 140,000 Ohioans took part in homeless-assistance programs
last year, and in Columbus, requests for emergency shelters for
families have quadrupled since 1987, Faith said.

<HEAD>Japan Ponders Life in Post-Hirohito Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searching for their national identity in a
post-Hirohito era, the Japanese are embracing values suited to a
modern economic powerhouse while sometimes mourning the parting with
the old ways.
   In the early years of Emperor Hirohito's reign, which began in
1926, Japan embarked on a militaristic course that led to national
humiliation and defeat in World War II.
   Today Japan is rich, exerting international influence through
financial power, while its military is limited by a constitution
that explicitly rejects using international force.
   The nation's rebirth was the work of wartime survivors who turned
their energies to building a rich, peaceful Japan. The reign of the
new emperor, Akihito, is the era of their children's generation.
   Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch, was entombed
Friday.
   When older Japanese speak of him, they think of the shared
experiences of the war and the long, hard climb out of the ruins of
defeat.
   Many say they thought of Hirohito as a father figure and that he
embodied the traditional Japanese virtues of modesty, loyalty to
family, and hard work. He attended diligently to his official
functions and to his avocation as a respected marine biologist.
   ``Judging by what the new emperor has so far said in public,
there are strong indications that he has no intention to inherit
from his father the role as patriarch of the nation,'' wrote Kyoto
University Professor Takamitsu Sawa in Saturday's Japan Times.
   As national symbols, Akihito and Empress Michiko are seen as
representative of a more modern, international Japan. The new
monarch ``is said to regard the British type of royalty as an ideal
for his reign,'' Sawa said.
   Hirohito's death gives Japan an opportunity to break away from a
family-patterned society headed by the emperor and embrace values of
``individualism, liberalism and democracy,'' he added.
   Even some older Japanese have already broken sharply with the old
values.
   Many do feel admiration and sympathy for the imperial family, but
others object to the expense of Hirohito's $74 million state funeral.
   ``I think it's outrageous the state went to so much trouble for
one individual,'' said Kiyoshi Yokoyama, 70.
   Based on their memories of militarism before and during World War
II, Japanese cherish their modern freedoms, says Takashi Inoguchi,
professor of political science at Tokyo University.
   But some social critics express concern about what they see as a
lack of old-fashioned virtues of loyalty and diligence among Japan's
youth, who have known only peace and affluence.
   ``The success of the Showa era was not without cost,'' says Kyoto
University Professor Masataka Kosaka, using the official name of
Hirohito's reign. ``Today, ethics have diversified and the people
have become open to different views ... but they have lost simple
and solid faith.''
   Today's Japanese often show little caring for traditional values.
   During Friday's funeral, when the government urged the public to
reflect quietly on Hirohito's passing, tens of thousands took
advantage of the national holiday to flee Tokyo for the ski slopes.
   ``I'm sure he was an impressive person, but for us it doesn't
really matter,'' said Tomomi Tominaga, 24, who spent most of Friday
in the mountains skiing.
   For young Japanese, the beginning of the new era prompts other
reflection.
   ``Older people probably feel differently, but for us, it's really
the beginning of a new era, our era,'' said Naomi Kishi, 30.
   While the debate continues over Hirohito's historical role,
Japan's new emperor has directed his nation's attention to Japan's
future, pledging to promote peace in his limited role as a national
symbol.
   ``Your image ... will live in people's memory for a long time,''
said Akihito, addressing his father's spirit at the funeral.
   ``But we are now separated in two different worlds. You are now
in the world of our ancestors, and I remain in the world of the
living.''

<HEAD>Khomeini Tells Shevardnadze He Wants Strong Ties to Confront the
West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New throughout to include Shevardnadze meeting Musavi, inviting
him to Moscow; new Shevardnadze quotes. No Pickup. ^By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Sunday he
wants strong ties with Moscow to help fight the ``devilish'' West,
and Iranian legislators reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties
with Britain.
   Khomeini's overtures to the Soviet Union, which he previously
condemned for its atheist ideology, came during a 1{-hour meeting
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Sheverdnadze later met Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and
delivered an invitation for him to visit Moscow, according to Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   IRNA said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his order
for Moslem zealots to assassinate British author Salman Rushdie
because of his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Britain reportedly asked
Shevardnadze to press Khomeini to give a reprieve to Rushdie, whose
book has been denounced as insulting to Islam.
   ``There was no mention of the affair in Shevardnadze's speech,''
said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   The meeting with Shevardnadze came two days after Khomeini
declared Iran does not need relations with the West. This issue has
divided the Tehran hierarchy between so-called pragmatists, who
favor more relations with the rest of the world, and hardliners, who
favor continued isolation.
   However, Iran's Cabinet declared Sunday it is united behind
Khomeini, reported Tehran Television, which also was monitored in
Nicosia.
   ``Your children are united as a single hand against the enemies
of Islam,'' it quoted a Cabinet statement as saying of the
international furor over Rushdie.
   The award-winning author born into a Moslem family in India has
been in hiding since Khomeini's Feb. 14 execution order, and Iranian
religious leaders put a $5.2 million bounty on his head.
   In protest, Britain withdrew all its diplomats from its embassy
in Tehran, which had been reopened in December after an earlier rift
of more than a year. It also asked Iranian diplomats to leave London.
   The 11 other European Community countries as well as Norway,
Sweden and Canada, recalled their top diplomats from Iran, and
Tehran brought its ambassadors home.
   No diplomatic ties have been formally broken. But religious
leaders in Tehran last week called for a break with Britain.
   IRNA said more than 100 of the 270 deputies in Iran's Parliament
sponsored a bill Sunday to put relations with Britain to the vote.
The bill was ``passed overwhelmingly,'' making it a priority at the
next parliamentary session Tuesday, IRNA said.
   Rushdie has apologized for the distress ``The Satanic Verses''
has caused, saying his work was intended to study good and evil from
a secular viewpoint and not intended to insult anyone.
   Many Moslems contend the novel insults Islam by portraying the
prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting Mohammed
wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book, rather than receiving it
directly from God.
   The English-language Tehran Times said Sunday that hostile
relations with the West stemming from the Rushdie novel opened ``all
doors'' to improving ties with Moscow.
   It said the two main irritants to better relations with Moscow _
the Soviet supply of arms to Iran's enemy in the 8-year Iran-Iaq
war, and the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan _ were removed
at a time when ``the West has pushed its relations with Iran to an
all time low.''
   Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the importance of ``the
expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the
devilish acts of the West,'' Tehran Radio reported. It broadcast
extensive excerpts from the meeting at Khomeini's home, which IRNA
said was believed to be the first private meeting between Iran's
88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister.
   Tehran Television showed Khomeini, wearing a skullcap and robes
with a blanket over his knees, talking to Shevardnadze.
   The Soviet leader later met Musavi and the two agreed to set up
mechanisms for ``regulating political contacts'' between Moscow and
Tehran, Tehran radio said.
   Shervardnadze said Nikolai Konarev, chairman of the Iran-Soviet
joint economic commission, will visit Iran shortly ``with
significant proposals,'' IRNA reported.
   ``We hope significant chances will take place in bilateral
cooperation in the political and economic fields as a result of the
current atmosphere,'' he told Musavi.
   Shevardnadze was scheduled to return to Moscow on Monday. His
Middle East trip was 10 days.

<HEAD>Snow In The Mid Atlantic States And The Central Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Sunday across sections of the mid-Atlantic states and
in areas of the central Plains that had temperatures in the 60s only
the day before.
   Snow fell throughout West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and across
the East Coast from northern Virginia to Connecticut. Most areas
reported an inch or less of snow, but heavier amounts fell in some
of the mountains of West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
   The heaviest snowfall in the East was in the Laurel Mountains of
south-central Pennsylvania. Sections of Cambria and Somerset
counties reported 5 to 6 inches of snow and Chalk Hill in
southwestern Pennsylvania got 5 inches.
   Ice and snow that built up on highways was blamed for a traffic
death early Sunday in the high country of northern West Virginia.
   The snow in the East was caused by a low pressure system over
northwestern Pennsylvania. Northerly winds around the west side of
the low caused locally heavy snow in snow belt areas south of Lake
Superior.
   Elsewhere, 8 inches of snow was reported at Wakefield, Mich., and
in Iron County, Wis. Four to 6 inches of snow was common in
northwestern Upper Michigan.
   An upper level disturbance spread snow from southwestern Nebraska
into northeastern Kansas, with 4 to 5 inches reported in sections of
Deuel, Perkins and Keith counties in southwestern Nebraska. Snow
fell at the rate of an inch an hour in Kansas at Concordia, Topeka
and Manhattan.
   Snow melted Sunday in northern Utah because of a combination of
recent warm weather and light rain, and local minor flooding was
expected along parts of the Wasatch Front range.
   Afternoon temperatures were in the upper 70s and 80s in much of
southern Arizona and southern California. The cold wave that hit
Florida late last week ended with temperatures moderating into the
60s and lower 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 88 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Sunday's early morning low for the Lower 48 states was 7 below zero
at Warroad, Minn.
   For Monday, showers and a few thunderstorms were forecast from
the Carolinas across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast states to
the lower Mississippi Valley. Snow was forecast from southern
sections of the mid-Atlantic states across the central Appalachians
to Kentucky and northern Tennessee, with a few snow flurries
lingering in New England and New York state. Snow also was forecast
from Montana across the northern Plains and Minnesota to northern
Michigan. Scattered rain was forecast over Washington state.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were forecast from northeastern
Montana across sections of the Dakotas, the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley to northern New
England; in the 30s and 40s from Washington state across the
northern and central Rockies, the central Plains, the middle
Mississippi Valley, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and the
mid-Atlantic Coast to southern New England; in the 70s along the
central Gulf Coast and across Florida; in the 70s and 80s in
southern California, the desert Southwest and southern Texas; and in
the 50s and 60s elsewhere.

   Here is a transcript of former Sen. John
Tower's appearance Sunday on the ABC-TV show ``This Week With David
Brinkley.'' He was questioned by Sam Donaldson, George Will and
Cokie Roberts.
   DONALDSON: Senator Tower, welcome to our program this morning.
   TOWER: Thank you, Sam. I'm delighted to be back. It's sort of
refreshing to be able to break my silence after three months.
   DONALDSON: We appreciate your coming in here to do it. You heard
Senator Nunn this morning suggest that if the White House continues
to leak, as he sees it ...
   TOWER: Mmm-hmm.
   DONALDSON: ... portions of that FBI report, the committee ought
to resume its hearings and call people, put them under subpoena and
oath, and take their testimony. Would you agree to that?
   TOWER: I'm not going to try to advise the committee on what to
do, and the committee will arrive at its own decision on that. I am
no longer a member of the committee, and I have found that I'm not
... don't have a great deal of influence over what the committee
does. But I am hopeful that we can reduce the level of the rhetoric
somewhat ...
   DONALDSON: Yes, but would that be a fair ...
   TOWER: ... de-escalate it.
   DONALDSON: Would that be a fair thing to do?
   TOWER: Well, I think that, in fairness to the White House, they
are reacting to about three months of solid allegations being poured
into the public media; and therefore the White House, I think, felt
it necessary to refer to the more favorable aspects of the report in
an effort to shoot down these allegations. As you know, in this
business, the answer rarely catches up with the charge. You can be
charged with something on a three-column headline above the fold in
the paper, and the next day the rebuttal for it or the disproof of
it is back on the 23rd page somewhere. And I think that that's what
the White House was responding to. The White House was put on the
defensive by all of the allegations that came through across the
media, and I think that should be understood.
   DONALDSON: Well, senator ...
   TOWER: I know one thing, and that is that the committee didn't
tell me nor did the White House tell me ... they're very meticulous
about this ... what the allegations were. And I learned about them
by seeing them on television and reading them in the newspaper, and
that was my first hint --
   DONALDSON: Well, senator ...
   TOWER: ... that these allegations were out there.
   DONALDSON: ... as you know, many of the allegations have to do
with, to put it rather inelegantly, the charge that you're a common,
or uncommon, drunk, that ...
   TOWER: Mmm-hmm.
   DONALDSON: ... you admitted that, in the '70s, you had a drinking
problem. But the allegations are that it has persisted. Now, what
can you tell us to reassure on that point?
   TOWER: I would deny that allegation. And what I would like to do,
in response to that, is to read a portion of letter that was issued
by a doctor who took care of me after I was operated on for a colon
polyp, in which a very thorough examination was made. And I will not
read the entire letter, although the entire letter I think is very
revealing.
   DONALDSON: It will be made part of the record?

<HEAD>Woman Accused of 1974 Jail Guard Stabbing Released After Night In

<TEXT>
   Joan Little, whose acquittal in the 1974
slaying of a North Carolina jail guard brought worldwide attention,
has been arrested on stolen property and weapon charges, police said.
   Ms. Little, 34, was arrested Friday afternoon with a male
companion at the New Jersey entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which
links northern New Jersey and New York City. She was released on
bail Saturday, police said Sunday.
   Police noticed the car she was driving was missing its front
license plate, and a computer check showed the rear plate was
stolen, said Mitchell Friedlander, an officer with the police force
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the
tunnel.
   A search of the car turned up a razor knife and gambling slips,
Friedlander said. Ms. Little also gave false identification to
police, he said.
   Capt. Frances McCarthy of the Hudson County police department
said Ms. Little posted $500 bail Saturday evening and was released.
   Ms. Little was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon,
possession of prohibited gambling devices, possession of stolen
property, driving with a suspended license, and false reporting to
authorities and wrongful impersonation, Friedlander said.
   She gave as her address a location in New York City.
   The arrested man has not been identified because he offered
police several different identification cards, Friedlander said.
   Ms. McCarthy said she did not know whether the man arrested was
released.
   In 1975, Ms. Little was acquitted of stabbing a jailer to death
with an ice pick in 1974 in North Carolina. She said she killed the
guard in self-defense after he tried to sexually assault her. The
case drew wide attention because she, as a black woman, aimed her
accusation against a white jailer.
   At the time of the incident, Ms. Little was in jail while
appealing a conviction on breaking and entering charges. The appeal
failed and she was sentenced to seven years. Ms. Little, who escaped
once and was recaptured in Brooklyn, was paroled in June 1979.

   Milton Wright entered a living
nightmare when the American Steel Foundries plant where he worked
for 19 years closed in 1982.
   But Wright, 51, learned last week that ASF plans to resume
production at its foundry, once the nation's largest producer of
railroad undercarriages, and he's eligible for recall.
   ``I can't think of anything else that would make me happier than
to see this plant open up,'' Wright said. ``I have tears in my eyes
right now.''
   The foundry's revival is a godsend for the more than 200 workers
who will be rehired. An estimated 650 employees were laid off when
the plant closed.
   Though he eventually managed to find another job, Wright
remembers the closure all too well. Bills mounted while he struggled
to find work, and unemployment put a strain on his marriage, which
ended in divorce about three years ago. He also sought professional
help to calm his nerves.
   ``When we shut down, most of us said we're going to get two,
three month's rest,'' Wright recalled. ``Six months later when your
unemployment runs out, you say, `Hey, what's going to happen to me?'
   ``Then, a year later, it's a nightmare.''
   At its peak in 1979, when U.S. manufacturers produced about
94,000 railroad cars, the foundry employed about 1,700 people,
according to ASF president Norman A. Berg.
   Several factors led to the railroad parts industry's collapse
just three years later, including deregulation of the railroads.
   ``They could operate more efficiently, and really, they didn't
need many cars,'' Berg said.
   Also, companies that invested heavily in railroad cars during the
late 1970s, in order to lease them to the railroads, pulled out when
the economy soured.
   As a result, the industry in the early 1980s faced a surplus of
almost 300,000 railroad cars, said Elwyn Ahnquist, president of the
Chicago-based American Railway Car Institute. In 1982, fewer than
19,000 railroad cars were produced nationwide.
   But now, Ahnquist and Berg say the railroad parts industry is
gaining steam because of a decline in the surplus of railroad cars
to about 40,000. And many of the 1.2 million cars in use are
obsolete or nearly so.
   And in May, Berg said, the foundry here will resume producing
cast steel side frames and bolsters, which form the undercarriages,
or trucks, of railroad cars.
   Thirty-five employees are getting the plant ready for reopening
and in the next couple of weeks 30 more will be added, plant manager
William Donovan said. By early summer, the company expects to recall
200 more workers at roughly $10 an hour, he said.
   Wright says he's happier for his former co-workers who never
landed a job after the plant closed. It took him two years, but he
finally found work as a supervisor at another steel-related plant in
Granite City.
   And, if the money is right _ he makes between $30,000 and $40,000
annually now _ he said he'd love to go back to American Steel,
calling it ``the best company to work for.''
   ``Whether I go back or not, I am concerned about my co-workers,''
Wright said. ``Hopefully, they'll be able to go to work at American
Steel and say: `Hey! Once again I'm a working man. I have my pride
back.'''

   About 3,000 Namibian guerrilla
supporters Sunday welcomed the chief of the U.N. peacekeeping force
that will oversee the transition of Africa's last colony into an
independent nation.
   India's Lt. Gen. Dewan Prem-Chand arrived in Windheok, the
Namibian capital, a week ahead of the first troops he will command
as head of the military component of the United Nations Transition
Assistance Group (UNTAG).
   The only exception to the warm welcome were complaints by some
supporters of the guerrilla South-West African People's Organization
that the United Nations decided to send only 4,650 troops to
Namibia, rather than the 7,500 sought by the guerrilla organization
and other African countries.
   They are to keep peace when the independence process begins April
1 in the territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years. Favored to
win independence elections planned in early November is the
South-West African People's Organization, the guerrilla movement
that has waged a 22-year bush war against Pretoria's troops.
   Pretoria agreed to implement the U.N. independence plan in
December.
   The plan originally called for 4,650 peacekeeping troops in
Namibia, but the U.N. Security Council decided on the smaller number
in a bid to keep down costs estimated at more than $400 million.
   At a brief news conference, Prem-Chand said he thinks he has
sufficient troops to perform his mission in the territory, which is
about twice the size of California but is one of the world's most
sparsely populated lands with only 1.3 million people.
   Gen. Willie Meyer, head of the South African-led military in
Namibia, met Prem-Chand and his 12 senior assistants at Windhoek
airport.
   Prem-Chand said he plans to travel extensively and meet other key
figures in the territory in coming days.
   Twenty-three countries have agreed to provide troops, military
observers and civilians for the Namibia operation.
   The election campaign is to begin in July.
   SWAPO's chief rival is expected to be the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, a multiracial coalition backed by the South African
government that favors free enterprise and a multiparty democracy.
   Four other political parties announced Saturday they have merged
to become the United Democratic Front of Namibia. Their decision not
to join SWAPO, which has a similar poltical platform, was seen as a
setback for the guerrilla movement.
   SWAPO has yet to detail its plans. However, the organization says
it favors a socialist economy and has not stated whether it would
allow the existence of other political parties.

   World leaders wrapped up their visits on Sunday and
asked Japan to take a bigger role in Middle East peace efforts and
spread more of its great wealth to developing nations.
   The funeral of Emperor Hirohito, which drew representatives of
163 nations, provided an unusual chance for leaders to meet in Tokyo
without some of the constraints of diplomatic protocol.
   President Bush met with 20 world leaders before leaving Saturday
for China and then South Korea. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita met with nearly 40 and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno held
talks with about 90 officials.
   On Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asked
for Japan to play a larger role in U.N.-sponsored peace talks
between Iran and Iraq, news reports said.
   Perez de Cuellar told Takeshita that Japan's help was important
because of a worsening of relations between Western countries and
Iran over the controversial book ``The Satanic Verses,'' Kyodo News
Service reported.
   In a meeting Sunday with Iranian Vice President Mostafa Mir
Salim, Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno said he hoped Iran
would rescind its ``intolerable'' death threat against author Salman
Rushdie, a ministry official said.
   But Uno said Japan had no plan to follow European nations' lead
and withdraw its ambassador from Iran in protest over the death
threat.
   ``We have chosen the course of expressing our opinions to Iran
and maintaining relations,'' the official said.
   Uno pledged in a separate meeting with Iraqi Vice President Taha
Muhi Dim Maruf to help Iraq rebuild after a peace settlement is
achieved with Iran, Kyodo reported.
   In talks with Israeli President Chaim Herzog, Takeshita said
Japan hopes for an international peace conference on the Middle East
that will include the Palestine Liberation Organization, another
ministry official said.
   But Herzog reiterated Israel's position that it will refuse to
meet with the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization,
the official said.
   Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmad bin Saif Thani asked Uno
Sunday to allow the PLO to open an embassy in Japan, but Uno refused
the request, Kyodo reported. Although the PLO does not have
diplomatic relations with Japan, it maintains an office in Tokyo and
sent a representative to Hirohito's funeral on Friday.
   Takeshita expressed support to Thai Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhaven for his country's peace efforts in Cambodia and pledged
that Japan will contribute more toward a settlement of the conflict,
Kyodo said.
   Chatichai told Takeshita that he hoped upcoming summit talks
between China and the Soviet Union would help bring an end to the
war, it said. The Soviet Union supports Vietnam, which invaded
Cambodia 10 years ago, while China has assisted Cambodian guerrilla
groups fighting the Vietnamese.
   Chatichai said Thailand hopes to further strengthen its economic
ties with Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Burma, Kyodo said.
   Although many Japanese expressed pride over the record number of
countries attending Hirohito's funeral, some said part of the reason
for the large number was Japan's new status as the world's largest
giver of development aid.
   Among the nations asking for increased Japanese economic
assistance and investment Sunday were Jordan, Thailand, Turkey,
Laos, Iraq, Malaysia, Argentina, Tanzania and Bangladesh.
   Takeshita promised new aid to Indonesia Sunday in talks with
President Suharto, Kyodo reported. The Indonesian president said his
country faces a foreign debt of about $38 billion.
   On Thursday, Takeshita pledged up to $1 billion in new assistance
for debt-ridden Brazil.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinistas will hand over power if
they lose the 1990 presidential election, a government official was
quoted as saying on Sunday.
   President Daniel Ortega will ``abandon power immediately'' if he
loses the February 1990 election, Interior Minister Tomas Borge told
a group of disabled war veterans, the pro-government daily El Nuevo
Diario said.
   Earlier Saturday, Borge told a group of foreign correspondents
that the Sandinistas would win the election. He also said the party
hadn't discussed who its candidate would be.
   Even though Ortega has not made his candidacy official, he has
spoken publicly about running for re-election. Party faithful
greeted him at a political rally near Managua Saturday with placards
calling for him to run in 1990.
   El Nueveo Diario quoted Borge as saying the Sandinistas would win
because they are ``the biggest and the best.''
   Ortega announced earlier this month at a Central American summit
meeting in El Salvador that Nicaragua would hold elections in
February 1990 instead of November.
   He said opposition parties would have an opportunity to
participate fully in the electoral process and international
monitors were welcome to observe every phase of the campaign and the
voting.
   The leftist Sanidinistas, who have been in power since
overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in a 1979 revolution, have
been holding talks with the opposition about electoral reforms and
media access.
   The United States supports the rebels known as Contras seeking to
overthrow the Sandinista regime.

   Conductor Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna
Philharmonic took a familiar piece of music, Schubert's ``Unfinished
Symphony,'' and not only made it fresh but made it sound like a
miracle of composition.
   Most of the audience at Carnegie Hall for the first of two
concerts by the Vienna conducted by Karajan had heard the
``Unfinished'' numerous times. Saturday night's audience heard it as
though experiencing it for the first time.
   The Vienna can playas softly as a murmur. But there are aspects
to this magnificent orchestra's playing that one forgets. Sound can
swell in certain groups of instruments without getting generally
loud. Low-toned instruments can convey depths of feeling. The
playing _ and not only the famous silken violins _ is so smooth that
a listener's breathing is calmed.
   Karajan brought up sections of instruments whose sound wasn't
emotionally whipped up but seemed to be filled with emotion.
   But the most awe-inspiring aspect was the playing of Schubert's
melodic themes. Each began like a tiny shoot through the surrounding
ground of the orchestral playing and grew straight, getting bigger,
to bud then bloom. The themes weren't overblown or overpowering, but
we never heard them so majestic.
   Karajan, who is 80, has been music director of the Berlin
Philharmonic since 1955. He has long conducted the Vienna
Philharmonic, both at the Salzburg Festival and in Vienna. This is
the first time he has conducted it here in 30 years. The orchestra
currently has no resident conductor.
   Some expected Karajan to enter the stage in a wheelchair, but he
walked, holding the arm of a musician. The back of the podium was
made with a kind of bench, against which Karajan leaned while he
conducted. He walked off the stage and then walked back to the
podium to take bows. He received standing ovations at every entrance
and exit.
   The second half of the program was short pieces by Johann and
Josef Strauss, which the Vienna Philharmonic annually plays on a
televised New Year's concert. These can be breezy confections, but
the Vienna Philharmonic and Karajan gave them more substance than
that.
   The overture to ``The Gypsy Baron'' was trippingly joyful and one
could see the spirit of a young man in the maestro's gestures.
   ``Music of the Spheres'' had majestic yearning, an uplighting
section and flowing sweetness. ``Annen-Polka'' floated delicately
its second time through.
   The less familiar ``Hilarion Waltz'' began with a storm brewing,
became expansive with pretty melodies and continued through several
elaborate sections. ``Perpetuum mobile,'' which is dizzyingly fast,
ended by fading away and Karajan giving a theatrical ``what could I
do?'' shrug.
   ``The Emperor Waltz'' evokes the ringing sound of success and an
opulent way of life.

<HEAD>Grosz: Multi-Party System Means ``Less Room For Bad Decisions''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz said
Sunday the introduction of a multiparty system will leave ``less
room for bad decisions'' but won't solve all of Hungary's problems.
   ``The introduction of a multi-party system in Hungary is a
novelty but not a historic event,'' Grosz was quoted as saying by
the state news agency Tanjug, monitored in Vienna. ``Even a
multi-party system is not a guarantee that grave social mistakes
will not be repeated.''
   Pluralism, Grosz said, is likely to bring about ``less room for
bad decisions because the parties will be publicly controlling one
another.''
   Grosz was interviewed in Budapest by Tanjug's director general
Mihailo Saranovic prior to a brief visit to Yugoslavia Monday for
talks with his Yugoslav counterpart, Stipe Suvar, on reform in the
East bloc and bilateral relations.
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party endorsed a multiparty system for
the first time earlier this month, but stressed the transition to
more pluralism should be gradual and orderly.
   In a separate development, the state news agency MTI reported
that Hungary will drop the traditional May Day parade this year
after 44 years of observation.
   In a report late Saturday, the agency did not spell out the
reasons for which the workers' demonstration, an annual fixture in
the Soviet bloc, was abolished.
   Participants at a weekend meeting laying the groundwork for an
independent trade union of young workers said they believed among
the reasons the May 1 parade was dropped was that authorities were
``fearful'' of posters calling for better living conditions for
Hungarian workers or voicing other complaints.
   ``Even if they say no, we shall sponsor our own parade,'' said a
participant.
   In place of the parade, authorities plan to stage a rally at
which Grosz will make a speech, MTI said.
   The announcement appeared to indicate that May Day would still
remain a holiday in Hungary.
   The Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee, in a
statement released after a highly secretive two-day meeting Feb.
10-11, said it had decided a multiparty system would provide a
``better safeguard'' against abuse of power than the single-party
rule initiatied with the Communist takeover in 1948.
   If Hungary implements genuine power-sharing, it would be the
first East bloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system.
   The Hungarian Parliament, which is increasingly outspoken, is to
pass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by Aug. 1, 1989.
   Grosz, however, told Tanjug that the Communist Party does not
plan to relinquish its leading role in Hungary.
   Dozens of independent groups have formed in Hungary over the past
year, several of which are likely to become political parties. The
Smallholders and the Social Democratic Parties have announced their
return after 40 years. Both were essentially dissolved when the
Communists came to power in 1948.

   A story Feb. 25 on the court-martial of
a Marine lieutenant said he was convicted of dereliction of duty and
appearing drunk. The story failed to mention that he also was found
guilty of disobeying an order.
   The charges against 1st Lt. Allen Lawson stemmed from the death
of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, who had been left behind in the Mojave
Desert in August after being posted as a road guide during a
training exercise.
   Lawson was acquitted of willfully disobeying an order. He was,
however, convicted of the lesser charge of disobeying an order to
post road guides in pairs and to submit a list of the guides to the
officer charged with picking up the Marines.

<TEXT>
   A community effort to raise $90,000 to pay
police officers a raise fell short of its goal and nearly half the
city's force was laid off Sunday.
   Mayor Louis Washowich said donations may allow officials to call
back a few of the 21 idled officers as early as Friday, but only for
a limited time.
   Washowich said the layoffs were necessary because state
arbitrators recently awarded the police department wage increases of
4 percent to 4{ percent, which the Allegheny County city could not
afford.
   City officials have said officers made an average of about
$28,000 a year before the raise, while the police bargaining unit
has said the average was closer to $25,000.
   The mayor said fund-raising is not a long-term solution.
   ``I don't want to create false hopes for people,'' he said.
   Washowich has said laying off 21 officers from the force of about
50 for three months would save the city $90,000. But wage increases
and benefits for the police will cost between $110,000 and $120,000
this year and an additional $225,000 next year, he said.
   McKeesport's volunteer ambulance company began the fund-raising
effort Thursday with a $15,000 donation. A restaurant planned to
contribute proceeds from Sunday's sales, which could raise $5,000 to
$7,000, according to manager Fred Balistreri.
   Equibank officials said Saturday that the company would match
money raised during the coming week, up to $50,000. Equibank
employees plan to canvass McKeesport for donations Wednesday.
   Officer Patrick Carloss, head of the police department's wage and
policy committee, said the ambulance company's $15,000 alone would
be enough to keep officers working for another two weeks.
   Carloss said he was surprised and angered by the mayor's decision
to proceed with layoffs as planned. Carloss was among those affected.
   ``It's a total slap in the face of the citizens of McKeesport,''
Carloss said. ``These people are going out of their way to save the
police.''
   He said the mayor wanted to punish the police for going to
arbitration. Washowich said he based his decision solely on the need
to balance the city's budget.

   Fire destroyed an old bus where a 70-year-old
woman and her daughter had lived in primitive conditions for 10
years, and the blaze also killed most of the chickens on which they
depended for food.
   ``We lost everything,'' said Leah Succkosh. ``We ain't got
anything to eat, we ain't got no blankets, nothing.''
   The bus, stripped of its wheels, sat on a wooded, rural lot that
the women said was their land.
   A motel agreed to take them and their two dogs for the weekend.
``If we could find a trailer so that they could stay on the land,
that would be ideal,'' said Tot Ratliff, director of Community
Christian Concern, a Slidell relief agency.
   Succkosh escaped without injury from Friday's fire. Her daughter,
Sarah, 40, suffered first- and second-degree facial burns when she
went back into the burning bus to rescue the dogs. She was treated
at Slidell Memorial Hospital and released, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   Most of their 65 chickens were killed. They had taken the birds
into the bus to keep them warm when the temperature dropped below
freezing in last week's cold wave. The women fed themselves and
their dogs on the hens' eggs.
   ``We had to literally fight them to keep them from going back in
the structure to save those chickens,'' Assistant Fire Chief Albert
Lee said.
   The women had no electricity or plumbing. They got water from a
hand pump next to the bus. For cooking and heat, they had an old
wood stove inside the bus. There was no outhouse and firefighters
found a bucket full of waste, Lee said.
   ``Never in my life have I seen people living in these kinds of
conditions,'' he said.
   Neighbors said the women stayed to themselves.
   Ratliff said the women lived there by choice and refused her
agency's offers of help to find them better living quarters.

   A fierce storm in the Atlantic Ocean sank
or disabled eight ships on Sunday, and rescue workers said eight
people drowned and 25 were missing and presumed dead. At least 80
people were rescued.
   The storm, which battered a wide section of the Atlantic from
Britain to Spain, produced winds up to 80 mph and 30-foot waves.
   In Spain, strong winds knocked over billboards and blew off parts
of roofs, killing five people in the eastern city of Valencia and
two more in central Valladolid, Spanish National Radio reported. A
man drowned when his canoe overturned in the Trasona reservoir in
the northern Spain, the radio reported.
   Two vessels sank during the storm and one ran aground.
   In the most serious incident, a Nigerian cargo ship with 46
people aboard developed engine trouble two miles off Cape Espichel,
Portugal, a rocky promontory.
   Gale-force winds and 16-foot waves then drove the 3,000-ton ship,
the River Gurara, onto the rocks, a spokesman for the Portuguese
navy said.
   A Portugese frigate picked up 27 people, including three women
and three children, from lifeboats, said the spokesman. Rescue
workers recovered eight bodies but called off their search for the
11 people still missing.
   A Singapore-registered freighter, the Anna Leonhardt, issued a
distress call and sank off France's Atlantic coast Saturday, and
rescue workers searched fruitlessly Sunday for 14 sailors who were
aboard.
   ``I think there's no longer any chance to find them,'' said
Francois Reuillot, director of the Regional Operational Rescue
Center in Morbihan in western France. Several hours later, the
search was called off.
   Reuillot said the captain radioed late Saturday to say he and the
crew were abandoning the sinking ship in heavy seas about 220 miles
west of Bordeaux. The cause of the Anna Leonhardt's distress was not
clear.
   Reuillot said searchers found debris from the 3,895-ton ship,
including lifeboats and life rafts. The search was hampered by
howling winds and 30-foot waves.
   Tugboats from the Lisbon Port Authority towed a Bulgarian cargo
ship to shore after it caught fire and was listing badly in heavy
seas about six miles off Lisbon. Officials were unable to say how
many people were aboard the Voyana, but they said four people from
the ship were injured, none seriously.
   An unidentified Libyan vessel with 30 people aboard had engine
trouble off northern Portugal was towed to shore by a tugboat from
Vigo, Spain.
   Off the coast of Santander in northern Spain, a passing fishing
vessel rescued the 13-man crew of the Santo Cristo de Festerrat
after the Spanish fishing boat sank in high seas.
   Another Spanish fishing vessel, the Agosare, was towed to the
northern port of Gijon after it reported it was in danger 25 miles
off the northern Spanish coast, said Spanish maritime officals. They
did not know how many were aboard.
   Two other vessels were disabled by the storm off Britain.
   A lifeboat crew from Wales rescued five fishermen from their
vessel, which was drifting toward coastal rocks in heavy seas and
high winds, rescue authorities said.
   A helicopter from the Brawdy Royal Air Force base in Wales flew
out to a Soviet trawler battered by 30-foot waves 260 miles out in
the Atlantic and winched aboard a crewman who suffered serious arm
injuries on the boat.

   An opposition group called on workers to
strike and said Sunday that the talks between the Solidarity labor
movement and the government will ``prolong totalitarian rule.''
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, meanwhile, told a rally in Gdansk
that workers must refrain from strikes while the talks on political
and economic reforms continue.
   But the meeting by renegade activists in the southern city of
Jastrzebie criticized Walesa's moderate stand. Up to 120 people were
arrested and held briefly Friday and Saturday to prevent them from
attending the weekend meeting, said opposition figure Jozef Pinior.
   Pinior, a leader of the banned Polish Socialist Party, said the
meeting resulted in a resolution calling for free elections and the
removal of the ``monopolistic authority'' of the communist party.
   The resolution said workers should use strikes to achieve their
political goals and criticized stands taken at the talks.
   ``The round-table talks will have our support only when they are
not used to prevent workers' protests,'' said the resolution, quoted
by Pinior.
   ``The model of an anti-worker economic reform accepted by the
negotiators at the roundtable is unacceptable and only serves to
make more credible and to prolong totalitarian rule,'' it said.
   Pinior said the congress was attended by members of his group,
the banned peace group Freedom And Peace, the militant splinter
group Fighting Solidarity and the Independent Students Association.
   Meanwhile, in the Baltic Port city of Gdansk, Walesa said the
talks need at least three more weeks of labor calm.
   ``He who wants to make trouble should go away from here
immediately. I am asking on my knees that you not destroy our
country,'' he said, addressing about 2,000 people after a Mass at
St. Brygida's Church.
   ``There are reasons for strikes everywhere,'' he said. ``But now
we have to mobilize ourselves and refrain.''
   But Walesa made clear that continued labor peace was contingent
upon further government liberalizations.
   ``If there are no reforms by April or May, I, Lech Walesa, will
call for struggle,'' He said.
   After Walesa spoke, about 200 young people staged a noisy march
in Gdansk, chanting ``Solidarity.''
   The government and a broad spectrum of opposition groups have
been meeting since Feb. 6 to negotiate sweeping economic, political
and social change in Poland. The government says it will consider
legalizing Solidarity if it agrees to be a party to reforms.
   Solidarity was the first independent labor union in the Soviet
bloc when it was founded in 1980. It was outlawed after the
imposition of martial law in 1981.

   Sir Roy Denman, European Community representative in Washington,
assured the governors they had nothing to fear from moves toward
greater unity among the 12 Common Market nations.
   He said one American concern was that ``there will be a `Fortress
Europe' and the answer is that's rubbish.''
   For European nations to impose trade barriers on the United
States ``would be shooting ourslves in both feet and the rear.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills warned the governors
against minimizing the importance of the dispute between the United
States and the European Community over U.S. beef treated with
hormones.
   The Europeans banned imports of U.S. beef. The United States
argued that the Europeans acted without examining scientific
evidence that the beef was safe for human consumption.
   She said the amount of trade was only $100 million and as a
result some commentators considered the dispute of little importance.
   ``Trust me, it's not,'' she said, warning that if beef is the
target on this occasion ``what happens next month when a trading
partner does not want to buy our corn because it has been sprayed
with a certain pesticide.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis told Mrs. Hills that many
companies in his state complain to him about the difficulty getting
export licenses from the federal government, particularly high tech
companies.
   ``It is frustrating for those who apply,'' she said. ``Yet the
national interest is such that they must apply. We cannot give away
our technology.''

   Military ruler Augusto Pinochet,
repudiated by voters in a referendum last year, is being wooed by
the right to run for president again, officials said.
   ``Many think the diversity of candidates is making it quite
difficult to reach a candidate of consensus, and the one who may be
closest is President Pinochet,'' Defense Minister Patricio Carvajal
said in a recent interview.
   When the military government offered Pinochet as the only
candidate in a referendum in October, Chileans rejected the bid of
the 73-year-old army commander to extend his authoritarian rule
until 1997.
   The terms of the constitution, drafted under the military
government, now call for an open presidential election on Dec. 14.
   The constitution holds that the president cannot seek re-election
to a consecutive term. Reform of the constitution is seen as the
only means of allowing Pinochet to be nominated as the official
candidate.
   Pinochet backers, however, say the constitutional restriction
does not apply to the general since he was not elected in the first
place.
   Pinochet seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died
in the overthrow.
   Patricio Aylwin, 70, president of the centrist Christian
Demoratic Party and the man who led the opposition coalition
campaign against Pinochet in October, is considered the frontrunner
in a field of at least four contenders for the opposition
presidential nomination.
   The opposition said it will support a single candidate in the
December election and the nomination is expected to be made next
month.
   Pinochet announced only recently he would not be a candidate. He
made clear he intends to direct the pro-government campaign and even
pick the candidate to succeed him.
   ``Soon I will tell you whom we shall support. Let's not rush
things,'' the general told supporters in a recent trip thorugh the
country.
   Yet many supporters are still urging him to run.
   The two largest parties on the right, National Renovation and the
Independent Democratic Union, joined in backing Pinochet in the
October referendum, but disputes have since distanced the two.
   Divisions also have surfaced among smaller pro-government parties
over centenders for the official candidacy, including two who have
already launched their bids: extreme-right lawyer Pablo Rodriguez
and Sergio Diez, former ambassador to the United Nations in the
Pinochet government.
   Others on the right are looking to Pinochet's 39-year-old Finance
Minister Hernan Buchi.
   Alejandro Navarrete, mayor of Chile's second-largest city, the
neighboring port city of Valparaiso, said the number of potential
candidates ``is causing Pinochet's political figure to loom large.''
   Observers say the disunity on the right is also being fueled by
disagreements over calls for political and constitutional reform.
   For instance, some in the opposition are demanding that the next
presidential term, to begin in March 1990, run four years and not
the eight dictated by the constitution.
   While some forces on the right support a shortened term, others
call it an opposition attempt to ruin the presidency.
   The opposition also is seeking changes to the constitution, which
now guarantees Pinochet extraordinary powers even after leaving
office.
   Under the existing constitution, an ex-President Pinochet would
be made a senator for life. He and the other armed forces chiefs, as
well as the National Police director, would continue to lead their
respective institutions for eight years.

<HEAD>Airline Announces Special Checks Of 747s In Wake Of Accident</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Plane Emergency, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines has begun a series of special
maintenance checks on its aircraft following the accident near
Hawaii in which nine people died, the airline said Sunday.
   The maintenance checks are ``over and above (United's) existing
procedures and those required by the Federal Aviation
Administration,'' said United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
   ``By announcing these steps, we want to make clear that we are
not speculating and will not speculate on the cause of Friday's
incident,'' Wolf said in a company statement. ``By the same token,
we have an absolute commitment to safety and we intend to go well
beyond our already-strict standards and FAA requirements.''
   A cargo door may have popped open on United Flight 811, ripping a
hole in the side of the 18-year-old Boeing 747, which was flying at
22,000 feet about 100 miles south of Honolulu, federal investigators
have said. Nine of the 354 people on board were blown out and are
presumed dead. The plane returned safely to Honolulu.
   Wolf also said the 747 involved in Friday's accident on Flight
811 was in compliance with all FAA airworthiness directives and
maintenance requirements.
   However, the jet's cargo door locks had not yet been modified
under a July order by the Federal Aviation Adminstration that
airlines improve cargo door lock systems on older Boeing 747s after
a door in one plane partly opened in flight. The deadline for that
work is the end of this year.
   United had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but
had completed the required modifications on just six by last week,
spokesman Russell Mack said in Chicago. The plane in Friday's
accident was not one of the six, he said.
   Because the right forward cargo door was suspected in the
incident, Wolf said United checked all cargo doors on its fleet of
31 747s and all were found to be in proper working order.
   In addition, a ``detailed technical inspection emcompassing all
latches, seals, fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms''
was expected to be completed Sunday. Similar inspections were to be
done on all aircraft in United's fleet, the statement said.
   It also said an FAA-licensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo
door upon arrival at a destination, in addition to regular
pre-departure inspections; and such mechanics will oversee the
closing of each 747 cargo door before departures. The closings have
been handled by ``trained ramp service personnel,'' the statement
said.

   TABA, Israeli-Held Sinai (AP) _ Israel and Egypt signed a
historic agreement Sunday that will turn this desert beach strip
over to Egypt and end a seven-year border dispute that has marred
relations.
   The agreement calling for Israelis to withdraw from the 250-acre
resort by March 15 was signed at the Sonesta hotel in Taba, northern
Sinai.
   Both sides joined U.S. mediators in expressing hope that future
disputes between Israel and its Arab neighbors can be solved through
negotiations.
   ``A new chapter is starting and we sincerely hope it will lead to
the road of a comprehensive peace,'' said Egypt's chief negotiator,
Nabil El-Araby.
   His Israeli counterpart, Foreign Ministry Director-General Reuven
Merhav added: ``It is a splended example and a shining beacon of
hope. We in Israel believe negotiations are the only possible path
to peace.''
   A key point of the accord will allow Israelis to visit the resort
for up to 14 days without visas or special entry fees. Israel also
will continue supplying water and electricity to the area.
   The agreement was approved Sunday by Israel's 10-member inner
Cabinet by a 8-1 vote with one abstention.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who voted for the agreement, said
he nevertheless regretted the results.
   ``To my great sorrow the drama has ended as it has ended,''
Shamir said at a Sunday night rally of his right-wing Likud bloc in
northern Israel.
   ``My stand was well known. I opposed the turn to arbitration and
instead wanted to turn to compromise,'' he said. ``If we had agreed
to compromise we would not have had to leave Taba,'' he said.
   Shamir and the Likud opposed the agreement in 1986 to enter
binding arbitration. They preferred non-binding negotiations.
   International arbitrators on Sept. 29 delineated the border in
such a way as to put the beach in Egypt. Israel delayed
implementation of the ruling pending negotiations over obtaining
easy access for tourists and receiving compensation for the hotel
and a neighboring holiday village.
   Under the agreement, Egypt will purchase the Sonesta for $37
million and the holiday village for $1.5 million.
   Egypt's Tourism Minister, Fuad Sultan, said Israeli tourists will
be ``extremely welcome.''
   The dispute over Taba, which borders on the southern Israeli port
of Eilat, began in April 1982 when Israel refused to withdraw from
the strip as it ended a 15-year occupation of the bulk of the Sinai
Desert.

   Jesse Jackson, Mayor Eugene Sawyer's most vocal
supporter, urges voters to ``maintain the gains'' that blacks have
brought to city hall, but others are predicting that Chicago could
become the first major city to have a black mayor defeated by a
white.
   Several variables could alter the result, but the most likely
scenario _ according to pundits and polls _ has Richard M. Daley,
who is white and the son of late Mayor Richard J. Daley, winning
Tuesday's Democratic primary and the April 4 election.
   Blacks fear that losing power in City Hall would erase gains
achieved by Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, who
died a few months into his second term in 1987.
   ``Of course that fear helps motivate people to get out the
vote,'' said Robert Starks, professor of political science at
Chicago's Northeastern Illinois University. Starks is chairman of a
task force on black political power which he said helped elect
Washington in 1983.
   ``Not only would it be the first loss of a black mayor, it would
also be a loss of the completion of Harold Washington's last two
years in office,'' Starks said. ``It would be a tragic loss.''
   Even if Sawyer managed to win Tuesday _ and a newspaper poll a
week ago had him gaining on Daley but still 8 percentage points
behind _ it would not guarantee that a black would stay in City Hall.
   The GOP candidate in April will be white _ and could be former
Washington nemesis Edward Vrdolyak, who is running a write-in
campaign for the Republican nomination. That candidate would face
Sawyer and third-party candidate Timothy Evans, a black alderman. A
split in the black vote could put a white in office.
   After Washington died, Sawyer was elected his successor in a
raucous City Council meeting by a coalition made up mostly of white
aldermen who opposed Washington.
   But Jackson told an Operation PUSH meeting Saturday that Sawyer
has ``maintained the gains'' brought by Washington, and he has urged
the divided black electorate to unite behind Sawyer in the primary.
   But he also stressed that race is not the only factor in the
election, saying, ``The issue fundamentally is about forwards and
backwards; it's about being progressive or regressive, so I think
that to center the analysis on race misses much of the point.''
   The era of big-city black mayors in the United States began in
1967, when Carl Stokes was elected in Cleveland and Richard Hatcher
in Gary, Ind., said Thomas E. Cavanagh, director of Johns Hopkins
University's Center for the Study of American Government in
Washington.
   Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit and Philadelphia have followed
suit, he said, and a black incumbent in a big city has yet to lose
to a white. Cleveland now has a white mayor, but that happened after
Stokes decided not to seek re-election, Cavanagh said in a telephone
interview Sunday.
   In Chicago, political turmoil sparked by Washington's death will
be to blame if a black can't hold City Hall, Cavanagh said.
   ``Exploiting divisions within the minority community is one way
that the traditional white leadership can regain power,'' he said.
Cities such as Chicago, where fewer than 50 percent of voters are
black, are especially vulnerable, he said.
   Cavanagh said it's only to be expected that ``you're going to
have reversals from time to time.''
   But to Starks, such a loss in Chicago would create a call to go
back to work.
   ``There will be a doubling of organizing efforts to come back
stronger than ever in 1991,'' he said.

   A man was fatally shot in a west
Belfast housing project Sunday night, police said, and the IRA
claimed to have shot him because he was a British agent.
   A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said the force was
not aware of the victim having any connection with the security
forces.
   In a brief statement released by the Irish Republican Army to
Belfast news media, it said it had ``executed a British agent.''
   The man, as yet unidentified by police, was killed in a dark
alley in Bunbeg Park in the Glen Road area of west Belfast, police
said.
   Nearby residents said they heard five shots.
   Police and troops flooded the area, set up road blocks and began
searches.
   The IRA is waging a violent campaign to drive the British out of
the predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the largely
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Actor Timothy Hutton Awarded $9.75 Million in MGM Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning actor Timothy Hutton was awarded
$9.75 million by a jury that decided MGM deceived him about the
reason for canceling the 1983 movie ``Roadshow.''
   The Superior Court jury found in an 11-1 verdict on Friday that
the studio committed fraud and breach of contract. The jury awarded
Hutton $2.25 million in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in
punitive damages.
   Hutton claimed studio executives told him the picture, about a
modern-day cattle drive, was being terminated because the director,
Richard Brooks, had suffered a heart attack. Actually, MGM lost
interest in the movie after a change of management, the actor
contended.
   ``We were able to prove at the trial that Brooks wasn't even
under contract and that MGM had lied about Brooks' commitment to
even direct the movie,'' said James Tierney, Hutton's attorney.
   Hutton, who won an Academy Award for his role in the 1980 film
``Ordinary People,'' claimed MGM deprived him of other possible
roles by failing to tell him of its decision for several months.
   The month-long trial included testimony from other ``Roadshow''
actors, Jack Nicholson and Mary Steenburgen, agent Sue Mengers and
directors Brooks and Martin Ritt.
   Nicholson ``resolved matters'' with MGM several years ago, and
Miss Steenburgen settled a lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, according
to a company attorney who asked not to be named, the Los Angeles
Times reported Sunday.
   MGM is now owned by Turner Broadcasting.
   Turner Broadcasting will seek a further review of the verdict,
the company attorney told the Times.

   A bus collided head-on with a truck
in rural northeastern Brazil, killing 16 people and injuring 25,
police said.
   The crash occurred Saturday in Catalao, about 1,100 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The bus was packed with 41 weekend travelers making a 30-hour,
1,116-mile trip from Irace in the northeastern state of Bahia to
Brasilia, the capital, said Catalao Police Officer Jose da Silva.
   The driver lost control of the bus on a hilly curve and swerved
in front of an oncoming truck loaded with corn, he said.
   ``The scene was horrible,'' said da Silva, who assisted rescue
workers. ``The truck rammed the bus clear off the road and threw
people over the drop that runs alongside the road. The dead bodies
were mangled and crushed, and bleeding people were screaming out for
help from the twisted wreckage.''
   Fourteen bus passengers, the bus driver and the driver of the
truck died instantly, da Silva said. Two bus passengers died shortly
afterwards at Catalao Hospital and six of the 25 injured are in
critical condition, he said.

<HEAD>In Ninth Day of Fast, Ministers Supported by Anti-Abortion Sympathizers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 400 to 500 anti-abortion
sympathizers sang and chanted Sunday in front of a jail to support
two ministers there who are in the ninth day of a water-only fast.
   The Rev. Ted Cadwallader, 40, and the Rev. James Evans, 38, waved
from a sixth-floor window at the Erie County Holding Center to the
gathering that lined a sidewalk across the street. The protesters
stood behind a large banner that read, ``We Love You Ted and Jim.''
   ``The fast is going fine and God is feeding us mightily,'' the
two wrote in a letter that was read at the demonstration. ``The
court may have meant this for bad but God meant it for good.''
   The two ministers have been in jail since refusing to post $100
bail each following their arrest Feb. 17 on charges of trespassing
and resisting arrest. They and four other anti-abortion protesters
chained themselves to the entrance of a medical clinic in suburban
Kenmore where abortions are performed.
   Kenmore Village Justice J. Mark Gruber said the two ministers
must post bail because they have been arrested before in
anti-abortion protests in the village. Gruber said the village
requires repeat offenders to post bail.
   The protesters Sunday sang hymns and chanted ``We Love You'' to
the ministers, who have affixed a small paper cross to the window of
their jail cell.
   ``Ted and Jim went to jail because they had no money for their
bail,'' they sang. `Be a hero, save a whale; save a baby, go to
jail.''
   ``Our main purpose is to show love and support for the two
pastors,'' said Patricia Bainbridge, a spokeswoman for the Western
New York Clergy Council of Project Rescue, which has conducted
anti-abortion protests across the country.
   The Rev. Paul Schenck, co-chairman of the Clergy Council, said he
spoke with the ministers Saturday and said that, having had only
water twice daily, they ``sounded weak.''
   ``Both of them said they're quite cold,'' he said ``But their
spirits are very, very good.''
   Raul Russi, the administrator at the holding center, said the
men, who have refused all solid food, are being examined by doctors
every two days.
   ``The moment I feel I have a problem, I will go in front of a
judge and get a court order to force-feed them,'' said Russi.
   Schenck said he didn't thin the fast would continue to the point
where it was life-threatening.
   ``It's not a point of starvation to death. It's a fast,'' he said.
   A court appeal is planned for early this week, and the two
ministers told The Buffalo News on Sunday they would continue the
fast until they were released. The newspaper said Cadwallader has
dropped to 170 pounds from 190 pounds; Evans has dropped to 222 from
245.
   ``I'll go as long as the Lord wants me to,'' said Evans.

   A collection of 18th century pocket watches that
filled a case at the Baltimore Museum of Art has been stolen,
officials reported.
   The antique English pocket watches, valued at about $150,000, are
believed to have been stolen between 3:30 p.m. and 4:15 p.m.
Saturday, said Brenda Richardson, the museum's deputy director.
   She said the watches, most bequeathed to the museum in 1931, are
gold; many are enameled and a few decorated with diamonds or pearls,
although some have imitation jewelry.
   Ms. Richardson said she was optimistic about recovering them
``because there was physical evidence'' found by police and
``because there were a lot of people in the museum.''
   The display case in the European decorative arts gallery was
pried open. It had been ``very well secured,'' Ms. Richardson said.

<HEAD>Schools Drop Idea of Asking Pupils to Pretend To Be Criminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School officials have removed from a
workbook a page that asked elementary special education pupils to
pretend to be criminals.
   One youngster drew a picture of himself behind bars and wrote
that murder was his make-believe crime.
   The Fort Smith School District received a complaint about the
exercise, which was deemed of questionable usefulness and will not
be repeated, said deputy superintendent Johnny Owen.
   Owen said the assignment was only recently brought to the
district's attention. The workbook was distributed in October to
five special education pupils at Sunnymede Elementary School, he
said Friday.
   The deleted exercise read: ``Did you ever think about doing
something terrible? Pretend that you did it. Describe the crime you
committed, and make your own mug shot and fingerprints.''
   An adult found one youngster's drawing and response, and
questioned Sunnymede Principal Jane Wiswall about it. Ms. Wiswall
would not comment about the exercise Friday.
   The student, a third-grader, had drawn a picture of himself in
jail, looking forlorn with a cigarette dangling from his mouth.
Above the drawing, he listed his make-believe crime: ``Murder.'' It
was graded ``C.''
   The exercise was contained in a work called ``Anti-Coloring
Book-Pad 2,'' which encourages creative coloring and is used as a
supplemental text. No other assignments in the book were considered
offensive and the book will continue to be used, Owen said.
   The teacher who assigned the exercise will not be reprimanded,
Owen said.
   ``We (the school administration) agree this was not in good
judgment,'' he said. ``I think the publisher should not have put
that particular exercise in there.''
   A spokesman for the book's publisher, Scholastic Book Services of
New York, said Friday that the book is no longer published by the
company.

<HEAD>Venezuela Will Suspend Debt Payments Wednesday, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela this week will suspend
capital and interest payments on its private-sector debt, a banking
official was quoted as saying Sunday.
   Venezuelan Central Bank President Pedro Tinoco was quoted by the
newspaper El Nacional as saying it will stop making the payments on
Wednesday.
   Afterwards, he said, the South American nation's private-sector
debt will be renegotiated ``as a block'' together with Venezuela's
public sector's refinanced debt of $20.3 billion.
   In January, pressed by declining oil export revenue and shrinking
international monetary reserves, Venezuela suspended principal
payments over its public sector's debt.
   Officials of the new social democratic government that took power
in early February have held preliminary contacts with creditor banks
to reschedule the country's refinanced debt over a period of 20-25
years, up from current 14 years, fixed interest rates and a grace
period of six to eight years.
   Venezuela owes a total of $33 billion abroad and ranks fourth
among Latin American debtors after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   The private sector's debt had been regularly served so far and
the decision afects $472 million in principal due this year.
   Under current agreements, Venezuela was to pay private sector
obligations over the next three years, Tinoco said. ``It is not
convenient to the nation to repay it in three years. We will place
it as part of the ongoing renegotiation process (with foreign
creditors),'' he said.
   In total, Venezuela paid last year more than $5 billion to its
creditors.
   There were no immediate comments on the decision from the private
sector or from banks, but when it was unofficially disclosed on
Thursday some said such a move was expected given the new
government's hardening stand on foreign debt problems.
   Tinoco said part of the Venezuelan strategy with its creditors
points at reducing the nation's total debt by buying part of it at
the secondary markets. There it is rated at less than a half its
face value.
   ``We are studying a series of concrete and realistic
possibilities,'' he said without elaborating.
   The official announcement over the private sector debt came as
the nation is negotiating an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund that will allow Venezuela financial support from the
multilateral institution and fresh loans from creditor banks.

   A Roman Catholic archbishop has been given a
helicopter, but his plan to use it to travel in the
8,300-square-mile Archdiocese of Los Angeles has brought out safety
concerns and criticism of the expense.
   Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, who earned a helicopter pilot's
license last summer, wants to use the $395,000 Hughes 389D for
visits in his archdiocese, which sprawls over Los Angeles, Ventura
and Santa Barbara counties.
   The 7-year-old helicopter was donated by a group organized by Los
Angeles lawyer Richard J. Riordan, a close friend of the archbishop.
The gift includes maintenance, operating costs and insurance.
   Several Catholic high schools and two seminaries have been
directed to prepare landing pads, and landing rights are being
sought downtown. Mahony, whose 53rd birthday is Monday, lives
downtown at St. Vibiana's Cathedral.
   The gift has been criticized by advocates for the poor.
   ``The problems and needs of the homeless ... and the refugee and
immigrant populations far exceed what is being done by the
diocese,'' said Catherine Morris, a spokeswoman for the Catholic
Worker organization. ``If he is going to set a good example, he'd
say `Thank you very much' and give it back.''
   The gift also has generated concern among some aviation experts
because of the skill needed to fly a helicopter and the complexity
of Southern California airspace.
   Insurance restrictions prevent Mahony from flying alone, so an
instructor will fly with him. But some pilots said a novice at the
controls of a helicopter might not be a good idea in Los Angeles'
crowded skies.
   ``He could be asking for a lot of trouble,'' said Capt. James
Kelly, a Navy chaplain who is licensed to fly a helicopter and also
holds a commercial pilot's license and instructor certificate.
   ``Flying a helicopter is no easy task. He has a lot to offer the
church and it might be better for him to just get a driver and sit
and do his work in the back of the car.''
   Mahony would not comment. A news conference about the helicopter
was scheduled for Tuesday, said David Moore, executive director of
communications for the archdiocese.
   Elsewhere in the United States, the dioceses of Anchorage and
Fairbanks, Alaska, and Gallup, N.M., own airplanes used by bishops
and priests to cover expansive, rugged terrain.

<HEAD>Soviet-Born Israeli Indicted For Passing Secrets to PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet-born Israeli who allegedly gave
military secrets to the Palestine Liberation Organization and asked
for $1.5 million in return was indicted Sunday before a Tel Aviv
court, Israel radio reported.
   The indictment accused Binyamin Shenkman, 35, of giving PLO
officials in Athens secret information on the Israeli army during
three trips to Greece in 1988, the radio said.
   He also offered to fly to PLO headquarters in Tunis and hold a
press conference where he would answer questions on Israel's
military capabilities and publically tear up his Israeli passport,
it said.
   Shenkman demanded $1.5 million from the PLO in return for his
actions, the radio said. But he was never paid and police arrested
him at the airport when he returned from Athens.
   The radio said Shenkman moved to Israel from the Soviet Union in
1978 and served in the army for four months in 1985.
   Details of the information disclosed by Shenkman and his role in
the military have been banned from publication.
   It is unusual, however, for a new immigrant who has served only a
short time in the military to be given a position in which he works
with sensitive information.
   The radio had previously quoted Shenkman, whose name was first
released Sunday, as saying his actions were motivated in part by his
disillusionment with Israel after immigrating.
   ``I ask that you take into consideration that all my life I only
wanted to come to Israel, and here I suffered.'' the radio quoted
Shenkman as telling the court after he his arrest.
   ``There were people who embittered my life every day and each
hour,'' he said. The radio did not elaborate.
   The court has not yet set a date for Shenkman's trial.
   A 1986 law bans unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist
group. Israel views the PLO as a such a group.
   Charges of espionage carry a maximun 30-year prison sentence.
   Shenkman's is the second case of alleged espionage involving a
Soviet emigre. On Dec. 15, Shabtai Kalmanovich, 45, was sentenced to
nine years in prison on charges of spying for the Soviet Union and
having contacts with a foreign agent.

<HEAD>Tower Takes On Allegations of Drinking and Womanizing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was an extraordinary live TV exchange _ a
prominent former senator taking on direct allegations that he was a
``common ... drunk'' and womanizer.
   Especially so, for a Sunday morning ``talk show.''
   By the time it was over, John Tower had acknowledged a fondness
for Scotch whisky 12 years ago, but said he was never an alcoholic,
has imbibed only modestly in recent years and promised not to take a
single drink if he wins confirmation as secretary of defense.
   He challenged his interrogators to define ``womanizer.''
   One of them, a woman, countered only that women know one when
they see one.
   At any rate, Tower declined to extend his tee-total pledge to
women.
   ``I am a single man,'' he protested when asked to say whether he
would do so.
   All this from one of the president's closest advisers _ a man
formerly referred to in U.S. Senate jargon as ``my distinguished
colleague,'' a former arms-control negotiator and appointee to
presidential commissions.
   The exchange Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley''
marked Tower's debut in his uphill fight to win full Senate
confirmation as President Bush's defense secretary.
   He later made the same presentation on Cable News Network.
   Tower said at the start of the ABC program that he was happy to
be able to ``break my silence'' on the character allegations that
have swirled around him since his nomination. The Senate Armed
Services Committee, which he once chaired as a senator from Texas,
recommended against his confirmation on Thursday.
   Sunday's television interview by ABC's Sam Donaldson, George Will
and Cokie Roberts quickly bore into the nitty-gritty details of his
personal life.
   Tower did not shrink from it.
   Donaldson asked him about, ``to put it rather inelegantly, the
charge that you're a common, or uncommon, drunk.''
   In response, Tower read a doctor's letter testifying that his
liver ``shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or
alcoholism'' and that there appeared no alcohol-related impairment
to his being defense secretary.
   He went on to make a formal pledge he said he hopes will remove
the main obstacle to his confirmation:
   ``Let me state that I have never been an alcoholic nor dependent
on alcohol. However, to allay any fears or doubts on this matter, I
hereby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the course of
my tenure as secretary of Defense, I will not consume beverage
alcohol of any type or form, including wine, beer or spirits of any
kind.''
   Will told him, ``It is fairly well on the record that at one
point in the 70s, you drank more than even you think you should
have.''
   Tower: ``Oh, yes. I did.''
   Will: ``Was there a point prior to this pledge ... at which you
... could point to and say, `There, I changed.'''
   Tower: ``Yes. Twelve years, I gave up spirits. I used to be a
pretty good scotch drinker. And I gave up, I haven't tasted scotch
in 12 years.
   ``After that, I had only wine. Had perhaps an occasional martini,
occasionally a little vodka with smoked salmon or caviar or
something like that. But that was just occasionally. I really
essentially have been a wine drinker. And now, my only consumption
is wine at meals. I don't drink wine even unless I'm eating.''
   Talk later returned to the pledge when Donaldson said: ``By
making that pledge today, it seems to me you're admitting you have a
drinking problem.''
   Tower: ``I anticipated that question, Sam, because, in vetting
this with some of my friends, they said that's the spin that would
be put on it. ... I said in the statement that I am not an alcoholic
nor have I ever been dependent on alcohol.''
   Donaldson: ``Then why would you make a pledge when you say
there's no reason to?''
   Tower: ``Well, why not make it? It's a small thing to do to allay
doubts and fears. ...''
   Donaldson: ``If you say there's no reason to do it. ... Now, when
allegations are raised that you're a womanizer, should you take a
pledge not to go out with women?''
   Tower: ``I'm a single man. I do date women. ... I've been a
single man for 3{ years.''
   Donaldson persisted.
   ``What is your definition of `womanizing,' Sam?'' Tower asked at
one point. ``Womanize is a broad term. What is your definition of
the term?''
   Donaldson: ``I don't know.''
   Tower: ``Well, all right ... Cokie, do you have a definition of
the term?''
   Roberts: ``Well, I think most women have a _ know it when they
see it, Senator.''
   Tower: ``But, you still can't define it.''
   Subsequently encountering a group of reporters off camera, Tower
said he could live with the scrutiny that ultimately forced former
Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado out of last year's presidential race.
   Asked in light of his alcohol pledge if he would invite reporters
to follow him as did Hart amid rumors he was unfaithful to his wife,
Tower replied, ``Look. A secretary of defense lives in a goldfish
bowl. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, they can.''

<HEAD>British Withdrawal Closes Another Chapter in War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last three British minehunters in the
Persian Gulf leave for home Monday, closing another chapter in the
Western naval commitment to protect shipping lanes during the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Britain's Defense Ministry said Sunday in London that the HMS
Berkeley, HMS Chiddingfold and HMS Cottesmore would take about three
weeks to reach their home port of Rosyth, near Edinburgh, Scotland.
   HMS Herald, an ocean survey ship serving as support vessel for
the mine-clearing trio, left earlier this month and another
auxiliary ship, HMS Diligence, will depart with the minehunters, the
ministry said.
   The withdrawal, first announced more than a month ago, was
unrelated to a renewed call by the Soviet Union during the weekend
for all foreign warships to leave the Persian Gulf now that a
cease-fire between Iraq and Iran has remained in effect for six
months.
   The minehunters' departure leaves the Royal Navy's ``Armilla
Patrol,'' consisting of three frigates and a support ship, to
represent British seapower in the gulf. Officials say there are no
plans to withdraw the patrol.
   It also leaves the United States virtually alone with the task of
further mine-clearing in the strategic waterway. U.S. officers
estimate there may still be as many as 150 to 200 mines laid by both
sides in the gulf.
   Six wooden-hulled U.S. minesweepers, dispatched to the gulf in
late 1987 and still on duty, are the last foreign ships based in the
waterway equipped to deal with mines.
   The Iranian navy claims it has cleared Iran's coastal waters, but
these do not include the gulf's main shipping lanes, where the mine
threat was greatest.
   The mines occasionally break loose from their underwater moorings
and drift into shipping lanes.
   U.S. and British naval officers put little stock in the Iranian
claims because they do not believe the Iranian navy is equipped to
clear mines.
   Neither Iran nor Iraq is known to have offered to provide charts
of its minefields, particularly in the northern gulf.
   The United States and Britain were among seven Western countries
that sent warships to the gulf, or reinforced units already there,
in 1987 to protect shipping caught in the escalating ``tanker war,''
a spinoff of the Iran-Iraq conflict. The conflict included a spate
of incidents involving Iranian-laid mines.
   While foreign navies have been scaling back since Iran and Iraq
agreed to a truce Aug. 20, there were indications that the
withdrawal of British minehunters amounted to a policy reversal.
   William Waldegrave, Britain's Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, told a news conference in Saudi Arabia Oct. 23
that the anti-mine force was likely to have ``a continuing role for
a good many years.''
   During a visit to Iraq Saturday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Moscow was prepared to remove its forces.
   His remarks were seen as aimed chiefly at the United States,
which has reduced its force by four warships since the cease-fire
but still has 23 in the region, including 14 in the gulf.
   U.S. officials say that while force size is tailored to the
threat at any given time, the United States intends to continue its
40-year naval presence in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>WASH: a moment.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MR. DONALDSON: We're back with former Senator John Tower.
Senator, let's go back to your relationship with the defense
industry. Now, you were a consultant for them for about two years,
we've discussed that. A lot of people wonder whether coming back to
the Pentagon and trying to cut the budget and take a hard look at
overruns and other abuses of defense contracting, whether you're the
right man to do it. They say, you're in the defense industry's
pocket.
   SEN. TOWER: Well, that's an allegation that is untrue. I am not
in the defense industry's pocket. Let me point out one thing: any
suggestion that I would be inordinately influenced by the industry
falls on the basis of my past record and performance.
   When I was chairman of the president's special review board, the
so-called ``Tower Commission,'' at the time I was asked to be
chairman of that, I was no more loyal to anybody than Ronald Reagan.
I was enormously loyal to him. And yet, I did my work objectively
and thoroughly, along with my two colleagues on that commission. And
I think I received universal approval from the mass media on my
objectivity, and the critical nature of that report.
   Now, to suggest that I'm going to be inordinately loyal to people
that I have no connection with, had no particular loyalty to in the
first place, except to the extent that I was bound to give them my
best judgment on issues.
   MR. DONALDSON: Do you think _
   SEN. TOWER: I think my past performance and my proven record of
integrity in public office speaks for itself. And I don't think I
have to apologize for it.
   MR. DONALDSON: Do you think you need to recuse yourself?
   SEN. TOWER: No, no _ well, I've already said I would recuse
myself on issues of suspension or disbarment, and that's enormously
important. The law doesn't even require me to do that. Now, if you
follow the Nunn-Warner criteria for what you want in a Defense
Department official, not just the secretary of defense, but
subordinate officials in the Department of Defense _ the deputy, the
undersecretary for acquisition _ it says they should be people
experienced in defense.
   And they anticipate, and I think Senator Nunn has said, that we
expect to get people out of industry. Now, my deputy who's coming
on, Don Atwood from General Motors, presided over Hughes Aviation,
which is a part of the General Motors complex. Now, is he to be
considered inordinately influenced by the defense industry? Now,
you're going to have to go back and rewrite the Nunn-Warner criteria.
   You have to bring people out of industry. People who've been in
industry, as long as they're people of honesty and integrity, who
know the process, are the ones best qualified to save you money, to
make sure that your acquisition procedures are efficient and
economical and honest.
   MR. WILL: Senator, I have two questions, one political and one
personal. On the political question, you've counted a lot of votes
in the Senate, and you must be looking at the Senate now. Are you
going to win? And do you assume, in doing so, that you're going to
get 45 Republican votes?
   SEN. TOWER: I think I have to follow Senator Dole's assessment of
that, and that is that the Republicans will stick by me. I have many
friends among the Democrats. And I think that I have removed the
principal cause for concern here today that most of them have
expressed. I think, as you note, a lot of the members of the
committee itself said that they were inclined to support me _
Senator Glenn said so earlier on this show _ until this concern was
raised.
   So, removing this concern I think gives me an opportunity, not
only to pick up Democrats off the committee, but to pick up
Democrats on the committee. I hope that it will be accepted by
Senator Nunn, that he would change his mind. Senator Nunn and I
agree for the most part on most policy issues and I think we'll have
a very good working relationship.
   MR. WILL: This can't have been any fun for you the last three
months. Have you ever, just as a human interest side of this story,
have you ever decided that this is too much cost to you or your
family and you'd like to get out?
   SEN. TOWER: It's already been costly to my family. Every time a
new allegation appeared on television that I was keeping a Soviet
ballerina in an apartment in River Oaks in Houston and off the wall
stuff like this, I would get calls from my daughters in virtual
tears. I have three daughters. And they'd call me on a daily basis.
This has been enormously difficult for them.
   It's also been difficult for people that I've been associated
with who have been trampled in the rush to get at me. I think some
innocent people have suffered. Some women on my staff have suffered
and unjustly so. So, that's also been a difficult thing for me to
bear because when people go after you, very often, they don't care
if they trample a few innocent people in the process and that's been
done in this case.
   MS. ROBERTS: But Senator, it's your own former committee. Why do
you think it's happening to you?
   SEN. TOWER: Well, I think it's because of the honest concerns
raised by Senator Nunn. I really think I answered that question
earlier. Most of the Democrats said they were inclined to vote for
me earlier. But because of the concerns raised by the chairman, they
changed their minds. And there is that loyalty to the chairman.
   So I think that as we progress with this, I would like to see the
level of the rhetoric lowered, I'd like to see it cooled off. I've
always had a good relationship with Sam Nunn. And I think we can
restore confidence in the Pentagon with solid Pentagon cooperation,
not only with Senator Nunn, but with other appropriate leaders and
committees of the Congress. And I think having been through this,
that it will go a long way toward restoring public confidence if I
have proven my ability to cooperate.
   MR. WILL: Senator, you were warmly recommended to the committee
by Senator Bentsen. Do you think that an inference from that is that
he may be one of your supporters?
   SEN. TOWER: I'm not going to try to predict how any individual
senator can _ will vote. Senator Bentsen and I worked together for
14 years in the Senate, and although we are of differing _ different
parties, we never had a cross word with each other, and always in
the interests of our state and the nation, we cooperated.
   MR. DONALDSON: Senator _
   SEN. TOWER: So, I don't know how he'll vote, but he obviously,
from his presentation, felt at the time he made that presentation
that I was highly qualified.
   MR. DONALDSON: Senator, going back to your no drinking pledge. If
you're confirmed, what's the penalty? If you should take a drink as
secretary of defense, would you think that you should then resign?
   SEN. TOWER: I think I'd be obliged to resign if I broke a pledge.
I've never broken a pledge in my life.
   MR. DONALDSON: All right. Thank you very much, Senator Tower. We
do appreciate your coming in here today.

<TEXT>
   Romanian officials frequently resort to
beatings and imprisonments to prevent workers from forming
independent trade unions, a report by a worldwide labor organization
said Monday.
   The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions said it was
sending its 20-page report on Romania's labor strife to the
International Labor Organization, the U.N. labor arm.
   The report said police arrested three of 34 people who discussed
setting up an independent union at an arms plant in Zarnesti on June
26, 1988. The three were dismissed from the plant and two of them
were beaten while in detention, it added.
   The labor group said this occurred less than a year after police
used force to end a rally by students in Brasov in support of a
strike at a plant there a week earlier.
   The report also expresses concern about the treatment, including
long prison sentences in recent years, for 20 people who sought
support for better working and living conditions in Romania.
   ``Imprisonment, beatings, disappearances, discrimination and
dismissals are among the arsenal of repressive measures used by the
Romanian authrities in their dealings with free trade unionists,''
the labor group's secretary-general, John Vanderveken, said in a
letter to the U.N. organization.
   The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions is a
coalition of 87 million workers in 141 affiliated organizations
worldwide.

   A ruckus over the government's
decision to let actor Chuck Norris build a beachfront mansion here
is one of the campaign issues in Monday's parliamentary elections.
   Parliament consists of only nine seats in this tiny British
Caribbean colony.
   Opposition parties accuse the governing Anguilla National
Alliance of breaking its own policy of prohibiting foreigners from
owning more than half an acre of residential property on this
35-square mile island inhabited by 7,000 people.
   Norris, a frequent visitor, bought three quarters of an acre on
the island's west side in 1985 and built a holiday mansion there.
   Chief Minister Emile Gumbs, whose party has a six-seat majority,
argues that the martial arts movie star's real estate on the island
is a tourist attraction. Tourism is Anguilla's main industry.
   Meanwhile, all politicians agree not to make an issue of
Anguillans' resentment of their London-appointed governor's
excessive powers, fearing it would fan the flames of something they
all oppose: independence.
   Though in practice the island's daily affairs are handled mostly
by parliament, Gov. Geoffrey Whitaker has veto power over the
decisions of Anguilla's elected leaders.
   British authorities in the past have said islanders must either
accept the status quo or opt for independence, which most of them
oppose.
   Opposition groups running in Monday's vote are the United Party,
which controls two seats, the Democratic Party with one seat and the
tiny Party for Anguilla's Culturation and Economy.

   Miners in Kosovo province decided
Sunday to continue their strike until they receive written
assurances that three regional Communist Party officials will
resign, the state news agency said.
   More than 1,000 miners, most of them Albanians, at the Trepca
lead and zinc mine have been striking since Monday to press for
changes in the regional leadership and to protest the Serbian
Republic's plans for greater control of Kosovo, one of its two
autonomous provinces.
   After intensive bargaining Saturday night and Sunday, the miners
decided to continue their strike until they receive written
assurances that Kosovo Communist Party leader Rahman Morina and two
other local officials, Husamedin Azemi and Ali Sukrija, will step
down, the Tanjug news agency said.
   The three leaders, ethnic Albanians, are considered by the miners
to be pro-Serbian politicians.
   Earlier in the day, Bashkim Hisari, a Kosovo party presidium
member, told reporters that the miners' requests would be discussed
``in a tolerant dialogue'' if they leave their mine at Titova
Mitrovica, 125 miles south of Belgrade.
   Tanjug said at least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical
assistance, and one was reported in critical condition.
   Ilijaz Nimani, 42, one of the hospitalized miners, told Tanjug
that ``When I recover I will join my comrades in the pits. We plan
to stay there until we die because the Albanians are losing their
rights.''
   He said Serbian authorities want to close Albanian-language
schools and the university in the province, where ethnic Albanians
are a majority.
   A striking miner was quoted by Radio Belgrade Sunday as saying:
``I prefer to die in the pit than at home.''
   ``If nothing is resolved, we have our plans,'' the miner added.
He refused to elaborate.
   Riza Muslimi, a spokesman for the striking miners, said Saturday
they had stashed two tons of explosives underground, but he would
not say whether they intended to use them to demolish the shaft if
their demands were not met.
   The protesters have condemned Serbia's drive to gain greater
control over Kosovo by changing the constitution, fearing they would
lose the wide autonomy granted to them in 1974.
   The constitutional change would give Serbia greater control over
Kosovo and its other province, Vojvodina, and increase its powers
over defense and state security. The proposed change was approved by
Serbia on Thursday, but the amendments must also be approved by the
provincial assemblies.
   Serbian leaders say they must have more control in Kosovo to
protect the mainly Christian Slav minority from alleged persecution
by predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of
the province's population.
   In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in
Pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial
officials as demanded by Serbia's leaders.
   Tanjug said Yugoslav leaders have told the protesters the
proposed constitutional changes do not mean a reduction of Kosovo's
autonomy.

<HEAD>Country Singer Plans to Keep Career Alive Behind Bars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORIENT, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnny Paycheck, famous for singing of the
working man's hard times, said he wants to continue his country
music career behind bars.
   Paycheck, who is serving a seven- to 9{-year sentence for
shooting a man in a southern Ohio bar, said he may write songs in
prison and record an album. But he said none of the songs will be
about the Dec. 19, 1985, shooting.
   ``I will probably never write about shooting that man because it
is something I want to forget,'' Paycheck said in an interview
published Sunday in The Columbus Dispatch.
   Paycheck, 50, was convicted on May 9, 1986, of assault in the
shooting of Larry Wise.
   Wise survived the gunshot, which grazed his head, and is suing
Paycheck for $600,000 in damages.
   Paycheck began serving his sentence this month after the Ohio
Supreme Court rejected a motion to block sentencing on technical
grounds. He will not be eligible for parole for at least five years
and eight months.
   Paycheck, best remembered for his 1978 hit ``Take This Job and
Shove It,'' is in the Orient Correctional Reception Center near
Columbus. He said he wants to record an album with other inmate
musicians and use the money to help pay medical bills for his wife,
who has cancer.
   ``We didn't have no insurance,'' he said. ``I have attorney
bills, doctor bills. When I had the money and I could have put it
away, I didn't have much sense.''

   Soldiers shot and killed an Arab during a tax
collection raid Sunday, and a masked Palestinian shot and wounded a
hospital official suspected of collaborating with the Israelis, army
and Arab reports said.
   Another Palestinian man was reported wounded in a clash between
soldiers and stone-throwers at a refugee camp.
   The army began enforcing a new policy requiring Gaza Strip
Palestinians to buy special stickers for their cars to drive into
Israel. A military spokesman said the practice will bar several
hundred of about 25,000 Arab-owned vehicles from Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the Cabinet he saw no need to
``rush into'' devising a Middle East peace plan before he visits
Washington for talks with President Bush in April, Israel radio
reported.
   Shamir spoke during a review of his meetings last week with
French leaders in Paris and talks in Egypt between Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Israeli counterpart, Moshe
Arens.
   The meetings failed to break a deadlock over Israel's rejection
of Soviet proposals for an international peace conference and for
direct negotiations with the PLO.
   In Jewish West Jerusalem, suspected Palestinian nationalists
stoned a bus in the center of the city, wounding one Israeli, Israel
radio said. Police detained a 16-year-old suspect for questioning.
   In Israel, police uncovered a seven-member squad of Palestinians
who belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a radical group headed by Ahmed Jibril,
the radio reported.
   The squad lived in Arab villages inside Israel. The group had
cameras and electronic equipment, but details of their activities
are banned from publication.
   In Gaza City in the crowded seaside Gaza Strip, toops shot and
killed 20-year-old Ahmed Abed Muharram when stone-throwing youths
confronted tax collectors during a raid at a Palestinian home, Arab
reports said. Withholding of taxes has been a frequently used tactic
during the uprising.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   The death raised to 386 the number of Palestinians killed in the
revolt against the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West
Bank. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died.
   Also in Gaza City, a masked Palestinian walked into the
government-run Shifa Hospital and shot deputy director Abdel Rauf
Hilles in the head for being a suspected collaborator, Arab reports
said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the shooting and said Hilles was
transferred to an Israeli hospital.
   The national Itim News Agency said Hilles, 35, was in charge of
security at Shifa, and Israel radio said he personally guarded an
Israeli medical officer.
   At least 60 Arabs killed during the uprising have been slain by
fellow Palestinians who suspect them of collaborating with Israeli
officials, said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   The other wounding in Gaza involved a 30-year-old man shot in the
wrist during a clash in Shati refugee camp, Arab reports said.
   The car sticker policy requires Palestinians to have their police
records checked before they can purchase a sticker. A military
spokesman said each sticker costs 10 shekels, about $5.50. The
average monthly wage for Palestinians is 400 to 500 shekels.
   Arab reporters said stickers will be denied Palestinians who have
not paid taxes.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers arrested dozens of
suspects during searches for the Palestinian who killed Israeli
reserve Sgt. Binyamin Meisner, the radio said.
   Meisner died Friday when someone dropped a concrete block on his
head.
   Arab reports said troops blew up a house near the site of the
attack and a room in an adjacent house. A third home in the area was
sealed shut, the reports said.
   Soldiers maintained a curfew on most of Nablus' 120,000 residents
for a third straight day.
   Dr. Amir Al-Masri, an obstetrician at Al Ittihad Hospital, said
the curfew prevented most of the medical staff from reporting to
work and that only 24 doctors and nurses out of 145 arrived Sunday.
   Al-Masri also said the hospital lacked fresh meat and vegetables
to feed its patients. Only one of four ambulances was permitted to
operate, other Arab reports said.
   Military sources denied the reports and said doctors are allowed
free access to the area, despite the curfew. They added that there
are no shortages of food in the city.

   The publisher of ``The Satanic Verses'' is willing
to talk with Moslems and would consider canceling the paperback
edition to defuse the controversy over the novel, a newspaper said
Sunday.
   Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in Lebanon and Iran in
support of Ayathollah Ruhollah Khomeini's demand that the book's
British author, Salman Rushdie, be killed.
   A man claiming to represent an Arab group said the furor over the
novel could delay the release of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Rushdie has been in hiding, reportedly under police guard in
Britain, since Khomeini issued his death sentence Feb. 14.
   Viking Penguin published the hardcover edition of ``The Satanic
Verses'' in Britain in September, and the paperback edition is due
out in fall. Some say the book insults Islam.
   The Sunday Times of London said Viking Penguin might rule out a
paperback version if British Moslems call off their protest and try
to persuade Islamic nations to do the same.
   Penguin also is willing to consider labeling the remaining unsold
hardcover copies with a warning that says the book is a work of
fiction, the newspaper reported, without citing sources.
   Efforts to reach the publishers failed Sunday, as offices were
closed and no one answered the telephone.
   British writers at a Writers Guild seminar in London unanimously
supported Rushdie on Sunday. ``We call upon world opinion to support
the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs,'' the
group said in a statement.
   ``We request all world leaders to continue to repudiate the
threats made against Salman Rushdie and his publishers, and to take
firm action to ensure that these threats are withdrawn,'' it said.
   The Council for Mosques in Bradford, home of Britain's largest
Moslem population, called for a boycott of all Viking Penguin
publications at a meeting Sunday.
   More than 60,000 Moslems live in the northern England community,
where demonstrators have burned copies of Rushdie's book.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India,
apologized for any distress his novel caused, but Khomeini rejected
the apology.
   About 5,000 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of Rushdie
during a march in Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday.
   Leading the march were 20 members of Hezbollah, or Party of God,
who wore white death shrouds inscribed in English and Arabic, ``We
are ready to kill Rushdie.''
   Shiite suicide squads usually don death robes before going out on
missions.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is believed to be the parent
organization of Shiite factions that hold most of the 15 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   In the ancient eastern Lebanon city of Baalbek, protesters
carried banners signed ``Islamic Jihad,'' or Islamic holy war, in
support of the death threat.
   Islamic Jihad is a Shiite group holding two American hostages,
including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. The longest-held hostage, he was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   A man claiming to speak for a previously unknown group, ``The
Islamic Revolutionary Force in the World,'' said the furor over
``The Satanic Verses'' and the West's angry reaction to Khomeini's
death threat will delay the release of the hostages.
   There was no way to authenticate the claim, made by an anonymous
caller who telephoned a Western news agency in Beirut.
   The man, who spoke Arabic, said the group had ordered its members
to assassinate Rushdie between Feb. 27 and March 15.
   Tehran television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstrated
in the Iranian holy city of Qom, chanting ``We are at your service
Khomeini'' and ``Death to America!''
   In London, a Moslem leader denied reports his mosque was being
used as a base to train Moslems in terrorist attacks. A senior
Middle Eastern diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, made
the allegation Saturday and said the training was under way at
Islamic cultural centers in Bradford, Leicester, Manchester and
London.
   The chief imam at the Manchester Central Mosque, Ahmad Nasar Beg
said: ``I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.''
   Many Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives
of the prophet Mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the
Koran, the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from God.

   Firefighters drove bulldozers and other
heavy equipment Sunday into a tire dump fire to keep the blaze from
spreading, and residents near the dump began returning to their
homes.
   About 200 families were evacuated Saturday night and authorities
allowed them to return home Sunday. But residents were advised to
stay indoors to avoid the dense chemical smoke.
   Officials said the fire was likely to burn for several days, but
Harold Tompkins, president of the Catskill fire company, said he
thought the fire was contained.
   The cause of the fire was unknown.
   The dump holds about 2 million tires, and about half of them
caught fire. The bulldozers were used to separate the mounds of
tires. Smoke from the blaze could be seen 40 miles north in Albany.
   Federal officials tested air samples and determined there was no
immediate health threat, said Tom June, chief of the Catskill fire
company.

   Tufts University has withdrawn investments
in companies that do business in South Africa, except for those
involved with communications and humanitarian endeavors.
   The decision was reached Saturday during a board of trustees
meeting and was approved by both faculty and students. Under the
action, Tufts will withdraw investments of approximately $5 million
from U.S. companies. The school has a total investment portfolio of
about $120 million.
   In 1986, Tufts students staged demonstrations against the
apartheid policies of the white South African government. Students
built a shantytown and held a sit-in demonstration.
   Tufts University President Jean Mayer said, ``The fact we decided
to change policy doesn't mean we were wrong 10 years ago. It just
means things have changed.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, calling the United
States ``a faithful friend and a dependable ally'' of South Korea,
said Monday he has no plans to reduce U.S. troops stationed in this
strife-torn nation, the last stop on a whirlwind five-day Asian tour.
   ``They will remain in the Republic of Korea as long as they are
needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace,''
Bush said in remarks prepared for a speech to the National Assembly.
   Bush arrived at a private military airfield amid unusually
stringent security because of a rash of recent anti-American
demonstrations. The president made no mention of the often-violent
protests in his prepared remarks, but focused on the history of the
U.S. military presence that Korean radicals want removed.
   Bush headed here after a two-day visit to China, whose troops
fought on the side of North Korea in that 1950s conflict.
   In 1950, when North Korean forces invaded the south, ``without
hesitation or delay, American and U.N. forces rushed to your aid.
Together, Americans and Koreans fought side-by-side for your right
to determine your own future,'' Bush said.
   ``I remember the devastation of your country. Your cities lay in
rubble. Your factories were in shambles. Millions of your people
wandered the streets homeless and hungry.''
   While in Beijing, the president stressed new, much-improved U.S.
relations with China. But his upbeat visit was marred by harassment
of a leading dissident.
   The dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, said his efforts to
attend a farewell banquet hosted by Bush were repeatedly frustrated
by police, even though he and his wife had been invited by the
president.
   White House officials said Monday that Bush voiced regret over
the incident just before leaving China.
   Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush headed to
Seoul, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
``expressed regret'' over the incident in a brief chat with the
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xueqian at the Beijing airport just before
boarding his plane.
   Fitzwater said Bush did not learn of the incident until Monday
morning. He said that Bush also asked Winston Lord, the U.S.
ambassador to China, to get ``full details'' of the incident.
   Fitzwater also said Bush felt that ``quiet diplomacy'' was the
best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders.
``The president feels that the visit was successful,'' Fitzwater
said. But he added that ``there are problems on both sides, of
course.''
   South Korea's capital has been buffeted in recent weeks by
violent anti-American demonstrations as radical students demanded
that the U.S. bases be moved.
   A security force 120,000-strong was mobilized to guard Bush
during his five-hour visit against threats, both from student
radicals and from North Korean commandos.
   In his speech, Bush likened the Korean National Assembly to the
U.S. Congress, ``full of noise, contention and emotion.''
   ``But that is the sound of democracy at work,'' he said.
``Throughout, let our close economic and strategic relationship
remain as it is _ a pillar of peace in East Asia.''
   But, while calling Korea a ``world class economic power,'' Bush
cited recent trade frictions between the two nations.
   He called on South Korea to do more to lower its barriers to U.S.
products, citing the large U.S. trade deficit with the nation and
declaring: ``Protectionism is fool's gold.''
   However, the main thrust of the president's remarks dealt with
U.S. troops.
   ``Our most important mission together is to maintain the freedom
and democracy you fought so hard to win,'' he said.
   ``I have come here today as the leader of a faithful friend and a
dependable ally...There are no plans to reduce U.S. forces in
Korea.''
   ``Our soldiers and airmen are there at the request of the
Republic of Korea and their presence contributes to the peace and
stability of northeast Asia.''
   At the same time, Bush voiced support for South Korean President
Roh Tae-Woo's ``peaceful initiatives...to build bridges to the
North.''
   Earlier, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said,
``There's been a lot of unrest. There's been an anti-American tone
to some of it.''
   ``One of the reasons the president is going there is to reassure
the South Koreans of our support for their moves toward democracy
and of the firmness of our strategic relationships,'' Scowcroft said.
   Of the incident involving the Chinese dissident, Scowcroft said,
``The president, of course, would hope that all of his guests would
be allowed to attend'' the U.S.-hosted banquet.
   Fang, holding a news conference in the hotel filing center used
by reporters covering Bush's visit, said the car he was riding in
was stopped by police several blocks from the banquet site.
   Then, he said, another officer prevented him from walking to the
site and when he attempted to get to the U.S. embassy to complain,
his taxi was stopped and buses were prevented from picking him up.
   Holding his invitations aloft, he declined to directly criticize
Bush for not raising human rights issues in his talks with Chinese
leaders. But, he said, the United States shouldn't hold China to a
lesser standard than it holds the Soviet Union.
   ``I've thought many times that democracy is a common concept all
over the world,'' he said.
   The event at issue was a banquet at which Bush served his guests
Texas barbecue.
   Presidential spokesman Roman Popadiuk said ``the issue of human
rights was not raised per se'' in Bush's talks.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the matter was
discussed on lower levels, including his own talks with China's
foreign minister.
   ``It hasn't been done with big public fanfare and a lot of noise.
Frankly we think that sometimes you make better progress with human
rights when it's done quietly and low-key,'' Baker said on CBS'
``Face The Nation.''
   ``I think the message got through loud and clear,'' he said.
   Although the president alluded to the subject in a speech at a
banquet Saturday night, most of his words in this capital have been
filled with praise for Chinese leaders.

   Police blocked China's leading dissident from
attending a banquet held by President Bush on Sunday. White House
officials said that Bush voiced regret over the incident just before
leaving the country.
   After preventing Fang Lizhi from attending a dinner that Bush
hosted at the Sheraton Great Wall Hotel, police tailed the dissident
for an hour and a half after ordering a taxi and a bus not to pick
him up.
   Bush had invited Fang, an internationally respected
astrophysicist, as a gesture of support for Chinese intellectuals
who have called for greater political freedom, White House officials
said.
   Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush headed to
Seoul, South Korea, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said that Bush ``expressed regret'' over the incident in a brief
chat at the Beijing airport just before the president boarded his
executive jet.
   Bush raised the issue with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, the
highest-ranking Chinese official to see the president off after
Bush's two-day visit.
   Fang was one of five human rights activists invited to the Bush
Texas-style barbecue dinner. The other four were allowed to attend.
   Fitzwater said that Bush did not learn of the incident until
Monday morning, just before he was to depart. He said that Bush also
asked Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China, to get ``full
details'' of the incident.
   Fitzwater also said that Bush felt that ``quiet diplomacy'' was
the best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders.
``The president feels that the visit was successful,'' Fitzwater
said. But he added that ``there are problems on both sides, of
course.''
   Fang said in a telephone interview, ``This really shows China's
attitude toward human rights.''
   He described the police action as ``weak and scared'' and added,
``All I wanted to do was shake the hands of the president and Mrs.
Bush.''
   As the banquet ended, a reporter yelled, ``Mr. President, what
about human rights?'' Bush smiled but did not answer.
   White House National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said later,
``Well the president, of course, would hope that all of his guests
would be allowed to attend the dinner, of course.''
   The police action came about an hour after Communist Party leader
Zhao Ziyang said U.S. support of Chinese activism could harm
relations between the countries.
   Perry Link, director of the U.S. Academy of Sciences office in
Beijing, said he and his wife were driving Fang and his wife, Li
Shuxian, to the banquet when police stopped them several blocks away
for an alleged traffic violation.
   They walked to the hotel, but outside the entrance ``suddenly a
swarm of plainclothes policemen surrounded us, pulling Fang Lizhi
and his wife and me and my wife apart,'' Link said.
   He said the officers told Fang he was not on the guest list. The
official guest list distributed at the banquet included Fang's name.
   The couples then walked to a nearby hotel to get a taxi, but
police stopped the taxi from picking up the group and then flagged
down a bus and ordered it to drive by the four, Link said.
   The four walked an hour and a half to Lord's residence, and were
followed all the way by police, some plainclothes officers and
others in marked cars, Link said.
   A Canadian diplomat saw them outside the locked residence and
drove them to his home, Link said. ``I was astounded by the scope of
the net that had been put out for us,'' Link said.
   He said he discussed the problem with the U.S. Embassy, but
embassy officials denied Link spoke to them.
   Several hours later, Fang held an impromptu news conference at a
Beijing hotel. He refused to criticize Bush for not pressing Chinese
authorities to correct human rights abuses, saying, ``I have no
comment because he is just beginning.'' However, he said the United
States should not hold the Soviet Union to one human rights standard
and other countries to another.
   With his wife, Li Shuxian, by his side, Fang said he had no plans
to halt his calls for democracy. ``It's a normal thing to attend a
banquet, but the authorities here are afraid of even that,'' Fang
said, holding aloft his banquet tickets.
   Western diplomats said Chinese authorities had put ``heavy
pressure'' on Fang not to accept the banquet invitation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier that Fang was
invited ``as an astrophysicist, an outstanding person in his field,
and also because of his human rights stand.''
   He said it was unlikely Bush would have talked with Fang.
   Fang gained international prominence when he was blamed for
inciting pro-democracy student demonstrations that spread throughout
China in early 1986 and 1987.
   He was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from his job
as professor at an Anhui province university. He has since been
transferred to a job at the Beijing University observatory.
   In recent months, Fang has led a renewed movement among Chinese
intellectuals who want more democracy, greater artistic freedoms and
amnesty for political prisoners.
   Earlier, Zhao told Bush that Chinese advocates of Western-style
democracy could cause the nation's economic reforms to fail, and he
issued a warning about support in the United States for those
seeking political reforms in China.
   ``Some personages in American society who support those people
who are dissatisfied with the Chinese government will not contribute
to the stability of China's political situation and the undergoing
of China's reform, nor will it be conducive to the friendship
between China and the United States,'' Zhao was quoted as saying by
Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing.
   Playwright Wu Zuguang, a government critic who attended the
banquet without interference, said, ``We all think this whole
situation is very strange.''
   ``It's strange and it's stupid,'' muttered Su Shaozhi, a leading
Marxist theorist who has called for greater democracy and who also
attended the banquet.

<HEAD>Developer of Artificial Hip Joint Dies at 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Harry Gorman, the veterinarian who
helped develop the artificial hip joint for animals and humans and
also trained animals the United States sent into space has died at
the age of 72.
   Gorman, who retired in 1982 from the faculty of the Colorado
State University College of Veterinary medicine, died Friday at
Poudre Valley Hospital. No cause of death was disclosed.
   Gorman, a past president of the American Veterinary Medical
Association, designed the first artificial hip joint for dogs and
later adapted it for human use. He also helped develop ethics
classes in veterinary medicine at CSU.
   Gorman spent 22 years in the military, starting with the Army and
in 1946 heading the newly created Air Force's Veterinary Corps. He
retired in 1960 as a colonel.
   During World War II, he led a team of veterinarians who rescued
more than a million cattle from drowning in the Netherlands when
dikes destroyed by bombs let farmland flood.
   He received the Bronze Star, Legion of Merit and nine other
military decorations.
   In 1956, he joined the School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air
Force Base in San Antonio as chief of the veterinary division. There
he raised and trained the United States' first animals in space.
   A native of Colorado who earned his doctorate at CSU, Gorman
returned to the university in 1964, and did research there for the

   President Bush tried to tiptoe around human rights
problems in China, deciding not even to mention them, but they came
looking for him.
   On the final night of Bush's visit, China's leading dissident,
Fang Lizhi and his wife, were prevented by police from attending a
banquet hosted by the president. They tried to get there by car,
taxi and bus but were stopped at each point. Police cited minor
traffic violations and ultimately incorrectly informed the pair they
were not on the guest list.
   They had been invited as a gesture by Bush toward Chinese
intellectuals who are calling for greater political freedom.
   How did the White House react initially?
   Offering a mild mannered response, White House National security
adviser Brent Scowcroft said, ``Well the president, of course, would
hope that all of his guests would be allowed to attend the dinner,
of course.''
   But the White House reacted more strongly in private, according
to press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Talking to reporters as Bush headed to Seoul, Fitzwater said that
Bush ``expressed regret'' over the incident privately during a brief
chat at the Beijing airport with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.
   Fitzwater said that Bush did not learn of the incident until
Monday morning, just before he was to depart. He said that Bush also
asked Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China, to get ``full
details'' of the incident.
   Fitzwater also said that Bush felt that ``quiet diplomacy'' was
the best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders.
``The president feels that the visit was successful,'' Fitzwater
said. But he added that ``there are problems on both sides, of
course.''
   But it was clear from the beginning that Bush was not going to
make human rights a burning issue.
   On the day he flew to Beijing, Bush said he was not aware of
whether he was supposed to be carrying a list of human rights
concerns. He said he'd be briefed on the flight.
   ``Human rights was not discussed,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater reported later as Bush completed two days of talks
with senior Chinese leaders.
   Before he left Washington, Bush had received a letter from more
than 40 members of Congress asking him to raise several human rights
cases in Beijing.
   Moreoever, the State Department, long criticized as having its
eyes closed to Chinese repression in Tibet, recently joined in
worldwide protest over treatment of ethnic Tibetans.
   Bush told reporters Friday that ``both the Soviet Union and China
know of our commitment to human rights. And it is beholden on any
American president to reiterate our commitment to human rights.''
   Despite Fitzwater's statement about human rights not being
discussed, American and Chinese officials said the subject was
raised _ not by Bush but by Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of the
Communist Party.
   Furthermore Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday
that he discussed the topic in a meeting he had with the Chinese
foreign minister during the Beijing trip. He said on the CBS-TV
program ``Face the Nation'' that they had ``a good discussion.''
   As to why Soviet human rights, especially under President Reagan,
had received such pointed attention and official denouncements in
contrast to the comparatively muted approach to China, Baker denied
any double standard.
   He China had begun ``opening up'' its political system and with
respect to human rights ``a lot earlier than the Soviet Union did.''
   Zhao gave Bush what amounted to a lecture on the subject. His
message was to butt out.
   According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao updated
Bush about the country's high inflation, official corruption and
other problems. Zhao said that critics of the government's economic
policies were really trying to undo its political policies.
   By complaining about government reforms, the critics ``want to
walk backwards,'' Zhao said.
   ``We don't export our system to other countries nor do we copy
the system of other countries,'' the Chinese leader said. ``Probably
there are a number of people in the American press and the field of
public opinion who support those people in China who are calling for
the introduction of a multiparty political system.''
   Zhao told Bush that ``the realistic forces that promote Chinese
reform are the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The fact
that some personages in American society who support those people
who are dissastified with the Chinese government will not contribute
to the stability of China's political situation and China's reform.
   ``Nor will it be conducive to the friendship betwen China and the
United States, Zhao said.
   Throughout his stay, Bush seemed determined to stay away from
controversy and to underscore his friendship with China's leaders
from his days as a U.S. envoy in Beijing in 1974-75.
   Accentuating the positive, Bush said, ``When future generations
of Chinese and Americans look back upon this time, they'll say that
the winds of change blew favorably upon our lands.''
   Fang, the dissident who was barred from Bush's party, said he did
not feel that the United States should hold Beijing to a different
standard than Moscow on human rights.
   ``I've thought many times that democracy is a common concept all
over the world,'' Fang said Sunday night. ``Freedom of speech,
freedom of thinking _ that is the same everywhere. It should not
depend on location.''

<HEAD>Lifelong Saver Dies; Leaves $250,000 In Banks Across U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former bank employee and postal worker
who pinched pennies by living in YMCAs and spending as little as $6
a day on food died with $249,746 in eight banks across the country
and no apparent heirs.
   Howard Thomas Drummond's $49-a-week room at the Lansing YMCA had
no bathroom, and he bought three $1.99 breakfasts each morning,
saving two of them in a knapsack for later meals, those who knew him
recalled.
   While his raggedy clothes and miserly way of life kept his wealth
secret, Drummond apparently attended to his fortune, said Paul
Rosenbaum, the state-appointed lawyer handling Drummond's estate.
   Rosenbaum said Drummond, who was 77 when he died Jan. 28 in
Sparrow Hospital after suffering a stroke, has no known family, and
unless relatives are found, his money will go to Michigan's general
fund.
   ``To my knowledge he just wanted to live his life and be left
alone,'' Darnelle Jones, room manager at the YMCA, told the Lansing
State Journal in Sunday's editions. ``I think there were people that
looked at him and said, `That's too bad.' He said, `I'm fine.'''
   ``It looked like he came right out of the 1930s,'' said Vern
Wright, who works at the post office where Drummond had a post box.
``And that old hat he wore must have been 30 years old. He was
trying to wear it out.''
   Wright said postal workers always suspected Drummond had money
somewhere because they noticed mail from banks, and subscriptions to
Psychology Today, The Saturday Evening Post and Foreign Affairs.
   Other Lansing residents who knew of Drummond said he bought two
newspapers and always read the stock tables.
   According to notes found by Rosenbaum, Drummond held a job in a
bank in Pasadena, Calif., until being drafted in 1942. He was
honorably discharged from the Army in 1946 and returned to the bank,
where he was fired in 1956 after being accused of stealing tape and
other items, according to the notes.
   Rosenbaum said Drummond was hired by the U.S. Postal Service and
remained in Pasadena until he retired in 1973.
   He later moved to Denver, where he stayed until 1981, working in
the YMCA membership office. Then he began roaming the East Coast,
from YMCA to YMCA, opening up bank accounts along the way. In Denver
he left $67,074.57 when he died, and more than $23,000 in Boston,
Rosenbaum said.
   By the time he died, he was earning more than $20,000 a year in
interest and government pensions.
   Rosenbaum is searching for relatives, as well as other bank or
brokerage accounts across the nation. He said there may be more
money in undiscovered accounts.

   When political leaders arrived
at the Presidential Palace to report on their meeting with rebel
commanders, they found chief executive Jose Napoleon Duarte flanked
by his military advisers.
   The seating arrangement at Friday's encounter was no coincidence.
   The armed forces, which never took the rebels' ideas for this
year's presidential election at face value, demonstrated their
continued influence _ some would say domination _ in politics
throughout recent weeks.
   The proposal by leftist rebels to postpone the March 19
presidential election to allow them time to participate appeared
doomed by last weekend, though all involved hesitated to say so
publicly. None relished the stigma of spoiler.
   On Sunday night, Duarte made a counter offer, proposing to let
the Salvadoran people vote on whether to accept the rebels' offer.
He offered a cease-fire this week and a meeting between rebels and
the government.
   Speaking on nationwide radio and television, Duarte suggested
opening peace talks with the rebels starting Tuesday after immediate
agreement by the government and insurgents to a cease-fire.
   The guerrillas' plan represented a dramatic turnabout for rebels
waging a nine-year civil war against the U.S.-backed government.
   The guerrillas had boycotted, condemned and done all they could
to impede the five previous national elections this decade. They
contend elections have been part of a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency
project to provide a facade of democratic civilian rule over an
edifice of military repression.
   After the rebels made their proposal, the country's 13 political
parties sent representatives to two days of talks to discuss it with
four rebel leaders at a Mexican resort.
   The insurgents originally proposed putting off the election until
September to give them time to marshal their political forces and
take part. In Mexico, they said they could go along with an election
in July.
   The rebels also called for security and anti-fraud guarantees.
   In exchange, they promised to recognize the legitimacy of the
government that arose from the vote _ implicitly accepting that
armed struggle would then be illegitimate.
   Soon after the Mexico meeting, the Defense Ministry declared its
stand.
   ``Postponing the election until September is impossible,''
Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova told reporters, invoking
the constitution.
   At first, some parties also had constitutional qualms about
putting off the vote, but those were overcome in most cases when
some jurists said it could be done legally.
   Postponement would have required consensus among the parties, but
that prospect was virtually nil before the politicians even went to
Mexico.
   ``No one in Mexico had the right or faculty to agree to
postponement,'' Francisco Merino, vice-presidential candidate for
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, told The
Associated Press on Friday.
   Postponement, he said, ``could bring even bigger problems to the
country, because it could divide the armed forces.''
   Mario Aguinada, leader of the leftist Nationalist Democratic
Union, told the AP last week that rightist and centrist parties
which may have been tempted to consider the guerrilla proposal were
dissuaded by the military's uncompromising stance.
   ``They were scared,'' he said.
   Arena soundly defeated the incumbent Christian Democrats in
legislative and municipal elections last year, and it is also
favored to take the Presidential Palace from the Christian Democrats
in the upcoming elections. It never indicated a willingness to
accept postponement.
   However, one party leader who had gone to Mexico told journalists
Friday that even the Christian Democrats balked at anything more
than a brief delay during the meetings there.
   If the vote were postponed more than a couple of months, the
legislature would have to name an interim president. Arena controls
the legislature and presumably would name one of its own members.
   Fear of losing the campaign advantage of incumbency motivated the
Christian Democrats to block postponement, according to several
participants speaking on condition of anonymity.
   This proposal, though dead, may have boosted long-term peace
propects.
   The guerrillas have been pursuing a ``two-lane'' strategy of
combat and negotiation, Guillermo Ungo, presidential candidate of
leftist Democratic Convergence, said in an interview Friday. He is
formally allied with the rebel army.
   ``The two aspects do not exclude each other. They complement each
other,'' he said.
   The guerrillas, in response to rejection of their proposal, say
they intend to step up attacks sharply in coming months.
   But Ungo said the ``negotiating lane'' has not been definitively
blocked.
   ``This (guerrilla) offer does not remain valid. It was tailored
for this moment. What remains valid is the idea of negotiation,'' he
said.

   A convicted murderer who was freed
because of jail crowding remained at large Sunday, authorities said.
   Sheriff's spokesman Sherry Rainey would not comment on whether
efforts were under way to locate Felton Singleton.
   Singleton, 19, was convicted Thursday night of first-degree
murder in the Oct. 7 shooting death of Darreld Jackson, 24, at a
convenience store parking lot.
   Singleton was sentenced to 25 years in prison. But Pulaski County
sheriff's deputies refused to pick him up after his trial, saying
their jail had reached capacity as mandated by federal court orders.
   Circuit Judge Jack Lessenberry ordered Singleton freed. No bond
was posted, although once Singleton is in custody, he will be
expected to post $15,000 bond to be freed pending appeal, Ms. Rainey
said.
   Singleton's attorney, Ralph Cloar Jr., said he did not expect to
hear from his client until Monday.
   ``He got an unexpected vacation or whatever,'' Cloar said
Saturday. ``They just made a boo-boo.''
   Ms. Rainey said a series of mistakes occurred: A booking sergeant
miscounted the number of prisoners Thursday, and concluded no jail
space was available. The sergeant then failed to alert a shift
sergeant of Singleton's impending arrival, so no alternative housing
arrangements were made until after Lessenberry freed Singleton.
   Asked Saturday whether his court should be responsible for
rounding up Singleton, Lessenberry said, ``I don't have a gun.'' He
suggested the sheriff's office study applicable law.
   Cloar said Singleton is the responsibility of the sheriff's
office. But Ms. Rainey said she was not sure who should be
responsible.
   ``It's a shame. He should have been incarcerated,'' Ms. Rainey
said.
   However, ``Our consent decree doesn't say 200 persons (capacity)
unless someone is convicted of murder.'' The federal court orders
limit the jail to 200 prisoners.
   Jail population had shifted by Saturday so that space was
available for Singleton, she said.

   Riot police on Sunday battled
demonstrators protesting President Bush's visit and dispersed
students shouting anti-U.S. slogans in two cities, police and
dissidents said.
   On Monday, police arrested 15 dissidents who tried to march to
the U.S. Embassy to protest the Bush visit and present a letter
condemning the United States.
   Bush arrived in Seoul on Monday for a five-hour visit to hold
talks with President Roh Tae-woo and to address the National
Assembly. He later flies home to Washington.
   In the southern city of Pusan Sunday, thousands of riot police
sealed off a downtown temple, blocking an anti-American rally but
triggering violent street protests, the Yonhap news agency reported.
   It said bands of protesters hurling firebombs and rocks fought
running street battles with police who fired tear gas. At least 34
protesters were arrested, it said.
   Similar clashes erupted in the western port city of Inchon when
police dispersed protesters trying to attend an anti-Bush rally,
dissident sources said.
   ``Bush, Yankee go home!'' hundreds of youths shouted as they
pelted police with firebombs.
   Four Korean reporters were injured when police brandishing clubs
charged about 100 demonstrators trying to march from an Inchon
church, Yonhap said.
   In Sunchon, 168 miles south of Seoul, 20 youths firebombed an
unoccupied prosecutors' office, smashing windows and burning some
fixtures, Yonhap also reported.
   Dissidents and radical students have called for demonstrations
against the Roh government and Bush's visit, but their rallies have
drawn only small numbers.
   South Korea's 120,000 police have been placed on top alert.
   On Monday, police maintained tight security around U.S.
facilities to guard against threatened radical attacks.
   About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying
pictures of Bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized and
hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the U.S.
Embassy in downtown Seoul.
   ``No Bush visit,'' the small band shouted before they were
overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the
protesters.
   Minutes after the protest, Bush's helicopter passed overhead on
its way to the nearby presidential mansion, the Blue House, to be
received by Roh.
   Three dissident leaders attempted to walk peacefully to the
embassy moments after the protest was broken up by riot police. But
the police blocked the sidewalk and eventually dragged the leaders
away.
   ``We're trying to deliver this letter,'' shouted dissident leader
Lee Bu-yong, waving it above his head as dozens of riot troopers
surrounded him.
   The letter, released earlier by the nation's main dissident
alliance, denounced the United States as the main source of division
and strife in South Korea. It called for the withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from South Korea and charged that Washington ruled the nation
like a colony.
   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Korean
people since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.
   The radicals claim Roh's government is a military dictatorship
controlled by the United States. They want to oust Roh and expell
the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense
treaty.
   ``The United States is scheming, through Bush's visit, to
perpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, stabilize the
military dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' said the United
National Democratic Movement of Korea, the main dissident alliance.
   Radical students have little public support because of their
extreme views, but they can assemble thousands of activists and
often clash with riot police in Seoul and other cities.

<HEAD>Honk Kong Flight Canceled After Cargo-Door Problem Discovered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cargo door problem on a United Airlines jet
forced cancellation of a flight to Hong Kong Sunday, the day the
airline said it ordered inspections of the doors because of Friday's
deadly in-flight accident near Hawaii.
   A United spokesman said, however, that the incident at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was not related to the special
inspections.
   In the Seattle case, an electric motor that closes a latch on the
cargo-hold door was found to be faulty, United said.
   The Boeing 747 that was to have flown to Hong Kong had already
been through the inspection when the motor problem was discovered,
said Russell Mack, a United spokesman in Chicago.
   He said the motor was repaired in one to two hours, but by then
crew scheduling problems forced the flight to be delayed until
Monday morning.
   Because the right forward cargo door was part of the 747 that
ripped away in flight last week, killing nine people, officials said
they checked all cargo doors on United's fleet of 31 747s and all
were found to be in proper working order.
   In addition, a detailed technical inspection of all latches,
seals, fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms was to be
completed Sunday.
   Mack said the incident in Seattle ``was entirely unrelated to the
special inspections that we have been doing this weekend.'' He said
the motor turns a cam that closes a latch. He added that the latch
can also be closed manually.
   ``It was simply a repair that needed to be done,'' he said.

   The explosive ripping open of United Air Lines'
oldest Boeing 747 over the Pacific Ocean came as an air safety task
force was about to propose mandatory work on all aging Boeing
airliners.
   Investigators consider structural failure a likely cause _
although a mechanical problem, human error or sabotage have not been
ruled out _ for the incident Friday in which nine passengers died.
   No matter the cause, the geriatric jumbo jet sitting on the
tarmac at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu with a 10-by-40-foot
hole in its side provided a graphic new illustration of continuing
concern over the safety of commercial aviation.
   Two days before the harrowing sky drama, the head of Boeing, F.
A. Shrontz, had declared in a speech: ``We believe fundamentally
that with proper maintenance and proper inspection an airplane can
in fact last forever.''
   Shrontz added, however, that ``at some point economics catch up
and the cost of inspection and the cost of updating just overwhelm
the equation.''
   Boeing and United officials stressed the ``heroic'' effort of the
pilot in bringing Flight 811 safely in with the remaining 345 people
aboard and the stability of the aircraft in holding together as it
returned to Honolulu for an emergency landing.
   But the incident raised questions about conditions that would
allow such a gaping hole to open up in the side of an airliner and
the integrity of all older airliners _ questions addressed by the
Aging Aircraft Task Force set up by the Air Transport Association.
   Even before the Flight 811 tragedy, the task force had scheduled
a news conference here Tuesday to make recommendations that are
expected to include mandatory repairs, modifications and
replacements of parts on older Boeing 747s, 737s and 727s.
Recommendations on airliners built by other manufacturers are to
come later this year.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which is represented on the
task force, would have to take action before the proposals would
become binding.
   Although the transport association represents airlines, the
150-member task force includes U.S. and European aviation experts
and government regulatory officials as well as representatives of
airliner manufacturers and professional mechanics organizations.
   Mandatory updating of airliners could be a costly departure from
the regime of inspection-related work the FAA now requires. It also
could increase the pressure on airlines to get rid of their
most-used aircraft if the changes send the cost of maintaining an
old aircraft beyond that of purchasing a new one.
   Aviation analyst Paul Turk of the appraisal firm of Avmark says
only about 15 old airliners have been voluntarily sent to the scrap
heap by major U.S. airlines in the last decade. Others have received
complete overhauls, often including new engines, and been sold to
charter outfits, cargo haulers or for other uses.
   In recent years, with air travel increasing worldwide, the value
of even older airliners has increased like the value of real estate.
The airline industry is now a major attraction for investors, with
about 40 percent of U.S. airliners leased by the carriers.
   Avmark puts the average age of airliners flown by major U.S.
carriers at nearly 13 years. United's fleet among the older ones:
14.87 years when the latest analysis was run eight months ago. About
half of United's 387 planes are more than 16 years old.
   The oldest fleets belong to Northwest, 15.47 years; Trans World
Airlines, 15.29, and Eastern, 15.11 years. The newest group of
airliners is flown by Delta, 9.48 years.
   But aviation experts say the raw age of an airliner has little to
do with its economic value or its safety.
   ``Each aircraft has a different life situation,'' said Pat Murphy
of Avitas, another independent aviation appraisal firm. The numbers
of takeoffs and landings, hours flown, the flying environment and
the quality of maintenance all have an impact on an airliner's life
expectancy, Murphy said.
   United's plane was 18 years old but had relatively few
takeoff-landing cycles, less than 15,000. That is one-sixth the
number of the Aloha 737 whose roof split open over Hawaii last April.
   The damaged United aircraft, which rolled off the Boeing assembly
line in November 1970, would be subject to modifications under the
task force proposals. Newer 747s, 757s and 767s would not be
affected.
   Details of the recommendations have not been disclosed, but the
group is not expected to propose that any class of airliners be
retired or that any maximum age, flying hours or number of takeoffs
and landings be set for mandatory retirement.
   Its proposals will be based on examination of Boeing service
bulletins which document problems airlines have had with individual
models and often lead to FAA directives, said transport association
spokesman Tim Neale.
   The group also has been examining airlines' programs for
corrosion prevention and control, structural inspection and repair
to see whether additional action is needed, he said.

   Liz Claiborne, founder of the major clothing

and president in June.
   Liz Claiborne Inc. also announced that Ms. Claiborne's husband,

leaving many, many close firends behind, we are confident that the
company is in a very healthy posture, with strong management in
place,'' the couple said in a joint statement.
   ``After years of working long, long days, and then meeting the
new challenges of helping to grow and manage a billion-dollar
enterprise, we are looking forward to making time to devote to
personal interests and to enjoying the fruits of our labors,'' the
statement said.
   The company said the two plan ``to devote their time to a number
of environmental, social and other personal interests.''
   Ms. Claiborne, 59, is one of the few female chief executives of a
major U.S. company.
   Liz Claiborne is known for its updated classic women's clothing,
which sells in the moderate price range. In recent years the company
_ one of the nation's largest manufacturers of women's attire _ has
branched out into men's clothing, perfume and a chain of retail
clothing stores.
   The company said that Vice Chairman Jerome A. Chazen will become
chairman upon Ms. Claiborne's retirement, and that Executive Vice
President Harvey L. Falk will become vice chairman and president.
   No successor was named to the position of chief executive
officer, which was created in 1987.
   The announcement came as the company released its earnings
statements for the fourth quarter of 1988 and for the full year.
   Earnings for the quarter rose to $26.6 million, or 30 cents a
share, up 18.4 percent from the $22.46 million, or 26 cents a share,
reported in the fourth quarter of 1987. Sales for the quarter
totaled $290.2 million, up 21.7 percent from sales of $238.4 million
in the same period a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, profit fell 3.6 percent to $110.3 million, or
$1.26 a share, compared with $114.4 million, or $1.32 a share,
reported for 1987.
   Sales for the year increased to $1.18 billion, up 12.4 percent
from the $1.05 billion reported for 1987, the company said.
   Liz Claiborne, like much of the women's fashion industry, fell
into a slump early last year, and it reported lower earnings for the
second quarter.
   The company also announced that its board had increased the
quarterly dividend to the annual rate of 20 cents a share from 17.5
cents a share.

   With a 30-day cooling-off period coming to an end, a
battle of propaganda and psychology is heating up between Eastern
Airlines and its Machinists union.
   Videos are being filmed and distributed, letters mass-mailed,
brochures and booklets are rolling off presses, post-card campaigns
are under way, news articles are being reprinted and news media
offices are receiving near-daily fax and Federal Express deliveries
from each side.
   Much of the action in these final days before a potentially
devastating strike is taking place away from the bargaining table,
in a struggle for hearts and minds.
   Although federal mediation efforts continue, both sides are ready
for a strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the end of the cooling-off
period set by the National Mediation Board. There haven't been signs
of progress toward a settlement in negotiations that began 17 months
ago, but President Bush could at least put off a strike for 60 days
by appointing an emergency board to investigate the Eastern
situation.
   Eastern, losing $1 million a day, says it can't afford more
delaying actions by a union it says refuses to face the failing
carrier's economic realities by accepting $150 million in pay cuts.
The Machinists favor the presidential board, saying outside
intervention is needed because, they believe, management wants a
strike to try to bust the union.
   There's more to the Eastern-Machinists showdown than the looming
walkout of the 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers, ramp workers and
janitors represented by the Machinists, comprising about 30 percent
of Eastern's work force.
   For a successful strike, Machinists leaders say, they probably
will need help from the pilots and flight attendants, and also hope
for supportive actions from the national Machinists union, other
airline industry workers and from the public.
   Eastern, meanwhile, has been negotiating with its pilots in hopes
they will cross Machinists picket lines, reportedly has been hiring
replacement workers, and is expected to call on parent Texas Air
Corp. and its other subsidiaries, particularly Continental Airlines,
for help.
   It is expected that management supervisors would return to the
line to keep the airline flying should there be a strike. Eastern is
counting on its strong frequent-traveler traffic to continue, with
many fliers willing to ignore the strike to keep building up their
bonus miles. Eastern fliers the past two weeks have received coupons
good for one-third discounts if they fly during the three weeks
starting March 4.
   Eastern tells its other employees in its brochures and employee
bulletins that the Machinists' refusal to make the wage sacrifices
made by the other unions has crippled the carrier. While the other
unions made 20 percent wage concessions in 1986, Eastern says, the
Machinists' refusal forced the sale of Eastern to Texas Air.
   It portrays Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan as
an egotistic near-maniac who wants to run the airline himself.
   ``If Charlie isn't stopped, he will destroy Eastern,'' said a
red-colored booklet titled ``Charlie Says...,'' distributed last
week among Eastern managers.
   ``Since Charlie took office in early 1980, Eastern Airlines and
its employees have suffered to the point that Eastern's existence is
in grave question,'' the booklet says. ``He has caused great harm to
this company to achieve his personal goal of owning and running the
company.''
   Bryan says Eastern employees have suffered for years of bad
management and now have owners with no commitment to the future. He
says more employee influence on the carrier would spur productivity
and improve service.
   The Machinists countered with mailings of a Fortune magazine
mini-profile of Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo that described him
as one of America's toughest bosses, but not a very effective one.
   The Machinists warn fellow employees that Lorenzo doesn't care
about Eastern's future, but wants only to milk its cash assets.
   Although Eastern reportedly has been talking to the pilots about
a ``fence agreement'' aimed at strengthening job security and
Eastern's viability, Machinists leaders hope the pilots will side
with fellow employees over a management they say can't be trusted.
   ``If we go down, the pilots and flight attendants will follow,''
said Frank Ortis, Machinists local 702 vice president. ``Lorenzo
will dismantle the airline.''

<HEAD>Home Savings Of America Asks To Convert To Savings Bank, Join FDIC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest savings and loan, Home
Savings of America, said it wants to convert into a savings bank so
it can avoid the burden of the Bush administration's savings and
loan bailout proposal.
   Home Savings said it has applied to regulatory agencies to merge
into its Bowery Savings Bank subsidiary in order to become a savings
bank.
   Applications were made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for Home Savings to become an
FDIC-insured federal savings bank, said Richard H. Deihl, chairman
and chief executive officer of Home Savings and Bowery Savings Bank.
   Bowery Savings Bank's deposits currently are insured by the FDIC.
The bank was acquired by Home Savings of America in January 1988.
   ``If we remain in the FSLIC (Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance
Corp.) and the Bush administration's proposal is adopted in its
present draft form, Home Savings of America _ by virtue of the fact
that we have the largest deposit base of any U.S. savings
institution _ will be forced to bear the largest cost burden to
resolve the problems of the FSLIC, problems we did not create and
which arose from policies we strongly oppose,'' Deihl said in a
statement Friday.
   The Bush administration wants to rescue the ailing S&amp;L industry
by selling $50 billion in bonds to raise money needed to close
insolvent institutions.
   The plan would strip the FSLIC from its parent agency, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and merge it into the FDIC, which
guarantees bank deposits.
   It also includes raising S&amp;L premiums from $2.08 per $1,000 in
deposits to $2.30. Bank premiums would go from 83 cents to $1.50.
   Deihl said Home Savings of America earned an after-tax profit of
$1 billion over the past five years, and last year was the largest
home mortgage lender in the nation. The S&amp;L also has paid more than
$170 million in deposit insurance premiums to the FSLIC over the
last four years.
   Home Savings paid nearly $50 million in deposit insurance
premiums in 1988 alone, including $45 million to the FSLIC covering
$24.4 billion of FSLIC-insured deposits, and $4 million to FDIC for
Bowery Savings Bank's $5.1 billion deposit base, the company said.
   Deihl added: ``Under the current FDIC insurance premium
structure, premium costs on the company's $29.5 billion deposit base
would have been $25 million _ half the amount paid last year. Even
if FDIC premiums doubled from present levels, Home's deposit costs
for FDIC insurance would still be well below that paid in 1988.''
   Allan Bortel, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
the thrift's move ``is their way of saying `We're mad as hell and
won't take it any more.'''
   Regulatory approval of the merger is necessary, including
approval of a Nov. 1, 1988, application to convert The Bowery
Savings Bank to a federally chartered savings bank. The bank is now
a New York state-chartered institution.
   Home Savings of America, with assets of $40 billion, is the
principal subsidiary of H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. Home Savings of America,
including the Bowery Savings Bank and Savings of America divisions,
operates 352 branches in nine states and 104 mortgage lending
offices in 18 states.

<HEAD>Texas Agency Seeks New Approach to Bailouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state agency is lobbying Congress to consider a
bank bailout program in which stockholders of failing banks would
not lose all of their investment.
   The Texas Banking Department believes the idea would save the
government money and prevent some banks from failing.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. policy requires that stockholders
lose all their equity whenever the agency advances money to prop up
a troubled bank.
   ``We think it's important that public money not be provided for
shareholders,'' FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said.
   The FDIC's policy applies both to routine bank failures and to
open-bank assistance transactions, in which private capital combines
with government money to save a bank. The banking department
proposal would apply only to open-bank deals.
   The banking department believes the proposal would give a failing
bank's owners incentive to raise private money, thereby reducing the
FDIC's costs.
   ``If you can get ahead of some of these problems before the bank
closes, it can't help but be cheaper for the system,'' said Steve
Scurlock, deputy banking commissioner.
   Scurlock presented the plan to U.S. Rep. Steve Bartlett of Dallas
for consideration. Bartlett said he notified FDIC Chairman L.
William Seidman about the plan and discussed stockholder bailouts
with him.
   The banking department hopes the proposal is considered as part
of President Bush's bill to rescue failing savings and loans.
   Under the proposal, bank management also would receive additional
incentive to save a failing bank. The proposal would allow a bank's
top managers to keep their jobs instead of automatically losing them
as dictated by current FDIC policy.
   The FDIC had no comment on the plan, Whitney said.
   He said the FDIC occasionally has provided existing shareholders
with a stake in a recapitalized bank. In the case of last year's
rescue of First City Bancorp. of Texas, for instance, shareholders
kept a 2 percent stake in the new First City.
   The banking department proposal specifies that existing
stockholders suffer more dilution of their ownership than in cases
in which private sources inject all the fresh capital. But the plan
does not specify how much dilution, only that is it considerable.
   Bartlett believes the existing open-bank assistance law gives the
FDIC a powerful vehicle to raise private capital for failing banks,
but the FDIC inadequately uses the law.

<HEAD>Japanese Chemical Maker Acquires Former Koppers Plant</HEAD>

   A major Japanese-owned chemical producer
has acquired the former Koppers Co. polyester resins plant here from
Beazer PLC of England.
   Spokesmen for Beazer and Reichhold Chemical confirmed the sale
but said no details would be disclosed until Monday.
   The suburban Pittsburgh plant employs about 100.
   Beazer has sold several chemical and allied products businesses
acquired in its $1.8 billion takeover of Pittsburgh-based Koppers
last year. Those businesses employed all but about 40 of the 1,150
people employed by Koppers in the Pittsburgh area at the time of the
takeover.
   Reichhold, which produces chemical binders, polymers and
adhesives, is owned by Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals Inc. of Japan.
