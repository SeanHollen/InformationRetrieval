   A helicopter crashed Tuesday on the
median of an expressway, killing the pilot, co-pilot and three
Atlantic City casino hotel executives of the Trump Organization,
officials said.
   The helicopter was returning to Atlantic City from New York City
when it crashed at 1:50 p.m. on the Garden State Parkway, police
said.
   Tom Murray of East Providence, R.I., said he was camping nearby
when he saw the helicopter as its ``rotor stopped spinning and
became disconnected from the helicopter and tumbled.''
   He said, ``It seemed like an eternity watching it'' plummet to
the ground.
   State police Sgt. Anthony Aceto said the main rotor was found
about a quarter-mile north of the crash site. Frank Ghiorsi,
regional director of the National Transportation Safety Board, said
a search was under way for the tail rotor. Investigators said the
loss of one rotor could have caused the other to fall off.
   Dan Klores, spokesman for the Trump Organization Inc., said
Donald Trump was not aboard the copter, but the presidents of his
Trump Plaza and Trump's Castle casino hotels died in the crash.
   Klores identified the Trump executives as Stephen Hyde, 43,
chief executive officer of Trump's Atlantic City casino operations;
Mark G. Etess, 38, president of the Taj Mahal casino project; and,
Jonathan Benanav, 33, senior vice president of Trump Plaza casino
hotel.
   ``They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their
lives,'' said Trump in a statement issued through his New York
office. ``No better human beings ever existed. We're deeply
saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go out to their
families.''
   State police spokesman Capt. Thomas Gallagher identified the
other victims as pilot Robert Kent of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., and
co-pilot Lawrence Diener of Westbury, N.Y.
   Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the helicopter was an Agusta 109A, which seats
eight people.
   The Trump executives had been in New York City for a news
conference promoting the Feb. 3 World Boxing Organization bout
between junior welterweights Hector Camacho and Vinny Pazienza at
Trump's Plaza.
   Ocean County Sheriff William Polhemus said his office has
confirmed five people died in the crash.
   ``There was a lot of debris smack in the center of the Garden
State (Parkway),'' said Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Klores said the helicopter was leased by the Trump Organization
from Paramount Aviation of Lincoln Park, and had taken off from a
heliport in Manhattan for the one-hour flight to Atlantic City.
Officials at Paramount Aviation said they could not answer
questions about the crash.

   The family of Ferdinand Marcos was cited for
failing to obtain a building permit before starting construction of
a temporary tomb for the former Philippine president, city
officials said Tuesday.
   Herbert Muraoka, director of the Building Department, said the
citation was sent out Tuesday, the day after building inspectors
visited the site at Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in Windward
Oahu.
   The Marcos family has 30 days to respond to the citation before
the case is referred to the city prosecutor's office, Muraoka said.
   Marcos supporter Joe Lazo said the mausoleum was being built by
volunteers with donated materials. The stucture is considered to be
temporary because the Marcos family hopes eventually to have Marcos
buried in the Philippines.
   The wood and corrugated metal structure was expected to be
completed on Wednesday, and the casket containing Marcos' body is
scheduled to be placed in the tomb on Sunday.
   The body remains on view at the family's estate until Friday,
when a funeral Mass is scheduled at the Co-Cathedral of St. Theresa.
   Marcos died Sept. 28 of cardiac arrest following a long illness.
He was 72.

   The matriarch of one of the world's most
sorely tried political families said Tuesday she still sometimes
thinks of her daughter, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan,
as ``my baby.''
   Madame Nusrat Bhutto, widow of executed Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, herself is senior minister _ the equivalent of deputy
prime minister _ and she conducts Cabinet meetings in her
daughter's absence.
   ``As the wife of a prime minister,'' she said in an interview
with The Associated Press on Tuesday, ``there was not much I could
do, but as a mother, sometimes I feel she is still my baby and
needs me and I am ready to help as much as I can.''
   Madame Bhutto is standing in for her daughter, delivering
Pakistan's speech to the present General Assembly. Diplomats said
her daughter's 10-month-old government is embattled and the prime
minister dared not leave at this time.
   The mother denied a report that her daughter is in political
trouble to the extent that she telephoned President Bush for help
in fighting her enemies.
   ``No, the report is stupid, it is lies, none of it is true,''
Madame Bhutto said.
   Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged for conspiracy to commit murder
by his rival, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, in April 1979. Madame
Bhutto was imprisoned in solitary confinement for three years, but
formed the Movement for Restoration of Democracy in 1981.
   She reportedly suffered from cancer and went abroad for
treatment for years, returning in 1988.
   Her two sons, Mir Murtaza Bhutto, and the younger Shah Nawaz
Bhutto formed an anti-Zia organization based in Afghanistan called
Al-Zulfikar, after their father. It was branded a terrorist
organization, outlawed in Pakistan and the sons were exiled. Both
married Afghan women.
   The organization claimed responsibility for the killing of the
official who signed Bhutto's execution order in 1979.
   Four years ago, Shah Nawaz Bhutto died in France under
mysterious circumstances. His mother says he was poisoned by Gen.
Zia's supporters. Reports said he carried a vial of poison in case
he was apprehended by enemies.
   Zia himself died in a plane crash in August 1988.
   The surviving Bhutto son now is living in Syria at an
undisclosed location, with a second wife whom he married last
March, his mother said.
   Observers said he waits to return home to Pakistan and that his
sister, the prime minister, is considering how to deal with his
situation.
   Another child, the prime minister's younger sister Sanam, is a
housewife living with her British husband in England.
   ``We always taught our children the difference between right and
wrong,'' Madame Bhutto said. The daughters especially loved their
father, the boys learned to be tough, she said.
   ``We said the only thing they leave behind is their good name.''

<HEAD>Star Wars Backers Seek Stronger Administration Support of Defense
System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush must ``put a line in the sand''
to head off further funding cuts for Star Wars, say the missile
defense system's hard-core backers who seek a sharper
administration view of the program's purpose.
   These Republican lawmakers _ who bristle at use of the term Star
Wars rather than the formal Strategic Defense Initiative _ say Bush
must act now as House and Senate negotiators thrash out the defense
budget for fiscal 1990.
   ``We need them to weigh in on this conference,'' Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said in an interview last week.
   ``The administration has to put a line in the sand on what is
not acceptable to them,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member
of the House Armed Services Committee. ``Unless the administration
is willing to come out and do something, it's going to continue to
go downhill.''
   Star Wars, introduced six years ago by then-President Reagan as
a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States, has
suffered a series of blows in recent months.
   In early August, the House slashed $1.8 billion from President
Bush's request of $4.9 billion for the program in fiscal 1990. The
vote was 248-175, reflecting waning support for the program.
   Last month Vice President Dan Quayle said the Reagan
administration's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the United
States was ``political jargon.'' Star Wars opponents cited these
comments as an indication the administration does not have its
heart in the program; proponents say the vice president's remarks
were taken out of context.
   Quayle recently has moved to emphasize his support for the
program. In a Public Broadcasting System interview last weekend,
the vice president urged Congress not to cut Star Wars funding.
   Bush has said little about Star Wars, but Quayle insisted the
president ``is a strong supporter of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.''
   Last week the Senate slashed $900 million from Bush's proposal,
but later reversed field and restored $600 million. That move was
viewed not as an increase in support for Star Wars but rather the
Senate's attempt to strengthen its bargaining position with the
House.
   During negotiations, House conferees have pushed for a Star Wars
budget around $3.5 billion, far below the $4.1 billion spent on the
program in fiscal 1989. The Senate has favored a total closer to
the $4.3 billion approved last week.
   In the wake of these events, the Republican disenchantment shows
up in various forms.
   Wallop criticized the contact between the Pentagon and Congress,
saying ``their congressional liaison is less than competent. They
(the administration) are being told things that basically guided
them elsewhere.''
   ``The general tenor of their legislative liaison is to be a
supporter once the crisis has arisen. Those of us trying to help
have been frustrated by that,'' the Wyoming Republican said.
Pressed for specific names, Wallop declined to identify them.
   John Dewey, who handles legislative issues for the SDI
organization at the Pentagon, said his office has been ``very
supportive, right along. We haven't given up _ by no means. Nobody
in our organization gives that impression.''
   Another Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said he was ``a little taken aback'' by the senator's
comments, and emphasized that ``we've worked the heck out of it and
will continue to.''
   Wallop said this week would be an ideal time for the
administration to indicate the total fiscal 1990 budget it will
accept for Star Wars, and he expressed his confidence that a former
Wyoming lawmaker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, will make that
point clear.
   ``It's hard to fight for people who don't have a target over
which to fight,'' the senator said.
   Another SDI supporter, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he was
looking to Cheney and Quayle to keep the program highly visible.
When asked if the administration has done enough to promote the
program, Hyde, after a long pause, responded, ``probably not.''
   ``Without administration support, the program will languish,''
said Hyde, who fears a substantial budget cut would ``emasculate''
the program.
   Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he was not disappointed by the administration's
efforts on behalf of Star Wars, but said ``now is the time to weigh
in.''

<HEAD>Cheating Scandal May Lead to Costlier Generics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers may soon be paying higher prices for
prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the
market and cost-conscious buyers are left with fewer low-priced
options, some industry observers say.
   Dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations
and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for Food and
Drug Administration approval.
   The scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and
result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval. Some
generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force
prices up, but others say the industry will remain competitive
enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases.
   A more immediate concern for consumers, however, is the possible
effect of the recalls.
   ``The costs to pharmacists are going up for selected products,
but not overall,'' said Steve Grote, vice president of purchasing
for the American Association of Retired Persons Pharmacy Service.
   The biggest impact of generic drug recalls may be seen by
patients taking the high blood pressure drug Dyazide or its generic
version.
   One of the drug's two clones was removed from the market earlier
this year when its maker, Vitarine Pharmaceutical Inc., admitted
cheating on safety tests to win FDA approval. Now the FDA is trying
to remove the other generic version from the market, saying its
maker, Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc., misrepresented test data to
the agency.
   Bolar's product is about half the price of Dyazide, and its
removal from the market would mean higher prices for some
consumers, at least until another generic version can win FDA
approval.
   Bolar agreed to recall another drug, an antibiotic used to treat
urinary tract infections, after the FDA said the company cheated on
product safety tests. The drug is nitrofurantoin, sold under the
brand name Macrodantin by Norwich-Eaton Pharmaceuticals.
   Generic drugs, which account for about one-third of all
prescriptions nationwide, now offer consumers savings averaging 50
percent to 70 percent over their brand-name counterparts.
   But some in the industry say the gap will narrow as the FDA
toughens regulations and as the industry itself consolidates.
   ``The prices for generics will show a gradual increase ... but
still will be substantially below brand-name drugs,'' said John H.
Klein, president of Zenith Laboratories in Northvale, N.J.
   Klein, who with an investor group took the company out of
bankruptcy last year and anticipates generic drug sales of $36
million to $40 million this year, also predicts an end to cutthroat
pricing in the generic industry as companies realize that setting
prices below costs to gain market share is unprofitable.
   The FDA has no formal proposal for tougher regulations, but
agency officials have been discussing the need for more staff, the
possibility of imposing user fees on the generic industry for new
drug application filings and more rigorous safety testing.
   ``All of those things will affect the cost of the generic
drug,'' said Henry F. Blissenbach, director of pharmacy programs
for United HealthCare Corp., a Minneapolis-based manager of health
maintenance organizations.
   But an official at Rugby Laboratories in Rockville Center, N.Y.,
disagrees.
   Martin Zeiger, executive vice president and general counsel of
Rugby, a privately held generic drug maker said to be the largest
in the country with about $500 million in annual sales, said the
additional costs would not be enough to raise prices.
   ``It's a very competitive industry,'' he said. ``We don't see
the prices increasing at all.''
   Analysts anticipate some generic manufacturers will not make it
through the scandal. Hemant K. Shah, a pharmaceutical analyst at
HKS &amp; Co., says more than half of the top 20 generic drug makers _
who account for 90 percent of the generic business _ will disappear
within five years.
   ``But still the prices of generics probably are not going to
rise because six or 10 companies are still enough for some form of
pricing pressure,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   This war-battered city is cautiously
coming to life again after six months of fierce artillery battles.
   Beirutis are picking up the pieces of their lives under a
cease-fire that took hold Sept. 22. But for many, the memories of
the nightmare that killed 900 people will not go away.
   Schoolteacher Mona Khoury ate so much to calm her nerves during
the fighting between Syrian and Christian forces that she can't get
into her dresses now.
   Housewife Samia Iskandarani can't listen to the radio any more
because it reminds her of fear-filled nights tuned to news flashes
in her bunker. Another woman got hooked on sleeping pills during
the shelling.
   While some people are having problems adjusting to a life
without the fear of pulverizing bombardments, many are having fun
while they can.
   The beaches that once were the playground of the Middle East are
crowded again. Restaurants and bars are so full that customers have
to make reservations.
   In Moslem west Beirut two weeks ago, when the city was largely
deserted before the cease-fire, there was only one bar open.
   Movie theaters are open, screening action movies to people who
by any stretch of the imagination should have had their fill of the
real thing.
   Few people believe that the cease-fire will last or that
Lebanese legislators meeting in Taif, Saudi Arabia, to seek a
settlement to the 14-year-old civil war will succeed.
   The Lebanese are grateful for the cease-fire. But after seeing
hundreds of cease-fires collapse many consider this one nothing
more than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers.
   They are returning to a normal life slowly and cautiously, if
living amid the ruins with tightly rationed electricity and water
can be called normal.
   ``I can only sleep if I take sleeping pills,'' said young Sunni
Moslem woman who identified herself only as Ghada. ``It's the only
way I can overcome my fear of being surprised by a shell during my
sleep. It's a carry-over from the fighting.
   Ms. Iskandarani, a Moslem, said she has an aversion to radios
these days:
   ``They're a reminder of the horrible days and nights we spent in
the shelter waiting for news flashes to tell us where the shells
were falling.'' Schools, offices and banks have reopened.
   Traffic around Beirut is so heavy during the day that one
driver, stuck in a traffic jam, joked with the driver of the car
next to her: ``I wish the war was still on. It kept the streets
clear and I'd be home by now.''
   The moneychangers are back on Hamra Street, the badly damaged
center of the old commercial district in west Beirut. Mostly they
gather around a pile of stones outside a fast-food store, prompting
local wags to dub the busy thoroughfare ``Wall Street.''
   Samer Osseiran, proprietor of the Uncle Sam pub across from the
American University of Beirut, said he won't remove the sandbags
piled high outside his bar until a peace settlement is signed,
sealed and delivered.
   ``Business is booming, but I don't trust this truce,'' he said,
echoing the feelings of most Beirutis. ``If there's no settlement
I'll add more sandbags.''
   Newspapers which a few weeks ago carried ads for 24-hour
delivery of sandbags and cement blocks ``to protect your homes,
shops and offices,'' now advertise repair services.
   People are making only essential repairs to their damaged
houses, enough to make them habitable. Many are replacing broken
windows with transparent plastic sheets.
   ``Why should I waste money fixing the whole place up?'' said
Jihad Ali, whose house in the seaside Ein Mreisseh neighborhood of
west Beirut took a direct hit from Christian artillery.
   ``I don't believe in this cease-fire. Those deputies in Taif
should be slaughtered for all the good they've done in the last 14
years,'' he said as he bought a lottery ticket.
   First prize is 15 million Lebanese pounds ($30,000), ``enough
money to get out of this damned country.''
   Most of the 1.3 million Beirutis _ 90 percent of the city's
population _ who fled the fighting are settling back in their homes
and students are returning to school. The American University
reopened on Monday.
   Many of those who stuck it out have found they're suffering from
an unexpected problem _ weight gained down in the bunkers.
   ``I've just woken up to the fact that I put on 10 kilgrams (22
pounds),'' said Ms. Khoury. ``During the fighting I ate like a
glutton. I found comfort in eating.''
   She said she didn't realize how much weight she had gained
because she was always dressed in ``shelter clothes,'' long, loose
flowing dresses.
   ``But I learned the awful truth when I tried out a dress to go
to back to school. I couldn't do up the zipper.''
   Colorful billboards advertising cosmetics and perfume have gone
up again along the battered boulevards. The joggers are back,
weaving through American University's shell-cratered gardens
overlooking the Mediterranean.
   The shell craters and bullet-pocked walls along west Beirut's
seaside boulevard are being patched up and many of the coffee
vendors are back in business with their colorful umbrellas, small
tables and rickety chairs.
   Strollers gather for coffee during the day. At night, rats still
dart out of huge piles of rotting garbage across the street.
   Uprooted palm trees and gutted vehicles still litter the
corniche that runs around the rocky Ras al-Beirut peninsula jutting
into the Mediterranean.
   They are a reminder of the ferocious Christian barrages that
sought to silence Syrian artillery, which took their toll on ships
carrying fuel and weapons to the Christians in their beleaguered
enclave across the bay.

   The death toll from last week's nursing home
fire rose to 11 on Monday with the deaths of two more elderly
residents who had suffered smoke inhalation.
   Meanwhile, investigators said the four-story building's
automatic alarm system malfunctioned when the fire broke out
Thursday at the Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center.
   Nine residents were killed and 98 of the 161 residents were
injured. The residents who died Monday were Ettie F. Cunningham,
88, and Katherine F. Hansthorn, 97, hospital spokeswomen said.
   Authorities said the fire was started when an elderly man who
was smoking in violation of regulations accidentally tossed a match
onto a mattress. The nursing home, built in 1969, did not have a
sprinkler system.
   Norfolk Fire Marshal Carl H. Welch said investigators determined
Monday that the building's automatic alarm system didn't work
properly. The system should have automatically sent an alarm to the
Fire Department through MGI Security Services Inc.
   ``The alarm never left the building,'' Welch said after
investigators checked the security company's records. ``We're still
trying to determine what the problem was.''
   Had the system worked properly, Welch said, firefighters would
have been able to respond quicker. The fire was reported by four
calls to the 911 emergency number. Welch said the response time was
four minutes.
   Jeffrey McKain, a vice president for the Tacoma, Wash.-based
Hillhaven chain, said Virginia Secretary of Health and Human
Resources Eva S. Teig and several other state and local officials
toured the building Monday.
   Hillhaven officials had hoped to reopen Monday, but McKain said
it appeared the nursing home would not reopen until Wednesday at
the earliest because officials want written reports from the fire
marshal and the building inspector.

<HEAD>Democrats Fear Child Care Could be Victim of Capital Gains Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats fear that billions of dollars
in proposed child care tax subsidies for low-income families could
be lost in the fight over a proposed capital gains tax cut for the
wealthy.
   The proposed child care tax writeoffs for families earning less
than $25,000 are part of a broad deficit reduction bill that, in
its House version, includes a cut in the capital gains tax rate for
the rich.
   The Senate version also includes the new child care benefits.
But Senate Democrats and Republicans are haggling over how to also
provide a similar break for better-off taxpayers.
   The chamber's leaders from both parties planned to resume talks
today on resolving the stalemate after making weak stabs at it
through the weekend.
   Republicans and a handful of Senate Democrats want to fulfill
President Bush's campaign promise last year to cut the tax on
capital gains _ profits made from selling stock, real estate and
other property.
   Democrats are countering with a proposal to encourage savings by
middle-and upper-income families by providing a tax break of up to
$330 if they save $2,000 a year in Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Looming over the negotiations is an Oct. 16 deadline. Unless
Congress completes work on a deficit-reduction plan by then,
automatic across-the-board reductions will be triggered in most
federal spending programs.
   ``We don't have an agreement yet but everybody in there today
thought we should get one,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas told reporters on Sunday.
   ``Child care legislation is of the highest priority in this
Congress _ a far higher priority than a capital gains tax cut,''
said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine. ``We don't
want that to fall between the cracks.''
   Senate leaders are searching for a way to strip away from the
big deficit-reduction bill numerous provisions that are popular
with lawmakers but do nothing to reduce the deficit.
   Democrats are trying to cut the capital gains tax cut from the
deficit-reduction bill. But the child care provisions then could
come under the same knife.
   Both the Senate and House have approved slightly different child
care measures that would rely on $11 billion to $13.5 billion in
Earned Income Tax Credits for low-income families over the next
five years to provide more than two-thirds of the new benefits.
   Republicans generally favor the tax-credit approach. But the
plans approved by the House and Senate also include, at Democrats'
insistence, $1.75 billion in new direct subsidies for child care
plus a doubling of the current Head Start program for pre-school
children.
   Even if Senate leaders are successful in stripping away the
extraneous provisions and wrapping them together in a new bill,
they still must seek agreement on the measure with their House
counterparts.
   The House already has passed its own deficit-reduction bill. In
addition to a capital gains cut, it includes repeal of catastrophic
health coverage for retirees, restoration of the Fairness Doctrine
that requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue and
extension of several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests.
   Unless the House-passed deficit plan also is pared back,
senators could be at a heavy disadvantage when they negotiate with
House members on final details of the bill.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army major who led the
unsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was buried
Monday and opposition leader Guillermo Endara ended a 19-day hunger
strike.
   Several reports have said an enraged Noriega personally shot
Maj. Moises Giroldi, 38, to death minutes after the coup attempt
against the Panamanian leader ended a week ago.
   Relatives of Giroldi said he was shot once in the neck and twice
in the chest. His mother, Eloisa, cried ``They murdered him!'' and
flung herself on the coffin.
   The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured Noriega, who
commands the Panamanian military and controls the government, but
gave up when loyalists counterattacked while U.S. troops looked on
from a few hundred yards away.
   Officials of the Panamanian Defense Forces said eight officers
and two sergeants were killed. They have not explained the
circumstances or responded to reports that some were slain after
surrendering.
   Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo on Monday
said Noriega met with his general staff to begin reshuffling
military units that hesitated during the uprising or openly opposed
him.
   The spokesman also said U.S. helicopters tried to intercept
forces loyal to Noriega flying into Panama City from Rio Hato, but
wavered, apparently because they had not been given specific orders.
   ``They tried to dissuade the Machos de Monte (the company that
now guards Defense Forces headquarters) but there was no decision
to say `you cannot pass,''' he said.Lopez Grimaldo did not describe
what action the helicopters took.
   In another development, the civilian Cabinet met with President
Francisco Rodriguez to approve emergency laws first proposed by
Noriega last week and aimed at stifling military and political
dissent.
   They include a military code, reforms to the penal code, labor
laws to make it easier to fire disloyal public employees and
economic laws to encourage investment.
   Endara meanwhile ended his fast and entered a clinic to
``normalize my body's system.''
   A medical bulletin said his ``conscious process was excellent
and his conversationcoherent,'' but he was suffering ``from
progressive debilitation.''
   The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay paying
taxes and utility bills, and to shun the government lottery and
casinos, on which the government has depended for much of its
revenue the past 18 months.
   The United States has applied economic sanctions against Panama
since federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega in February
1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
   Noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a U.S. plot
to retain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, when it is to be
turned over under treaties signed in 1977.
   At a news conference, Endara said he felt his hunger strike was
a success. He said the opposition did not approve of the coup
because it represented ``Noriegaism without Noriega,'' not a
movement toward democracy.
   Capt. Leon Tejada, another rebel, was buried at the same small
red stone church over the weekend. ``He had one bullet wound in the
right temple,'' said Tejada's mother, Esther, who was at the church
again for Giroldi's burial.
   About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for Giroldi.
   ``They were good friends,'' Mrs. Tejada said. ``My son had just
come back from (U.N. duty in) Namibia last Saturday. On Tuesday he
told his wife he had to go to headquarters and would return later
to go see his baby girl.
   ``We did not hear anything until Wednesday when they said on
television that he was dead. We picked up the body.''
   Giroldi's widow and three children did not attend. They have
been under U.S. Army protection at Fort Clayton since the coup.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the United States has
flown about 40 Panama coup participants, family members or Noriega
opponents to Miami, including Mrs. Giroldi, her two sons, her
father and other family members.
   The group included 14 military personnel, according to the
paper, which quoted unidentified Bush administration sources.
   Defense Forces officials say the rebels surrendered after nearly
five hours of negotiations with Noriega, who was their hostage at
Defense Forces headquarters.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several U.S. newspapers have said
Noriega personally shot Giroldi in the final moments of the doomed
uprising.
   Endara, the opposition's presidential candidate in May, took
refuge in the Vatican's embassy after soldiers beat him and threw
him out of his office Thursday. Shortly before the assault, Noriega
claimed he had evidence the United States planned to install Endara
as president.
   Foreign observers said Endara's ticket won the May 7 election by
a 3-1 margin, but Noriega had the results annulled May 10. U.S.
officials have said they consider Endara the legitimate president
of Panama.

<HEAD>Roach Revisionism Not Taking Hold at Agriculture Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department scientists are still
out to bash cockroaches when they can, regardless of some who say
live and let live.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service says there's a
school of thought that suggests scientists ``ought to let up on the
repulsive insects'' and concentrate on other pests.
   Defenders of cockroaches contend that unlike blood-feeding
arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks and fleas, the cockroaches
``are only incidental disease transmitters,'' says Regina Wiggen,
associate editor of the agency's Agricultural Research magazine.
   ``Thus, the roach revisionists argue, the risks that attend
cockroach control may outweigh the benefits to be gained by
maintaining a roach-free home,'' she said.
   But scientists at the department's Imported Fire Ant and
Household Insects Research Laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., remain
skeptical _ and they've been studying roaches since the 1940s.
   Wiggen, writing in the current issue of the magazine, admitted
cockroaches ``have never been irrefutably incriminated in the
natural transmission'' of disease organisms to humans.
   ``But there's plenty of circumstantial evidence to tie the roach
to cases of typhoid fever and other diseases caused by Salmonella
bacteria,'' Wiggen said. ``They've also been implicated as carriers
of Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and polio.''
   Wiggen added: ``Roaches are notorious scavengers. They eat
contaminated food and waste, then carry microorganisms in their
digestive tracts, releasing them on the surfaces they contact.
Release occurs through vomiting, excreting wastes and laying eggs
on human food.''
   A female cockroach can produce tens of thousands of offspring a
year. In one study by the USDA agency, scientists checking
low-income housing in Florida turned up 20,000 cockroaches in each
apartment.
   There is also an esthetic dimension to the matter of food
cleanliness, Wiggen said, quoting William E. Currie of the
Environmental Protection Agency who described ``roaches crawling
out of the drain, across the counter and onto the cream pie.''
   Entomologist Richard J. Brenner of the agency's Gainesville
research center said in a related article that some 4,000 species
of cockroaches are known to scientists. Only about 50 species are
considered pests, but those are enough to prompt Americans to spend
an estimated $1.5 billion annually on pesticides to control
cockroaches.
   A goal of the Gainesville research is to find long-term
solutions, so Brenner is using electronic sensor and computers to
help study cockroach behavior.
   Cockroaches thrive in areas of stagnant air and high humidity.
Anything else ``tends to dry them out,'' he said. Also, a cockroach
behaves differently in a group than it does when alone.
   Some cockroaches prefer attics, while others, such as the German
cockroach, primarily inhabit walls.
   Once scientists determine the conditions cockroaches need to
thrive, Brenner said it may be possible to manipulate the
environment around the home to repel them.
   ``The bottom line is safer, more effective means of controlling
cockroaches and ultimately preventing infestations,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, cardboard ``hotels,'' liquid doses of chemicals,
spray and other weapons continue to be used by homeowners.
   A new slow-acting insecticide, sulfuramid, was developed by USDA
scientists to use against fire ants and was also found to be 90
percent effective against household ants and roaches.
   Sulfuramid was used as a wetting agent to coat baits with a
potential insecticide for fire ants, says retired entomologist
Clifford S. Lofgren.
   ``When the ants were killed not only by the test bait but also
by an non-toxic control bait coated only with the wetting agent, we
realized we had stumbled onto a new class of compounds for
controlling them,'' he said.
   The EPA recently approved sulfuramid _ which is sold by Griffin
Corp. of Valdosta, Ga., under an exclusive license from the
Commerce Department _ for use against household ants and roaches.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Rockwell Ignored Warning on Plutonium Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former engineer at the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons factory contends the plant operator knew for several years
of possible accumulations of radioactive plutonium in the
ventilation system but failed to investigate.
   James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site near Denver
from 1980 to 1986, said in a telephone interview Monday that the
operator, Rockwell International Corp., ignored the repeated
warnings he voiced as early as 1984.
   ``They just said, forget it, we're not going to do it,'' Stone
said.
   Stone had no firm evidence of plutonium accumulations in air
ducts, but his suspicions were proven correct by a team of
independent investigators who last Friday told the Energy
Department they found 11 pounds of plutonium in air ducts linked to
``gloveboxes,'' or work chambers, in which plutonium is manually
processed.
   The presence of plutonium in the ducts is considered a hazard
because, under certain circumstances, it could lead to an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction. Such a reaction could, in extreme
cases, release lethal amounts of radioactivity.
   The investigators said the plutonium they found did not present
an immediate health danger because it was not being released to the
environment. But they criticized Rockwell for not having
investigated earlier on the basis of Stone's reports.
   Rocky Flats is owned by the Energy Department and makes
plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads.
   Rockwell had contended prior to the investigation by experts
from Scientech Inc., an engineering and management company based in
Idaho Falls, Idaho, that there were no accumulations of plutonium
in any ductwork at Rocky Flats.
   Ed Heintz, a Rockwell spokesman, said Monday he could not
comment on Stone's allegations because they might be linked to an
FBI investigation of possible violations of environmental laws at
Rocky Flats. He said the company was not prepared to comment on the
Scientech findings because it had not studied the final report,
which is highly critical of Rockwell's safety procedures.
   The FBI began investigating Rocky Flats last June but no
indictments have been handed down so far.
   The independent investigators were sent to the weapons plant in
July by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who is attempting to
resolve uncertainties about operational safety and waste management
at Rocky Flats and other weapons plants.
   Stone said he realized the probability of plutonium deposits in
the ventilation system in 1984 while he was helping plan a
renovation of Building 881, a former site of uranium and plutonium
processing that now is used as a laboratory and computer center.
   Stone said Rockwell did not act on his advice that the hundreds
of feet of stainless steel ducts be sandblasted or cleaned in some
other way to remove any plutonium buildup.
   ``It wasn't part of the original scope of their work so they
weren't going to do it,'' he said.
   Roger Mattson, a vice president of Scientech and leader of the
Rocky Flats investigation, said in a telephone interview that
Rockwell shut down several of the gloveboxes after the discovery in
August and began taking steps to correct the problem.
   Mattson said ``it's still an open question'' as to whether
plutonium deposits have accumulated in the ductwork at Building
881, where Stone had been working.
   Stone contended in an August 1986 lawsuit against Rockwell that
he had been fired five months earlier in retaliation for having
raised numerous health and safety issues, including the risk posed
by the plutonium deposits. Stone's lawyer, Hartley Alley, said the
suit is scheduled to go to trial later this month.

<HEAD>HUD Audit Details $35 Million Spending Spree in One Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal housing officials say they're honoring
most loan commitments they made in a $35 million spending spree in
a multi-family loan program on the last day of fiscal 1988.
   More than 100 loans from the Section 312 loan program were
approved that day _ Sept. 30, 1988 _ in an apparent rush to spend
the money before it was transferred to another program at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to agency
records and auditors.
   HUD auditors determined most of the loans were approved despite
incomplete applications and processing, but were told by the
department's attorneys the government must keep its funding
promises in all but a few cases.
   ``Where commitments were made they were honored, but (HUD) will
not be making conditional commitments in the future,'' department
spokesman Jack Flynn said.
   The Section 312 program has not received new funding for several
years but continues to make loans using payments on outstanding
loans. Roughly $200 million was available for the program in fiscal
1988.
   In the final month of the budget year, Section 312 loans
totaling more than $40 million were approved, including 107
totaling $35.3 million on Sept. 30, according to HUD records.
   Seven of the loans later were canceled, including the largest, a
$6.1 million loan to convert a closed hotel in Spokane, Wash., to
apartments.
   There is nothing in the documents to suggest political
favoritism was involved in the year-end loan approvals, but the
auditors and other HUD officials said intense competition within
HUD for the shrinking federal housing allowance likely was a factor
in the hasty approvals.
   The auditors also raised questions about program management,
saying regulations requiring proper documentation and other checks
before making loan commitments were ignored.
   Those criticisms mirror others levied at HUD by auditors and
congressional investigators who blame lax agency management for
many of the problems being exposed in congressional hearings and
internal reviews.
   HUD's inspector general reviewed 19 of the biggest loans made in
the final month of the 1988 fiscal year _ those for more than
$500,000 _ and found 11 were approved on the final day. In all 19
cases, the obligations, totaling $29 million, were improper because
the necessary approval requirements had not been met, the auditors
concluded last month.
   The auditors attributed the rush to spend the money to Congress'
decision that any Section 312 money not spent at the end of the
fiscal year was to be transferred to the Community Development
Block Grant Program. That program falls under a different HUD
department and provides loans and grants to projects designed to
benefit low- and moderate-income citizens.
   ``We believe that most of the obligations were recorded because
the ... staff wanted to obligate the available Section 312 funds
before they were reallocated to the Community Development Block
Grant Program,'' the auditors concluded in a report late last month.
   Several HUD officials interviewed in recent weeks said
conditional approvals for Section 312 loans had been a common
practice for years, with officials committing money to the projects
before developers completed their applications.
   But such approvals will no longer be given because of the
concerns raised by the inspector general and HUD's legal counsel,
Flynn said.
   The Spokane loan was canceled because a regional HUD official
who granted the project waivers didn't have the authority to do so,
according to HUD records. The six other canceled loans totaled $5.1
million.

   An electrical fire broke out
in an elevator shaft on the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal on
Monday night, and four sailors suffered minor injuries putting it
out, a Navy spokesman said.
   ``At this moment we believe the fire to be out,'' Navy spokesman
Bert Byers said at 12:15 a.m. Tuesday. ``I believe it took place in
one of the forward elevators, just forward of the ship's
superstructure.''
   Two people suffered cuts and bruises and two suffered smoke
inhalation. All four were treated at the naval station's
dispensary, Byers said.
   The fire erupted just after after 8:30 p.m. aboard the ship
docked at Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville. The fire was
primarily confined to a machinery room inside the shaft of an
elevator that raises aircraft to deck level, said Cmdr. Tim Taylor.
There was ``quite a bit of smoke,'' he said.
   He couldn't say where or when the ship was to be deployed next.
   At full capacity, the ship carries 148 officers and 2,810
enlisted men, plus 2,480 officers and men in the air wing, for a
total of 5,438.
   The air wing was not on board Monday, leaving a crew of about
2,500 to 3,000 sailors on the ship, a spokesman said.
   The 1,086 foot-long Forrestal, which is based at Mayport, was
the first U.S. aircraft carrier launched after World War II and the
first designed to operate jet aircraft.
   Now the third oldest U.S. carrier on active service, the
Forrestal has been modernized several times since it was launched
on Dec. 11, 1954. It underwent a major refit from January 1983 to
May 1985 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard that was designed to extend
its life another 15 years.

   Neither bees nor rocks nor fast-drying
cement could stop county officials from placing a marker at the
state's geographic center.
   About 40 people attended a ceremony Saturday to install a brass
U.S. Geological Survey marker at a spot four miles up the Devil's
Gulch Trail south of Cashmere.
   But the siting was no simple matter.
   On the day before, David Warby, Cashmere centennial chairman,
and Randy King pushed a wheelbarrow carrying a portable generator
toward the site. The generator was to power a drill, which would
make a hole for the anchor spike.
   But a sharp rock flattened one of the wheelbarrow tires, and as
the two stashed the generator in the brush they set it down on a
nest of bees.
   They left hurriedly. On Saturday, they retrieved the generator
after spraying the bees with insecticide.
   Their hard luck persisted, though, at the site.
   Someone mixed up fast-acting cement for anchoring the plaque
sooner than expected and officials had to work fast to get the
marker in place.
   There was no time for speeches.
   ``We just said, `This is the center of the state as near as
anybody can tell,''' Warby said.

   The price of a ticket to Trinity
Repertory Theater's production of ``Summerfolk'' tonight should
spark precurtain murmurs. That's because theatergoers are paying
what they want.
   ``The objective is to give everyone an opportunity to come to
the theater,'' said E. Timothy Langan, managing director of the
theater company that has won many national honors.
   The normal ticket price is $24. Based on similar experiments by
others in Baltimore and San Diego, Langan said he expected people
tonight to pay $3 or $4.
   ``But that's OK,'' he said. ``The whole purpose of this is for
someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater.''
   Patrons can offer a price as low as they want; the only rule is
they must pay something, he said. Langan won't turn down offers of
more than $24.
   ``I'd love to see that,'' he said. ``There is a great pressure
to produce quality shows, and then the discussion gets into money
and then there's pressure on ticket prices.''
   Trinity has set aside $5,000 from a sponsorship grant from Rhode
Island Hospital Trust bank to cover projected losses.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Bishop was unsure about becoming a
doctor, and Harold Varmus wrote his thesis on Dickens, not DNA. But
today the pair share the Nobel Prize in medicine.
   The two microbiology researchers at the University of California
at San Francisco celebrated their award on Monday, by toasting each
other with French champagne at a news conference at the university.
Then they headed to Candlestick Park to watch the San Francisco
Giants win the National League playoff series against the Chicago
Cubs.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery of a collection of normal genes that can
cause cancer when they go awry.
   In 1976, their research showed that normal genes that apparently
control cell growth can undergo alterations that lead to the
uncontrolled growth that is cancer.
   Their work has led to the discovery of more than 40 different
genes that can cause cancer, and is leading to better ways to
diagnose cancer and predict who is at risk. As knowledge of the
genes increases, researchers hope to find ways to block them if
they become deranged, stopping the growth of the cancerous cells.
   The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and
it ``widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which
govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said.
   Varmus called the research by him and Bishop a ``cornerstone in
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer.''
   Bishop and Varmus were optimistic about the practical
applications of their work. But they were cautious about
forecasting a cancer cure.
   ``This is just another step in what's a long journey,'' Bishop
said. ``It's very difficult to predict when a full view of the
cancer cell will be at hand.''
   Varmus saluted other researchers in the field, saying, ``We all
stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.''
   But Dr. Dominique Stehelin, a French researcher who carried out
experiments overseen by Bishop and Varmus in the 1970s, said
bitterly Monday that he was disappointed about not being included
in the Nobel Prize.
   ``This work belongs to me,'' he said, ``and I don't know why the
scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me.''
   Bishop and Varmus called Stehelin's work ``crucial'' to their
research, but referred questions about the prize to the Nobel
committee.
   ``We didn't nominate each other,'' Varmus said.
   Varmus said he abandoned plans to become an English professor,
and his studies of 17th century literature, to attend medical
school after learning that writer Gertrude Stein enrolled at John
Hopkins Medical School after being told that ``medicine opens all
doors.''
   Gradually he found that he enjoyed being in the laboratory more
than the clinic, and his research career began.
   ``My mother died of breast cancer, but I don't know if that in
itself caused me to study the cause of cancer ... there's hardly
anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow,'' Varmus
said.
   Bishop said he was interested in science in high school, and
decided to become a doctor. But he said that ``by the time I
finished college, I wasn't so sure I wanted to be a doctor.''
   It was a rural Pennsylvania doctor, Robert Kough, who became his
mentor and convinced him that his calling was in medical research.
   Kough, director emeritus of hemotology at Geisinger Medical
Center in Danville, Pa., said Bishop's ``spark was recognized not
only by me, but by his professors ... by everybody who came into
contact with him.''
   Bishop, a native of York, Pa., holds degrees from Gettysburg
College and Harvard. Varmus, a native of Oceanside, N.Y., has
degrees from Amherst College, Harvard and Columbia.
   Both said they don't expect their lives to be dramatically
altered because of winning the Nobel Prize.
   ``It's the only job I've ever had since putting on roofs in high
school, Bishop quipped.
   ``I like my life the way it is, and I hope it stays that way,''
Varmus said. ``The danger is you're supposed to be smarter today
than you were yesterday, and I'm not.''

   The federal government says its switchover to
a new long-distance telephone network will save millions of dollars
and provide 1.3 million federal workers with state-of-the-art
voice, data and video communications.
   The changeover began during the long Columbus Day weekend at 31
government buildings nationwide. Ultimately, more than 1,300
locations in 90 federal agencies will be tied to the network when
it is fully installed in mid-1990.
   The General Services Administration is overseeing the mammoth
switchover with the two prime contractors that won a fierce bidding
war for the project, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and US
Sprint Communications Co.
   GSA estimates FTS2000 will save taxpayers between $15 million
and $20 million a month for regular telephone service _ or as much
as half of the government's $400 million annual phone bill.

<NOTE>Battle Brewing Over Animal-Protection Bills</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mounting number of animal-rights related
bills face Congress, and both sides are preparing for the battle.
   On one side is Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who says Congress needs
a ``common-sense voice'' to combat the efforts of animal-rights
activists. He's recruiting colleagues for a group he tentatively
calls the Animal Welfare Caucus.
   On the other side is Annette Lantos, wife of Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif. She is helping him and Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., organize
the Congressional Friends of Animals.
   The caucuses plan to serve as forums for debate and
clearinghouses of information on bills such as ones to make it
illegal to break into laboratories and destroy documents; prohibit
certain lethal testing of laboratory animals; and require special
labels on cans of tuna that were caught in nets that endanger
dolphins.
   Weber says consumers and many members of Congress don't realize
the impact the animal-rights movement could have on farming and
medical research, but animal-rights activists say the increasing
number of bills on the issue reflects a rising public concern about
it.

<HEAD>Aging Communists Find New Scapegoat in Western News Media</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist leaders
have found a new scapegoat to explain away mounting protests for
reform and the refugee exodus. The culprit is Western news media.
   Worldwide television broadcasts of police beating people
protesting for democratic reform in East Berlin, Leipzig and
elsewhere have pushed the Communist government to bitter
denunciations.
   One party newspaper condemned the ``gang of Western reporters,''
while East Berlin's official news agency accused Western
journalists of working in cooperation with the demonstrators.
   During protests, police roughed up journalists, smashed cameras,
confiscated film and ordered some photographers and television
crews to leave the East German capital immediately. They also
detained at least two journalists before letting them go several
hours later.
   Until recently, large street protests were a rarity in a country
whose government traditionally blamed its woes on Western agents
and an allegedly unfriendly government in Bonn. Television footage
of unrest was scarce.
   But over the last month, that has changed.
   An exodus of at least 50,000 East Germans to West Germany since
Sept. 11 emboldened those left behind to speak out and protest
during a weekend visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
East Germany's 40th anniversary.
   Gorbachev attracted dozens of Western correspondents and
television crews anxious to know what he told East Germany's
hard-line leader, Erich Honecker, who has rejected the reforms
embraced by some East bloc allies.
   Consequently, the many foreign journalists accredited to cover
Gorbachev's visit were on hand to hear the thousands of East
Germans who want reform.
   In East Berlin and five provincial cities, police over the
weekend beat and arrested hundreds and perhaps thousands of
protesters.
   East Germany's leaders were angered. The first broadside came on
Sunday, after thousands of protesters filled East Berlin's main
square.
   ``In the evening hours of Oct. 7, troublemakers tried to disturb
the people's celebrations for the 40th anniverary of the GDR (East
Germany),'' the state news agency, ADN, said. ``In cooperation with
Western news media, they banded together in the Alexanderplatz
(East Berlin's main square) and nearby areas and called out slogans
against the Republic.''
   Among the slogans the protesters chanted was, ``Gorby, Gorby,
help us!''
   The East German government tried to clamp down on reporting
Sunday, declaring whole areas of the capital off-limits to
photographers. That included a Lutheran church that has become the
focal point for East Germany's growing opposition movement.
   ``Wherever the gang of Western reporters went, especially the
television crews, certain types showed up seconds later and started
trouble,'' the Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt charged.
   But, as if to balance hostility to the Western news media, the
newspaper also said that its own photographer's camera had been
smashed in the weekend clashes.
   The nation's official newspapers printed Sunday's ADN dispatch
calling the pro-democracy demonstrators ``troublemakers.''
   West Germany lodged an official protest against the East German
interference with the Western journalists, but the East German
government's diplomatic mission in Bonn rejected the allegations.
   West Germany's ARD television network also lodged a protest,
saying the East Germans' interference with its reporters' work
violated ``international rules and regulations,'' including the
Helsinki accords.

<HEAD>China Suspends Diplomatic Relations With Liberia</HEAD>

   China suspended diplomatic relations with Liberia
today, a week after the African state normalized ties with the
Nationalist government on Taiwan.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Liberia's ambassador to
China, J. Christopher Ricks, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
this morning to be told of the Chinese decision.
   Liberia is the second nation this year, following the West
Indies island state of Grenada, to normalize ties with Taiwan, a
step which always leads to a severing of ties with the Beijing
government.
   Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, refuses to
accept dual recognition of the governments in China and Taiwan.
   A Foreign Ministry official told Ricks that Liberia's decision
ran counter to principles set forth when the two countries
established relations in 1977, when Liberia recognized the People's
Republic as the sole legal government representing China.
   ``Under such circumstances, the Chinese government cannot but
suspend its diplomatic relations with Liberia as of today,'' Xinhua
quoted the ministry official as saying.
   Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lien Chan, in announcing the
establishment of relations with Liberia, said the diplomatic
victory was achieved because ``we are making more progress
politically, economically and socially'' than Communist China.
   China now has relations with 137 countries, compared to 25 for
Taiwan.

   For many residents of
St. Croix, the resort island raked by Hurricane Hugo and then
plundered by looters, life is still chaotic.
   Three weeks after one of the century's most destructive storms
struck the U.S. Virgin Islands on its way to Puerto Rico and the
Carolinas, most of St. Croix's 56,000 inhabitants still have no
electricity or telephone service. Running water is just beginning
to be restored.
   Thousands of houses, schools and churches are destroyed, and
some beaches are fouled by sewage and fuel oil.
   Health officials have raised concerns about the possibility of
epidemics caused by contaminated water, a lack of refrigeration,
poor sanitation and millions of mosquitoes breeding in stagnant
water.
   A tent hospital in Christiansted is the only one on the island
admitting patients.
   The looting has long since stopped, but 1,000 military police
deployed by President Bush to help restore order still patrol the
streets with pistols and M-16 rifles. A curfew remains in effect.
   Scores of supermarkets and hardware, appliance and clothing
stores stand in ruins, their shelves emptied by looters.
   ``We don't have anything to eat. We don't have any stores to go
to,'' said Lillian Santos, a mother of seven children ranging in
age from 10 months to 20 years, as she stood in a Red Cross food
line in the eastern port town of Frederiksted.
   ``We need rice. We need corn flour,'' she said. ``I try not to
get depressed. I just have to think things are going to get
better.''
   St. Croix, about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico, was by far the
hardest hit of the U.S. Virgin Islands, although St. Thomas and St.
John also suffered substantial damage when Hurricane Hugo hit on
Sept. 17.
   Three people were killed on St. Croix, where winds of up to 216
mph stripped the once lush landscape of its foliage. From the air,
towns on the 84-square-mile island look as if they were bombed.
   Dr. Carlton Hodgson, director of the Frederiksted Health Center,
said he and 13 other doctors have treated nearly 5,000 patients for
storm-related injuries such as nail punctures, broken bones and
burns.
   Hodgson said he was beginning to see patients with psychological
problems caused by Hugo's devastation.
   A typical case, he said, was a man depressed over the loss of
rare vases collected over a lifetime. ``The thought of having
something to leave as a legacy is not there anymore,'' Hodgson said.
   The territorial government has estimated damage to the Virgin
Islands at $500 million, but Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said he expected
the figure to rise to $4 billion. Damage to the giant Hess Oil
refinery in St. Croix alone was $100 million, he said.
   The Bush administration has alloted $1.1 billion for hurricane
relief in North Carolina and South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Hodge said he believed it would take up to two years for St.
Croix to recover fully from the hurricane.
   ``This is going to be a long one,'' said Gerald Connolly, who is
directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief
operation in the territory. ``I think we'll be in the
full-steam-ahead recovery program for six months. We may still be
building some houses after that.''
   Federal officials say 6,300 houses in St. Croix, about one-third
of all homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed. Hodge said most of
the homeless were staying with relatives but that 500 remained in
shelters.
   Tap water started flowing to St. Croix homes on Thursday, but
was being rationed while repairs continued. Officials said it would
take at least six months to fully restore electricity and
telephones.
   There is extensive damage to hotels, guesthouses, restaurants
and marinas, and the outlook for tourism is bleak.
   However, nine of St. Croix's 13 hotels say they hope to reopen
by the start of the winter tourist season in December. Meantime,
hundreds of workers have been laid off and there is concern some
businesses might never reopen.
   Some businesses said they were ruined by looters, who went on a
four-day spree and stole everything from food and building supplies
to lawn mowers and TVs.
   FBI agents are searching homes for stolen goods, and the U.S.
attorney's office is investigating allegations that members of the
National Guard and the local police force were involved.

   George Strait, a former ranch trail boss
whose songs are White House favorites, was voted entertainer of the
year by the Country Music Association.
   Strait, 37, won country music's top honor Monday night during
the association's nationally televised 23rd annual awards show.
   Ricky Van Shelton and Kathy Mattea won top vocalist honors, and
perennial honoree Hank Williams Jr. received two awards.
   The accolade for Strait came a month after President Bush, a
country music fan, told the singer how much he enjoyed his songs.
The president made the comments during a Rose Garden ceremony
honoring Strait and 11 others for promoting vocational-technical
education.
   Monday night at the Grand Ole Opry House, Strait's peers gave
him a standing ovation as he accepted a bullet-shaped trophy for
entertainer of the year.
   ``I'm so excited. I've wanted this for so long,'' said Strait of
San Marcos, Texas. He thanked his Ace in the Hole Band, adding: ``I
truly believe audiences go away entertained.''
   Strait's July hit single, ``What's Going On in Your World,'' was
his 19th No. 1 song in eight years of recording. His album ``Beyond
the Blue Neon'' has been a top seller this year.
   Besides his crisp tenor, he is known for his spiffy cowboy hats,
neatly pressed jeans and starched shirts that accent his lean,
athletic frame.
   ``This is incredible,'' he said backstage after the awards
program. ``I'm my own worst critic. I know I'm not a great singer.''
   A fourth-generation cattle rancher who was a trail boss in the
1970s, Strait has a degree in agriculture from Southwest Texas
State University.
   Top male vocalist honors went to Shelton, an ex-pipefitter in
Virginia, for his recent hit singles ``From a Jack to a King'' and
``Hole in My Pocket.''
   ``I thank God he gave me a voice instead of big feet,'' Shelton
quipped as he accepted the award.
   Top female vocalist Mattea, a former tour guide at the Country
Music Hall of Fame, had a No. 1 single in ``Come From the Heart.''
   ``I've always liked to do this (sing), because I liked the doing
of it,'' she said, her voice choked with emotion.
   Williams, the association's entertainer of the year in 1987 and
1988, was the night's only double winner.
   Both awards were for his music video, ``There's a Tear in My
Beer'' _ on which old footage and sound recordings are used to make
it appear that Williams is singing with his late father, the famed
country artist. The vocal event of the year award goes to two
performers who don't normally sing together.
   The late Keith Whitley, 33, who died of an accidental alcohol
overdose in May, won single of the year for his hit ``I'm No
Stranger to the Rain.'' The award was accepted by his widow, singer
Lorrie Morgan, who said as her voice cracked, ``Five months ago on
this date, I lost the world's greatest husband, and country music,
in my eyes, lost the world's greatest singer.''
   The mother-daughter team the Judds won duo of the year, making
it the fifth consecutive year they won either duo of the year or
group of the year.
   ``I think as time goes by, we appreciate it (winning) more every
day,'' daughter Wynonna Judd said. ``Music isn't just a living,
it's our life.''
   Singer Hank Thompson and music publishers Cliffie Stone and the
late Jack Stapp were chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Other winners included: ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II''
by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, top album; Highway 101, group of the
year for the second straight year; fiddler Johnny Gimble, musician
of the year; ``Chiseled in Stone'' by Max D. Barnes and Vern
Gosdin, song of the year, a songwriters' award; and Clint Black,
Horizon Award for a rising star.

   An obscure chapter of World War II
history is emerging from beneath the frigid, gem-clear waters off
the Aleutian Islands, where divers made a high-tech survey of
Japanese wrecks.
   A Japanese submarine, six other vessels and what may be the hulk
of an American B-17 bomber were painstakingly charted by divers who
braved 35-degree waters off Kiska and Attu islands last month.
   The relics were measured and filmed so the National Park Service
can preserve the story of the bloody battle to drive the Japanese
from the only American soil held by foreign soldiers since the War
of 1812.
   From Sept. 5 to Sept. 22, a team of about 30 Navy and National
Park Service divers working in 20-minute shifts off the USS
Safeguard explored the sandy bottom of Kiska Harbor.
   They found the 243-foot submarine resting in 80 feet of water,
said park service archaeologist Susan Morton.
   ``It looked like it sustained direct bomb damage,'' Morton said.
``The conning tower was blown off and was sitting in the water
nearby. Other than the conning tower damage, it was in good shape.''
   The desolate, windswept islands, which lie in the nearly
uninhabited chain that stretches west from Alaska, presented
imperial Japan with a potential base for bombing runs on the
airplane plants of Seattle, a 12-hour flight to the southeast.
   Japanese soldiers took Attu and Kiska in June 1942, building
roads and even a fire-fighting water system that remain intact.
   U.S. forces stormed Attu on May 11, 1943, retaking the island in
a 19-day bloodbath which left 549 dead. It took three months to
root out the last of the Japanese on the treeless island. Only 28
of the 2,650 Japanese defenders were captured; the rest were killed
or committed suicide.
   On Kiska, 200 miles to the southeast, Japanese forces carrying
only personal gear and rifles slipped off the island in bad weather
on July 28. Unaware, allied forces bombarded Kiska and came ashore
Aug. 15. Despite the lack of an enemy garrison, the invasion force
sustained more than 300 casualties _ with most falling to booby
traps or shootouts between nervous troops.
   The park service already protects the islands' surface as a
historical preserve. Now, the wrecks beneath the island's waters
will be nominated for protection under federal historic landmark
laws, Morton said.
   The survey team aboard the Safeguard started by probing the
bottom of Kiska Harbor by sonar and marking each wreck with a buoy.
   Then, a 1-by-2-foot remote-controlled submersible with a video
camera was sent down to inspect with sonar contacts. If the find
was worth inspecting, divers made detailed, measured drawings.
   The team brought plans for ships it expected to encounter, and
as the drawings were brought to the surface, they were entered into
a computer, Morton said. ``We had up-to-the-minute
computer-generated measured drawings,'' she said.
   While the divers worked, other members of the team started an
inventory of the rich Japanese and American military historical
sites on the island itself. Some structures had collapsed, others
were obscured by more than 40 years of vegetation.
   ``A lot of the Japanese roads still are in good shape. There are
miles and miles and miles of communication lines, both American and
Japanese,'' Morton said.
   The Japanese abandoned more than 50 structures including Shinto
shrines, 6-inch coastal guns, 25mm and 75mm antiaircraft weapons
and piles of other equipment.
   The diving team planned to work off both Kiska and Attu, but
days of 50-knot winds and 25-foot seas at Attu delayed that part of
the survey until at least next year, Morton said. And more work is
needed at Kiska, where more submarines and destroyers are known to
have been sunk.
   The project's charts will be available to the public, Morton
said, and a commercial-grade video should be available in the
spring.

   A prison parolee with a history of sexual
assaults pleaded guilty to kidnapping an 11-year-old girl and told
authorities he accidentally ran over her with his car and buried
her in a Georgia forest.
   The prosecutor who negotiated the plea bargain Monday said he
hoped eventually to file murder charges against Charles
Blassingame, who agreed to help investigators find the body of
Tammy Lynn Maciulis, missing for two years.
   ``I just totally can't believe he accidentally ran her over with
his car,'' said Marinette County District Attorney Tim Duket. ``The
prosecution reserves the right to charge him with first-degree or
second-degree murder ... if in fact he takes us to the body and
through scientific or forensic evidence it can be proven the death
was not of an accidental nature.''
   Blassingame's plea in Marinette County Circuit Court is the
latest twist in a bizarre story of a prison correspondence that
brought the Georgia sex offender to live with a Marinette woman and
her teen-age daughter.
   Blassingame, 43, had been living with the woman in the same
apartment complex as Tammy's family for about three weeks when he
and the girl disappeared July 10, 1987.
   Prosecutors maintained that Blassingame kidnapped Tammy
intending to assault her. The defendant said he left town before
dawn that morning and was driving south on U.S. 41 when he
discovered the girl in the back seat of his car.
   He said Tammy asked him to take her to her father's home near
Chicago, but, worried because of his criminal record, he made her
get out of the car. While driving away, he said, he accidentally
hit her.
   Then, he says, he put her body in a duffel bag, drove south and
eventually buried her in some woods outside Dalton, Ga.
   The prosecutor, who labeled the story ``incredible,'' originally
charged Blassingame with kidnapping and enticing a minor for
immoral purposes in Tammy's disappearance. He also was charged with
attempted second-degree sexual assault on his girlfriend's
16-year-old daughter.
   The latter two counts were dropped in the plea bargain, which
calls for Blassingame to serve 25 years in prison on the kidnapping
charge. If the body isn't found, Blassingame has agreed to plead
guilty to extortion in an unrelated case and serve a additional six
years.
   Circuit Judge John Hoffmann accepted the agreement but delayed
sentencing until after the search for the body.
   Authorities said Tammy's mother, Phyllis Nicklaus, assented to
the terms of the agreement.
   According to the prosecutor, Blassingame has at least four
sex-related convictions. Paroled after serving about seven years of
a 30-year term in one of the cases, Blassingame went to Wisconsin
in mid-June 1987 because of a romance with Tammy's neighbor, his
prison pen pal, Duket said. They struck up a correspondence through
a pen-pal advertisement in a magazine, he said.
   The relationship soon soured, Duket said, noting that the
couple's prison correspondence would have been used as evidence if
the case had gone to trial.
   The prisoner asked for pictures of his pen pal's daughter in a
swimsuit.
   Duket recalled the contents of the prisoner's letters, saying:
``He wanted (the woman) to adopt a girl between 7 and 11 ... He
asks whether (the woman's daughter) is a virgin or not, because
he's going to be her father, after all ... ''

   Delegates who dissolved the country's
ruling Communist Party ended a four-day congress today after voting
to keep their old leader but picking a reform slate to fill other
top posts.
   A closed session chose Rezsoe Nyers, chairman of the dissolved
party, late Monday as president of its successor, the Hungarian
Socialist Party, which professes to now embrace constitutional
democracy.
   The vote followed debate in which key reformers opposed to some
of Nyers beliefs _ including his support for continued party
influence in the workplace _ reluctantly shelved reservations to
avoid a possible split.
   Reformers want a clear break with the past and that includes
depoliticizing the workplace, where under traditional one-party in
the East bloc the leaders of party cells organized in the workplace
have been de facto bosses.
   The congress also elected a 25-member National Steering
Committee to replace the Communist Party Politburo.
   Among its members are key reformers Imre Pozsgay and Premier
Miklos Nemeth, who belonged to the old party's collective
leadership.
   But the two were not chosen as vice presidents to Nyers, an
indication that most of the 1,200 delegates were unwilling to
completely part with the past. The new party's statutes had
foreseen two vice presidents and liberals proposed Pozsgay and
Nemeth.
   However, the clearly reformist makeup of the Steering Committee
_ the party's executive body _ was expected to please some liberals
unhappy with the choice of Nyers.
   Despite the party's commitment to multiparty democracy,
reformist delegates expressed fear that the it does not differ
enough from its predecessor to attract much support among the
people.
   The choice of Nyers was likely to increase anxieties among
leading reformers that their party will fare poorly in Hungary's
first free national elections in 41 years, which have been promised
by June.
   In its last two hours after midnight the congress approved the
following resolutions _ all falling short of the wishes of the most
committed reformers among the delegates:
   _ Start of discussions in Parliament about the fate of
party-controlled assets accrued illegally during its predecessor's
41 years in power.
   _ Informal support of the largely volunteer Worker's Militia,
formerly controlled by the Communist Party and facing dissolution,
if it decides to give up its paramilitary character and become an
emergency aid organization during fires, floods and other
catastrophes.
   _ Declaration of Oct. 23, the start of the 1956 nationalist
uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks, as a ``Day of National
Reconciliation.''
   Earlier, Nyers, tired but clearly elated, told reporters that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been the first to
congratulate him.
   ``Gorbachev conducts very fast diplomacy,'' he said. ``They gave
me his telegram within two hours of my election.''
   The National Steering Committee list contained names of
reformers only, including some former Politburo members such as
Foreign Minister Gyula Horn. Missing were the names of other, less
reform-minded Politburo members.
   Politburo member Karoly Grosz, the most conservative of the old
party's collective leadership, was among those not elected to the
new body. But he had said previously that he would not seek a
senior post.
   The new leaders were elected just hours after the party adopted
a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break with a
past that advocated the Leninst dictatorship of the proletariat.
   Delegates overwhelmingly approved striving for ``a
constitutional state based on a multiparty system, where the source
of power is the will of the people expressed in free elections.''
   The party changed its name in a vote on Saturday.
   Before Monday night's secret vote for its new leaders, there
were serious ideological rifts among the three top candidates in
the collective leadership.
   But Nemeth, said earlier to be siding with Pozsgay against
Nyers, told reporters going into the congress hall for the vote
that ``the danger of a split has been averted.''
   Nyers, criticized by some reformers for not being a strong
advocate of barring old-style Communists from the new party,
repeated that there would be no purge.
   ``We will part from certain people, but it should be a friendly
parting,'' he told reporters after his election.
   The congress has rejected radical reformers' demands that
die-hard Marxists be barred from the new party, stipulating instead
that all accepting its orientation in writing could become members.
   Reformers were further embittered Sunday when Nyers declared
that he backed continued political organizing in the workplace _
which Pozsgay opposes.
   The congress subsequently voted for the motion to continue
organizing at factories and in offices, despite reformist protests.

<HEAD>Study: Top `Family Values' Don't Include Abortion, School Prayer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians who claim to fight on
behalf of ``family values'' in battling abortion and promoting
prayer in school may be off target, according to a study released
today.
   ``Politicians and pundits of various stripes have attempted to
co-opt the term (family values) in pursuit of their own agendas,''
said the study on the American family, which included information
from 1,200 randomly selected respondents.
   The survey was commissioned by Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
   The respondents were presented with 28 value statements and
asked how well the term ``family value'' described each one.
Topping the list of responses were love and emotional support for
family members, respect for others and taking responsibility for
one's actions.
   ``Being in favor of prayer in school'' ranked 25th and
``opposing abortion'' ranked 27th.
   ``It tells us that our legislators really don't know what
they're doing,'' said Dr. Lee Salk, who was hired by
Springfield-based Massachusetts Mutual to review the study
findings. ``They're all paying lip service to something they've not
really examined.''
   Salk said a true political ``family value'' might be granting
paternity leave or employers giving time off for parents to attend
school functions.
   The study said Americans are changing the way they define
family, but family is still the center of their lives.
   By 3-to-1, Americans defined the family as ``a group of people
who love and care for each other,'' over the traditional
definitions of people related by blood or marriage.
   Eighty-one percent of the respondents listed ``family'' as one
of their top two sources of pleasure, with ``friends'' the next
most mentioned source.
   ``People cherish the family and they cherish it because of their
own experience even when their experience has been less than
perfect,'' said Dr. Albert Solnit of the Child Study Center at Yale
University, one of the advisers to the study.
   ``Even with the rate of divorce and even with the rate of
remarriage the expectation of being able to love someone and being
able to be cared for by someone is universal,'' Solnit said.
   While family was a top source of pleasure to Americans, it also
was a chief source of worry, the survey found. Fifty-one percent
said providing financial security for their families was one of the
things they worry about most.
   Americans also believe that the root cause of social problems is
found in the family, with the largest group, 20 percent, blaming
the problems on ``parents failing to discipline their children.''
   But the question of whether the American family is actually in
decline drew a paradoxical response that Salk described as, ``I'm
OK, but everybody else out there is not.''
   More than half of respondents gave a negative rating to the
quality of American family life. But 71 percent said they were at
least ``very satisfied'' with their own family life.
   The survey said that might mean respondents weren't willing to
speak honestly about their own problems, or that the declining
American family is a myth fueled by widespread media reports of
crime and social ills.
   The survey was part of Massachusetts Mutual's ``American Family
Values Program,'' initiated in 1988 to get a better understanding
of the family, their basic market, said spokeswoman Eva Dion.
   The program included discussions with family experts, an
analysis of media issues, discussion with four focus groups of
families in Baltimore and Denver, and a random telephone survey
conducted in June. The margin of error for the sample was less than
3.5 percent.

   By the time firefighters arrived at the
schoolhouse, flames were shooting from the windows. The blaze, one
of hundreds started each year by juveniles in the Houston area, was
the creation of 13-year-old Samuel.
   The seventh-grader had gone to the school for shelter from the
rain. Once inside, he flicked his cigarette lighter until it
ignited books.
   Now, five months after counseling and participation in a
nationally recognized Houston Fire Department program called Cease
Fire, Samuel says he's glad he was caught.
   ``I tell other kids not to do things like that,'' he says. ``I
can do better than what I had been doing. I tell them not to do the
bad stuff. I learned the bad stuff the hard way.''
   Samuel and about 1,500 other juveniles, ranging in age from 10
to 16, and their parents have gone through the program, the
brainchild of Houston Fire Marshal Eddie Corral.
   The program ``puts out more fires than a fire truck,'' said
Corral, a 32-year fire department veteran and marshal since 1981.
   Cease Fire is marking its eighth anniversary this week in
conjunction with National Fire Prevention Week. Earlier this year,
the U.S. Fire Administration cited the Houston program as one of
the nation's most successful and innovative juvenile fire
prevention pilot programs.
   The majority of U.S. arson crimes are committed by children, who
cause more than $11 billion in damage per year, Corral said.
   He said about 50 percent of Houston's arson fires were set by
youths at the time of the program's inception; now he estimates
that juvenile arson amounts to about 10 percent of all arson crimes.
   Cease Fire also has held 12-week courses at various neighborhood
community centers. Upon graduation, each young person is given a
badge and acts as a junior fire marshal in neighborhoods. Thousands
have attended the classes, he said.
   Now, however, Corral said he is scrambling for funds. The
program's counseling service had been supported by $100,000 in
federal grants, but no federal funding will be available in the
next year.
   He said he will seek private funds and continue parts of the
program.
   Researchers at the University of Texas' School of Public Health,
meanwhile, have applied for a grant to study the case histories of
the 1,500 juvenile arsonists who have been through Cease Fire,
Corral said. He hopes the study will renew interest in his program.
   ``Our highest priority is to get our message to kids early
enough so they refrain from experimenting or playing with fire,''
Corral said. ``Prevention is the key to fire protection.''

buildings to sway. There were no immediate reports of damage.
   The quake, which registered 3 on the Japanese scale of 7 in
Tokyo, struck at 3:28 p.m. and also measured 3 in neighboring
Yokohama and Chiba cities, and 2 in other outlying areas adjacent
to the Japanese capital.
   The quake's epicenter was estimated to be 50 miles beneath Tokyo
Bay, according to the Central Meteorological Agency's Earthquake
Division.
   An earthquake measuring 3 on the Japanese scale can knock

<HEAD>Abortion is Focus of Debate Between Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate J.
Marshall Coleman accused Democratic foe L. Douglas Wilder of
pandering to women's fears by attacking his strong anti-abortion
stance.
   During their first televised debate Monday night, Coleman said
state law allowing unrestricted first-trimester abortions would not
change if he becomes governor.
   ``You know that it is a false fear,'' Coleman said.
   But Coleman didn't say he would veto any repeal measure _ only
that the state General Assembly would not pass such a bill.
   Wilder charged that Coleman was trying to ``turn the clock
back'' on abortion.
   The battle over abortion has heated up since July, when the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld restrictions placed on abortion by the state
of Missouri.
   Coleman, a former state attorney general, and Wilder, the
lieutenant governor, are vying to succeed Democrat Gerald L.
Baliles, who is barred by the state constitution from seeking
re-election. Wilder is trying to become the nation's first black
elected governor.
   Coleman has said repeatedly he would allow abortions only when
necessary to save the mother's life. Wilder said Coleman refuses to
rule out signing a bill banning abortions for victims of rape or
incest.
   Coleman would say only that ``there will be no law restricting
abortion in cases of rape or incest when I am governor.''
   He said Wilder's attacks have been insensitive to women and an
effort to gain politically from a highly emotional issue.
   But Wilder said, ``I trust the women of Virginia, and that's the
difference between you and I.''

<HEAD>Jamie Fiske in Critical but Stable Condition After Spleen Removed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE LAHAMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgery to remove 7-year-old Jamie Fiske's
enlarged spleen enabled doctors to inspect the liver the youngster
received at 11 months. They liked what they saw.
   Jamie, whose father's desperate appeal for a liver donor six
years ago helped shape the nation's organ transplant policy, was in
critical but stable condition after Monday's surgery.
   Dr. John Najarian, chief of surgery at University of Minnesota
Hospital, said Jamie's other organs ``looked perfectly fine''
during the three-hour surgery.
   ``Her liver is as normal as we can possibly hope for it to be.
It looks perfectly normal,'' he said.
   The girl's long-range prognosis is excellent, he said, adding
that he has felt all along that she could live a normal life. ``I
feel even more convinced now than before, since we now have had an
actual opportunity to see her liver,'' Najarian said.
   Najarian said doctors are satisfied that the enlarged spleen was
the cause of internal bleeding, which had hospitalized the
youngster three times in the past month.
   The spleen was seven or eight times the normal size, he said, or
about the size of a melon. A normal spleen for a youngster that age
is about the size of a lemon, he said.
   Najarian performed Jamie's liver transplant at the same hospital
when she was 11 months old. That operation followed her family's
nationally televised pleas for a liver donor.
   Their efforts ultimately led to the National Transplant Act of
1984, which created a national computer system used to match donors
with recipients.
   Najarian said Monday's spleen-removal surgery left the youngster
without a ``very important'' source of fighting infection. Because
of that, he said, she was given a vaccination to guard against
pneumonia-type illnesses and will have to take daily penicillin
tablets the rest of her life.
   ``Hopefully, she'll do well and be out of here in a week's
time,'' he said. ``It's hard to predict.''
   Jamie has survived longer than any of the 200 other liver
transplant patients at the university since 1968, Najarian said.
   She was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition in
which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the Fiskes
learned that only a liver transplant could save her life.
   Jamie's father, Charles, said after the operation that he and
his wife, Marilyn, were looking forward to tickling Jamie's toes
when the anesthesia wore off. The Fiskes live in Bridgewater, Mass.
   ``She's as healthy as she can be considering the fact that she
was dying back in 1982,'' he said.

   Four divers experimenting in long-term
underwater survival have plunged into a 74-day mission to test
breathing compounds that might eventually be used in orbiting space
stations, researchers say.
   The divers, who submerged on Monday, will live in a capsule
simulating dives up to 980 feet deep until Dec. 21 in the operation
directed by the French navy and the Maritime Expertise Co., or
Comex, of Marseille, Comex said.
   A team of 24 scientists will gauge the reaction of the divers to
a hydrogen-oxygen breathing compound researchers hope will allow
people to stay under water longer and at greater depth than the
traditional hydrogen, oxygen and helium.
   They are also testing a helium-oxygen blend, though the
hydrogen-oxygen blend is the focus of the experiment.
   The $3.13 million experiment, dubbed ``Hydra-IX,'' also will
measure the physical and psychological effects of long submersion,
Comex said.
   The results could help submarines reach lower depths and,
eventually, aid in the development of manned space stations,
according to the National Center for Space Studies.
   The divers, whose identities were not disclosed, will work seven
hours, 30 minutes daily and communicate by telephone with their
families once a week. They will also receive televised newscasts.
   The experiment calls for the men, aged 28 to 33, to spend the
first three days at 33 feet under water on a mixture of helium and
oxygen.
   They will then be lowered to 230 feet and be fed a mixture of
hydrogen and oxygen, which will be raised in pressure over eight
days until simulating a depth of nearly 1,000 feet. After 20 days,
helium will be introduced and hydrogen phased out until the divers
are breathing a helium-oxygen compound.

<TEXT>
   People gather at a fruit stand,
speaking in low voices. They are talking about a newspaper photo of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The picture was taken Wednesday, the day after Noriega survived
a coup attempt. He stands at a window at Panamanian Defense Forces
headquarters, waving to a crowd.
   Behind the general is an image _ not a person _ and they can't
make it out. Some Panamanians do not rule out supernatural
intervention on Noriega's behalf.
   It is said the general has a Haitian spiritual advisor, that he
worships African gods. Clearly they are powerful, for he has put
down two coup attempts in 18 months and fended off the United
States, which wants him out of office.
   Many rumors roam the streets of Panama, where people fear the
general so much they are afraid to let it show.
   On Oct. 3, Noriega was captured and held for five hours by
rebels. But he survived, retained his post as head of the Defense
Forces and his grip on power in Panama.
   Now it is said the general will stop at nothing and Panamanians
fear nothing will stop him.
   ``Blows for the undecided,'' Noriega said two days after the
uprising. ``Lead for the enemy and silver for the friend.''
   Officially, ten rebels died in the uprising, eight of them
officers. But there are rumors of trucks loaded with the corpses of
fallen mutineers.
   Some reports say Noriega personally shot the leader of last
week's abortive coup. ``You are a dead man,'' he is supposed to
have told Maj. Moises Giroldi, who withered and dropped his gun.
   A list is being made of the disloyal, the government employees
who do not enthusiastically support the general.
   ``The list, the list, the list,'' Noriega said when he announced
the purge. ``Names, names.''
   On the day of the coup attempt, people thought the military
strongman had fallen. They waved handkerchiefs or honked horns to
celebrate, while some danced in the streets. A few church bells
rang.
   But Noriega didn't fall. And now he's taking down names.
   Two days after the coup attempt Noriega's gunmen dispersed a
crowd around opposition leader Guillermo Endara's office and sent
him running with blows.
   ``I did not hear anything. It is not good for me to hear
anything,'' said a street vendor plying his trade a few yards away.
   A homeowner lets in a stranger who wants to borrow a telephone.
When he realizes the stranger is a journalist, his finger comes
down on the button to cut off the call in mid-conversation. ``No
politics here,'' he says.
   Some taxi drivers won't pick up journalists. It would be bad for
business to be seen with a reporter who may want to go to unsafe
places such as the cemetery where Giroldi was buried Monday.
   One fallen rebel was refused burial in his family parish. The
priest, a Defense Forces chaplain, had a choice between God and
Noriega. He chose the general.
   Noriega has taken on God before. His troops tear-gassed churches
when dissent was still public.
   People avoided Mass the Sunday after the coup. Just in case.
   Giroldi's widow did not attend his burial Monday. She and her
threee children were hidden at a U.S. military base, Fort Clayton
after the coup. The Washington Post reported today they and 36
others were flown to the United States over the weekend.
   ``They murdered him,'' Giroldi's mother cried, throwing herself
on the casket. She said he had been shot once in the head and twice
in the chest.
   A wreath of red carnations lay at the foot of the altar. ``From
your old friends,'' it said. No names.
   The opposition, which once rallied tens of thousands in streets
and won the May 7 elections Noriega later annulled, sat out the
uprising.
   ``We'd just have been supplying the bodies,'' Christian Democrat
leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said later.
   ``The truth is, we are all afraid,'' another opposition leader
said.
   Even the unkind nickname Noriega earned because of his
pockmarked skin _ Pineapple Face _ has taken on new meaning. The
pineapple, people say, is the toughest of tropical fruits. It
doesn't fall. It has spines.
   Panamanians made their feelings about Noriega clear in May
balloting. The United States also insists he has to go.
   ``You'll have to kill me first,'' he said, facing the mutineers.
He has made that perfectly clear.
   The United States says the rebels weren't prepared to take that
step. Nor were they prepared to hand Noriega over to face U.S. drug
trafficking indictments.

<HEAD>Charleston, S.C., Mayor Expects No Long-Term Impact to Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo put a lot of people out
of work temporarily, but shouldn't cause long-term damage to the
economy, the mayor said.
   Also Monday, Army troops arrived to help cart away mountains of
debris and smashed appliances and furniture left in the storm's
wake.
   Unemployment in South Carolina jumped from 4.5 percent to more
than 16 percent after the hurricane, which struck Sept. 21 at
Charleston and killed 25 people in the Carolinas.
   Hugo, which hit Puerto Rico and several Carribean islands before
reaching the U.S. mainland, did an estimated $4 billion to $5
billion damage in South Carolina and $725 million in North Carolina.
   In Charleston, which bore the brunt of the storm, unemployment
is estimated at 10 percent, Mayor Joseph Riley said Monday. He
predicted that the economic forces fueling the city's most
prosperous period in 100 years would help the economy recover
quickly.
   ``Our goal is to have our tourism economy back to full steam as
quickly as possible so that jobs that have been lost can be
replaced,'' Riley said.
   Growth will continue, he predicted, as thousands migrate to the
area to retire or work in the beach resorts.
   ``Charleston was booming more than it had in 100 years and the
reasons for that boom have not changed,'' the mayor said.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that unemployed youths be given
federal job training so they can help rebuild the region.
   ``The silver lining in the cloud is the chance to train and
retrain people,'' Jackson said Monday in Greenville. ``Let's train
our youths to do the work.''
   Jackson said he met last week with U.S. Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole and she was receptive to the proposal.
   About 250 engineers and soldiers from Fort Stewart, Ga., were
expected to hit the streets today in Charleston, Berkeley and
Dorchester counties to help clean up. They brought 13 front-end
loaders and 40 dump trucks.
   Riley said he hoped much of the debris could be cleared in two
weeks, although Army officials weren't as optimistic.
   ``We could have people cleaning up for the next six months,''
said Lt. Col. Jim Scott, district engineer for the Charleston
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   The Army will remain in the state for another week while the
corps arranges with private contractors to complete the work.
   Streets throughout the region known as the Lowcountry are
littered with piles of leaves, broken limbs and logs from felled
trees _ some piled so high they obscure the view of the houses
beyond.
   Refrigerators and other appliances are piled up along the
streets in low-lying areas and islands that flooded during the
storm.
   No one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and
highways, but Riley said 1,000 truck loads a day are moved out of
Charleston alone.
   The federal government agreed last week to pick up the tab for
the entire cost of removing the debris. That will save the state
and local governments as much as $50 million, Riley said.

Athletics, spring training partners for more than two decades,
finally play for real Saturday when the Bay Bridge World Series
opens in Oakland.
   Giants first baseman Will Clark set National League playoff
records for hits, runs, extra-base hits, total bases, batting
average and slugging percentage as he led his team to a 3-2 victory
Monday over the Chicago Cubs. The Giants won the playoff series,
4-1.
   ``Will Clark proved all season long, and this was just the
capper, that he's the best hitter in baseball,'' the Cubs' Mark
Grace said. ``I don't even think that's arguable.''
   The pennant is the 16th for the Giants since the World Series
started in 1903, but 14 came when the team played in New York. The
Giants moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, three years
after their last World Series victory, a four-game sweep of
Cleveland.
   The Athletics moved to Oakland from Kansas City following the
1967 season. Since arriving in the Bay area, the A's have won world
championships in 1972, 1973, 1974 and an AL pennant last year.
   The last time a World Series was played in one metropolitan area
was 1956, when the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in
seven games.

   A jury convicted a man of planting 13
bombs around a southern Indiana city in a plot that prosecutors
said stemmed from a lifelong rivalry with a state legislator.
   ``I know I'm innocent; God knows I'm innocent,'' a
Bible-carrying John M. Hubbard III told reporters as marshals led
him from the courthouse.
   The jury deliberated just over three hours Monday before
returning guilty verdicts on 29 counts in U.S. District Court.
   Family members who sat in the courtroom, including Hubbard's
wife, Julie, began to cry as the verdict was read. Hubbard also
wiped away tears.
   ``We love you and still believe in you,'' Hubbard's mother, Opal
Kramer, told him as he was being led away.
   Hubbard turned to her and said, ``Let the world know.''
   Hubbard, 32, and Jerry A. Conrad, 42, were arrested May 17 and
charged in connection with the 13 bombs that were found July 5,
1988, beneath bridges and behind buildings in the city of Salem.
   Conrad, who worked with Hubbard at a Salem factory, was
convicted on all counts following a trial last month.
   The charges against Hubbard included conspiracy, illegal
possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making bombs and 13 counts of
attempting to destroy bridges and buildings used in interstate
commerce.
   Prosecutors contended Hubbard was motivated to place the bombs
around Salem because of his lifelong rivalry with state Rep. Frank
Newkirk Jr., a Democrat from Salem. ``He resented him for a
lifetime of accomplishments that he thought Frank Newkirk Jr. had
that Mr. Hubbard didn't,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Stanley
Powell said during closing arguments.
   He described Hubbard as a ``guerrilla fighter in his own mind.''
   ``He wanted the thrill of being able to see the fear and the
panic on people's faces about the bombs and the chaos he had
created in Salem,'' Powell said.
   Watts rested his case without calling any defense witnesses. The
attorney said he felt the government had not proved its case
against Hubbard beyond a reasonable doubt.
   He told jurors the government's case was ``riddled with
mistakes'' and based on circumstantial evidence.
   Watts said he was uncertain whether the case would be appealed.
Judge Sarah Evans Barker set no date for sentencing.
   Hubbard, who has been in custody since his arrest in May, faces
up to 285 years in prison.

<HEAD>Construction Blast Hurls 500-Pound Boulder Through Roof of Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WESTOVER, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Susan Louden thought a tree had crashed
into the roof of her home when she felt a rumble that shook her
``right down to the fillings in my teeth.''
   ``Boy, was I wrong,'' Mrs. Louden said Monday as she pointed to
a 500-pound limestone boulder lobbed through her roof by a
construction-site blast. The stone lodged in the floor of a bedroom
shared by Mrs. Louden's sons, ages 8 and 10. The boys weren't in
the room, and nobody was hurt.
   Blasting by workers preparing a shopping mall site hurled the
boulder 300 feet in the air, and nearly 200 feet sideways, said
Monongalia County Sheriff's Deputy Sandra Bonnett. A smaller chunk
of rock also hit the house, she said.
   ``I feel like I'm in Beirut,'' said Greg Louden, 39, an agent
for a life insurance company. ``What's the difference between this
and a rocket attack?''
   The boulder ripped through layers of pink insulation, wood and
wallpaper before coming to rest midway between the first and second
floors.
   ``All the kids were out of the house, the Lord was looking out
for us,'' said Louden. ``If this had happened on a Tuesday my
4-year-old daughter would have been home.''
   Warren Wriston, a supervisor for the Mashuda Corp., general
contractors for the new Morgantown Mall, said the incident was
``just one of those things that happen.''
   ``Anything we do we do legally,'' said Wriston, as he supervised
a crew covering three large holes in the roof of the Loudens' home.
   Vic Mashuda, president of Mashuda Corp. in Pittsburgh, said his
company is prepared to pay for any damage caused by his crews.
   Bonnett said the case would be turned over to the Monongalia
County prosecutor's office.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes First Strike Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in the Soviet history,
lawmakers have voted into place a legal framework that gives
workers the right to strike.
   But the complex measure passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature
on Monday also bans strikes in almost a dozen strategic sectors of
the economy.
   Only 12 of the chamber's more than 400 deputies voted against
the bill, with 10 members abstaining, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   The Supreme Soviet reconvened today to consider price
stabilization measures, Tass said. Inflation has only recently been
acknowledged to be a problem in the Soviet Union.
   The need for a labor law became urgent this summer when hundreds
of thousands of coal miners went on strike for better working
conditions and political reform.
   The law was also needed to curb the now commonplace stoppages
provoked by ethnic conflict. Thousands of Russian workers in
Moldavia and Estonia walked off the job recently to protest laws
they viewed as disciminatory.
   Although strikes were not expressly forbidden by Soviet law, the
few stoppages that occurred before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
came to power were brutally suppressed.
   Gorbachev has not moved to crush labor unrest but has warned
that widespread strikes threaten to undermine his efforts to
overhaul the economy to make it more market-oriented and encourage
greater democracy in politics.
   He backed the right-to-strike law, which prohibits strikes that
``create a threat to people's lives and health.''
   It also bans stoppages by workers in railroads, public
transportation, civil aviation, communications, energy, defense,
government bodies, law enforcement and round-the-clock production
industries, the agency said.
   In addition, the law forbids politically or ethnically motivated
strikes, Tass said.
   Only with all other options exhausted does the union have the
right to strike. To launch a legal strike, a union must first give
a ``conciliatory commission'' comprising representatives of both
labor and management five days to resolve the dispute. If that
fails, arbitration has seven days to work things out before the
union may call a walkout.
   Lawmakers of the Supreme Soviet, which was a mere rubber stamp
for decisions of the Communist leadership until Gorbachev's reforms
gave it real power, contested many of the law's provisions Monday
and voted on some 50 proposed amendments.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov suggested that some
form of political strike be considered legal, but his proposal was
defeated, Tass said. Several deputies complained that too many
sectors of the economy were prohibited from striking. Under the new
law, those sectors can appeal to the Supreme Soviet with their
complaints.
   The law follows an emergency measure passed by the Supreme
Soviet on Oct. 3 banning strikes until the general law could be
passed.
   The coal strikes over the summer paralyzed much of the crucial
coal industry and ended only after the government conceded to
virtually all the miners' demands.
   The miners had sought more consumer goods and more local control
over their industries.
   Although he expressed sympathy for the miners, Gorbachev has
said repeatedly that such strikes could lead to anarchy and
economic disaster.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worker fell 12 stories from the roof of an
office building, crashing through a glass atrium and striking
another person before landing on a table in a basement cafeteria.
   Troy Livingston, 24, an electrician who had been working on a
neon sign atop the Medical Center Tower I, was in critical
condition after the fall Monday, said Nita Dotson, nursing
supervisor at St. Luke's Lutheran Hospital.
   As he fell, Livingston hit a 23-year-old man sitting near the
second-floor landing, said police Sgt. Pat Kilough.
   The man, whose identity was withheld, was in stable condition at
St. Luke's.
   ``My eyes just trailed him right down until he hit the floor,''
said Jerry Fosselman, who was eating lunch in the cafeteria.
   ``There were some ladies screaming downstairs pretty bad,'' said
Oscar Gallegos, another witness. ``It was chaotic. There were
people all over. There were doctors and nurses all over.''
   Livingston finished work on the sign, took off his safety
harness, and was walking backward, gathering rope, when he fell,
Kilough said.
   ``He backed right over the edge of the building,'' Kilough said.
   Livingston landed on a table, then bounced onto the floor.

<HEAD>Thatcher's Tories Hold Conference Amid Fears Of Currency Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party opened its annual four-day conference today amid
fears of a currency crisis and with its popularity at an eight-year
low.
   Mrs. Thatcher told party members at a pre-conference dinner in
the northwest seaside resort of Blackpool late Monday: ``The
economy is stronger than ever. Living standards are higher than
ever.''
   But newspaper headlines today spoke of crisis.
   The London Times wrote, ``Tories gather in Blackpool as shares
and sterling slump,'' referring to the British currency.
   The Independent read, ``Fears of crisis as pound plunges.
Sterling collapse triggers sharp fall in share prices.''
   The Financial Times, Britain's leading business daily, said,
``Substantial selling on fears that interest rates will not be
raised further.''
   The pound was down early today by 1 cent, and 4 cents lower than
it was before Lawson raised the British equivalent of the prime
rate by 1 point to 15 percent on Thursday.
   ``The interest rate rise was necessary and this government
always does what is necessary and always has,'' said Mrs. Thatcher,
who attended Monday night's dinner with Lawson.
   Lawson ordered the increase following interest rate increases in
West Germany and five other European countries. It was Britain's
11th rise since the rate stood at 7.5 percent in June 1988.
   The pound fell heavily on foreign exchange markets following
weekend reports that Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson were at odds over the
interest rate increases, designed to support the currency and hold
down inflation.
   But Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker insisted in an
interview Monday with the British Broadcasting Corp. that there was
no split in Cabinet ranks.
   Higher interest rates make the British currency more attractive
to foreign investors and curb inflation by making credit more
expensive for consumers. But business leaders have warned that high
rates could send the economy into recession.
   The latest interest rate increase has pushed up the cost of
monthly mortgage payments for home-buyers, adding to the growing
unpopularity of Mrs. Thatcher's government.
   New opinion polls show the Conservatives 7 to 11 points behind
Labor. They suggest voters are increasingly disenchanted with
63-year-old Mrs. Thatcher and many are opposed to almost all her
latest programs.
   Particularly unpopular, the polls show, is legislation to sell
off the water and electricity utilities to private enterprise, a
new property tax, and a shakeup of the free National Health
Service. They are cornerstones of the third five-year term Mrs.
Thatcher won in June 1987.
   The economy, meanwhile, has taken a turn for the worse. The
trade deficit hit a record $3.61 billion in August and inflation
has risen to an annual rate of 7.3 percent.
   The conference follows a highly successful opposition Labor
Party gathering last week. Labor adopted a new, more centrist,
platform and ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament,
which cost the party votes in the last election.
   The conservatives, who have trailed Labor for four months in the
opinion polls, are falling further behind in their most consistent
slump since a 1981 recession.
   Police marksmen scanned the Blackpool seafront from the roof of
the conference hotel. Tight security has surrounded Conservative
conferences since the Irish Republican Army blew up Mrs. Thatcher's
hotel in Brighton, southern England, during the 1984 party
convention, killing five people.

   A malfunctioning alarm system slowed
firefighters' response to a nursing home blaze, the fire marshal
said, as the death toll from the fire rose to 11 from nine.
   The alarm at the Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent
Center should have been automatically relayed to the fire
department, Fire Marshal Carl Welch said Monday.
   But because of a blown fuse in a control box, the alarm wasn't
relayed through MGI Security Services Inc. when the fire broke out
Thursday night, Welch said.
   ``The alarm never left the building,'' Welch said after
investigators checked MGI's records.
   Had the system worked properly, Welch said, firefighters would
have been gotten to the scene earlier. The blaze was reported by
four calls to the 911 emergency number. Welch said the response
time after the calls was four minutes.
   Two of the 105 people hospitalized after the blaze died Monday
of complications of smoke inhalation, authorities said. Ettie F.
Cunningham, 88, died at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, hospital
spokeswoman Elizabeth A. Miley said; Katherine F. Hansthorn, 97,
died at DePaul Medical Center, according to hospital spokeswoman
Shirley White.
   Five people remained in critical condition, authorities said.
   Seven of Hillhaven's 161 residents died inside the home during
the fire, and two more were pronounced dead on arrival at area
hospitals.
   The fire is believed to have started when a patient, smoking in
his room against regulations, accidentally dropped a match on his
bed.
   Most of the injuries were from smoke inhalation.

   Ghosts and goblins aren't scary enough
for one police chief who plans to unleash a nightmare on his
community this Halloween _ a haunted ``crack house.''
   Police Chief John L. Lechliter's Halloween attraction will
combine a fake drug market, courtroom, emergency ward, prison and
morgue to show children and adults what happens to those who sell
or use cocaine and other drugs.
   ``We're talking about real life here,'' said Lechliter, head of
an eight-man police force in a town of 2,000. ``They (children) may
go to bed with nightmares. I want to have an impact.''
   The haunted house will be in the former county jail, a
century-old three-story stone building. Volunteers will act out
brief scenes showing a drug sale, an arrest, a trial, and a drug
user's accidental overdose.
   The performers will strive for accuracy to let ``kids know about
what it's like to be on drugs,'' he said.
   About two dozen people, including county sheriff's deputies and
paramedics, will help run the free attraction for four nights
around Halloween. Local merchants are financing the effort.
   ``It's not a bad notion,'' said John W. Sause Jr., Queen Anne
County's Circuit Court judge who has signed up to play himself in
the courtroom scenes. ``The more people get involved, the more
we'll get out of it.''
   The haunted crack house may be the first crack house of any kind
for the rural eastern Maryland community. Lechliter said he has
made only one arrest involving crack _ a highly addictive form of
cocaine _ since he took over as chief last January.
   While there may not be a big crack problem, ``there are drugs in
this town, no doubt about it,'' the police chief said. ``I don't
imagine we're much different in that respect than any other town in
America.''

<HEAD>Hong Kong Police Say China Beefs Up Security Along Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has tightened border security in an
apparent effort to prevent people from fleeing to this British
colony during a dispute over repatriation of illegal immigrants,
police said today.
   China refused for the first time Sunday to take back 70 people
who immigrated illegally to the territory. The move came in
apparent retaliation for Hong Kong's allowing a Chinese swimmer who
had sought political asylum in the colony to leave for the United
States.
   No illegal immigrants have been returned since. A Hong Kong
spokesman said discussions to resolve the deadlock have proceeded
through normal diplomatic channels, but refused to elaborate.
   The territory's government has routinely sent back all illegal
immigrants from China since 1980. The sudden refusal by Communist
China to accept them has brought anxiety to capitalist Hong Kong,
which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police
believe China has stepped up patrols along the border to prevent
people from escaping after its June military crackdown on the
student-led pro-democracy movement.
   China's crackdown caused concern among Hong Kong residents for
their own freedoms after 1997.
   Government radio quoted unnamed police sources as saying Chinese
border patrols appeared to have doubled in strength. They were also
more heavily armed than usual, police said.
   It was not immediately clear what effect the added Chinese
security would have.
   Hong Kong police reported 49 illegal immigrants were caught in
the 24-hour period that ended at 5 a.m. today, a total that a
police spokeswoman described as ``normal.''
   Meanwhile, Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson urged the
resumption of normal arrangements for repatriation of illegal
immigrants as soon as possible.
   ``It's much better if (we can) get back to normal handling of
matters on the border, because that is the way to make sure that
confidence is maintained in Hong Kong,'' he told reporters.
   More than 12,000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated to
China so far this year.

   Fire broke out in a transformer at the
Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant but was confined to a section
separated by concrete from the reactor and posed no threat to the
public, the utility said today.
   No one was injured in fire, which was reported at 11:20 p.m.
Monday and extinguished by 2:45 a.m. today, Carolina Power &amp; Light
Co. said.
   ``No safety systems at all were affected,'' said Elizabeth Bean,
a utility spokeswoman. ``The transformer that caught fire was
carrying electricity from the plant, so there were no outages.''
   The cause of the fire was undetermined, Ms. Bean said.
   She said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified but
hadn't indicated whether it would investigate. She said the blaze
was confined to a part of the plant separated by concrete walls
from the reactor.
   ``There was no threat to the public other than just like any
electrical fire that may occur at any facility,'' said David
McNeill, another CP&amp;L spokesman.
   Because of damage to equipment, the 900-megawatt plant was
closed for a refueling outage that hadn't been scheduled to begin
until next week, the company said. The regular annual refueling,
inspection and maintenance are expected to keep the plant out of
operation for eight to 10 weeks.
   Hydrogen gas leaked when the blaze spread through gas lines
running from the transformer to one of three generators, Ms. Bean
said. The gas, used for cooling the generator, burned but didn't
explode, she said.
   The plant declared an alert, which is routine in such cases,
McNeill said.

<HEAD>U.N. Cuts Food Rations to Cambodian Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations cut its food
rations to the largest Cambodian refugee camp because some of its
aid had been diverted to guerrillas fighting inside Cambodia,
relief sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the food
aid to the Site 2 camp inside the Thai border had been decreased by
nearly 20 percent following disclosures that refugees were selling
or otherwise diverting the food to the military.
   Site 2 houses more than 180,000 followers of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front, one of three major guerrilla groups
fighting the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia.
   The front recently launched an offensive against the Cambodian
army from its bases along the Thai-Cambodian border and claimed to
have scored major successes.
   A spokesman of the U.N. Border Relief Operation, Robert Burrows,
said that regular rations to the residents of Site 2 had not been
reduced. ``But (the agency) has, however, regretfully decided to
suspend further delivery of administration workers' rations and
some of the social rations pending clarification of their use,'' he
said.
   Administraion rations are given to Cambodians at the camp who
help distribute food to the general population or otherwise help
with administration of the camp. Social rations are special food
supplies given to certain well-identified groups such as
single-parent families.
   Relief officials note that diversion of food, medicine and other
humanitarian aid provided by aid agencies to the refugees has been
going on since the program began a decade ago.
   Some said officials have privately been especially critical of
the aid being supplied the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who exercise
rigid control over the civilians under their control.
   Human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights
abuses at the Khmer Rouge camps where monitoring of international
aid is far more difficult than in camps run by the other two
factions in the three-member guerrilla coalition.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and says it withdrew the last
of its troops last month.

   Baton-wielding police today charged
thousands of protesters who threw rocks and fired slingshots to
demand freedom for political prisoners on Taiwan's National Day.
   Officials said five policemen were treated in hospitals for
injuries and one protester was slightly injured.
   As the government held its own parade and rally nearby, the
demonstrators clashed with about 2,000 police clad in riot gear and
backed by water cannons and barbed-wire barricades.
   The clashes failed to disrupt the parade and rally, which were
held to mark the 1911 uprising that led to the fall of China's last
dynasty, the Qing. An estimated 250,000 spectators were on hand.
   President Lee Teng-hui briefly addressed the rally, which was
attended by dignitaries from 40 countries.
   The demonstrators, waving flag poles and sticks, tried to break
through human walls formed by police.
   Riot police with shields and truncheons charged them, but the
protesters quickly regrouped to confront the officers again.
Television footage showed a man in a yellow shirt running close to
the police line and lobbing a large rock into their midst.
   The police charged the man and he fell. Another shot showed
blood staining the back of a protester as he was helped away by a
friend.
   In the afternoon, about 2,000 riot police blocked all three
intersections leading to the jail where dissident publisher Hsu
Hsin-liang is being held.
   About 10,000 protesters, wearing yellow headbands, waved banners
that read ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang.''
   Hsu, 48, was jailed in the Taipei suburb of Tucheng after he
returned to Taiwan from the United States in a fishing boat last
month. He was wanted by the government for his alleged role in
organizing a 1979 anti-government demonstration in which hundreds
were injured.
   Hsu and four other executives from the Formosa magazine were
charged with trying to topple the Nationalist government by
organizing the demonstration. Hsu left for the United States
shortly before the 1979 riot. The other four men were convicted of
sedition and released after serving part of their lengthy jail
terms.
   Chen Wan-chen, the organizer of today's protest, said the
demonstrators wanted to appeal to Lee to release political
prisoners.
   The detainees include Hsu and two other prisoners who were
convicted of sedition and sentenced to lengthy jail terms in 1987.
All three were accused of advocating that Taiwan no longer consider
itself part of China _ an act the Nationalists consider seditious.

<HEAD>Grandfather Charged Under Florida's New Gun Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man whose visiting 8-year-old
granddaughter shot herself in the thumb with a gun found in his
room has been arrested under Florida's new law against leaving
weapons within reach of a child, police said.
   Sheriff's spokesman Dick Simpson said Willie W. Green, 60, is
believed to be the first person charged under the law, which went
into effect Oct. 1.
   Green's granddaughter, Sheila Owens, discovered the loaded,
unlocked .32-caliber automatic in a box on the floor of his bedroom
Sunday, Simpson said.
   The shot she fired passed through her thumb, a bedroom door, a
bookcase and onto the floor of the living room, where several
family members were gathered, Simpson said. The child was treated
at a hospital and released.
   ``It could have killed her or the others,'' said Simpson said.
   Also Sunday, Scott Carlton, 12, of San Mateo was fatally shot in
the abdomen when a 9-year-old playmate pulled the trigger on a
rifle he thought was unloaded, police said. The boy had taken the
rifle from a rack, police said.
   The names of the 9-year-old and his parents were withheld
pending a decision on whether to prosecute, state attorney John
Tanner said. He said he wants to know how the gun was secured
before making a decision.
   The gun law was passed during a special legislative session last
summer after several children were shot, some fatally, by
youngsters playing with guns. The law requires gun owners to take
reasonable precautions, such as using a trigger lock or keeping the
weapon in a locked box.
   Under the law, if a child shoots someone because of a gun
owner's carelessness, the adult can get up to five years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Sailors on the aircraft
carrier USS Forrestal worked today to cool hot spots from an
electrical fire in an elevator machinery room. Nine sailors
suffered minor injuries, the Navy said.
   The fire broke out about 8:30 p.m. Monday and was believed to be
mostly confined to the room, which contains machinery for an
elevator that raises aircraft to deck level.
   Cmdr. Tim Taylor said it could have traveled along cables to
other areas of the ship. ``Electrical fires can be deceiving. We
won't know the scope until they trace the cableways and find the
source,'' he said.
   Fire crews from the naval station, east of Jacksonville on the
St. Johns River, and other ships stood by to assist, Taylor said.
But the flames were fought by the ship's crew.
   Nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and cuts and bruises
putting the blaze out, he said. They were treated at the base
dispensary.
   Taylor didn't know early today whether the fire would disrupt
the ship's schedule. He said he couldn't release information about
future ship deployment.
   At capacity, the Forrestal carries a crew of 5,438, including
officers and crewmen on the air wing. The air wing was not aboard
Monday, leaving 2,500 to 3,000 sailors on the ship, a spokesman
said.
   Based at Mayport, the 1,086-foot Forrestal was the first U.S.
aircraft carrier designed for jets.
   Now the third-oldest U.S. carrier in active service, the ship
has been modernized several times since it was launched in 1954. It
was renovated in 1983-85 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard to extend
its life 15 years.
   The Navy's worst carrier flight deck disaster since World War II
occurred on the Forrestal off Vietnam in 1967 when a fire killed
134 crew members and injured 64. The fire was ignited by a missile
accidentally fired by a plane that was being armed on deck.

   Banned playwright and human rights
campaigner Vaclav Havel made a surprise appearance in the official
media when the Communist daily Rude Pravo unwittingly published his
photo.
   Havel, using a pseudonym and apparently outfoxing editors, paid
a $50 fee and sent his picture for publication in weekend editions,
congratulating himself in the personals column on his 53rd birthday.
   It was the first time that Havel, banned from publishing at
home, had his picture printed in an official Czechoslovak newspaper
since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that put down the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of Alexander Dubcek.
   ``On Oct.5, 1989 Ferdinand Vanek of Maly Hradek celebrated his
birthday,'' read the caption accompanying Havel's photo in
Saturday's paper.
   Ferdinand Vanek is the name Havel used for autobiographical
characters in some of his plays. Maly Hradek is Havel's country
residence, north of Prague.
   ``His friends and colleagues thank him for the hard work he has
done and is still doing in his life, send many greetings and wish
him success in his work,'' the daily said.
   Havel was a candidate for the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, which last
week was awarded to the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.
   Havel was most recently arrested for his political activities in
January. But following considerable opposition from abroad and
intellectuals at home, authorities cut his nine-month sentence to
eight and then paroled him after four months.

<HEAD>Baker Invites Israel, Egypt to Talks in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
invited the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to Washington in
the next two weeks to seek a formula for Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, officials said today.
   The Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Baker presented a proposal to Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid. They did not
elaborate on the substance of the proposal.
   The U.S. invitation came after Israel's 12-member inner Cabinet
rejected a proposal by the center-left Labor Party to accept an
Egyptian call for talks with a Palestinian delegation in Cairo. The
plan was defeated by the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The Palestinians criticized Israel, saying it had blocked the
peace process.
   The Israeli officials said details of the U.S. plan were
discussed in a series of telephone calls since last Friday and
followed up with a written proposal relayed by U.S. Ambassador
William Brown.
   Speaking Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press,'' Baker indicated the
United States was actively involved in the Middle East peace
process.
   ``We're not involved by getting on an airplane and flying over
to the Middle East, but the suggestion that we're not involved, I'm
sorry, is simply not accurate,'' Baker said.
   Asked if he was personally involved in deciding who would
represent the Palestinians in peace talks, Baker said: ``Let me
simply say that we have sent such a message ... It's been sent to
both capitals.'' He said Washington was ``working with language to
try and bridge the gap between Israelis on the one hand and
Palestinians on the other.''
   The makeup of a Palestinian delegation has been a major problem.
Israel objects to the particpation of the PLO, which it views as a
terror group.
   Initial reaction to the Baker proposal was positive from both
Labor and the Likud, headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But
Likud officials indicated more study was needed before Israel could
accept the U.S. plan or even the call for a three-way meeting.
   Avi Pazner, a senior aide to Shamir, confirmed that a three-way
meeting in Washington was one idea under consideration. But he
declined to give details.
   Shamir, who plans a visit to Washington in mid-November, said in
an interview published in the liberal daily Haaretz that he
welcomed U.S. involvement in the peace process. But he also
reflected the fears of his right-wing Likud that Israel could be
pushed into an indirect dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Baker's proposal calls for a meeting within two weeks by U.S.,
Israeli and Egyptian officials to discuss the makeup of a
Palestinian delegation and an agenda for the proposed Cairo talks.
   Likud hawks, who plan a meeting Wednesday, opposed Baker's plan
outright, saying a meeting with Palestinians in Cairo was a ruse to
start negotiations with the PLO.
   Labor's minister of energy, Moshe Shahal, said in an interview
that his party would accept the U.S. proposal. He also said the
rejection of the U.S. proposal could lead Labor to break up the
coalition government.

<TEXT>
   A three-eyed alien and a robot landed in the
Russian city of Voronezh, zapped a boy with a tube and made him
disappear, a Soviet daily reported today, quoting supposed
witnesses.
   The newspaper, following up on an earlier report by the Soviet
news agency Tass, assured skeptics that ``something did in fact
happen.''
   The purported landing of a UFO in Voronezh is the latest bizarre
tale to appear in the state-run Soviet media under the policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness. The media recently have told of other
sightings of unidentified flying objects and space invaders.
   Tass, not known for its sense of humor, informed the world
Monday that scientists had confirmed that an alien spaceship
carrying giant people with tiny heads had touched down in Voronezh,
a city of more than 800,000 people about 300 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   As many as three aliens left the spacecraft, described as a
large shining ball or disc, and went for a stroll in the park, Tass
reported. A Tass duty officer later contacted by telephone stood by
the story.
   ``It is not April Fool's today,'' he said.
   Sovietskaya Kultura was the only major national daily to print
anything today about the supposed UFO, indicating that more
prestigious papers such as Pravda may have wanted nothing to do
with such a topic.
   Sovietskaya Kultura said its coverage was motivated by ``the
golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.''
   ``Of course, it's hard to believe in what happened in the
town,'' it said in its report from Voronezh. ``It's even more
difficult to explain.''
   The daily, published by the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, quoted witnesses as saying the aliens landed on
a warm evening on Sept 27.
   At 6:30 p.m., it said, boys playing soccer saw a pink glow in
the sky, then spotted a deep red ball about 10 yards in diameter.
The ball circled the park, disappeared, then reappeared a few
minutes later to hover over the park, it said.
   The paper said a crowd rushed to the site, and people clearly
saw a hatch open in the lower part of the sphere. Through the
opening, it said, people could see a three-eyed alien about 10 feet
high, clad in silvery overalls and bronze-colored boots and wearing
a disk on his chest.
   Sovietskaya Kultura, quoting witnesses, then gave this sequence
of events:
   The UFO landed. Two creatures, one apparently a robot, exited
the hatch. A boy started screaming with fear, but when the alien
looked at him, with eyes shining, the boy fell silent, unable to
move. The onlookers screamed, and the UFO and the creatures
disappeared.
   About five minutes later, they reappeared. The alien had what
appeared to be a gun _ a tube about 20 inches long. It pointed the
tube at the 16-year-old boy, and the boy disappeared.
   The alien went inside the ball, which immediately took off. At
the same time, the boy reappeared. He was not identified.
   Sovietskaya Kultura's Voronezh correspondent, E. Efremov, gave
obvious credence to the witness accounts.
   ``Children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been
questioned by police workers and journalists,'' he wrote. ``There
are no discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself, or
the actions of the `aliens.' Moreover, all the children who became
witnesses to this event are still afraid, even now.''
   Efremov said scientists from the local branch of a nationwide
group that investigates ``abnormal phenomena'' were probing the
landing.
   Meanwhile, Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical
Laboratory, threw doubt on the initial Tass report that quoted him
as saying the aliens left behind two pieces of rock that cannot be
found on earth.
   ``The rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece
of (iron ore) which could easily have originated on earth,''
Silanov said in a telephone interview.
   He said there indeed was ``a landing site'' or something
resembling one in Voronezh, but the symmetrical depressions also
could result from the leak of an underground pipe or cable, an
underground reservoir or another geological feature.
   ``Don't believe all you hear from Tass,'' the spectroscopist
advised. ``We never gave them part of what they published.''
   Shortly thereafter, the phone connection was cut off.

<HEAD>Researcher: Pay Phone Calls Really Do Last Longer if You're Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you think the person ahead of you is going to
talk on the pay phone forever, you may be right _ and you may be
the reason.
   A study by Barry Rubak, a psychology professor at Georgia State
University, suggests that people talk longer on pay phones if
someone else is waiting. It's not just your imagination.
   ``Humans are just like animals; they defend their space. In
public territory we place personal value on space, and when we are
challenged, we defend it,'' Rubak said in today's Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
   He said most callers don't stretch out their conversations
simply to be annoying. Rather, the person waiting may distract the
caller, thereby lengthening the phone call, he said.
   Rubak and his students used questionnaires and observed callers
at pay phones at three hospitals, Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, a
train station in West Germany, two shopping malls, a mass transit
train station in Atlanta and two convenience stores in rural
western Georgia.
   The study showed calls in airports tend to be the shortest,
partly because the pressures of departing flights overpower
territorial tendencies.

   An earthquake shook the central Anatolian
province of Kayseri today, causing damage but no casualties, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
   The dispatch, quoting local governor Ayhan Bilge, said four
houses and the minaret of a mosque collapsed in the villages of
Sarayli and Doruklu. Many houses had cracks in their walls, the
agency said.
   The quake measured 4.9 on the Richter scale. The scale is a
measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs and every
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A
quake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage.

<TEXT>
   The Americal Civil Liberties Union is
taking up the Ku Klux Klan's fight to join a North Carolina litter
program in which groups ``adopt'' a highway to keep clean and get a
road sign with their name on it.
   Two weeks ago, the Department of Tranportation denied a KKK
request to join the Adopt-a-Highway program, saying a KKK sign
could prompt more littering.
   James Shields, state ACLU director, on Monday said the state
``apparently agrees with Sen. Joe McCarthy and with the government
of communist China in claiming that people have to pass some
political litmus test in order to participate in government
programs.''
   ``If government is able to decide who gets to participate in a
program based upon government approval of their views, government
is doing a very Klan-like thing,'' Shields said.
   The Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Rockingham
County wanted to remove trash from a 3.4-mile stretch of highway in
Reidsville.
   A youth group with the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People was allowed to adopt a highway.
   ``If people would think about the issue for what it is, a civil
rights issue, rather than looking at the name or any mythological
hearsay about the Klan, common sense would tell you what's right
for one should be right for the other,'' said Rocky Chapman,
exalted cyclops of the KKK chapter.
   Shields said the ACLU will ask the transportation department to
reconsider, then sue if necessary.
   In a statement, a department spokesman said he was not surprised
by the Klan's move.

<TEXT>
   The recent U.S. seizures of almost 36 tons of
cocaine may be the result of the Colombian drug crackdown as
traffickers move the drug out of an unsafe haven, officials say.
   But others say the timing of the huge busts may simply be
coincidental. The drugs seized may have come to the United States
through Mexico or may have been in this country before the
crackdown began Aug. 18 in Colombia, they say.
   ``We're seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaine's
coming out, because it's not safe to leave it in Colombia
anymore,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told
reporters at a dock in New Orleans, where the ship Zedom Sea was
taken after six tons of cocaine were seized from it in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   While drug traffickers used to send out cocaine in smaller lots
as a security measure, they've now begun moving it out in huge
shipments, Skinner said. ``That's because of the pressure from the
government in Colombia,'' he said.
   The Colombian crackdown, begun one day after the assassination
of a leading presidential candidate who was a critic of the drug
trade, has resulted in sweeping arrests and the seizure of millions
of dollars of drug traffickers' assets. One accused money-launderer
has been extradited to the United States.
   The traffickers vowed to wage ``total war'' against the
government and have been blamed for 157 bombings that have killed
11 people and wounded 200.
   U.S. officials in the past two weeks seized 20 tons of cocaine
from a warehouse in Los Angeles, nine tons from a house in Texas
five miles from the Mexican border, six tons from a ship in the
Gulf of Mexico, and 1{ tons near Puerto Rico. The 20-ton seizure
was the largest ever in the world, while the nine-ton bust is the
second largest in U.S. history.
   ``These seizures certainly indicate the traffickers are taking
substantial risks and they are moving vast quantities of their
drugs out of the country for whatever reasons they have, but one of
them must be their perception that it is not safe down there,''
said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults.
   ``They are taking substantial risks and we are taking advantage
of that,'' he said.
   Several years ago, cocaine came into the United States primarily
on private aircraft. The shipments were much smaller and the loss
of any load cost the traffickers much less.
   ``As we became more effective in targeting that method of
transit, they have changed,'' Shults said. ``These are businessmen
... We feel that they are weighing the risks and have decided they
have got to move these drugs.''
   But there also are reasons to believe that the huge busts may
have nothing to do with the situation in Colombia. For example,
there is no indication how long the 20 tons of cocaine seized in
Los Angeles had been in that warehouse.
   Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner said the group arrested
in connection with that seizure had been operating the warehouse
for two years.
   During that time, Reiner said, authorities estimate 60 tons were
processed through the warehouse in addition to the 20 tons just
seized.
   In Texas, Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox said
the home in Cameron County about five miles above the Rio Grande
River ``hasn't been used very long as far as we can tell.'' But he
added, ``We think this is the second large load intended to go out
of the house. We missed one load.''
   Although the house was purchased in September, the month after
the Colombian crackdown began, Texas officials ``don't have any
hard evidence'' the huge seizure resulted from Colombian drug
traffickers pushing their wares out of their own country, Cox said.
   ``Since the standard method is to leapfrog it from Colombia to
Mexico and from Mexico to the United States, it could have been
stockpiled in Mexico for a time,'' he said. Officials still have
not identified the owner of the house, he said.
   The cocaine itself obviously came from Colombia, he said, noting
that ``some of the dope was wrapped in newspapers from Bogota,'' he
said.

   Ten bombs exploded in Bogota and another
city just hours after a U.S. Army official reportedly met with
President Virgilio Barco for talks on fighting the drug war.
   The bombs injured 23 people and caused extensive damage,
shattering a three-day lull in a terror campaign blamed on drug
traffickers, police said. Earlier they had said 32 people were
injured but then lowered the number of casualties.
   Also Monday, police shot and killed a suspected terrorist in
Bogota as he tried to flee, presumably after setting a bomb, police
said. No further details were provided.
   Three bombs exploded in downtown Pereira, capital of the Western
province of Risaralda, and one of them injured 14 people in a
lottery office, police said. They said two other bombs were
deactivated in the city of 500,000 and a midnight-to-dawn curfew
was imposed. Police earlier said four bombs had exploded in the
city.
   In Bogota, seven bombs exploded in supermarkets, residential
neighborhoods, in the commercial center and at the base of
electricity pylons, injuring nine people, police said. The
explosions caused millions of dollars in damages, they said on
condition of anonymity.
   As in previous attacks, no group claimed responsibility but the
bombings were believed the work of Colombia's cocaine barons.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Army's southern command,
arrived in Bogota Monday afternoon and met at the presidential
palace with Barco and the chief of Colombia's Administrative
Security Department, Gen. Miguel Maza, accoding to the daily El
Tiempo.
   The Administrative Security Department, Colombia's national
detective force, has been in charge of trying to track down
Colombian drug traffickers.
   El Tiempo, usually well informed of government activities, said
the general talked with Barco and Maza about the government's war
on drug traffickers. It said he was leaving Bogota today.
   A U.S. Enbasst spokesman refused to comment on the general's
visit.
   Barco was leaving today for Ica, Peru, where he will attend a
meeting of a group of eight Latin American countries trying to find
a peaceful solution to Central America's problems.
   The meeting of the so-called Group of Eight will deal with
foreign debt, international coffee prices, trade and drug
trafficking, Barco's office said.
   The countries attending are Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru,
Mexico, Venezuela and Uruguay. Panama will not send a delegate,
Barco's office said.
   Barco will try to get Bolivia and Peru to join Colombia in a
program of crop substitution to reduce crops of coca bushes. Coca
bush leaves are used to make cocaine base.
   Colombia started a crop substitution program last year year in
one state on a trial basis. The government has not said how
successful the program has been.
   Since Aug. 23, 157 bombings and arson attacks have killed 11
people and injured 200.
   On that date, traffickers declared war on the government of
President Virgilio Barco for its decision to reactivate an
extradition treaty with the United States and expropriate property
belonging to alleged cocaine smugglers.
   The government declared the emergency measures on Aug. 19, a day
after the slaying of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential contender. He had led a crusade against drugs in
Medellin, Colombia's cocaine capital.
   Earlier Monday, authorities raided five cocaine laboratories
along the Rosario River, arresting eight people and destroying a
ton of coca leaves, the national radio chain Caracol reported.
   Coca leaves are the raw product for cocaine.
   Police also reportedly seized weapons as well as coca seeds and
chemicals used in processing cocaine, the radio said citing the
commander of the state's anti-narcotics police.
   Since Barco began the crackdown, only one reputed top drug
figure has been extradited to the United States to stand trial.
Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed, allegedly on the orders of cocaine bosses.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
dispute over taped evidence in the federal prosecution of nine men
accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargo depot in
Connecticut six years ago.
   The justices said they will decide whether all the tape
recordings made during court-authorized electronic surveillance of
the defendants may be used as trial evidence.
   A federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be
used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping
quickly enough.
   Prosecutors say members of an organization in Puerto Rico known
as Los Macheteros, or the machete wielders, were involved in the
Sept. 12, 1983 robbery in West Hartford, Conn.
   Nineteen members of the organization were indicted by a federal
grand jury in connection with the crime.
   Evidence linking nine of the men to the Connecticut robbery was
discovered during an investigation of a rocket attack on the FBI
office in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.
   During that investigation, court-authorized electronic snooping
was conducted at six different locations in Puerto Rico between
April 1984 and August 1985.
   After their indictment, the nine men sought to have all tape
recordings obtained during the surveillance ruled inadmissible as
trial evidence.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie in Hartford, after an
eight-month hearing, last year suppressed 378 tape recordings made
at two of the six locations: one defendant's apartment in
Levittown, Puerto Rico, and the home of two other defendants in
Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the suppression
order last May 5, ruling that government agents waited too long
after the taping sessions had ended to have the tapes sealed _ and
preserved as evidence _ under a judge's directions.
   ``While we eschew any thought of automatic suppression on the
basis of time alone, we do not believe that any satisfactory
explanation has been offered for this long delay,'' the appeals
court said.
   It found a 118-day delay in one instance and an 82-day delay in
the other.
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers argued
that the tape recordings should not be suppressed because of delays
in having them sealed if they are proved to be unaltered originals.
   The nine defendants involved in the case are Filiberto Ojeda
Rios, Hilton E. Fernandez Diamante, Jorge Farinacci Garcia, Elias
Castro Ramos, Orlando Gonzalez Claudio, Issac Camacho Negron,
Ivonne Melendez Carrion, Angel Dias Ruiz and Luis Colon Osorio.
   The case is U.S. vs. Ojeda Rios, 89-61.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Arizona Killer's Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the death sentence of Arizona murderer Jimmie Wayne
Jeffers, convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend in Tucson 13 years
ago.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that, although
upholding Jeffers' murder conviction, declared his death sentence
unconstitutional.
   Jeffers was convicted of the Oct. 20, 1976 killing of Penelope
Cheney in a Tucson motel.
   Prosecutors said Jeffers had been told that Ms. Cheney had
provided police with information about his heroin trafficking.
   Trial testimony indicated that Jeffers injected Ms. Cheney with
a massive amount of heroin and then choked and beat her while she
was unconscious because he was worried the overdose would not be
fatal.
   A state judge sentenced Jeffers to death after ruling that the
murder was ``especially heinous and depraved.'' Jeffers' conviction
and sentence was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court, and the
nation's highest court refused to hear his appeal in 1983.
   Jeffers then sought help from a federal judge, and subsequently
appealed the judge's denial to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   By a 2-1 vote in 1987, the appeals court struck down Jeffers'
sentence while unanimously upholding his murder conviction.
   The appeals court relied in part on a 1980 Supreme Court
decision that limited the use of an ``outrageously or wantonly
vile, horrible or inhuman'' aggravating factor in sentencing.
   Such a factor may be applied only to cases in which victims were
tortured before death, the high court said in 1980.
   The 9th Circuit court ruled that Jeffers' death sentence ``must
be struck down as arbitrary'' because ``we are unable to find a
principled means of distinguishing the depravity of Jeffers'
conduct'' from that of some convicted Arizona murderers who
received life sentences.
   In the appeal acted on today, Arizona prosecutors contended that
the appeals court showed too little deference in setting aside a
state court's finding of the ``especially heinous and depraved''
aggravating circumstance.
   The case is Ricketts vs. Jeffers, 89-189.

<TEXT>
   A strike by Boeing's 57,800 Machinists went into
a seventh day today with a pledge of economic support from about 25
other unions.
   The Machinists asked for help in case the strike at the world's
biggest and busiest manufacturer of passenger jets runs long, said
Tom Baker, president of Machinists Local 751.
   No contract talks were scheduled.
   None have been held since the Machinists, including 43,300 in
the Seattle area, rejected a three-year contract and walked out
Oct. 4. The strike also affects plants in Wichita, Kan., Portland,
Ore., and several other sites.
   The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers in
Washington state. Their leaders met Monday.
   ``This was a real upbeat meeting,'' Baker said. ``People are
willing to do whatever they can do monetarily. They're going to
form a hardship fund, that type of thing.''
   The support did not involve refusal to cross picket lines. All
of Boeing's unions have contracts that prohibit sympathy strikes.
   Larry Kenney, president of the Washington State Labor Council,
said the hardship fund would help strikers with mortgage payments
and other bills. He said the other unions also promised to set up a
temporary employment center.
   ``This is a classic labor dispute because the issues are clearly
defined,'' Kenney said. ``Is the company going to use its economic
leverage or are the employees going to use their economic leverage?
That's what it's all supposed to be about.''
   Boeing officials said they did not know how to interpret the
show of union support.
   ``I still don't think anybody at this point knows how long a
strike it will be,'' said spokesman Paul Binder.
   A company that advertised for aircraft maintenance workers was
deluged by hundreds of job-seekers, including Boeing strikers.
Intertec Aviation Co. of Phoenix said its recruiter's visit to
Everett on Sunday was planned before the strike.
   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began, and
hopes to deliver 92 more by the end of the year.
   Five consecutive years of record orders have given the company a
backlog that stretches into the late 1990s. That backlog was behind
Machinists' demand for better wages and lower mandatory overtime.
   Boeing offered a raise 4 percent, followed by 3 percent raises
in 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8 percent of gross earnings
this year and 3 percent in 1990.
   Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per
quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved.
   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for the
first half of 1989 and had profits of $614 million on sales of
$16.96 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Fine Against Pennsylvania Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today overturned a fine
against a Pennsylvania newspaper for publishing conversations of a
bookmaker whose telephone was tapped by police.
   The justices ordered a state court to reconsider a $1,000 fine
and $17,409 in lawyers' fees imposed against The Easton Express.
The newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts
accidentally placed in public court records.
   The high court said the case should be restudied in light of the
justices' ruling last June that spared a Florida newspaper from
having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published.
   An Express article on April 7, 1982, related a conversation
between bookmaker Alfred Boettger of Forks Township, Pa., and a
bettor on college football games who owed him money. The bettor
permitted state police to tap his phone in return for protection.
   The wiretap transcripts were placed in a court clerk's file, and
a reporter for the newspaper was permitted to see them and take
notes on the conversations.
   Boettger, who pleaded no defense to bookmaking charges and was
fined, sued the newspaper. He said it violated his privacy and a
1978 Pennsylvania law designed to protect people from unauthorized
disclosure of information obtained through wiretaps.
   Boettger withdrew his privacy claim but was awarded the $1,000
plus legal fees by a state jury that decided the Express had
violated the 1978 law.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the jury award last March.
It said the 1978 law permits police _ not news organizations or the
general public _ to reveal wiretap information.
   ``There is no justification to allow the media a unique
prerogative to trespass where the general populace is barred,'' the
state court said.
   It said the privacy interests the 1978 law are intended to
safeguard outweigh free-press rights.
   ``Only when the protected information is disseminated either
through an order of court unsealing it or through its use as
evidence in an open court proceeding does the media's interest rise
above those of the (state) and its citizens,'' the state court said.
   The Express, with support from leading news organizations, said
the state court ruling conflicts with the justices' ruling last
June.
   In that ruling, the high court threw out a $97,500 award won by
a rape victim whose name was published by the Florida Star, a
weekly newspaper in Jacksonville. The victim's name was obtained
from a report posted by mistake in a sheriff's department press
room.
   The justices said then, ``We do not hold that truthful
publication is automatically constitutionally protected. We hold
only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it
has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at
all, only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest
order.''
   Among those supporting The Easton Express appeal were the
American Newspaper Publishers Association, the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the National Association of Broadcasters and the
Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.
   They argued that if the news media can be punished for
disclosing ``accessible, trustworthy and newsworthy government
records and court files, speech would be chilled to the point of
being frozen solid.''
   The case is Easton Publishing Co. vs. Boettger, 89-265.

<HEAD>Missouri Hepatitis Carrier Loses Anti-Bias Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to order a
program for the handicapped in Missouri to take back a 33-year-old
mentally retarded man who is a carrier of hepatitis.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Dennis
Kohl's ouster from the program did not amount to illegal
discrimination against the handicapped.
   Aside from his retardation, Kohl is blind and an active carrier
of the hepatitis B virus. According to court records, he frequently
exhibits maladaptive behavior such as biting and scratching.
   Hepatitis B is one cause of hepatitis, an infection that
primarily affects the liver. Although the transmission of hepatitis
B is not fully understood, most medical experts agree it is
transmitted through body fluids.
   Kohl lived at the Woodhaven Learning Center in Columbia, Mo.,
for three months in 1984, until he was discharged. The center is
run in conjunction with the Woodhaven School, which provides
educational and vocational programs for handicapped people.
   Kohl was dismissed from the Missouri programs because he is a
carrier of a contagious disease.
   Both the learning center and school receive federal funding,
making them subject to a 1973 federal law protecting handicapped
people from bias.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Kohl's
dismissal was not a violation of the 1973 law.
   The costs of inoculating all staff members and patients at the
facilities to protect them against catching hepatitis from Kohl are
too high to be reasonable, the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Kohl and his parents
argued that the appeals court's ruling conflicts with a 1987
Supreme Court decision that people with contagious diseases are
protected by the 1973 law.
   The justices two years ago said recipients of federal aid may
not discriminate against people with contagious diseases if those
people are ``otherwise qualified'' to work or take part in some
program or activity.
   The 1987 decision said, ``A person who poses a significant risk
of communicating an infectious disease to others ... will not be
otherwise qualified ... if reasonable accommodations will not
eliminate that risk.''
   Kohl's appeal said the 8th Circuit court ignored medical
judgments about what represents ``reasonable accommodations'' in
his case.
   ``In the face of a national AIDS epidemic and the hysteria it
has engendered, the 8th Circuit's misinterpretation of (the 1987
high court ruling) erodes the substantive protections provided by
(the 1973 law) to both contagious individuals and the public
itself,'' the appeal said.
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a deadly viral
disease that can kill its victims by destroying their immune system
and leaving them vulnerable to other diseases.
   The case is Kohl vs. Woodhaven Learning Center, 89-240.

<HEAD>Progress Reported in Peace Talks; New Fighting in Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese lawmakers were reported to be
moving closer to a peace agreement but fighting broke out today in
their divided nation, a sign that any accord reached here would
have to be accepted by the warlords battling for supremacy.
   In Beirut, sniper fire exchanges along the city's dividing Green
Line claimed the first combat fatality since an Arab
Legaue-brokered truce halted six months of bloodshed on Sept. 22.
   Police said 1st Lt. Abdul-Rahman Aslan, a Shiite Moslem, was
killed and three soldiers were wounded in a clash between Maj. Gen.
Sami Khatib's Moslem troops and Christian army units in the Chiyah
district.
   The casualties brought the overall toll to 930 killed and 2,744
wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between the
Christians and an alliance of Syrian troops and their Moslem allies.
   Conference sources in Taif, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that hard-line Christian lawmakers were backing away somewhat
on their demand that Syrian forces withdraw before Christians agree
to political reforms in Lebanon.
   They said the lawmakers conceded that an immediate Syrian
withdrawal would allow Moslem militias to take control of Moslem
regions now controlled by the Syrians.
   The sources also said that a committee working on a draft
proposal for political reforms has completed its recommendations on
the future powers of the president, traditionally a Maronite
Catholic.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, formed the
committee of seven Christians and seven Moslems on Monday to speed
up work toward a settlement. By today, the committee had been
enlarged to 18 members.
   Under the proposed reforms the president would continue to have
the right to summon Cabinet sessions. He also will be able to
decree special amnesties, but not general ones as before.
   Parliament bills will automatically become law if not ratified
by the president within 15 days. Previously, no law could take
effect unless endorsed by the president.
   Moslems have been demanding that presidential powers be
curtailed as part of a political reforms agreement that would give
them an equal share of power with the Christians.
   Christians, then considered the majority, have dominated the
government, Parliament and judiciary since independence from France
in 1943. But Moslems now are believed to make up a majority of the
population.
   A three-man Arab League committee had presented the 63
Parliamentarians gathered in Taif with a draft peace plan. The
legislators have been studying the proposal since Sept. 30 and
making their own recommendations.
   The main obstacle that has threatened to undermine the peace
conference was Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   The Arab committee has proposed a phased Syrian withdrawal from
the Beirut area to be completed in two years, with total pullout
depending on Israel ending its occupation of south Lebanon and the
conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact.
   The Christian legislators' consent that an uncalculated Syrian
withdrawal would spur more turmoil has raised speculation that a
compromise was in the works, possibly based on narrowing the
two-year period for a withdrawal from Beirut that was envisaged by
the Arab committee.

<HEAD>Court to Study Texas Killer's Retardation Argument</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a Texas man who murdered a deputy sheriff 10 years ago may
raise the issue of his mental retardation in a new attack on his
death sentence.
   The court's decision, expected sometime in 1990, could clarify
the scope _ and retroactive effects _ of its decision last June 26
that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers, but only
if jurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental condition into
consideration.
   The justices agreed to hear the appeal of John Henry Selvage,
and fashioned the sole question Selvage's lawyers and Texas
prosecutors are to debate in the coming months.
   The question is whether there was a legitimate cause for Selvage
not raising the issue of his mental retardation at some earlier
stage.
   The justices also asked the lawyers to consider whether, if no
legitimate cause existed, whether barring Selvage from making the
claim now would ``result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.''
   Selvage was convicted of killing Albert Garza, a Harris County
sheriff's deputy, during the July 30, 1979, robbery of a Houston
jewelry store.
   The case is Selvage vs. Lynaugh, 87-6700.

<HEAD>Honda Founder to Be First Japanese in Automotive Hall of Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soichiro Honda, the 82-year-old founder of
Honda Motor Co., tonightst Japanese inducted into
the Automotive Hall o becomes the firf Fame.
   ``In less than 30 years, Mr. Honda built an auto company that
has stood toe-to-toe with all other manufacturers and has competed
successfully,'' said Robert Mallon, chairman of the hall.
   ``He changed the way Americans viewed imported cars and altered
forever the role of the import in our domestic market.''
   Selections to the Hall of Fame, a non-profit organization
founded in 1939, are made by its board of directors, made up mostly
of auto executives. The bonds, Keating has said, were a ``normal method
of corporate
finance'' and were portrayed to potential investors as uninsured
instruments.
   Keating bought Lincoln in 1984. Through risky direct investment
in real estate and investment in other corporate junk bonds, he
turned a sleepy savings bank with $1 billion in assets into an
aggressive thrift whose assets had grown to $5.4 billion by 1988.
   The bond sales began about the same time Keating's troubles with
regulators began _ 1987, a time when Lincoln apparently desperately
needed capital to stay afloat.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco examined Lincoln and
found it was in danger of failing. Keating took his case to
Washington. He persuaded Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., Don Riegle, D-Mich., and
John Glenn, D-Ohio, all of whom had received large campaign
contributions raised by Keating, to meet with regulators and press
Keating's case.
   In a two-hour April 1987 meeting, the senators defended Keating
as a major employer who ran profitable operations.
   DeConcini asked that regulators grant ``forbearance'' on new
direct-investment regulations, and Glenn said, ``You should charge
them or get off their backs,'' according to notes taken by William
Black, a regulator with the San Francisco bank who attended the
meeting.
   In an unprecedented move, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
ordered supervision of Lincoln transferred from San Francisco to
Washington, and a new examination conducted. Keating celebrated
with a champagne party at his Phoenix headquarters.
   Many investors could have been spared ruin had regulators'
actions not been delayed two years by political influence, said Don
Mikami, a Fountain Valley, Calif., dentist who invested $25,000.
   ``The bonds never would have been sold to California
investors,'' Mikami said. ``It was a mad scramble those last two
years to get money in the coffers of American Continental.''
   Four of the five senators now say they regret the appearance of
political influence created by the meeting, but insist there was
nothing wrong with trying to help a constituent.
   ``If I knew then what I know now, I would not have done any of
what I did,'' said DeConcini, who returned Keating-related campaign
contributions after the Justice Department filed its racketeering
suit.
   ``The question is, Was I abused? The answer is yes.''
   McCain said he is now ``embarrassed'' that he attended the
meeting. Riegle returned campaign contributions. Glenn said that
upon learning regulators had made referrals to the Justice
Department, he bowed out of further Keating discussions.
   Cranston, who solicited Keating for a $400,000 contribution for
his non-partisan voter education project after the meeting with
regulators, has ``no regrets about trying to help a California
institution with thousands of employees and depositors who was
having a rough time with red tape and delays by the federal
bureaucracy,'' spokesman Murray Flander said.
   Added Cranston's chief of staff, Roy Greenaway, ``The things we
know now about the sale of the bonds and the confusion created _
that whole issue is something we never knew about then.''
   Cranston has asked the General Accounting Office to examine
whether federal or state regulators were responsible in any way for
the bondholders' plight, and, if so, whether the government could
compensate them out of federal savings and loan insurance funds.
   Bondholders say that may be their only hope.
   ``The regulators allowed this to go on,'' said attorney-investor
Rosenberg.
   Even the chance of recovering some money after protracted
litigation, bankruptcy proceedings or Washington policy-making is
of little comfort to the elderly victims, bondholders say.
   ``These people need their money now,'' said Ms. Kane, the
Leisure World resident who organized with other bondholders to try
to get their money back. ``They need to go into nursing or
board-and-care homes now. They have medical bills now. They don't
have time to wait.''

   Pope John Paul II visited the
heartland of Indonesian culture today, celebrating Mass in tropical
heat in a region that blends Buddhist, Hindu and Moslem traditions.
   In a meeting with religious leaders, the pope cautioned against
any violation of religious freedom in this overwhelmingly Moslem
nation. There have been signs of pressure on the Roman Catholic
Church by Islamic extremists.
   Religious freedom is enshrined in Indonesia's constitution and
it is up to the state to ensure that ``religious freedom is indeed
a fundamental human right, one which should be enjoyed by all
religious communities, as well as individuals,'' the pope told the
religious leaders.
   Vatican officials said the pope was reflecting the concerns of
Indonesia's bishops over two proposed laws viewed by the minority
church as unconstitutional.
   One would require Islamic instruction in all public and private
schools including Catholic ones. The other would give legal
recognition to several hundred Islamic courts.
   The church considers Indonesia a generally tolerant country
despite the small numbers of Catholics, only 5 million compared
with 157 million Moslems.
   For the Mass today, about 150,000 people, many wearing yellow
and white baseball caps _ the Vatican colors _ jammed the
Indonesian air force academy grounds.
   Barefoot Javanese women in sarongs strewed rose petals in the
pope's path as he walked along a red carpet after changing for the
mass.
   The pope, speaking from an alter flanked by a vintage World War
II fighter plane, emphasized the importance of local tradition in
the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``Remember you build up the universal church when you bring to
it the unique riches of the Indonesian culture,'' the pope said,
speaking in English.
   He made a one-hour flight from Jakarta, the capital, to the
southern edge of Java on the second day of his pilgrimage to the
world's most populous Moslem country.
   The Vatican estimated that Catholics make up only about 2
percent of the more than 17 million people in the diocese of
Jogjakarta. But the crowds were large and enthusiastic.
   Tens of thousands arrived before dawn, hours before the mass,
walking on dirt roads covered by dense tropical vegetation.
   A Javanese orchestra called a gamelan accompanied the choir with
drums, cymbals and gongs.
   Jogjakarta is surrounded by temples set in rice paddy fields.
   The Borobudur Temple is considered one of the world's greatest
Buddhist monuments. In 1983 it was damaged by Moslem extremists.
   Also nearby is a temple complex dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu
goddess, a sign of the ancient Indian tradition.

<HEAD>Court to Use Convicted California Robber's Case in Police Search
Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use the case
of a convicted California robber to dispel some uncertainty over
when items seized in a police search may be used against criminal
suspects.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Terry Brice Horton,
sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery, illegal
firearms possession and other charges.
   Horton was convicted in a holdup on Jan. 13, 1985, of Erwin Paul
Wallaker, the treasurer of a San Jose coin club.
   Wallaker was returning home from a coin show with two briefcases
containing $10,000 in cash and $20,000 in coins.
   He was accosted by two people wearing Halloween masks who
stunned him with an electrical device and also stole jewelry from
him.
   Wallaker told police he recognized Horton's voice, a distinct
Southern drawl.
   The police searched Horton's home and found an Uzi, a revolver,
two stun guns and keys for handcuffs. None of those items was
listed in the court warrant that authorized the search.
   The warrant did describe the items stolen from Wallaker, but
they were not found by police.
   Horton argued that the seized items should not be used as
evidence against him, even though they were in plain view.
   He said the items were not discovered inadvertently by police.
The police expected to find weapons in his home and came there
looking for them, he said.
   Also, he argued, the police could not show a sufficient
connection with the items and holdup.
   Horton relied heavily on a 1971 Supreme Court case which allowed
police to use evidence found in plain view only if discovered
inadvertently.
   But a California appeals court permitted the items police found
in Horton's home to be used against him.
   The state court said the 1971 high court ruling on evidence
found in plain view was endorsed by only four justices _ not five
of the nine _ and therefore does not establish a national precedent.
   Also, the state court said of the police conduct in searching
Horton's home, ``There is no indication that they used the warrant
as a pretext to conduct a general exploratory search of horton's
residence.''
   The case is Horton vs. California, 88-7164.

   Authorities have released a U.N. relief
plane, its crew and its passengers nearly three weeks after they
were detained following an emergency landing in northeastern
Uganda, officials said today.
   Army commander Salim Saleh said the twin-engine C119 Fairchild,
its two American pilots, two British passengers and three Kenyan
crewmen were released Friday.
   Tarcis Kabwegyere, minister of state for foreign affairs, said
the foreigners and the aircraft were expected to leave for Nairobi
on Wednesday. U.N. officials, who have not released the names of
those aboard the plane, were not immediately available for comment.
   The plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 in Kaabong in
northeastern Uganda after running out of fuel in bad weather. It
was trying to return to Lokichoggio, Kenya, after delivering
emergency food and other supplies to southern Sudan as part of a
U.N. relief operation.
   Kaabong is about 50 miles south of Lokichoggio, which has served
as a staging point for the U.N.-coordinated relief effort.
   The United Nations has been airlifting food and supplies from
Kenya to southern Sudan since April in an effort to stave off
massive famine deaths.
   Saleh said the Ugandans detained those on board the plane
``pending finalization of investigations'' in which they confirmed
the plane did indeed make the unauthorized landing due to an
emergency.
   Government officials said earlier they held the plane to
determine whether its crew and passengers had any ``ill
intentions.''
   Last year, a Kenyan-registered plane delivered military
equipment and supplies to rebels fighting the government of
President Yower Museveni. The goods were seized by the military.

   NASA today reported an engine
problem that could ground space shuttle Atlantis beyond Thursday's
launch date even if anti-nuclear activists lose their court
challenge to stop the flight.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch began hearing arguments today
in Washington from attorneys representing NASA and three citizens
groups seeking to halt liftoff because Atlantis will be carrying a
plutonium-powered space probe.
   Shuttle test director Mike Leinbach said overnight checks found
that a controller on one of the three main engines was giving a
faulty fuel pressure reading. The device controls the engine during
the liftoff burn.
   Experts were analyzing the situation to see if the controller
had to be replaced, a task that could take five or six days.
   A decision was not expected until late in the day today or
Wednesday.
   Sources said that after the first low pressure reading, four
more tests were conducted, and the problem did not repeat itself.
   Leinbach said other countdown tasks were proceeding normally
despite four inches of rain overnight. The main job today was
loading fuel aboard the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells.
   The countdown ticked toward a liftoff at 1:29 p.m. Thursday with
the Galileo spacecraft on board.
   Opponents sought a temporary restraining order because Galileo,
which Atlantis' five astronauts are to dispatch toward Jupiter,
carries two generators fueled by 49.4 pounds of plutonium.
   They contend an explosion like that which destroyed the shuttle
Challenger in 1986 could scatter plutonium over heavily populated
east-central Florida.
   NASA responds that in tests empty plutonium containers have been
blown up, shot at and burned to determine how they would survive
all kinds of accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater
than those produced in the Challenger accident, the agency reports.
   Similar devices have been carried on 22 other U.S. spacecraft
without a problem.
   ``We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we
are told to stop,'' NASA test director Ron Phelps said Monday as
the countdown started.
   About 25 people held a brief demonstration at the space center
Monday, staging a mock countdown and then collapsing in mock death
when a woman sprinkled powder representing plutonium.
   They said that if they lost in court they would attempt to stop
the liftoff by infiltrating the launch area in a non-violent
occupation.
   ``We're going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the
court doesn't prevent the launch,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator
of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the three
groups that filed suit.
   Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough.
   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center
to stop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by
helicopters and boats.
   Only a 10-minute launch window exists on Thursday, and NASA
officials are concerned that time could easily be lost dealing with
protesters who might penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat,
plane or on foot.
   The five astronauts assigned to the mission flew to the Kennedy
Space Center Monday from their training base in Houston for final
launch preparations. They were to be briefed today on the flight
plan and progress of the countdown.
   The commander is Donald Williams. The other crew members are
pilot Mike McCulley and mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.

   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two half-hour ``feeds'' of their nightly newscasts, tape
their newscasts for broadcast three hours later on the West Coast,

   Protected by thousands of soldiers and police,
the presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia met today in this
small desert town to discuss a common strategy for dealing with the
region's cocaine lords.
   The meeting was expected to include criticism of President
Bush's emphasis on military-style repression of the cocaine trade.
   Both Peru and Bolivia have called for increased economic aid
from the United States to provide alternate sources of income for
the hundreds of thousands of peasants who grow coca, the raw
material for cocaine.
   Today's gathering took place under heavy security to defend
against feared attacks by the fanatical Shining Path guerrilla
group, which works in alliance with cocaine traffickers in Peru's
coca-growing highland jungles.
   Peru's president Alan Garcia received Presidents Virgilio Barco
and Jaime Paz Zamora this morning at an air force base in Pisco, 45
miles northwest of here, then flew with them by helicopter to Ica
where they were to meet for two hours and issue a joint communique.
   There was no word late this morning on details of the closed
meeting.
   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded in a nearby city where ministers of
eight Latin American nations are planning another high-level
meeting in Ica that is to follow today's gathering.
   The bomb exploded before dawn today in the northern city of
Trujillo, 350 miles north of Lima, where ministers of five Latin
American nations were preparing the agenda for a meeting of eight
Latin American presidents.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which caused
minor damage to a government building half a mile from the hotel
where the ministers were meeting.
   Ica, a remote town of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of
Lima, has limited road access and was chosen for the meetings
because it affords better security than the capital, government
officials said.
   An army battalion was guarding the town's two entrances while
about 3,000 police officers were in charge of security at the plush
Las Dunas hotel, where the meetings are being held.
   Security was stepped up after Shining Path guerrillas launched
attacks in Ica and the surrounding area in the days preceding the
summit.
   Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Carlos Andres
Perez of Venezuela, Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay, Jose Sarney of
Brazil and Carlos Menem of Argentina will join Garcia and Barco in
discussions of drug trafficking, the failed coup in Panama, Latin
America's foreign debt and ecological damage to the Amazon.
   But most attention has focused on today's ``drug summit,'' which
was expected to produce a demand for greater U.S. economic aid to
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Peruvian officials have been sharply critical of Bush's emphasis
on repression to halt cocaine trafficking rather than economic
development that would encourage peasants to shift to crops other
than coca.
   Peru and Bolivia produce more than 90 percent of the world's
coca. Colombian drug cartels turn semi-refined coca paste from Peru
and Boliva into pure cocaine and smuggle it into the United States
and Europe.
   Hundreds of thousands of peasants make their livelihood from
growing coca in Peru and Bolivia, and officials in both countries
say coca cannot be eradicated without providing the growers with an
alternative source of income.
   Bush recently announced $261 million in aid to Colombia, Peru
and Bolivia to fight the cocaine trade, but most of it is in
military aid.
   ``It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes
very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets. It's an
economic problem,'' Garcia said recently. ``It would be enough to
offer a good price and a guaranteed market for the products that
could substitute for coca.''

<HEAD>Court to Resolve Extra Prison Time Issue in Missouri Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
conflict over federal laws authorizing extra prison time for some
criminals.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Arthur Lajuane
Taylor, who said he improperly was sentenced to 15 years in prison
after pleading guilty in federal court in Missouri to illegal
firearm possession.
   The judge increased Taylor's sentence because of his previous
felony convictions.
   Taylor argued that the judge improperly based the enhanced
sentence on his prior convictions for the non-violent crime of
second degree burglary.
   Taylor said under Missouri law burglary in the second degree
includes breaking into an empty building where there is no
potential for violence.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January that
breaking into an empty building has potential for violent harm to
innocent people. The building owner may return or a neighbor may
investigate, the appeals court said in upholding Taylor's sentence.
   Taylor had two previous convictions for second degree burglary
in Missouri and one robbery conviction.
   At issue is the interpretation of laws Congress passed in 1986
against drug abuse and career criminals. The laws permit those
convicted of three previous felonies to be given longer sentences
because of their past crimes.
   But Congress deleted a definition of burglary, creating
confusion over its use as a basis for enhanced prison terms.
   The Justice Department said Congress, despite the omission,
intended to retain a broad definition of burglary.
   But Horton argued that since there is no specific definition of
burglary in the federal laws, Congress meant the common law
definition to apply. Under that theory, he said, the courts should
accept the definition used in the state where the alleged crime
occurs.
   Also, Horton said, the 8th Circuit court's interpretation will
mean longer sentences for many inmates, threatening more
overcrowding in the nation's prisons.
   Horton said other federal appeals courts disagree with the 8th
Circuit court's interpretation.
   The case is Taylor vs. U.S., 88-7194.

<HEAD>Trains Moving to Armenia But Cargo Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have managed to restore some freight
train service to Armenia but radicals in neighboring Azerbaijan are
still sabotaging crucial deliveries of food and other supplies,
Soviet media said today.
   The southern republics have been locked in ethnic violence for
more than 19 months, largely over territorial rights to the
Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenia is seeking control of the area, which is populated
mainly by ethnic Armenians.
   Almost all the supplies that come to Armenia from other parts of
the Soviet Union have to go through Azerbaijan first.
   Soviet troops moved into the region last week to break an
economic blockade that has been strangling Armenia for nearly three
months, and Nagorno-Karabakh for even longer. About 400 trains with
60,000 cars have been reported idled on the tracks in the region.
   In the past 24 hours, authorities did manage to push 1,748 rail
cars of supplies through to Armenia, the official news agency Tass
said today. But those cars did not carry any oil, and the republic
remains strapped for fuel, Tass said, quoting a speech by Deputy
Premier Lev Voronin to the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Voronin said transport in Armenia and Azerbaijan is still
difficult due to ``blown-up bridges and continuing strafing of
trains.''
   Much of the cargo that does arrive in Armenia on its main rail
artery through Azerbaijan has been damaged beyond repair, Pravda
reported today.
   Factory-built temporary houses for victims of last year's
Armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glass
and crushed window frames, it said.
   Pre-furnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project
arrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, and ``they simply
cannot be restored,'' Pravda said.
   Tass said it was particularly difficult to restore transport of
supplies in Nagorno-Karabakh. The regions of Martuninski and
Gadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday,
the newspaper Red Star said.
   It also said weapons were found hidden in sacks of flour on an
Armenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied any knowledge
of the weapons.

   Six journalists have been killed and 10
kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas in Colombia
over the past six months, a Colombian publisher told a meeting of
the Inter-American Press Association.
   The Colombian press ``continues to be trapped in cross-fires''
between the government and guerrillas and drug lords, which it is
battling, said Enrique Santos of the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo.
   ``This occurs in a country where there exists a policy of free
press and a goverment that is respectful of criticism _ but not of
real guarantees for their full exercise,'' Santos said Monday in an
address to the association's annual meeting.
   About 450 editors and publishers from the United States, Canada,
Latin America and the Caribbean are attending the IAPA's 45th
general assembly in this northern industrial city.
   Eduardo Ulibarri, vice president of the association's Press
Freedom and Information Committee, singled out Colombia and Panama
as ``the two most critical cases this year.''
   Jorge Hernandez of the daily newspaper El Colombiano of
Medellin, Colombia, home of the Medellin cocaine cartel, said at a
seminar that he and his colleagues are afraid: ``We're scared to
death.''
   Reporters for El Colombiano have been killed and bombs have been
found in the newspaper's offices.
   After the Colombian government declared war on the country's
cocaine barons in August, drug gangs declared ``total war'' on the
journalists who had helped expose them.
   Santos said that, as a result, the Colombian press omits the
names of judges and magistrates that handle narcotics cases and the
names of government officials ``on the front lines of this
struggle.''
   To protect journalists, newspaper stories about drug traffickers
do not carry reporters' bylines and reports about terrorist
activities have been played down to avoid ``playing the terrorists'
game,'' Santos said.
   ``The permanent climate of terrorism _ psychological and real _
has obliged the press to take exceptional measures to protect
itself,'' he said.
   Santos said 10 journalists were kidnapped for several days in
May and June by Marxist guerrillas of the National Liberation Army
to pressure them into publishing messages from the organization.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, editor for the daily Bogota newspaper El
Espectador that was bombed last month by drug traffickers, urged
the IAPA to find a way ``to combat this tremendous flogging.''
   ``We must all look for a solution so we don't have a press
dominated by the narcotics-trafficking mafia,'' he said.
   Cano, whose brother was killed in 1986 by drug traffickers, told
the group that Colombian journalists receive death threats against
themselves and their families and require bodyguards.
   He said newspaper advertisers also have been threatened by the
drug lords.
   Reporting on Nicaragua, Cristiana Chamorro of La Prensa of
Managua said that, despite official promises of press freedom,
reprisals by that country's leftist Sandinista government are
common against the news media.
   La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper, is owned by
her mother, Violeta Chamorro, the opposition coalition's
presidential candidate for February 1990 elections.
   Cristiana Chamorro said President Daniel Ortega's promise two
years ago to permit the creation of an independent television
station remains unfulfilled, a Nicaraguan-born reporter was
expelled from the country and radio stations are censored or forced
to broadcast government news.
   The situation has improved for journalists working in Paraguay
and Chile, publishers from these two South American countries
reported.
   ``Several newspapers that were closed at the beginning of the
current military government (of Gen. Augusto Pinochet) are now in
circulation,'' Emilio Filippi of the Santiago newspaper La Epoca
said.
   But he said Manuel Cabieses, editor of the ultra-leftist
magazine Punto Final, has been charged with ``presumed offenses
against the president...'' Cabieses has been charged in court, but
has not been arrested.
   The magazine, banned since late President Salvador Allende's
overthrow in 1973, was allowed to publish again in September.

   Hundreds of Iranian soldiers repatriated
after the cease-fire in the war with Iraq will be given back their
old jobs, according to a bill passed Tuesday by Iran's parliament.
   Under the new law, the private and public sectors must reinstate
the veterans to their old jobs, Tehran Radio said in a report
monitored in Cyprus.
   It also requires all government offices to provide the veterans
with training, education and medical facilities. A soldier will be
entitled to a loan if he wants to start a business or buy a car,
the radio said.
   Former POWs will be exempt from taxes for three years and won't
have to pay taxes dating back to 1980, when the war broke out, the
report said.
   A United Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the war in August
1988, although subsequent peace talks have deadlocked.
   Iran has freed 1,466 Iraqi prisoners; Iraq has released 949
Iranians.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran
before the exchange began, and 19,284 held by Iraq. But U.N. and
other officials estimate the number of POWs at more than 100,000.

   About 20 people wearing blue ribbons stood
outside court in support of two lawmen today as they went on trial
on charges of plotting to kidnap a suspected drug dealer and
torture him with a hot curling iron.
   Sheriff Wesley Liddell Jr. of Love County, Okla., and his
son-in-law, Marietta, Okla., police Officer Roger Ray Hilton, are
accused of conspiracy and interstate travel to commit violence.
   FBI agents arrested them in May, charging that they plotted to
abduct the alleged dealer from Texas to get information about drug
lab locations in Oklahoma. No kidnapping took place.
   Many residents were outraged by the arrests and held a
$50-a-plate fund-raiser for the officers' legal expenses. The
defendants today did not confront their supporters and were taken
into the courthouse through another door.
   Federal prosecutors planned to offer nine hours of conversations
secretly taped by a Marietta police officer. Defense attorney
Darryl Roberts said the accuracy of the transcripts will be at
issue during the trial.
   ``I think when this case is over, you will be disappointed in
our federal agents,'' he said.
   The case is being tried in Sherman because it has the closest
federal court to Marietta, which is on the Texas state line.

   Five suspected Kurdish guerrillas and two

   The announcement, carried by the semi-official Anatolia News

school.
   The guerrillas opened fire on pursuing government troops, the
report said. The shooting lasted sporadically until Tuesday morning.
   One wounded guerrilla was captured along with a rocket launcher

<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honocker today compared
the pro-democracy uprising in China with the unrest in East Germany
and criticized what he said was a campaign to defame the Communist
countries.
   Municipal officials took a softer line in the East German city
of Leipzig, however, allowing 70,000 protesters to rally for reform
in the city center.
   The official tolerance of Monday's peaceful march for an end to
authoritarian rule contrasted sharply with the violence police used
to break up similar demonstrations over the weekend in six East
German cities.
   Despite the new tolerance in Leipzig, Honecker gave no
indication that he is about to change his government's course.
   In a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin, he said:
   ``Any attempt of imperialism to destabilize the socialist
construction or to slander its successes and achievements is now,
and will be in the future, nothing other than fruitless charging of
Don Quixote against the ever-moving blades of a windmill,'' the
official news agency ADN quoted him as saying.
   ADN said Honecker and Yao recalled the events of last June in
Beijing, when troops crushed the Chinese pro-democracy movement.
   ``In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learned
from the counter-revolutionary revolt in Beijing and the present
defamation campaign against the GDR (East Germany) and other
Socialist states,'' ADN said.
   That statement appeared to signal Honecker's willingness to
crush dissent, if necessary.
   Also today, Manfred Stolpe, deputy director of the Lutheran
Church Federation, said there were ``working groups'' of government
and church officials who were discussing the current unrest in East
Germany.
   But he denied a West German radio report that said high-level
talks had been held between church leaders and government officials.
   Meanwhile, Hans Otto Furian, a Lutheran church provost in East
Berlin, said in an interview that ``positive developments in our
nation can only come about if a new orientation breaks through.''
   ``The Communist Party must give up its grip on total power,'' he
said. ``It can't happen with anything less.''
   Over the weekend, hundreds of people were arrested in East
Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and other cities by club-swinging police.
West German television said many already were sentenced to jail
terms of up to six months.
   Leipzig, an industrial city of 500,000, has been the scene of
several clashes in recent weeks as police moved to crush
demonstrations stirred in part by an exodus of disillusioned
citizens to the West.
   After two nights of clashes in East Berlin, many feared police
would also use violence to break up Monday's peace march in Leipzig.
   But beforehand, officials of the Leipzig Communist Party
promised to push for a talks between citizens and the government.
``We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue
socialism in our nation,'' the officials said in a statement.
   The message was read over Leipzig state radio during services at
four city churches and over loudspeakers during the demonstration,
witnesses said.
   Police and paramilitary troops watched the Leipzig march, but
did not intervene. Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas
Lutheran church in Leipzig, said he was surprised by the restraint.
   He told West Germany's ZDF television network that some
demonstrators even ``began conversations with paramilitary troops''
when the crowd was dispersing.
   West German radio also reported peaceful demonstrations Monday
in Dresden, Plauen and Halle.
   There is no indication, however, that the government intends to
soften its tough stand against the reforms sweeping such East bloc
allies as Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   But Monday's demonstrations were far different from the weekend
marches across the country of 16.6 million people, when police
marched into crowds of demonstrators and hit, chased and arrested
hundreds.
   Protesters paraded through Leipzig on Monday shouting, ``We Need
Freedom,'' ``Democracy,'' and ``No Violence,'' witnesses said on
condition of anonymity.
   The march was the largest single protest in East Germany since a
1953 workers uprising was put down by Soviet tanks.
   Earlier Monday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany denounced
the East German government as ``rigidly authoritarian'' and said
relations with East Berlin ``cannot prosper'' under present
conditions.
   Also, 18 Lutheran leaders issued an appeal in East Berlin
calling on the government to implement democratic reforms and
urging all sides to refrain from violence.
   At least 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months,
either over Hungary's newly-open border to Austria or after seeking
refuge in Bonn's embassies in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw,
Poland.
   The exodus deeply embarrassed the government on its two-day 40th
anniversary festivities, which were attended by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev hinted that he favors for East Germany the types of
reforms he is overseeing in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Soviet Advisers Likely Still Involved in Afghanistan: US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is still providing ``vast
amounts'' of weapons and other support to the Afghanistan
government, and the White House said Tuesday that it seems likely
Soviet advisers are still involved in the fighting.
   Moscow has said its last troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan
in February.
   The New York Times reported in Tuesday editions that a
confidential Bush administration intelligence report said Soviet
advisers wearing Afghan uniforms were launching Scud missiles at
rebels.
   ``It seems a likely conclusion, but I cannot be more specific,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said about Soviet
involvement.
   ``Our position is still the same, that the Soviets are supplying
vast amounts of weapons and money and support to the Afghanistan
government and we similarly are staying involved on that basis. But
I can't get into people and so forth.''
   Asked if the United States believed the Soviets have withdrawn,
Fitzwater said: ``We feel they've withdrawn from Afghanistan, yes.
But Soviet aid is still going back in.''
   The Times said American intelligence agencies prepared the
report for the State Department and the White House.
   Since the Soviet pullout, Moscow has continued massive shipments
of arms, food and fuel to buttress the government of President
Najibullah. The United States, in turn, has kept up military
shipments to guerillas trying to oust Najibullah.
   U.S. intelligence officials had predicted an quick victory for
the rebels once the Soviet troops left, but the guerillas have
gained little ground and have been beset with infighting.
   The United States furnished an estimated $600 million in
military aid to the Afghan rebels last year and more than $2.3
billion over the past nine years.

   Soviet mushers will compete for the
first time this winter in the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled dog race and
will get their training and equipment from three-time champion
Susan Butcher.
   Butcher is taking a crash course in Russian for the 1,100-mile
trek and provided dogs and sleds for the two Soviets, who arrive
Nov. 1 for four months of training with Butcher and her husband,
Dave Monson.
   ``They'll be using my dogs this year,'' she said Monday. ``In
subsequent races, they'll be bringing over their own.
   ``There's just not enough time to make a trained racing team out
of inexperienced racers. They know how to work dogs, but that's
quite different from racing. They're coming over with nothing but
their cold-weather gear.''
   In its 17 years, the Anchorage-to-Nome race has included mushers
from Japan, Italy, Norway and Australia, among other nations, but
none from the Soviet Union.
   Rosemary Phillips, Iditarod executive director, said the Soviets
also have agreed to help organize an invitational Alaska-Soviet
race in 1991. It would cover about 1,000 miles from Nome to the
Soviet port city of Anadyr.
   ``The Soviets are not familiar with sled dog racing as we know
it _ especially long-distance racing,'' Phillips said. ``They'll
train here, in Alaska, and then they'll return to train others.''
   One of the Soviets is Nicholai Yettiye, 25, a secondary school
physical education teacher and a member of an expedition that
traveled 1,000 miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the
Soviet Far East to Alaska.
   The other is Alexander Reznyuk, 43, chairman of a regional
sports committee.
   Fifty-four mushers have signed up for the 1990 Iditarod,
scheduled to begin March 4 and pay out $275,000 in prize money.
   Butcher and Monson supplied a dog team for an Australian musher
in 1985 and for a Norwegian in 1986. The Norwegian, Rune
Hesthammer, came in 10th and was Rookie of the Year, Butcher said.
   Butcher has 130 dogs in her kennel, more than enough to go
around.

<HEAD>Amnesty Appeals to Somalia to Review Human Rights Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International appealed Tuesday to the
government of Somalia to mark the 20th anniversary of President
Mohamed Siad Barre's coming to power by changing the legal system
to safeguard human rights.
   The human rights group said it has been been concerned about
human rights violations in the East African nation for years and
has documented a persistent pattern of gross violations.
   These include imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, torture
and ill treatment, detention without trial and unfair trials, and
executions, it said.
   Amnesty International called for an end to Somalia's national
security laws, which outlaw some forms of legitimate freedom of
expression, provide for indefinite detention without trial, and
have permitted ``grossly unfair'' political trials ending in death
sentences.
   It said impartial investigations into alleged extrajudicial
executions were urgent as were safeguards to prevent such
executions happing again.
   The group said the government has released hundreds of political
prisoners since 1988, but other suspected government opponents and
political prisoners remain in detention, including two who have
been held for more than 10 years.
   An Amnesty International delegation visited Somalia in June for
the first time in 20 years, and said it received assurances from
Barre and other government officials that they would cooperate in
protecting human rights.
   On July 13, however, several prominent government critics were
arrested in the capital of Mogadishu, Amnesty International said,
including Ismail Jumaale Ossobleh, a lawyer who has defended
political prisoners, and Abdulkadir Aden Abdullah Osman, a former
government minister and son of Somalia's first president.
   Both are being held without charge or trial in the National
Services headquarters in Mogadishu. Amnesty International said it
regards them as prisoners of conscience and appealed to the Somali
government for their immediate and unconditional release.
   The organization also said it raised with the government the
reported killings of people arrested in Mogadishu after
demonstrations on July 14. At least 46 people were reported to have
been summarily executed by soldiers on a beach near Jezira,
southwest of Mogadishu, on July 15.
   A survivor is said to have reported the killings to the minister
of interior, and the president has ordered an investigation,
Amnesty International said.
   Somalia had earlier denied the reported executions.
   It said illegal executions by the Somali security forces, which
were widespread in the north after attacks by the Somali National
Movement in May 1988, have also been reported this year in
different parts of the country.
   Barre took power in the one-party state on Oct. 21, 1969.

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday that
religious freedom must be preserved in this overwhelmingly Moslem
nation, where there have been signs of pressure on the small Roman
Catholic minority.
   Religious freedom is enshrined in Indonesia's constitution and
the state should make sure it ``is is indeed a fundamental human
right, one which should be enjoyed by all religious communities, as
well as individuals,'' the pope told a group of Islamic and other
religious leaders.
   Vatican spokesmen said John Paul was reflecting concerns of
Indonesia's Catholic bishops about two proposed laws the church
considers unconstitutional.
   One would require Islamic instruction in all public and private
schools, including Catholic institutions, and the other would give
legal recognition to hundreds of Islamic courts.
   The church considers Indonesia generally tolerant, but views the
proposed laws as signs of growing pressure by Islamic
fundamentalists on Roman Catholics, who number only 5 million in a
nation of 157 million Moslems.
   Foreign missionaries told reporters Tuesday in Jogjakarta, a
city in central Java where the pontiff pope celebrated Mass, that
fundamentalists threatened harm to local residents who provided
housing to Catholic pilgrims.
   Nonetheless, an enthusiastic crowd of more than 150,000
assembled in sweltering tropical heat for the Mass on the grounds
of the Indonesian Air Force Academy.
   Barefoot young women in sarongs strewed rose petals in John
Paul's path as he walked on a red carpet. He spoke from an altar
flanked by World War II fighter planes.
   Jogjakarta, considered Java's cultural heartland, is surrounded
by temples set in rice paddies. The Borobudur Temple, considered
one of the world's great Buddhist monuments, was damaged by Moslem
extremists in 1983.
   A temple complex dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu goddess, also is
nearby.
   The official news agency Antara reported from Flores, on the
pope's schedule for Wednesday, that a woman dropped dead in front
of a statue of the Virgin Mary in Gelora Samador stadium, where he
is to say Mass.
   She was described as a descendant of a local king. No cause of
death was given.

   A bomb blew up at a high school today for
the second day in a row, causing minor damage but no injuries and
canceling class for 1,200 students, authorities said.
   Charles Petersen, agent in charge of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Indianapolis, said a pipe bomb
exploded in a hall outside the auditorium at Anderson High School
about 7:30 a.m.
   Several students and teachers were in the building, but classes
were not scheduled to begin until 8 a.m.
   ATF investigators were on their way to investigate a bomb blast
about 24 hours earlier on the opposite side of the gymnasium, which
shares a hall with the auditorium. They arrived minutes after the
second explosion.
   Peterson offered no motive for the bombings and said it was too
soon to say for certain whether the attacks were connected. He said
the precise type of bomb used Monday was not known.
   Classes were canceled for the second consecutive day at the
school, about 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis.
   Police Chief Ron Rheam said school would be opened Wednesday
after a thorough search of the building.
   ``We're not going to allow anyone to come back to school with
the possibility of anyone being injured,'' he said.
   Maurice Jones, a freshman, and other students lingering outside
the school said they were uneasy about returning to class.
   ``I think ... they should cancel school for a certain number of
days because we're risking our lives,'' Jones said.
   ``I even have a fear of something blowing out into my face while
I'm walking down the hall. It could be anywhere.''

   Libya's official news agency Tuesday assailed NATO's
naval exercises in the Mediterranean, saying they threaten peace
and will pollute the ocean.
   The monthlong ``Deterrence Force'' exercises began Monday in the
western Mediterranean. NATO described the maneuvers as routine and
said they involve forces from the United States, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, West Germany, Britain, Spain and France.
   In a dispatch monitored in Rome, the news agency JANA said the
exercises ``flagrantly threaten peace and security in the
Mediterranean. These hostile maneuvers diametrically threaten air
and naval navigation.''
   The commentary said the exercises also ``harm the environment of
the Mediterranean by contaminating its waters and destroying its
natural life.''
   JANA said the maneuvers also give justification to ``the other
camp,'' apparently referring to the Soviet Union, to deploy its
fleet in the Mediterranean and turn the area into a ``zone of
military conflict.''
   The dispatch said Libya wants to turn the Mediterranean into a
``lake of peace.''
   In January, U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan jets in a
dogfight about 70 miles off Libya.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed the use of an
anti-racketeering law against 26 abortion opponents for incidents
at a Philadelphia clinic.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that
use of the racketeering law violated the protesters' free-speech
rights.
   The protesters were sued successfully by operators of the
abortion clinic.
   Similar lawsuits, each invoking the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), have been filed
against anti-abortion activists in cities such as Pittsburgh,
Chicago and Brookline, Mass.
   Antonio Califa, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in
Washington, recently wrote: ``The ACLU believes that civil RICO's
potential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression is
enormous.''
   The concern centers on the possibility political protesters will
be labeled ``racketeers'' and held financially liable for doing
nothing more than expressing their views.
   But in upholding a $108,000 award against the 26 Philadelphia
protesters last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
their actions ``went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech and
protest.''
   The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully
entered the Northeast Women's Center in Philadelphia. According to
trial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor,
damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassed
patients.
   ``An assistant district attorney who witnessed a demonstration
testified that the demonstrators' activity rose to a `frenzy' and
that he delayed leaving the center out of fear for his phsyical
safety,'' the appeals court noted.
   It added: ``Civil RICO could appropriately be applied to
defendants' intimidation and harassment of the center resulting in
the destruction of its property.''
   Michael McMonagle, executive director of Pro-Life Coalition of
Southeast Pennsylvania, said ``this is one battle in a long war. We
intend to continue our efforts to non-violently save children and
mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. This case will
not deter that one bit.''
   The 26 protesters are members of the coalition.
   Edmond A. Tiryak, attorney for Northeast Women's Center, said
``this decision shows that our society will not tolerate the use of
fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on
women seeking abortion services.''
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether a Texas man who murdered a deputy
sheriff 10 years ago may raise the issue of his mental retardation
in a new attack on his death sentence.
   The court's decision, expected sometime in 1990, could clarify
the scope _ and retroactive effects _ of its decision last June 26
that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers but nly if
jurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental condition into
consideration.
   _ Agreed to use the case of a convicted California robber to
dispel some uncertainty over when items seized in a police search
may be used against criminal suspects.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Terry Brice Horton,
sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery, illegal
firearms possession and other charges.
   _ Overturned a fine against a Pennsylvania newspaper for
publishing conversations of a bookmaker whose customer's telephone
was tapped by police.
   The justices ordered a state court to reconsider a $1,000 fine
and $17,409 in lawyers' fees imposed against The Easton Express.
The newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts
accidentally placed in public court records.
   The high court said the case should be restudied in light of the
justices' ruling last June that spared a Florida newspaper from
having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published.
   _ Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine
Puerto Rico men accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargo
depot in Connecticut six years ago.
   The justices said they will decide whether all the tape
recordings made during court-authorized electronic surveillance of
the defendants may be used as trial evidence.
   A federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be
used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping
quickly enough.
   In the abortion-protest appeal acted on today, lawyers for the
26 protesters decried ``an unprecedented and dangerous expansion
of'' the federal law primarily aimed at fighting organized crime.
   ``Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... Martin
Luther King was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property
and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business
policies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appeal
contended.
   ``So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheid
with the goal of changing the investment policies of a
university,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violation
should be found if no economic profit motive exists.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case so
the court could consider whether a profit-making element is needed
for RICO prosecutions. Four such votes are needed to grant review.
   Lawyers for the clinic urged the justices to reject the appeal,
and accused the 26 protesters of deceptively trying to portray
their demonstrations as peaceful.
   ``Those individuals who engaged in peaceful and protected
activities are not and were never parties to this case. The (26)
are those who exceeded the bounds of protected activity and engaged
in violent and unlawful activities,'' the clinic's lawyers said.
   The case is McMonagle vs. Northeast Women's Center, 88-2137.

<HEAD>Former Football Player Awarded $11.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has concluded that a defective
football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a
severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $11.2 million.
   The helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably
dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of Richard
Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County Circuit Court jury decided
Monday in an 11-1 vote.
   Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical
impairments and requires 24-hour care.
   It apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a
Bike helmet has been presented to a jury. Bike has been in the
helmet business since 1976.
   Mark R. Bocci, an attorney for Austria and his parents, John and
Perla Austria, said several other cases against Bike had been
settled out of court without disclosure of payments.
   Bocci and James M. Pippin, also representing the Austrias,
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had
not been adequately tested before the company marketed it.
   Bike and the Kendall Research Center, which tested helmets for
Bike, are both liable for damages. Both are subsidiaries of
Colgate-Palmolive Corp.
   Charles Peery, a Seattle lawyer for Bike, told jurors last week
that helmets similar to the one worn by Austria are used by 80
percent of the players in the Northwest and Alaska, from junior
high school teams to professionals.
   The Air Power model contains a bladder at the crown of the
helmet that is inflated with air. Other padding includes foam
strips, called sizers, that come in various sizes.
   Lawyers for the Austrias contended that the Air Power model for
large heads did not meet national testing standards, although
smaller helmets did pass the tests. They said detailed company
testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984.
   Peery argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a
subdural hematoma, bleeding in the brain caused by a blow, and
contended there was no proof that a football injury caused
Austria's hematoma.
   Peery said Austria had ignored advice from his physician not to
play football while he suffered headaches.
   Jurors concluded that Austria was 2 percent at fault, thus
reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for
daily care the rest of his life.
   William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, said
there was a strong chance of an appeal.

   Duke Power Co. customers whose
electricity was knocked out by Tropical Storm Hugo have been told
to make their own estimates of what they owe.
   That decision was made Monday after customers lit up
switchboards complaining that their bills didn't reflect how long
the storm left them in the dark. Some said they were blacked out up
to half the billing period.
   It will all be straightened out on the next bill when meters are
read.
   About 210,000 customers got or will get estimated bills because
meter readers were diverted to guide visiting work crews or
couldn't safely reach meters.
   ``Customers concerned about the estimates may make their own
estimates and pay what they feel is appropriate,'' said spokeswoman
Mary Boyd. ``The next billing period, the meters will be read and a
true-up will occur.''
   ``We know the estimates are wrong,'' she said.

   Lawyers for three environmental groups argued
today for a court order stopping Thursday's scheduled launch of a
nuclear-powered probe from the space shuttle on the ground ``there
is a very high probability of an accident.''
   But lawyers for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration countered that the $1.5 billion, six-year mission to
Jupiter carried ``very low risks'' and that even a few days delay
would force the agency to drop some of its scientific objectives.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch took the case under advisement
after hearing 2{ hours of argument and did not indicate when he
will rule. The countdown for the flight began Monday morning.
   The environmental groups, led by the Florida Coalition for Peace
and Justice, asked Gasch for a temporary restraining order and
preliminary injunction against the launch, scheduled from the
Kennedy Space Center at 1:29 p.m. EDT Thursday.
   Even if the suit is dismissed, an engine problem discovered
overnight could delay the launch several days should repairs be
needed, NASA said.
   ``The fundamental issue in this case is whether the defendants
adequately complied'' with environmental laws, Edward Lee Rogers
argued for the environmental groups. ``Our concern is that for the
first time 50 pounds of plutonium are being sent off into space
from the space shuttle ... where there is a high probability of an
accident.''
   Rogers said government studies show that the statistical
probability of a shuttle accident is one in 78 and that the Galileo
mission, which involves the space probe looping around Earth twice
for momentum, each provides further opportunity for mishap that
would spread plutonium pollution.
   ``If ever a case needs to comply fully to the letter of the law,
this one is it,'' he said.
   Rogers said NASA, which claims the possibility of an accident
causing plutonium contamination to be extremely remote, has
insufficient historical data on which to base such a conclusion.
   ``Columbus didn't have much experience either,'' said Judge
Gasch.
   ``He wasn't going to contaminate the world either,'' Rogers
replied.
   Steven Frank, a Justice Department lawyer arguing the case for
the space agency, said the two nuclear generators aboard Galileo
are similar to the 38 that have flown previously on 22 missions,
none on the space shuttle.
   Although three of those flights had accidents, he said, only one
resulted in any dispersal of plutonium _ and that it acted as it
was designed to do at the time, in 1964. Since then, the nuclear
generators have gotten better shielding.

   President Bush is taking antibiotics after
removal of a benign cyst from his finger, White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Dr. Allen Smith, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center surgeon who
performed Friday's surgery, saw Bush on Tuesday morning for a
post-operative evaluation.
   Smith, according to Fitzwater, ``said the president's doing very
well and there are no complications from the surgery.''
   ``There is no evidence of infection or any other follow-up
problems. The stitches will be removed in approximately two weeks.
The president will need to wear a splint on the finger during
periods of vigorous activity, such as any exercise,'' Fitzwater
said, adding that Bush had ``little, if any, pain.''
   Bush is ``taking some antibiotic pills,'' the spokesman said.
   Bush, who is left-handed, had the cyst removed in a 25-minute
operation at Walter Reed. The cyst had been present for several
years but had recently become larger and bothersome, aides said.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A con man who wooed women with false
tales of his exploits as the nation's youngest major general and
his work for the CIA was sentenced to 15 months' psychiatric
treatment in a prison hospital today.
   U.S. District Judge Earl E. O'Connor ordered Robert S. Lyons,
35, to undergo treatment at a medical center in Springfield, Mo.,
or Rochester, Minn.
   Lyons was also fined $500 and placed on probation for one year.
He faced up to three years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   Lyons pleaded guilty in July to falsely impersonating a federal
officer.
   ``I'm sorry for this episode and the entire train of events,''
the water purification salesman told the judge. He said he had
repeatedly sought counseling.
   Authorities said Lyons showed acquaintances a publication called
the Pentagon Gazette with a cover picture of him in an Army shirt
with general's stars. The newsletter claimed to be a
special-edition tribute to one of ``Washington's well-known,
best-kept secrets.''
   His guilty plea was in connection with a story he had told a
girlfriend _ that he was an Army general working for the CIA and
the National Security Council and that he needed $1,000 to get out
of the CIA. The woman gave him a check Jan. 31.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Patton said Lyons' tale came
unraveled when Lyons told his girlfriend that he had been convicted
in the Iran-Contra arms deal, had lost his military retirement and
that because of the possibility of terrorist attack he was under
the protection of the Secret Service.
   The government found out about Lyons when the woman contacted
the Secret Service to check the story, Patton said.
   The prosecutor said Lyons did serve in the Army and was given an
honorable discharge as a private.

<HEAD>Club Gets International Cuisine Adapted To Strict Kosher Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a small club get to sample
international foods normally forbidden to them under strict Jewish
dietary laws, thanks to a hotel's executive chef who experiments
and adapts recipes.
   The Kosher Dining Club, with more than 200 members, gathers
every six weeks at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel for meals
prepared by chief Jim Lawson.
   Among other things, the dietary laws set in the Old Testament
require that animals be slaughtered in a specific way, forbid the
mixture of dairy products with meat, and forbid eating shellfish
and cloven-footed animals such as pigs.
   Cooking for the club is ``always a challenge,'' Lawson said.
``I've always got to work from non-kosher recipes and kosher-ize
them.''
   For example, for a meal that featured Scandinavian food, Lawson
had to substitute the hams and cheeses common to the Nordic diet
with corned beef, fish and appetizers without dairy products.
   ``It takes a lot of investigation and experimentation to come up
with a winner, and still keep it kosher,'' he said.
   And on Mexican night, a consultant from the Mexican Embassy in
Washington even complimented the food, Lawson said.
   ``He kept saying that he couldn't believe how authentic it
was,'' he said.
   Lawson said many of his recipes are also health-conscious, low
in cholesterol and light in texture, differing from the sometimes
heavy, traditional Jewish food.
   ``I guess you can call this kosher nouvelle,'' said Lawson, who
began his training in a kosher hotel kitchen in Minnesota.
   The Kosher Dining Club was the brainchild of Henry Zetlin, who
runs the kosher catering service at the hotel. Every six weeks
since he called together some friends for the first meal in 1986,
he goes to the library to research a country and writes to its
embassy for suggestions on authentic recipes.
   The Sheraton's kitchen carries the certification of the Orthodox
Union, whose monitoring assures guests that the service is kosher.

<HEAD>Police Get the Drop On Suspect in Night Deposit Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police are warning residents of this
Dallas suburb to not always believe what they read, especially when
it comes to notes taped to bank night deposit slots.
   A 39-year-old man was arrested Sunday and accused of taping
notes to night deposit boxes at two banks. The notes told customers
the deposit boxes were out of service and directed them instead to
put their money in a nearby Postal Service drop box.
   ``It was typed _ it looked fairly official,'' said police Sgt.
Gary Anderson.
   Officer George Harris spotted one of the notes on his beat and
police made a hurried check of other banks. They found one more
note, Anderson said.
   Police staked out both locations and arrested Joe Ben Hunsaker
while he was allegeding loading a mailbox into his pickup.
   No night deposits were found in either mailbox.
   ``Initially, he's been charged with forgery, going with the
premise that the bank didn't make the note,'' Anderson said.
   Police said similar scams have been reported in Dallas,
Richardson, Grapevine, Bedford, Grand Prairie and Irving.
   Anderson had a warning for bank customers: ``My word to people
is if they see any notes on the night deposit boxes, don't put any
money in there. No legitimate bank would do something like that.''
   Hunsaker, being held in lieu of $8,740.50 bail, also faced 14
outstanding check forgery warrants, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Strict new traffic regulations and higher
fines went into effect in the world's largest city this week, but
they seem to have had little effect on the normally chaotic traffic.
   At the major intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida
Insurgentes, a pollution-blackened statue of Cuauhtemoc, Mexico's
last Aztec king, presided over a scene even more confusing than
usual.
   ``There isn't any change in the traffic,'' said Roman Tejeda, a
48-year-old physicist in an orange Volkswagen. ``The only change is
going to be in the attitude of the police. They're going to rob
more from people.''
   Illegal turns and mass jay-walking were out of control.
Motorists generally disregarded seatbelt requirements. And
policemen could do precious little about it _ they had no ticket
books.
   For weeks, street vendors have been hawking copies of the 1989
Federal District Transit Regulations, prepping Mexico City's 19
million residents for the tenfold increase in traffic fines that
went into effect Monday.
   Some drivers and pedestrians weren't aware that the regulations
took effect this week. ``I've seen them selling the booklets in the
street, but I didn't know the new rules were in effect already,''
said driver Sara Arriaga.
   The Mexico City Council published the new rules in August. In
addition to stiffening fines for such offenses as running red
lights, illegal turns or jaywalking, the new rules add a few
offenses to the list, among them driving without a seatbelt and
necking while driving.
   Until Monday, the fines for violations ranged from 100 to 500
pesos _ 4 cents to 20 cents. The new regulations provide fines
equaling one to five times the minimum daily wage, or $3.60 to $18.
   ``We're just briefing drivers, inviting them to respect the new
rules and not commit infractions,'' said transit officer Basilio
Haro as a van tried to pull an illegal left at the
Insurgentes-Reforma traffic circle.
   ``Good afternoon. You're obstructing the turnout. You have to be
careful because the new regulations are in effect,'' Haro told the
driver.
   The fine for the turn, once four cents, is three days' minimum
wage, or 24,000 pesos, about $9. But Haro couldn't write a ticket
because his old ticket book based on the former regulations has
been taken away and he doesn't expect to get a new one for 15 days.
   Violations went on all around him.
   A pair of young vendors on the street corner said they sell
about 40 copies of the new regulations a day, at 3,000 pesos, or
$1.20, each.
   A 32-year-old insurance company employee who stopped to buy a
copy said she wanted to be know her rights in order to avoid police
extortion.
   ``The fines were insignificant, before,'' said Margarita
Barragan. ``Now that they're higher, they're going to increase the
bribes,'' she said, and turned to cross the street in the middle of
the block.
   A retired policeman, who was chatting nearby with an on-duty
colleague, denied the charge. ``Bribes have always been encouraged
by the lawbreakers so they won't have to go out of their way to pay
fines,'' he said. He refused to give his name.
   A taxi driver, waiting on the curbside for a fare, said he used
his seatbelt for the first time ever Monday, because he had ``a
little more fear of the police.''
   But he said he didn't think the rules would make much difference.
   ``It's not going to be worth much, because you can't change a
population's future from one day to the next with a rule,'' said
Santiago Guerrero. ``You need conscience and education about
traffic safety.''
   At one point on the traffic circle, a pedestrian in a
pin-striped suit, ignoring crosswalks, crossed in front of another
cop. The 21-year-old salesman said he knew about the new rules and
thought they would improve safety if everyone would follow them.
   But, said Noe Villada, ``To tell the truth, I hadn't thought
about it.''

   Federal agents today said they seized 871
pounds of cocaine valued at $40 million in a truckload of apples
and arrested two people.
   The drugs were concealed in boxes of apples from California and
Washington state in the back of a 45-foot tractor-trailer, said
Victor Pedalino, Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
   ``It's probably the most expensive apples that have ever arrived
in the state of New Jersey,'' he said.
   Pedalino said the cocaine seized early Monday appears to be from
Colombia.
   He would not give details of the operation but said surveillance
led to the truck, which they seized in a parking lot near Newark
International Airport.
   The driver, Sugundino Reyes Flores, a 36-year-old Cuban, was
arrested on drug charges. Also arrested was Carlos Arturo Ceron,
33, a Colombian who authorities said organized the shipment.
   Flores was scheduled for a court appearance later in the day.
Ceron was hospitalized in serious condition after jumping from the
fourth-floor window of his motel room in Secaucus as authorities
tried to arrest him, Pedalino said.
   The 27,000-apple shipment was headed to Albany, N.Y., from Los
Angeles, but Newark appeared to be the final destination for the
cocaine, said Robert Van Etten, agent in charge of the Customs
Service in New Jersey.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressmen Complain About New TV Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. congressmen on Tuesday complained
to European officials that a plan to limit the broadcast of
American and other foreign-made TV programs amounted to ``just a
plain old trade barrier.''
   The legislators, part of an 11-member delegation, wound up a
five-day trip with a stop in Brussels to visit the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the European Community.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the legislators held a
``spirited exchange'' with officials of the 12-nation trading bloc
about the new measure that presses local TV stations to air a
majority of European-made entertainment programs.
   ``We feel very strongly about this issue,'' said Gephardt, who
is the majority leader of the House of Representatives.
   ``It's especially troubling for Americans to see a product that
we do have some skill in ... and some advantage to be closed down
to any extent,'' he said.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said, ``It's a question of access
in one of the few areas where the United States has maintained a
positive balance of trade.''
   Another Californian, Republican Robert Lagomarsino, described
the move as ``just a plain old trade barrier'' that could lead to
``some fairly severe consequences.''
   The Bush administration had lobbied strongly against the plan,
which was approved last week by foreign ministers of the community
nations. The United States argued the move would hurt the European
earnings of the American film industry and might violate
international trade rules.
   The plan was part of the community's move to create a single
market of 320 million consumers in late 1992. By that date, the
dozen nations are scheduled to remove the many trade barriers
restricting the free flow of people, money, goods and services.
   The TV measure spelled out the conditions under which
broadcasters in Europe would be able to transmit channels
throughout the community.
   As part of that, it said governments must ensure that a majority
of transmission time be reserved _ ``where practicable and by
appropriate means'' _ for European-made programs.
   Gephardt said the community officials explained the measure was
``a goal and not a hard and fast rule.''
   The community officials, according to Gephardt, said, ``Even
though this is their statement, that it doesn't mean in reality it
is going to happen.''
   Officials said last week the measure was a political commitment,
not a legal obligation.
   Berman said American film producers were not asking for a
certain share of the European market.
   ``We're asking for the traditional factors which affect
programming decisions, that is, consumer interest, to be the test
for what happens in post-Europe '92 television programming,'' he
said.
   U.S. officials have argued that the plan amounted to a local
content provision, which refers to measures requiring that a
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically.
   The surge in imports of American TV programs has prompted some
European politicians to urge imposition of quotas, contending
European culture was being threatened.

   The son of a man convicted of bank
robbery was sentenced Tuesday to more than nine years in prison for
helping to plot his father's escape from jail and the murder of
federal witnesses.
   The escape never occurred and no witnesses were killed.
   Kennis ``Kip'' McCoy, 22, of Slaters Branch, Ky., was described
by defense attorneys and the judge as a man who loved his father
too much but didn't know when to pull away.
   ``I think you were sorely used by your father,'' U.S. District
Judge Charles Haden said. ``That's something he'll have to live
with.''
   ``That's a heck of an epitaph as he faces the penitentiary, but
he loved his father too much,'' said defense attorney Joseph
Martorella.
   John P. McCoy, 43, was sentenced this summer to life in prison
plus 43 years for robbing the Matewan National Bank's Kermit branch
o&amp;!T286,000, counterfeiting up tp $800,000, and plotting his escape
from the Cabell County Jail, where he wa[ |eing held pending trial.
   After Kip McCoy serves nine years and three months in prison, he
will be on three years' probation, Haden said.
   The young man told the judge he would never hurt anyone and was
``entrapped by the government and the battles between the
government and my father.''
   Another man convicted of participating in the escape plot was
sentenced Tuesday to more than 15 years in prison and fined $10,000.
   Robert Nance, 43, of Huntington, was convicted Aug. 1 for
conspiring to kill a federal witness, attempting to kill witnesses
and a jail escape charge.
   Haden imposed the maximum sentence against Nance, saying he did
not accept responsibility for any of his crimes.

<HEAD>Tories Say They Won't Slow Down Despite Slumping Popularity</HEAD>

   Conservative Party leaders, on the
defensive as their annual conference opened Tuesday, insisted
Thatcherism won't slow down despite slumping poll ratings and fears
that soaring interest rates will bring on a recession.
   ``Would the critics prefer us to do too little too late?'' said
party chairman Kenneth Baker, addressing 9,000 delegates at the
Winter Gardens, a former opera house in this north England resort.
   ``This is not the time for fretting or poring over opinion
polls. This is not the time for being fainthearted,'' added Baker
to applause from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   She was seated beside him with other party leaders on a podium
bedecked in blue, the Tory color, and carrying the slogan of the
four-day conference, ``The Right Team for Britain's Future.''
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler announced the government will
introduce legislation to curb the unions, including a total ban on
sympathy strikes and unspecified regulations against wildcat
strikes.
   The conference opened at a time of economic uncertainty,
following an increase of interest rates to 15 percent last week, a
slump in the value of the pound and inflation of 7 percent.
   The departure from the conference of Chancellor the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson, the chief financial official, sparked speculation
that yet another interest rate rise was imminent. In London, the
Treasury issued a statement saying Lawson had left to work on his
speech to the conference, due Thursday.
   The economic problems have strengthened the revamped Labor
Party's four-month lead in poll ratings. The Conservatives are at
least seven points behind, their worst rating since a recession in
1981.
   The proposed new moves against the unions are the latest in a
battery of union-curbing laws passed since Mrs. Thatcher won power
in 1979 and follow a summer resurgence of union militancy.
   Strikes included weekly shutdown of the London subway system.
The government blamed shadowy groups of militants, although the
strikes were official and called after the union arranged secret
ballots of members as required by law.
   ``We have fought to get our industrial relations reforms
through,'' said Fowler. ``We will not give up now.''
   In his keynote speech, Baker defended the controversial program
Mrs. Thatcher is pursuing during the third five-year term she won
in 1987. It includes selling the water and electricity utilities to
private owners, an unpopular new property tax and a shakeup of the
free National Health Service.
   He was greeted with the repeated applause traditional at the
usually well-disciplined Conservative Party conferences, which have
no policy-making powers and are aimed mainly at rallying support.
   Outside the conference center, some rank-and-file legislators
renewed calls for slowing down, particularly in the privatization
and property tax plans, and generally rethinking policies.
   ``We're getting things wrong at the present time _ we have to
say we've made mistakes,'' said legislator Sir Rhodes Boyson.

   Thousands of sign-waving, chanting
demonstrators ringed Florida's Capitol today as the Legislature
convened the nation's first special session on abortion since a
landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July.
   Lawmakers gaveled the session to order shortly after 1 p.m. to
take up anti-abortion legislation pushed by Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez in the wake of a high court ruling giving states greater
power to restrict abortions.
   Pro-choice activists marched to the Capitol, with anti-abortion
demonstrators lining the route. No trouble was reported, although
there was jeering and yelling from both sides.
   Senate President Bob Crawford and House Speaker Tom Gustafson,
both Democrats, said Martinez's proposals would get a full hearing
in committees. But they said the legislation is unlikely to pass.
   ``I don't believe a session called to restrict abortion is a
wise expenditure of time,'' Gustafson said.
   Uniformed officers have maintained tight security at the
Capitol, patrolling corridors and guarding the doors to the Senate
and House chambers.
   ``You are being heard on this issue,'' Martinez told a cheering
crowd of 7,000 anti-abortion activists in a rally outside the
Capitol on Monday night.
   ``More than 1,000 babies could be saved by pending legislation,
whose voices we won't hear, whose cries will not be acknowledged,''
Martinez said as the crowd chanted, ``Pro-life! Pro-life!''
   Martinez called the session in July in response to the Supreme
Court ruling in the Missouri case Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services. The ruling prompted efforts in several states to impose
limits on abortions.
   Among the governor's proposals are a ban on the use of public
money and facilities for abortions and expanded regulation of
abortion clinics. Measures intended to make women think twice about
having an abortion would require doctors to tell patients about the
development of their fetuses and require women more than 20 weeks
pregnant to be tested to see if the fetus could survive outside the
womb before an abortion is performed.
   Florida's anti-abortion movement suffered a setback last week
when the state Supreme Court struck down a 1988 law that required
girls under 18 to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge before
getting an abortion. The court ruled the law violated a privacy
clause in the state Constitution.

<HEAD>USDA Imports Soviet `Hit Team' of Wasps, Beetles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special hit team of lady beetles and wasps
has been imported from the Soviet Union to help American farmers
battle the Russian wheat aphid, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after
evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests.
   In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles
were collected during May and June in the southern region of the
Soviet Union, the department's Agricultural Research Service
reported.
   Actual collecting of the hundreds of specimen was done by insect
pathologist Tadeusz Poprawski and entomoligist Francis Gruber, who
work for the agency's parasite laboratory in Behoust, France.
   During their explorations, Poprawski and Gruber were based at a
new Soviet-American biological control laboratory in Kishinev,
Moldavia. The insects were sent to a USDA laboratory in Newark,
Del., for quarantine, rearing of new generations and distribution.
   The department's Richard S. Soper said in a statement that the
wasps and beetles ``are the first exchanges of biological pest
controls to come from recent USDA research agreements with the
Soviet Union.''
   Soper coordinates research on biological pest controls for the
USDA agency in Beltsville, Md. He left on Monday for the Soviet
Union to help plan next year's joint studies and explorations.
   The Russian wheat aphid, first spotted in the United States in
1986 in Texas, has spread to 16 states in just three years,
damaging wheat, barley, rye and oats. Aphids were said to cost
farmers an estimated $123 million last year in grain losses and
chemical controls.
   Officials said two species of Soviet wasps were sent in August
to a USDA research unit in Stillwater, Okla., for evaluation with
other wasps from Turkey, Syria, Jordan and France to determine the
best candidates for field tests.
   Some other wasps were shipped to the department's ``mass-rearing
facility'' in Mission, Texas, to produce more specimens. And the
lady beetles are being ``multiplied'' in Niles, Mich. Research on
the beetles will be done at the agency's facility in Brookings, N.D.

   Unidentified gunmen ambushed a
Salvadoran journalist's car Tuesday, killing his wife and seriously
wounded their son, police said.
   A police spokesman identified the victim as Edelmira Fuentes,
45, the wife of Luis Fuentes, an editor with El Diario de Hoy, a
conservative newspaper.
   Oscar Fuentes, 21, the son who was driving the car, was
seriously wounded in the attack near the family home in the
southwestern sector of the capital, according to the spokesman, who
insisted on anonymity for security reasons.
   At the time of the attack, Luis Fuentes was not in the car,
which was struck by more than 20 bullets.
   No group claimed responsibility for the ambush and police said
they had no clue as to the identity of the attackers.
   ``We don't have the slightest idea who was responsible,'' said
Rolando Monterrosa, Diario de Hoy's news editor.
   The newspaper's director, Enrique Altamirano, announced the
attack to delegates at the Inter-American Press Association's
annual meeting in Monterrey, Mexico.
   ``The attack clearly came from the extreme left,'' said
Altamirano, who also defended the conduct of President Alfredo
Cristiani's conservative government.
   The armed forces press office said Mrs. Edelmira Fuentes ``was
assassinated at 6:30 a.m. by urban terrorists,'' a term the
military often use when they are referring to urban commandos of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front leftist guerrillas.

<HEAD>With AM-Hungary, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This country's Communist leaders have
moved toward political change by discarding the Communist Party and
creating a new party dedicated to democratic reforms.
   The Communist Party, officially called the Hungarian Socialist
Workers' Party when it was reorganized after the 1956 revolution,
decided Saturday to become the Hungarian Socialist Party and
adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the country.
   The delegates to the party congress then named Rezsoe Nyers, who
headed the Communist Party, as president of the new party.
   With the same leader, a slightly different name and the same
membership as the old party, it remains unclear what directions the
new organization will take.
   The Hungarian Communist Party was modeled on the Soviet
Communist Party in which the party elite made all the major
day-to-day decisions and the general membership had little say in
formulating policy.
   A Communist Party believes in the efficency of central economic
planning and all property is state-owned in an effort to end
``exploitation of the working masses.''
   One important aspect of communism is that it concerns itself not
only with the economy but with almost every aspect of society,
including political life, education and public information.
   However, under the 32-year leadership of Janos Kadar, the
Hungarian party allowed some small private enterprise in the 1970s
and was relatively tolerant of dissent.
   In the past year, the reformist Communist leadership took steps
toward transition to a more democratic society by advocating free
elections and a market economy.
   The program of the newly founded Hungarian Socialist Party makes
no mention of Marxism and accepts a market economy that includes
private ownership.
   Socialist parties in the West have favoured some state influence
in the national economy, stressing it is necessary to ensure public
welfare and national health programs, a point also emphasized by
the new Hungarian party.
   The new party also has adopted Western Socialist ideals such as
guaranteed human rights and freedom of movement and freedom of
conscience.
   The party's program advocates a ``social market economy,''
rejecting democratic centralism and favoring self-government.
   It wishes to compete for support among the electorate along with
other parties and no longer relies on its leading role in society
being secured in the constitution.
   The party accepts the fact that there is a plurality of
interests in society and rejects the notion that there is a single
``correct line'' on everything.

   Security has been tightened for Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh and drug policy coordinator William
Bennett, but officials declined Tuesday to directly link the
measures to Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers.
   ``It was a combination of threats in the area of terrorism, both
from domestic concerns and from international areas. Also
narco-terrorism was a part of it,'' FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich
said about the increased security for Thornburgh.
   The attorney general has been using an armor-plated limousine,
which cost more than $100,000, for three or four weeks, said
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel. He also has been using a
basement entrance at the department instead of the street-level
door he had been using, Runkel said.
   Both Ahlerich and Runkel declined to say whether Colombia's war
on drugs was a specific factor. Colombia began a crackdown on drug
traffickers in mid-August.
   ``There has been since mid-August a heightened concern for
security,'' Runkel said. He would not say whether there had been
any specific threats against Thornburgh.
   The U.S. Marshals Service has assigned a permanent security
detail to protect Bennett, said spokesman Bill Dempsey.
   The security, Dempsey said, was ``not solely because of the
Colombian situation, but partly'' the result of it.
   The Marshals Service, which is responsible for protecting
federal courthouses, is tightening security in jurisdictions where
Colombian drug traffickers face charges.
   ``We are taking necessary security steps throughout the country,
but we are not going into a discussion of degrees of what we are
doing specifically, Dempsey said.
   One Colombian has been extradited to the United States on
charges of laundering money for the Medellin cartel since the South
American government began its crackdown.
   Three other Colombians wanted on U.S. charges are awaiting
extradition.

   A judge granted U.S. Rep. Bob Davis a
no-fault divorce that ended his 12-year marriage but not the
accusations of unethical conduct his wife leveled during their
six-month separation.
   ``I take it there is no possibility of reconciliation,'' Circuit
Judge William Porter asked Davis on Monday.
   ``No,'' Davis said.
   Marty Davis has accused her former husband of impropriety in
arranging a federal job for Brook Ball.
   Davis, 56, moved in with the 28-year-old Ms. Ball last winter,
weeks after he recommended her for a $28,000-a-year job on the
House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, on which he is the
senior Republican.
   ``I believe congressmen should serve their constituents just as
well as they serve their libido,'' Marty Davis said. ``It boils
down to this: Having a relationship is normal. Everybody has
relationships. But you don't hire somebody on your own staff for
self-gratification.''
   She said she learned of her husband's affair when new credit
cards arrived at her home for him and Ms. Ball.
   The congressman left the courthouse and could not be reached for
reaction to his ex-wife's comments. He has insisted that there is
no conflict in having Ms. Ball on the staff, that she is qualified
and that he cleared the hiring in advance with the House ethics
committee.
   Davis, who has been married three times, filed for the divorce
in April. The Davises reached a property and child support
agreement in June.
   Marty Davis, 40, a former broadcast journalist, is employed by
the U.S. Information Agency. She said she is happy now pursuing her
career ``unencumbered by that congressional spouse baggage.''

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Medical Device Patent Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to referee
a big-money battle over patent rights for medical devices.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis, seeking reinstatement of a $26.7 million award
against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly said Medtronic
infringed on patents on a device implanted in patients to correct
potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   At issue are provisions of a 1984 federal law that reduced
patent infringement protection for drug companies.
   A federal appeals court here interpreted the law to apply to
medical devices as well as generic drugs. The appeals court last
March threw out the $26.7 million judgment a lower court awarded
Lilly.
   The 1984 law is aimed at helping generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented, brand-name drugs
on the market as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patents.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic drug companies are allowed by law to ``make,
use or sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   The appeals court here said ``the clear intent of Congress was
to create an FDA experimental use exception'' for research
activities. ``No persuasive reason is suggested why Congress would
create an exception with respect to those activities for drugs
only,'' the appeals court said.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said the ruling could undermine health care
research and development of lifesaving devices.
   The companies said the pace of costly, innovative research will
be slowed because patent holders will fear their work soon might be
copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   ``Notwithstanding the limited nature of Medtronic's
FDA-controlled testing, Lilly contended that the testing gave
Medtronic a headstart towards an entry into the commercial
marketplace,'' Medtronic said.
   It added that if Lilly's interpretation of the 1984 law is
correct, it is up to Congress and not the Supreme Court to correct
the problem.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
disturbances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the high court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic, Inc., 89-243.

<DATELINE>VICTORIA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Mexican aliens were found dead this
morning in a rail-mounted trailer that had been fumigated with a
toxic chemical, police said. The trailer had been plastered with a
warning it was being fumigated.
   ``They apparently died of asphyxiation,'' said Lt. Jack Williams.
   A Southern Pacific inspector found the victims about 8:15 a.m.
after a brakeman noticed a door open, said Sgt. John Burney. The
container, 40 feet long, 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide, was half
filled with boxes of tortilla flour.
   Authorities said they were not certain if fumigation played a
role in the deaths, but Burney said the victims had suffered
diarrhea and vomiting, symptoms he said can be caused by the
fumigant usually used on flour. Autopsies were scheduled.
   The trailer carried an 8-by-10-inch sticker with skulls and the
warning, in Spanish and English: ``Danger. This trailer is being
fumigated.''
   Officials of the flour producer, Azteca Milling Co. of Edinburg,
said they did not know exactly when the trailer was treated with
pesticide but that the aliens must have broken into the container
after it was fumigated.
   A contractor had fumigated the flour with Phostoxin, an aluminum
phosphate pesticide, before the trailer was sealed and loaded on a
flatcar in Harlingen, said Jorge Trevino, Azteca quality control
manager.
   ``Obviously they had to break into the car because they are
sealed before they are put on the train,'' said Gonzalo Garcia,
Azteca traffic manager.
   Aluminum phosphate can produce a poisonous gas in enclosed
containers and should not be breathed, according to the Houston
Fire Department.
   The train left Harlingen at 12:40 a.m., said Steve Abeyta, a
Southern Pacific trainmaster. The morning was cool, with
temperatures at Victoria in the mid-50s.
   ``They put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar.
Apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the
hole,'' Williams said. Another police officer said the men
apparently made the hole for ventilation.
   Burney said officers suspect other illegal aliens may have been
hiding in another trailer and opened the door, then fled when they
saw the bodies.
   The trailer was in between switching areas in Victoria, a town
of 45,000 about 125 miles southwest of Houston.
   Since 1980, there has been a string of incidents in which
illegal aliens have been found dead after crossing into the United
States.
   In 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated inside a locked boxcar after
crossing the border into a freight yard in El Paso. A smuggler had
locked the men inside the insulated car, which later was parked for
hours in the desert sun.

<HEAD>Book Fair Opens With Appeal to Lift Rushdie Death Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The international Frankfurt Book
Fair opened Tuesday with an appeal to Iran's leaders to lift the
death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   In Bonn, the Foreign Ministry said it is continuing to urge
Czechoslovak authorities to grant an exit visa to dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel, who is due to receive a prize at the book
fair Sunday. But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl indicated it
was not likely Havel would get a visa.
   Peter Weidhaas, director of the 41st annual fair, the largest in
the world, said extra security precautions have been taken because
several exhibitors expressed concern that the death threat against
Rushdie could put them in danger.
   Luggage deposit boxes in the fair buildings are being kept
locked, he said.
   Among those concerned are exhibitors from Britain and the United
States, where Rushdie's book has been published and drawn protests,
Weidhaas said. No threats have yet been received, he added.
   Weidhaas, who said he was speaking for all the publishers
gathered in Frankfurt, appealed to Iran's leadership to ``revoke
the death call against Salman Rushdie, his publishers and
booksellers.''
   Neither German nor foreign publishers are displaying the British
author's book, published last year. Some exhibitors feel ``simply
uneasy if such a book is around,'' Weidhaas said.
   In February, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini put a $5.2-million
bounty on Rushdie, whose ``The Satanic Verses'' was banned in
Moslem countries because they said it blasphemed Islam.
   Khomeini, who died in June, also urged Moslems to kill Rushdie's
publishers. The current Iranian leadership has upheld the death
threats.
   Iran is banned from the Frankfurt fair as long as the threat
stands, Weidhaas said.
   Havel, a leading human rights activist who is banned from
publishing in Czechoslovakia, has been awarded the annual
Friedenspreis (Peace Prize) by West German publishers.
   A presentation ceremony, which Kohl will attend, is scheduled
Sunday in Frankfurt's historic St. Paul's church.
   ``Today Vaclav Havel is unfortunately still being prevented from
being with us. I hope that the awarding of the West German
publishers' Friedenspreis is support and encouragement for him in
his distress,'' Kohl said in officially opening the book fair.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has urged his
Czechoslovak counterpart several times to let Havel come accept his
prize, ministry officials said.
   If Havel cannot come, West German actor and director Maximilian
Schell is due to accept the prize for him.
   Nearly 8,200 exhibitors are taking part in this year's Frankfurt
Book Fair, about 3 percent more than in 1988, organizers said.
   French literature and culture are the focus of this year's fair.
Related events are planned in 23 other West German cities.
   Guenther Christiansen, a top official in West Germany's book
trade association, called for a unified book pricing system in the
European Community once the trade bloc removes all internal trade
barriers by the end of 1992.

   The United States has airlifted to Miami some
of the leaders of the failed military coup in Panama and is
treating them as refugees, the White House said today.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the group
included coup members as well as their relatives.
   ``We have a number of refugees in Miami that were flown in,''
Fitzwater said. ``I can't identify who they are or where they are
for personal safety reasons.'' He said the action was taken under
President Bush's authority.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said 42
Panamanians were flown to Miami and admitted on humanitarian
grounds. Some are relatives of Maj. Moises Giroldi, a top coup
leader killed after the takeover failed, she said.
   Giroldi's widow, Adela Bonilla Giroldi, was conspicuously absent
Monday from her husband's funeral in Panama City.
   The Washington Post reported that those given refuge also
included Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking
participant in the coup to escape capture, and Capt. Francisco
Alvarez, who was arrested and jailed last year for taking part in a
failed 1988 plot against Noriega.
   Alvarez was said to have been released from jail three weeks ago.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Panamanians are being received by the U.S.
Catholic Conference and ``the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service is prepared to review aplications for political asylum if
such requests are made.''
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater continued to defend the U.S. role and the
decision not to send in U.S. military forces to help depose
Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void of
information, the spokesman said Bush ``had plenty of information,
he made the decision that he thought was best and the decision we
still think is right. We don't have any questioning about the
correctness of that decision.''
   Fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaints
about congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularly
in Panama.
   Saying that Bush wants a good relationship with Congress, he
said, ``We don't have any specific complaints.''
   Asked if the United States was planning additional economic
sanctions against Panama to increase pressure on Noriega, Fitzwater
said, ``We don't have any plan'' to do that.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a review of the
events during the coup now reveals that there was ``confusion'' and
dissension among the coup plotters, and that there was some
argument about what to do with Noriega.
   Williams said it is now clear that Giroldi, the coup leader,
``had no intention, ever,'' of turning Noriega over to the United
States and that an officer who wanted to turn Noriega over to the
United States argued with Giroldi about it.
   The spokesman declined to identify the officer or say where he
is now.
   Williams said the officer was one of those who met later with
Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, second in command of the U.S. forces in
the area.
   But Williams said he could not say whether that officer made
clear to Cisneros that there was a dissident faction among the
Panamanian officers who wanted to turn Noriega over.
   The Pentagon spokesman said it isn't entirely clear to what
extent the people claiming to hold Noriega really had him under
their control.
   ``You have someone who was one of the coup plotters, saying,
`Well we ought to (turn Noriega over to the United States).' He
doesn't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates (to the United
States) that the people holding General Noriega still have no
intention of turning him over to the United States,'' Williams said.
   ``There was never a request for us to come and get him, they
never offered him to us,'' he said.

   Entertainer Olivia Newton-John has been
named goodwill ambassador for the United Nations' Environment

warming and pollution.
   ``I'm really thrilled. I hope I can learn enough so I will be

   The singer-actress said that for the next few months she will
juggle album promotions with United Nations briefs on topics
ranging from recycling to the destruction of the rain forests.
   ``We have problems with the forests in America. We talk about
problems in Brazil, meanwhile ours are being hacked down,'' she
said.
   ``She is a very popular singer who for a generation has been
extremely effective in conveying an environmental message through
her music,'' said program director Noel Brown.
   ``Her caring for the earth will have a very wide appeal, in many
ways larger than a diplomat could,'' he added.

   A woman in a yellow visitor's gown
stole a newborn baby from his mother at Mercy General Hospital,
police said Tuesday.
   Lt. Ken Walker said the woman came in the mother's room Monday
night, said it was time to feed the less than day-old baby boy,
took the child and didn't return.
   The 6-pound, 1-ounce baby was born at 1:36 p.m. Monday.
   The woman took the child from his mother's third-floor maternity
ward room during a hospital shift change. Guards said they noticed
a yellow car leaving the parking lot about that time.
   Police described the abductor as in her 20s or 30s, and said she
may appear pregnant.

   The groom's brother, actor Dennis Quaid, actress Meg Ryan and
Amanda Quaid, the groom's 6-year-old daughter from a previous
marriage, were among those attending.
   Bloch said the couple, who met two years ago, plan to take a
honeymoon sometime next year. They were headed for Houston this
week for the Oct. 21 Randy Quaid-Miller Lite celebrity golf
tournament benefiting the Texas Special Olympics, Bloch said.
   Randy Quaid, who starred in the movie ``Vacation'' with Chevy
Chase and won acclaim for his portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson in the
TV miniseries ``LBJ,'' appears in two upcoming motion pictures,
Bloch said.
   He stars again with Chase in the holiday release ``Christmas

   Smooth singing George Strait, voted
country music's best entertainer, could hardly believe he had won
the award after five years in contention.
   ``Slap me! Pinch me!'' he told a throng of well-wishers Monday
night after being presented the honor at the Grand Ole Opry House
during the nationally televised Country Music Association awards
program.
   The soft spoken Strait, a top concert draw and one of President
Bush's favorite singers, said the accolade capped his career.
   ``I've worked really hard for eight years,'' said the natty
37-year-old tenor. ``It finally paid off.''
   ``The fans couldn't be denied,'' he said. ``They have been so
great to me. I owe this to them.''
   His album, ``Beyond the Blue Neon,'' is No. 8 on the Billboard
country music chart this week and still doing well after 33 weeks
on the chart. It has already gone gold, selling more than 500,000
copies.
   Strait's July hit record, ``What's Going On in Your World,'' was
his 19th No. 1 song. Despite his steady success this decade, the
CMA's top award had eluded him while others like Hank Williams Jr.,
Reba McEntire and Ricky Skaggs earned the honor.
   ``I was starting to think maybe it wouldn't happen,'' he said.

   Actress Ellen Barkin has played wife, mother and
sex pistol. Now, she's hankering for the role of bimbo.
   ``Actually, it would be fun to play a bimbo,'' Barkin said in an
interview published Tuesday in The New York Times. ``I mean, not
just some character who's a pair of breasts attached to the leading
man _ but a great, ditzy bimbo. You know?''
   So far, she hasn't had the honor. ``That also has a lot to do
with what I look like,'' she said. She has endured reviewers'
characterizations of her grin as lopsided and her nose as looking
like a boxer's, but says she wouldn't change her looks.
   The actress, who plays opposite Al Pacino in ``Sea of Love,''
said she's surprised to be perceived as a sex goddess.
   ``Three years ago, it would have been ridiculous,'' she said.
``Hilarious! I'm doing the same things I always did and now they're
saying I'm a hot babe!''
   After tamer roles in ``Diner,'' ``Daniel'' and ``Tender

Dennis Quaid in ``The Big Easy'' and Mickey Rourke in ``Johnny

   Gordie Howe, who is about to be surpassed by

to come out of retirement in 1990 and set a record _ playing in six
decades.
   Howe, 61, retired from the National Hockey League in 1980 after
a 26-year career in which he amassed 1,850 points. Gretzky of the
Los Angeles Kings has come within seven points of the record.
   Howe said he plans to rejoin the Hartford Whalers. Howe ended
his career with Hartford in 1980 after playing for the Detroit Red
Wings from 1946 through 1971.
   ``The only record I'm going to make sure about is that I'm going
to come out of retirement after the new year to play one more game
in the '90s so that I've played in six decades,'' Howe told the
Detroit Free Press. ``Then I challenge the little guy (Gretzky) to
do that.''
   Howe also holds NHL records for most seasons, games (1,767),
goals (801), game-winning goals (122), All-Star selections (21) and

   Thomas DeBarge, a member of the
singing DeBarge family, has asked for drug treatment after being
jailed on a cocaine charge.
   District Judge Michael Smolenski on Monday delayed a decision on
his request and delayed a preliminary hearing after the former
singer requested a court-appointed attorney.
   DeBarge, 32, was returned to jail, where he has been held since
Thursday on $5,000 bond. He is charged with selling imitation
cocaine in the suburb of Wyoming and with delivery of cocaine in
Grand Rapids. He faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted.
   DeBarge served time in the county jail in 1986 on a cocaine
conviction.
   DeBarge gained fame in the late '70s and early '80s with the
now-defunct soul group Switch. Four brothers and one sister formed
a group that also was on its way to success on the Motown label but
disbanded in 1986. Family members have had numerous brushes with

   The House voted Tuesday to extend five child
nutrition programs for five years and to make it easier for
low-income children and pregnant women to qualify.
   The bill was approved on a voice vote with no opposition. An
identical measure is pending in the Senate.
   The legislation expands the women, infants and children prenatal
and postnatal nutrition program by $150 million _ to slightly more
than $2 billion _ in 1990 to allow at least 300,000 more mothers
and infants to participate.
   It also makes any expectant mother or infant in a family
receiving food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children
payments or Medicaid automatically eligible.
   For the first time, schools would be allowed to certify children
as eligible for free lunches by obtaining needed information from
local food stamp or AFDC offices without requiring additional
applications from their families.
   Other extended programs include nutrition education and
training, free summer lunches to children in needy areas, an
expanded school breakfast program and aid to states for
administering school lunch programs.

   A moose that apparently lost a mating
rights battle in Canada is wandering south through Iowa, sending
residents scrambling for their cameras and hopping into airplanes
for a better look.
   Moose aren't supposed to be in Iowa, but several have popped up
in the last dozen years, usually heading south for a mysterious
reason, a state wildlife specialist said Tuesday.
   The wandering bull's natural range is 400 miles north of Iowa.
The animal has traveled 120 miles in the state since it was spotted
Sept. 22.
   Word spread quickly when the moose was sighted Monday in
Woodbine, about 100 miles west of Des Moines.
   Residents grabbed their cameras, and postmaster Dencil Hammack
rushed to the airport and rented a plane. By the time he got up,
the moose had moved to a field of unpicked corn.
   ``He was kind of tired out and resting,'' Hammack said. ``We
came in low and got a good look at him.''
   The cornfield's owner, farmer Myron Barry, went along with
Hammack for the ride.
   ``He said, `I don't suppose the federal crop people would honor
a claim for damages by a moose,' '' Hammack said.
   Lee Gladfelder, a state wildlife specialist, said he expects the
moose to continue south, though he doesn't know why.
   ``I only know of one case where a moose did turn back, and that
was back in the 70s. The others have either gone on south or stayed
the winter,'' he said.
   Gladfelder said the best theory on the beast's trek is that it
lost a contest for mating rights and was rejected by the herd.
   The animal already has crossed two rivers to keep on the
southerly course. State conservation officer Richard Johnson said
the moose was not bothered by gawkers and airplanes.
   ``Some got to within 30, 40 feet from him to get their pictures
and videos,'' he said.

<HEAD>Provoked Paleontologists Pursue Postal Precision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's paleontologists, who know a
dinosaur when they see one, are upset over the U.S. Postal
Service's latest block of dinosaur stamps.
   One of the stamps uses an out-of-date name and another actually
shows a flying reptile, complain the scientists who study ancient
forms of life.
   In its own defense the Postal Service produced a letter from a
Maryland seven-year-old to whom the identity of the animals was
perfectly clear.
   And as for calling the set ``dinosaur'' stamps, officials say
that term is simply the easiest for people to understand.
   The stamps were selected in an effort to join in the current
interest in dinosaurs among young people, and they are being
featured as part of the Postal Service's annual ``Stamp Collecting
Month'' promotion.
   The four 25-cent stamps include a tyrannosaurus, a large fierce
reptile, and a stegosaurus, or plated lizard, with a row of large
plates on its back. Neither of those raised any complaints from the
paleontologists.
   But the other two show a brontosaurus, a large-bodied lizard
with long neck and tiny head, and a pteranodon, a flying reptile,
   That means that one of the stamps, the pteranodon, doesn't
picture a dinosaur at all, complained the paleontologists.
   And the brontosaurus actually is an apatosaurus, they said.
   While promoting the dinosaur stamps in their advertising, postal
officials admit that the pteranodon isn't technically a dinosaur.
   The Postal Service's book ``Introduction to Stamp Collecting,''
which is being used in the stamp promotion, refers to the stamps as
the ``prehistoric animals series'' and notes that the group of
stamps portrays ``three dinosaurs and a pteranodon, a winged
creature that ruled the skies while dinosaurs ruled the land.''
   The Paleontological Society is more upset about the brontosaurus
stamp, however, having gone so far as to issue a statement
detailing the correct name for the animal.
   The brontosaurus never existed, having actually been the result
of a 19th century researcher mixing up the skull of one prehistoric
animal with the body bones of another, the paleontologists say. The
body skeleton had already been named apatosaurus, the scientists
noted.
   In the past 15 years or so museums have corrected the problem,
joined the correct skulls with the skeletons of the animals, and
changed the designation to apatosaurus.
   By scientific convention, the paleontologists state, ``when more
than one name is given to a species only the oldest name is
scientifically valid. As a consequence, use of the name
brontosaurus must be discontinued.''
   In its defense, the Postal Service noted that its booklet on
stamps uses both names, and the agency produced a letter from
7-year-old Brandon Dennis of Laurel, Md., who had read about the
controversy in a Washington newspaper.
   ``I like the name brontosaurus because it means thunder lizard,
not deceptive lizard like apatosaurus,'' wrote Brandon.
   After citing a several books using the term brontosaurus, he
concluded that ``it's all right to use brontosaurus because most
kids, including my sister, know that brontosaurus and apatosaurus
are the same creature.''

   Fifth-grader Mike Lee's pet walks on a
leash, jumps through a hoop, plays dead, wears a helmet and rides a
scooter.
   The pet is a lizard.
   It's a simple garden variety, called an anole lizard, that
skitters on sidewalks and leaps between blades of grass. It showed
up one day at Mike's front door in this farming community 25 miles
east of Tampa.
   ``I almost stepped on him,'' the youngster said. ``Then he ran
in the house.''
   The 11-year-old named his pet Figment, after a Disney World
character and patiently taught the lizard tricks to show off at
school. The lizard taught the shy boy, whose family moved 14 times,
to make friends.
   Mike had a feeling his new pet was special when it sat in Mike's
hand for long periods. The youngster began working with him.
   First, there were hoops. Figment effortlessly jumps through
Mike's mother's bracelet with a gentle nudge.
   The easiest trick is playing dead. Mike flips the lizard on its
back and rubs the reptile's smooth, beige tummy. Claws in the air,
eyes closed, Figment almost looks as though he's smiling.
   But getting a leash and helmet on the squirming creature took
more doing.
   ``Figment,'' the youth admonished during a training session.
``Keep your hat on!''
   Mike slipped a small collar fashioned from a rubber band past
the lizard's snout, then carefully placed Figment on a tiny doll
scooter. He plopped on the helmet and gently pushed the lizard
around.
   Lex Salisbury, curator of the Lowry Park Zoo, said he's never
heard of anyone training a lizard.
   ``This must be a special lizard,'' said Carolyn Lemanski, Mike's
math teacher. ``I don't think all lizards can do what he does.
We've had more lizards caught in the last month. Everybody thinks
they can train their lizard.''

   When the 29-year-old woman opened the door to her home at about
1 p.m. Monday, she found her boyfriend dressed in armor and
kneeling on her stoop.
   ``Kerry Anne O'Connell, I would like to be your knight

   O'Connell, her face flushed and trembling, replied, ``Yes I

   Lopes said donning the armor suit made of gray fiberglass and
riding a horse up to his girlfriend's front door was the
fulfillment of a dream.
   ``As a boy, I was always into knights and castles and kings,''
he said. ``I can't really explain it but I decided when I was 14 or
15 years old that I should propose in armor and on a horse. I guess
this is extravagant enough to prove to her that I'm not kidding
around, that it's the real thing.''
   The couple have known each other for three years and plan to

   Call it a sound investment.
   Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons has purchased a private
performance by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra for $10,000.
   While it might seem cheaper just to get a new compact disc,
Simmons, who made his fortune buying and selling companies,
obviously likes live music. It was the second consecutive year he
has been high bidder for the private symphony performance package
offered at The Auction for the Cultural Arts Ball.
   What's more, Saturday's winning bid was a relative bargain. In
1988, he had paid $24,000 for the concert of pops or classical
music at the location of his choice on a mutually agreed upon date.
   ``If it had to go that cheap,'' said ball chairman Mago Nelson,
``I'm just glad it went to Harold Simmons after he paid so much
last year.''

   A reclusive, night-prowling man killed
himself in his apartment and neighbors thought the resulting fire
and explosion was his attempt to make good on his frequent threats
to kill them.
   Dwight Manning, 33, set fire to his room Monday and killed
himself with a shot to the head with a .45-caliber automatic
pistol, police said.
   Hot, expanding gases from the fire blew out Manning's bedroom
windows, and then ammunition stored inside began exploding and
spread the fire to surrounding apartments.
   Neighbors said Manning had frequently hand-delivered threatening
notes, often while wearing camouflaged military fatigues.
   ``That was the plan; he wanted to kill my family and the family
next door,'' said neighbor Joe Rivas.
   Manning had lived with his mother, Brigitta Manning, all his
life, but she said her son kept to himself in his bedroom and she
wasn't allowed inside for 10 years.
   ``I wouldn't dare go in because I think he would have killed me
or something,'' she said.
   Manning stayed mostly in his room listening to loud Asian music
at night followed by ``The Star Spangled Banner,'' said neighbor
Maria Torres.
   The high-school dropout who reportedly never held a job was
rarely seen outside before midnight, neighbors said.
   Residents reported the threatening notes to police and Mrs.
Manning reported her son's threats twice during the weekend before
his death. When police responded to her calls, they questioned
Manning through his locked bedroom door and each time he convinced
them he was unarmed.
   ``The officers had no legal authority to break into that room,''
said police Sgt. R.D. Johnson. ``There was no probable cause.
Nobody, at anytime during the investigation, said they saw him
armed with a gun or knife.''

   A man whose 8-year-old granddaughter
shot herself in the thumb may be the first person charged under
Florida's precedent-setting gun-access law, authorities said
Tuesday.
   Willie W. Green, 61, was charged Sunday with violating the law
designed to keep loaded guns out of the hands of children. The law
went into effect Oct. 1.
   Sheila Owens shot herself Sunday at Green's home, less than two
miles from the Florida Capitol where the law was passed during a
special legislative session in June.
   ``It's an indication the law was needed and it will be
enforced,'' said state Sen. John Grant, one of the sponsors.
   Sheila took a .32-caliber automatic from an unlocked box on a
bedroom floor, officials said.
   ``To our knowledge, this is the first case where charges have
been filed in the state of Florida,'' said Dick Simpson, a
spokesman for the Leon County Sheriff's Department.
   A second test of the law may come out of Palatka, where a
12-year-old was fatally wounded Sunday by a 9-year-old playmate.
   Under the law, if a child shoots someone, even accidentally,
because a gun owner was careless, the adult could be charged with a
felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
A gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in jail
and a $500 fine if a minor points a gun at someone or displays it
in public.
   The shot fired by Green's granddaughter passed through her
thumb, a bedroom door, a bookcase and onto the floor of the living
room, where several family members were gathered, Simpson said. The
child was treated at Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center
and released.
   ``We're glad she only shot her thumb,'' Grant said. ``She could
have been killed or killed someone else.''
   In the Palatka case, Scott Carlton, of San Mateo, near Palatka,
was shot in the abdomen Sunday when a 9-year-old playmate pulled
the trigger on a .22-caliber rifle, police said. Scott later died
at a hospital in Jacksonville.
   The names of the 9-year-old and his parents were being withheld
pending a decision on the charges, state attorney John Tanner said.
   The boys had been playing in the 9-year-old's bedroom when he
took the rifle down from a rack to show it to Scott, said Capt.
Dick Schauland of the Putnam County sheriff's department.
   ``He thought the rifle was empty,'' Schauland said.
   The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions, such
as using a trigger lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box, to
keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands
of children 15 and younger.
   There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents
and for incidents involving guns taken illegally.

   ``The paper was undercapitalized and they ran out of money,''
Jose Mariano Castillo said of El Diario de Los Angeles, which
halted publication after Saturday's edition.
   Castillo said its owners, Inmobiliaria America Latina Inc., hope
to revive the newspaper, which was launched in May 1987. He said
the newspaper, with a circulation of about 30,000, was losing about
$80,000 a month.
   Twenty-four people lost their jobs when the newspaper closed.
Twenty-six others had been laid off in June when the newspaper
moved to reduce operating costs, he said.
   Inmobiliaria took over the newspaper in June after El Diario's
former owner, Editoria Inc., filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   The company continues to print other publications, Castillo said.
   Los Angeles' remaining Spanish-language newspapers are La
Opinion and Noticias del Mundo.

   A Christian couple and their eight
children who fled religious persecution in the Soviet Union have
become the targets of death threats, vandalism and a cross burning
in their new home.
   ``It's just ironic that they come here and experience more
persecution,'' Judi Jankowski of the Minnesota chapter of World
Relief, an arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said
Tuesday.
   The FBI has entered the case, agent Terry Wyllie said Tuesday.
``There's a strong possibility that a civil rights violation has
occurred,'' he said, refusing further comment.
   The harassment that Vladimir and Ekaterina Doroshkevich and
their children have suffered since Saturday is the first aimed at
any of the more than 10,000 Soviet Christians who have immigrated
to the United States since 1988, Jankowski says.
   Police say they have no idea who is responsible for the
incidents. ``We're following up on a number of leads and doing
anything we can,'' said Lt. James Moeller, adding that measures
have been taken to protect the family.
   ``They suffered greatly under the Communist system. Now, they're
suffering here,'' Jankowski said Monday.
   But Doroshkevich, 30, who spent 12 years trying to leave his
homeland in the Ukraine before arriving in Minnesota with his
family Aug. 18, said through an interpreter Monday that he wasn't
too concerned about the incidents and resolved to stay in this
well-to-do Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb.
   ``Where I come from, I'm used to this kind of persecution,'' he
said. ``But this is nothing compared with the love we've received
here.''
   The Ukraine is one of several Soviet republics chafing under
Russian rule from Moscow.
   The harassment began with a telephone call late Saturday from an
adult male to the home of the Rev. Michael Smith, pastor of the
Calvary Assembly of God Church, which sponsored the family's
resettlement.
   Although the Doroshkevishes are Ukrainian, the caller made
vulgar references to Russians, Smith said. No threats were made in
that call.
   About 2{ hours later, early Sunday, the same man called again
and this time threatened the Smiths, the Doroshkeviches and the
church, Smith said.
   Smith called police, who told him that they were responding to a
cross-burning at the same time on the front lawn of the
Doroshkevich home near the church. Officers put out the fire, but
no suspects were spotted, Smith said.
   Later Sunday morning, graffiti was found at the church, some of
it painted inside the lobby, Smith said. The vandals may have
gotten in through an unlocked side door, he said.
   Smith said the slogans, painted in red, included: ``CCCP not
welcome'' _ referring to U.S.S.R. in the Cyrilic alphabet used in
Russia _ and ``America is for Americans only. Our boys died over
there so these people could live here? No way.''
   Another said: ``Russians go home ... not welcome in USA ever!
Enemy for all time.''
   On Sunday night the air was let out of the tires of the
Doroshkeviches' car.
   Two more calls came to Smith's home Monday.
   ``There was no talking, just music,'' he said. ``On one of them
they were playing `We've Only Just Begun.'''
   Doroschkevich, an auto body welder, said he was subjected to
beatings and interrogations in his homeland because of his
Pentecostal faith, which is not among the Soviet Union's authorized
religions.
   Residents of this community of about 23,000 north of St. Paul
have responded with support for the family by calling police with
leads, Moeller said.
   ``The community's reaction has been very favorable, very
supportive of this family after this has happened,'' he said.
``I've been a cop for over 15 years and this is the first incident
I can recall where we've had anything of this type happen.''

<TEXT>
   Operators of a game booth at the
Arkansas State Fair have stopped handing out live ducklings as
prizes after complaints that one was dropped from a Ferris wheel
and another was drowned in a cup of beer.
   ``Rather than alienate anybody or our customers we just decided
to stop it,'' said Bill Dillard, operator of the fair's midway.
   Carol Kimball, a Pulaski County sheriff's detective, filed a
complaint with the city human society after playing the
``Ring-a-Duck'' game.
   ``I was just totally appalled that they were doing something
like this,'' she said. ``They were giving them away like they were
toys. They're not toys, they're animals.''
   Joe Vera III, marketing director for Dillard, said he had
reports of a duckling tossed from the Ferris wheel and another
drowned in a cup of beer.
   ``Basically that was sufficient for us to feel there was valid
concern out there,'' Vera said.
   Rick Evans, an animal abuse investigator for the humane society,
said he also took complaints but had no proof of cruelty.
   The owner of the Ring-a-Duck booth began Monday doling out
stuffed bears. To win, a player tosses a ring around the neck of
hunting decoys floating in a shallow tub. The fair opened Friday.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-eyed alien with a robot sidekick landed by
UFO and made a boy vanish by zapping him with a pistol, a Soviet
newspaper reported Tuesday, in a second day of strange tales in the
state-run media.
   But as the bizarre saga of the space invasion of the city of
Voronezh unfolded for a second day, a scientist whose words were
used to buttress the first published report voiced doubts, and said
he was in part misquoted.
   ``Don't believe all you hear from Tass,'' Genrikh Silanov, head
of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, cautioned in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press from Voronezh. ``We never gave
them part of what they published.''
   On Monday, the usually staid, official Soviet news agency told
the world that scientists had confirmed an alien spaceship carrying
giant people with tiny heads had touched down in Voronezh, a city
of more than 800,000 people about 300 miles southeast of Moscow.
   As many as three aliens 13 feet tall left the spacecraft,
described as a large shining ball, and walked in the park with a
small robot, Tass reported. A Tass duty officer stood by the story.
``It is not April Fool's today,'' he said.
   The purported close encounter in Voronezh was only the latest
weird tale to appear in the Soviet media, which under the policy of
``glasnost'' or openness have recently told of other sightings of
UFOs and the Yeti, or abominable snowman.
   Monday's report spawned rumors in Moscow, including one that the
aliens told Voronezh residents the Earth would be destroyed by the
year 2000 if people didn't stop polluting it.
   Nonetheless, a Communist Party paper whose avowed mission is to
write about culture was the only major national daily to print
anything Tuesday about the UFO, indicating more authoritative
newspapers like Pravda thought the topic too hot to handle.
   Sovietskaya Kultura said its coverage was motivated by ``the
golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.''
   ``Of course, it's hard to believe in what happened in the
town,'' it reported from Voronezh. ``It's even more difficult to
explain.''
   The daily quoted witnesses as saying the UFO flew into Voronezh
on Sept 27. At 6:30 p.m., it said, boys playing soccer saw a pink
glow in the sky, then saw a deep red ball about 10 yards in
diameter. The ball circled, vanished, then reappeared minutes later
and hovered, it said.
   A crowd rushed to the site, Sovietskaya Kultura said, and
through an open hatch saw a ``three-eyed alien'' about 10 feet
tall, clad in silvery overalls and bronze-colored boots, and
wearing a disk on his chest.
   The newspaper, quoting witnesses, gave this account:
   The UFO landed. Two creatures, one apparently a robot, exited. A
boy screamed with fear, but when the alien gazed at him, with eyes
shining, he fell silent, unable to move. Onlookers screamed, and
the UFO and the creatures disappeared.
   About five minutes later, they reappeared. The alien had a
``pistol'' _ a tube about 20 inches long, which it pointed at an
unidentified 16-year-old boy, making him disappear. The alien went
inside the sphere, which took off. At the same time, the boy
reappeared.
   ``Children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been
questioned by police workers and journalists,'' wrote Sovietskaya
Kultura's Voronezh correspondent, E. Efremov. ``There are no
discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself, or the
actions of the `aliens.' Moreover, all the children who became
witnesses to this event are still afraid, even now.''
   It gave the names of only three witnesses, all youngsters.
   Scientists from a nationwide group that investigates ``abnormal
phenomena'' were looking into the landing, the newspaper said.
   Silanov, who said he belongs to the group, cast doubt on the
Tass report that quoted him as saying the aliens left behind two
rocks resembling sandstone of a deep red color that cannot be found
anywhere.
   ``The rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece
of iron oxide which could easily have originated on Earth,''
according to Silanov, 50.
   He said there indeed was ``a landing site'' or something
resembling one in Voronezh. But he acknowledged that could happen
as well if there were an underground pipe or cable, or an
underground reservoir.
   Silanov also said the testimony of children between the ages of
11 and 14 who claimed they witnessed the landing did not always
correspond on how the aliens looked, and that they ``certainly
didn't mention the tremendous height'' cited by Tass.
   The phone connection was abruptly cut off before Silanov could
answer more questions.
   Meanwhile, a Tass editor said two Moscow-based reporters had
been dispatched to Voronezh to check on the report on the UFO filed
by local Tass correspondent Vladimir Lebedev, a man he termed a
``very serious'' journalist.
   The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tass,
through bitter experience, has learned to be wary of hoaxes. In
January, the news agency reported six people had been rescued after
spending 35 days buried alive in rubble following the Armenian
earthquake. It later retracted the story.

   Police said they seized 350 pounds
of pure cocaine dropped early Tuesday from an aircraft into the bay
of this south coast town.
   Sgt. Edwin Sollivan, head of the Guayama Police Division of
Drugs and Narcotics, said the cocaine had an estimated street value
of $200 million.
   Sollivan said the drug shipment came from Colombia since it was
packaged in special cans, which he said was a common practice of
Colombian drug runners.
   The Maritime Police expect to recover more packages of cocaine
that were washed ashore in nearby Salinas, Sollivan said.
   Police patrols were mounted in the region after an unidentified
caller told police Monday that a drug shipment was to arrive in
Guayama.
   A small twin-engine plane made the air drop but got away, he
said.

   President Bush joined the celebration Tuesday
for the Trumbull, Conn., Little League baseball team that brought
the world championship back to the United States.
   Bush, a former Little League coach, used the Rose Garden
ceremony to urge the 12-year-olds to emulate the example of
baseball great Lou Gehrig.
   The U.S. Postal Service recently issued a stamp commemorating
the 50th anniversary of Gehrig's final season, and Bush presented
the original painting of Gehrig to an official of the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Bush said the Trumbull team, which defeated a favored Taiwan
team at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., in
August, displayed ``a spirit which says that nothing is impossible,
in Little League or in the bigger fields of life.''
   Trumbull became the first U.S. squad to capture the title in six
years.
   Bush said the youngsters had learned ``the lessons of Little
League: lessons like friendship and generosity; like do-unto-others
and doing your best; lessons which go beyond balls and strikes and
which have made Little League a global institution.''
   Little League baseball, which marked its 50th anniversary this
year, is played by 2{ million youths in 33 nations, Bush said.
   Bush called Gehrig, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the New
York Yankees in the 1920s and 1930s, ``a hero of mine.''
   Gehrig set a consecutive games record that still stands. The
streak ended when Gehrig was struck by the paralyzing disease that
bears his name.
   Even in the face of that fatal ailment, Gehrig told a crowd at
his retirement in Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, ``I consider
myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''
   ``That story has become an American parable. What an example for
these kids,'' said Bush, adding that Gehrig spent much of the last
two years of his life counseling youngsters as parole commissioner
for the city of New York.
   ``He showed, like Little League, that what matters is how we
conduct ourselves off, as well as on, the field,'' Bush said.
   Bush shook hands with Coach Tom Galla and his entire squad.
   ``You truly are No. 1,'' the president said.
   The Trumbull team has been invited to appear in uniform Sunday
at the second game of the World Series between San Francisco and
Oakland, if parents can afford the trip.
   Bush, who had hoped to see the Series himself, apparently has
decided the West Coast is too far to go to throw out a ball.
   ``I'm afraid I might not get to go now,'' he told reporters as
he left the Rose Garden.

<HEAD>Con Man Who Wooed Women With War Tales Sentenced to Psychiatric Care</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who wooed women by claiming he
was a friend of Elvis Presley, rescued hundreds of prisoners of war
in Vietnam and twice won the Medal of Honor was sentenced Tuesday
to 15 months of psychiatric treatment.
   Robert S. Lyons, 35, has ``a history of falsehoods that can't be
substantiated other than through his words,'' U.S. District Judge
Earl E. O'Connor said. He ordered Lyons to undergo treatment at a
federal medical center for prisoners in Springfield, Mo., or
Rochester, Minn.
   The water purification salesman from Mission, Kan., pleaded
guilty in July to falsely impersonating a federal officer.
   Lyons, who also wove tales of being the nation's youngest major
general and of his CIA work, additionally was fined $500 and placed
on probation for one year. He faced up to three years in prison and
$250,000 in fines.
   During the hearing, Lyons' attorney, John Gerstle, described his
client as ``an individual who has severe problems and enormous
emotional problems.''
   ``This has been a long, trying five months for ... my family, my
friends,'' Lyons said. ``I'm sorry for this episode and the entire
train of events.''
   After the sentencing, three women stood in the courthouse
comparing stories that Lyons had told them.
   Authorities said Lyons showed friends copies of a newsletter
called the Pentagon Gazette with a cover picture of him in an Army
shirt with general's stars on the epaulets. The newsletter, dated
August 1988, claimed to be a special edition tribute to
``Washington's well-known, best-kept secrets.''
   In the newsletter and in tales he told women, Lyons claimed to
have rescued hundreds of prisoners of war in Vietnam, posed as a
priest and a doctor during CIA operations, and said he was a friend
of Presley.
   Lyons told one woman he was an Army general working for the CIA
and the National Security Council and needed $1,000 to get out of
the CIA. The woman gave him a check Jan. 31, but Lyons has since
repaid the money, a prosecutor said.
   The government said Lyons did serve in the Army and was given an
honorable discharge as a private.
   A former girlfriend, Beth Hannah, said she became suspicious of
Lyons when a neighbor saw Lyons' resume and doubted many of his
claims. The neighbor called Washington, where authorities said they
had never heard of Lyons.
   Ms. Hannah said she believed Lyons got a relatively light
sentence.
   ``I don't feel it's fair in light of what he is,'' she said.
``He is a pathological liar who doesn't know the truth. He needs to
learn to keep his story straight.''
   Gerstle said he was satisfied. ``It's not a matter of what's
fair. The judge sentenced at the lowest end'' of the
recommendations, Gerstle said.
   ``I've never had a case like this before and I doubt I ever will
again,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Patton.

   Riot police fought Tuesday with 1,000
protesters who demanded freedom for political prisoners and tried
to reach a nearby National Day rally sponsored by the government.
   About 2,000 police with clubs and shields formed human walls to
keep the protesters, brandishing flag poles and sticks, from the
rally outside the presidential office building. Police also used
water cannons and barbed-wire barricades.
   Seven people were reported injured, including five policemen.
   After the street battle, about 10,000 demonstrators massed
outside a jail to demand the immediate release of dissident
publisher Hsu Hsin-Liang.
   The 90-minute parade of military honor guards and marching and
dancing students was not interrupted. An estimated 250,000
spectators filled the square in front of the office building.
   President Lee Teng-hui delivered a brief address to the rally,
attended by dignitaries of 40 countries.
   ``Taiwan's future cannot be viewed as independent of a reunified
China,'' he said. ``Our sense of national righteousness and
sincerity will most certainly not allow us to merely stand by and
watch China continue to exist with one part living in a state of
freedom and the other under enslavement.''
   The Nationalists, who fled the Chinese mainland when the
communists won the civil war in 1949, have suffered diplomatic
setbacks because of their claim to be the sole legitimate
government of China.
   Chen Wan-chen, a protest organizer, said the demonstrators from
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party wanted to appeal to Lee
to release three prominent political prisoners, including Hsu.
   About 10,000 riot police blocked all three intersections leading
to the jail where the 48-year-old publisher is held.
   Protesters wore yellow headbands, carried yellow flowers and
waved banners reading ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang.''
   Hsu Hsin-liang was arrested after his return from the United
States last month, pending sedition charges. The other two were
convicted of sedition and sentenced in 1987 to long jail terms.
   All are accused of advocating that Taiwan no longer consider
itself part of China.
   National Day marks the 1911 uprising in Wuhan, central China,
that led to the fall of the Manchu Ching dynasty.

   President F.W. de Klerk said
today that seven African National Congress leaders will soon be
freed but that Nelson Mandela is not among them.
   De Klerk said the formalities may take some time, but all the
men had served many years and were quite old.
   The guerrilla leaders were among eight prisoners the government
said would soon be released. Seven were African National Congress
leaders and six, like Mandela, were sentenced to life in prison in
1964.
   The announcement, read on government-run television, said that
Mandela's own release ``is not now on the agenda.''
   The most prominent of the prisoners to be released is Walter
Sisulu, 77, who ran day-to-day operations of the African National
Congress as its secretary-general from 1949-54, when the government
ordered him to resign.
   Sisulu was imprisoned for life in June 1964 along with the other
leaders of the guerrilla group's internal military wing. The others
to be freed are Ahmed Kathrada, 60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias
Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba, 69.
   Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who briefly took command of the guerrilla
group's military wing after the arrest of Mandela's co-defendants
in July 1963, is also to be freed from the life prison term he
received in 1964.
   The announcement also named Oscar Mpetha, 80, an African
National Congress leader who has spent most of a five-year prison
term in the hospital. He was due for release next year.
   No information was immediately available about the eighth man to
be freed. The television announcement gave his name as Jafta
Masemula.
   Mandela, South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activist,
has been in prison since 1962.
   In 1962, Mandela was sentenced to five years for leaving the
country illegally and organizing an illegal strike by blacks. While
serving that sentence he was convicted in 1964 of sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white government and sentenced to life in
prison.
   Rumors of Mandela's possible release have been circulating in
South Africa for more than a decade. In 1988 the government moved
him to a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm. He has
refused offers of freedom on condition he renounces the use of
violence in the fight to topple the white-led government.

   With a luncheon featuring Vice President

seemed to mind when he forgot the name of one of the party's three
statewide candidates.
   About 450 people attended the $125-a-person lunch honoring
Republican candidate for governor J. Marshall Coleman, lieutenant
governor nominee Eddy Dalton and attorney general candidate Joseph
Benedetti. A couple of dozen people paid $3,000 each to attend a
private reception with Quayle.
   ``The people of Virginia will go to the polls and hopefully
elect Marshall, Eddy and George,'' Quayle told the crowd at the
Richmond Centre.
   Benedetti laughed off Quayle's slipup with his name.
   ``I look so much like the president that I think he just got
carried away momentarily,'' Benedetti, who does not resemble George
Bush, told reporters.

   Federal health officials on Tuesday began
distributing a 15-minute videotape advising people infected with
the AIDS virus to be especially careful about the foods they eat
and how they prepare those foods.
   Because their immune systems are weakened, people with AIDS and
earlier stages of the disease face special dangers from food-borne
illnesses that can result from improperly cooked and handled foods,
the videotape says.
   These people can develop life-threatening illnesses from foods
such as raw or lightly cooked eggs, meats and seafoods, as well as
unwashed produce or food prepared in an unsanitary manner,
officials said.
   The videotape, being sent to community health organizations
nationwide, provides information on foods to be avoided and
instruction on how best to handle and prepare foods. It also offers
advice on how to minimize risks from food-borne infections when
dining out and during travel abroad.
   The virus that causes AIDS cannot be transmitted through foods.
   The videotape was produced by the FDA and the Centers for
Disease Control and is being distributed through CDC's National
AIDS Information Clearinghouse.
   Copies can be requested by contacting the clearinghouse at
1-800-458-5231.

<TEXT>
   A high school was shaken by a second bomb
blast in two days Tuesday, and telephoned bomb threats have been
received by at least four other high schools in central Indiana.
   Tuesday's blast caused minor damage at Anderson High School but
no injuries. Classes were canceled.
   Police have no suspects, but at least one lead looked promising,
said spokesman Kevin Smith.
   Police Chief Ron Rheam said police would step up security at the
school Wednesday. He declined to reveal details.
   ``I do not fear for any teacher or student coming to the school
tomorrow,'' Rheam said Tuesday. ``The safety of students and
teachers is our first priority.''
   A small pipe bomb exploded about 7:35 a.m. Tuesday in a hall
outside the school auditorium, said Charles Petersen, special agent
in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Indianapolis.
   ATF agents were on their way to Anderson to investigate Monday's
explosion when the second bomb went off, Rheam said.
   ``It sounded like a loud firecracker. I was scared a little
bit,'' said James Porter, a senior, who said he was about 40 yards
from the explosion.
   ``The areas that the bombs were placed are areas where there is
not heavy traffic flow, so that the person that's placing the bombs
has some feeling that he does not want anyone hurt,'' Rheam said.
   A telephone threat preceded Tuesday's blast by about 10 minutes.
A few students and teachers were in the building at the time but no
one was injured.
   Monday's explosion at the school was followed by two telephone
bomb threats, said Fire Chief Dan Edwards. Highland and Madison
Heights high schools in Anderson also received bomb threats Monday.
   On Tuesday, officials at Frankton High School, about eight miles
northwest of Anderson, evacuated about 720 students after receiving
a bomb threat, said Stan Warner, assistant principal.
   No bomb was found. Warner said students returned to classes
about noon but some were sent home at their parents' request.
   ``Once you have a bomb threat, you have a certain amount of
hysteria and uncertainty, and it makes it very difficult to get the
school back to a normal day,'' Warner said.
   Noblesville High School, about 15 miles west of Anderson, also
was evacuated Tuesday after officials there received a bomb threat.
No bomb was found.
   Noblesville Fire Chief Jeff Reveal suspected it was a copycat
incident following publicity surrounding the Anderson bombs. ``I
think it's just somebody who thought they could get out of class a
half a day or a period,'' Reveal said.
   Authorities don't know if the two explosions were related to
each other or to the threats, Petersen said.
   The device that exploded Monday was between a heater and the
ceiling in a wrestling room, officials said.
   Several ceiling tiles were burned and some paint was peeled by
the heat, but damage from that blast was limited to about $500,
said Smith of the Anderson police.
   Tuesday's blast did about $300 damage, Smith said.

   President Bush said Tuesday that he will
nominate R. James Woolsey, Navy undersecretary in the Carter
administration, as chief U.S. negotiator on talks to reduce
conventional forces in Europe.
   Woolsey would be accorded the rank of ambassador. The Senate
must confirm him.
   Bush proposed in May that the United States and Soviet Union
sharply reduce the troops and weaponry they have in Europe. The
negotations between the NATO allies and the Warsaw Pact nations
will occur in Vienna.
   Woolsey has been a partner in the Washington law firm of Shea
and Gardner since 1979, after his two-year stint as undersecretary
of the Navy.
   Wollsey, 48, a native of Tulsa, Okla., is a Stanford graduate
and Rhodes Scholar with a law degree from Yale. He was general
counsel to the Senate Armed Services Committee in 1970-73 and was a
U.S. adviser to the original Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in
Helsinki and Vienna in 1969-70.
   The White House also announced Bush will nominate:
   _Richard C. Austin as administrator of the General Services
Administration. Austin, 41, has worked for the GSA since 1986 and
has been its acting administrator since last year. The former aide
to Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson would succeed Terence C. Golden.
   _Betsy Brand as assistant secretary of education for vocational
and adult education. Mrs. Brand, 35, became acting director of
adult education at the Department of Education earlier this year.
She was an aide to Vice President Dan Quayle when he was a senator
from Indiana. She would succeed Bonnie Guiton.
   _Robert C. McCormack as assistant secretary of the Navy for
financial management. McCormack, 49, is a former investment banker
who has worked at the Defense Department since 1987, most recently
as deputy undersecretary for industrial and international programs.
He would succeed Robert H. Conn.

   The 55-year-old Pittsburgh native, who has a history of high
blood pressure, was rushed to Mercy Hospital around 9:30 a.m. by
paramedics after his wife was unable to awaken him in their hotel
room, said hospital spokesman Eric Hofmann.
   He was semi-conscious by the afternoon and was attached to a

   Turrentine's publicist, Don Lucoff, said he was unaware of any

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 150,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal
for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The latest sales pushed U.S. soybean meal purchases by Moscow to
250,000 tons for 1989-90.
   In addition, since the new delivery year began on Oct. 1, the
Soviet Union has bought 3.7 million tons of corn under the
agreement. No wheat has yet been sold for 1989-90 delivery, however.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   No prices or further details were announced, but the 150,000
tons of soybean meal could have a value of around $30 million,
based on recent prices quoted at U.S. processing plants.

   President Daniel arap Moi, observing a
national holiday named for him, ordered the release Tuesday of
10,274 petty criminals.
   ``Since today is Moi Day and a day of being mindful of other
peoples' welfare, those prisoners who have been imprisoned for
petty offenses for six, seven or even 10 months will be released
... and join their families and take part in nation building,''
said Moi. ``They should refrain from these offenses in the future.''
   Moi has expressed concern about overcrowding in prisons, which
hold an estimated 38,000 inmates, and has suggested legislation
that would enable courts to impose non-custodial sentences on petty
offenders.
   Moi announced the prisoners' release during celebrations marking
his ascendancy to power in October 1978 following the death of
Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta. The holiday was created
last year marking Moi's first decade of rule.

   Most of the seven men
sentenced with Nelson Mandela to life in prison for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white government were arrested in July
1963 during a police raid on their headquarters, a farm in the
Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia.
   Mandela was already in prison in a separate case, but became a
defendant in the so-called Rivonia treason trial because he helped
found Spear of the Nation, the military wing of the African
National Congress.
   Here are profiles of the others sentenced on June 12, 1964:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WALTER SISULU</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Sisulu ran the day-to-day operations of the ANC as
secretary-general from 1949-54, when the government ordered him to
resign. He was one of the ANC's most important leaders in the years
when it grew from a small organization into a mass movement. He
helped organize the national Defiance Campaign against apartheid
laws in 1952.
   Born May 18, 1912, in the Xhosa homeland of Transkei, he joined
the ANC in 1940 and formed the Youth League in 1943 to press for
more aggressive tactics. After his acquittal along with 155 other
defendants in a 1956-61 treason trial, Sisulu was restricted to his
house, arrested six times, and finally convicted of furthering the
aims of the newly outlawed ANC. While on bail pending appeal he
went underground and was captured three months later at Rivonia.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GOVAN MBEKI</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A journalist, teacher, and author of two books, Mbeki was the
African National Congress national chairman when he was arrested at
Rivonia. As a leader in the Xhosa tribal homeland of Transkei, he
made the eastern Cape Province the strongest center of ANC support
in the early 1950s.
   Mbeki was born July 18, 1910, to a prosperous cattle owning
chief and earned university degrees in education and economics. He
joined the ANC as a student in 1935, and the Communist Party in
1950.
   He was acquitted on a technicality in 1962 of violating the
Explosives Act, and was placed under house arrest, but in 1963
disappeared underground until the Rivonia raid. He was identified
at the trial as secretary of the military wing high command.
   Mbeki was freed unconditionally in November 1987 after serving
23 years of his life term, in what the government said was a test
for the possible release of Mandela. He held two news conferences
before the government banned him from making public appearances,
giving news interviews or leaving the Port Elizabeth area without
permission.

<NOTE>DENNIS GOLDBERG</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Goldberg, 56, the only white convicted at the Rivonia trial, was
the first to be freed, after he agreed to renounce violence in
March 1985. He was deported to Israel, but went immediately to
London. He works full time in the ANC's mail-order business, mainly
selling T-shirts, and lectures in Britain and elsewhere.
   Goldberg's parents were members of the Communist Party in Cape
Town, where he was born in 1933. He was a successful engineer and,
according to evidence at the trial, was responsible for
manufacturing devices used in the sabotage campaign. The Rivonia
court found he had run a military-training camp, which Goldberg
said was political education camp.

<NOTE>AHMED KATHRADA</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Kathrada, arrested at the age of 17 for participation in a
passive resistance campaign in 1946, was a member of the ANC
military wing's high command. He is one of only two Rivonia trial
defendants who denied all the charges against him, and was
convicted on only one count, sabotage.
   Kathrada was born Aug. 21, 1929, in the western Transvaal to a
scholarly Moslem family, and became involved in political activism
at the age of 11. He joined the Communist Party in the early 1940s
and as general-secretary of the Transvaal Indian Congress, was
instrumental in linking it to the ANC. He was acquitted in the
1956-61 mass treason trial, but was placed under house arrest in
October, 1962. He went underground a few months before his arrest
at Rivonia.

<NOTE>RAYMOND MHLABA</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Mhlaba denied the charges against him in the Rivonia trial, in
particular that he was a member of the high command of the ANC's
military wing. But he has been identified in the South African
press as the man who became commander-in-chief of the military wing
after Mandela's arrest.
   In 1952 Mhlaba was the first ANC leader to be arrested as part
of the nationwide Defiance Campaign, when he led a group of blacks
through the ``whites only'' entrance to a train station.
   He was born Dec. 2, 1920, in the southern city of Fort Beaufort,
the son of a policeman. He dropped out of school and worked in the
nearby city of Port Elizabeth, where he became active in trade
unions. He joined the Communist Party in 1943 and was dictrict
secretary from 1946 until it was banned in 1960.
   Mhlaba joined the ANC in 1944 and from 1947-53 was branch
chairman in Port Elizabeth, where he worked closely with Govan
Mbeki. He was elected to the ANC's Cape Province executive
committee in 1954 and was banned from 1956-57, but continued his
political activities until his arrest at Rivonia.
   In 1986, Pollsmoor Prison authorities allowed him to marry the
mother of three of his eight children.

<NOTE>ELIAS MOTSOALEDI</NOTE>

   As a founder member of the ANC military wing's Johannesburg
regional command, Motsoaledi hid recruits and helped send them
abroad for military training and procuring armaments, according to
evidence at the Rivonia trial. He said he joined the military wing
in 1962.
   Born in Sekhukuneland in northern Transvaal on July 26 1924, the
son of a migrant laborer, Motsoaledi worked in Johannesburg as a
servant, and in boot and furniture factories. He joined the
Communist Party in 1949, and the ANC in 1948, becoming a member of
the provincial executive.
   In 1949, he became chairman of the Council of Non-European Trade
Unions, organized strikes and was banned in 1952. He was detained
in solitary confinement for three months in 1960 before going
underground. His wife, Caroline, lives in Soweto and three of their
seven children are in exile.

   Mlangeni said at the Rivonia trial he had agreed to carry
messages for the ANC's armed wing, but denied he was a member. He
was arrested at the farm, and was accused during the trial of being
responsible for explosives and being a member of the Johannesburg
command.
   Born in Johannesburg on May 30, 1926, he worked as a golf caddy
to pay for his schooling, and later as a clerk, bus driver and
journalist. He joined the ANC in 1951 and was regional secretary
for the township of Soweto from 1958-60, before he went underground.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rocket hit a crowded bus station in
the besieged Afghan capital Tuesday, killing 23 people and injuring
an undetermined number, Radio Kabul reported.
   The official radio, monitored in Islamabad, described a grisly
scene of blood, fragmented bodies and people crying.
   It said five surface-to-surface rockets hit Kabul on Tuesday,
the eve of the Afghan celebration of the birth of the Moslem
prophet Mohammed 1,409 years ago.
   ``People, including children, women and old men, were returning
home from work or shopping'' when the rocket exploded, the radio
said.
   It said the rocket was fired ``most probably'' by puritan Wahabi
sect mercenaries helping U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas fighting to
topple Kabul's Soviet-backed government.
   The celebration of Mohammed's birth depends each year on the
sighting of the moon. Afghans will celebrate the event Wednesday
but other Moslem countries may celebrate later this week.
   Afghan guerrillas, who are struggling to oust the communists and
establish an Islamic government, also are aided in part by private
Moslem mercenaries from some gulf states.
   Official Kabul media often report that these mercenaries, in
addition to Pakistanis and sometimes even Americans, are fighting
against them on Afghan soil.
   Washington has flatly denied that U.S. military personnel ever
have fought in the 11-year-old Afghan civil war.
   Also on Tuesday, Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad said an
estimated 2 million people in Kabul face a winter of scarce food
and fuel unless the communist government changes its priority of
supplies.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bulk
of a massive Soviet airlift to the city consists of weapons instead
of foodstuff.
   Western diplomats reported a similar situation in autumn 1988.
When early and persistent snows fell in the winter, disrupting
overland transport, Kabul faced a severe food shortage.
   Soviet combat troops ended nine years of involvement in the
Afghan civil war in February, and Kabul government forces still
hold the major cities.
   But the guerrillas, fighting to oust the communists in favor of
an Islamic system of goverment, control most of the rugged
countryside including key roads.
   Several of Afghanistan's communist-controlled cities only
receive supplies by air, which sharply limits the volume of cargo.

<TEXT>
   A meat trade official said in a report Tuesday
that the current situation points to good times for the industry as
the 1990s approach.
   C. Manly Molpus, president of the American Meat Institute, said
the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have
stabilized over the last year or so. Further, he said, there are
``solid indications'' that demand for pork is increasing.
   ``Retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with
more vigor than might have been expected after the flat-to-down
trend that characterized most of the decade (of the 1980s),''
Molpus said. ``And the export value of meat and meat products
surpassed the value of imports for the first time ever last year.''
   Molpus' comments were in the association's Meat Facts yearbook
for 1989, the 19th annual issue.
   ``Cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low, and beef
supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers
hold back cattle to expand herd sizes,'' he said.
   ``On the pork side, poor producer returns have likely slowed
herd expansion, with the result that pork supplies could be
slightly smaller next year.''

<TEXT>
   The state electric industry, owed more
than $39 million, is telling government-owned enterprises to pay up
or it will pull the plug.
   The power monopoly also warns of a potential shortage of
electrical energy due to lack of capacity as the winter heating
season approaches, the state PAP news agency reported.
   Amid Poland's crumbling economy, there have been reports of
state-owned companies failing to pay other state-owned enterprises.
   This results in enterprises lacking cash to operate, further
aggravating shortages and reducing funds available to pay debts to
other suppliers.
   Among the debtors with overdue electric bills in Warsaw are the
pharmaceutical enterprise, the car factory and the works that make
construction and photographic supplies and transportation, optical,
telecommunications equipment, according to PAP.
   The Polfa pharmaceutical enterprise alone owes nearly $139,000.
   The largest debtor, the Huta Warszawa steel mill, recently paid
up, PAP said, although no figure was provided for its bill.
   Regional power distribution stations already have cut off
electricity to many smaller enterprises with high bills, the news
agency said.
   The power supplier warned that even companies that pay their
bills may suffer power shortages due to a demand for electricity
that has increased by 1,000 megawatts.
   ``This is precisely the amount lacking at present,'' said PAP.
``Almost all the capacity of the Polish power industry has been put
ot use.''
   Last month, a severe shortage of coal was reported. Estimates
are that coal extraction this year will be off 7 million tons from
the approximately 185 million tons mined last year.

   In a state that has no limits on political
contributions, Douglas Wilder's campaign for governor of Virginia
is happy to have the support of John W. Kluge, named by Forbes
Magazine as the richest man in America.
   ``It's great,'' B.J. Northington, a Wilder campaign aide, said
Tuesday. ``He's given us, what, $200,000?'' Indeed, he has, in two
checks so far this year of $100,000 each. Kluge raised an
additional $500,000 for Wilder at a $5,000-a-couple get together at
his Charlottesville estate.
   But Northington was quick to say that Wilder's Republican
opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, has received more than $900,000 in
campaign contributions from McLean, Va., developer Dwight Schar and
his family.
   Big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed Virginia's
Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles, who cannot run for re-election.
   Coleman has raised more than $8 million and Wilder, bidding to
become the first black elected governor of any state, has taken in
close to $5 million. The election is Nov. 7.
   Money can be easy to raise in Virginia, too easy, according to
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``We have no limitations in Virginia,'' he said. ``People can
give millions if they want.''
   Sabato defends political action committees as a preferred
alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``They're making an investment,'' he said of such contributors.
``I've yet to find a person who believes the line they're doing it
for good government.''
   Alson Smith, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who is
one of the state's premier political fund-raisers, said he
supported efforts to limit individual contributions to $1,000.
   ``We couldn't get that to fly,'' he said, adding that attempts
to set the limit at $5,000 and $10,000 were no more successful.
   Smith described Kluge as ``a good friend of mine'' and said,
``I've never asked him for a dime for anybody.''
   He said he thought Kluge was ``basically a Republican.''
   The 75-year-old Kluge is described as a self-made man who
parlayed a Maryland radio station into the Metromedia radio and
television empire.
   Forbes estimated his fortune at $5.2 billion and said his
holdings rose about $2 billion from the previous year thanks to a
tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones.
   He took the role of richest man in America from Sam Walton, head
of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain who dropped down on the
individual list because he divided his $9 billion fortune among
himself and his four children.
   Smith said Kluge and Wilder met when the billionaire had ``a
little mixer'' on his yacht.
   ``He started off without a dime,'' Smith said of Kluge. ``He
felt Doug Wilder had brought himself up by his bootstraps.''
   That prompted the first $100,000 check from Kluge to the Wilder
campaign. The story of the second check was told by Patricia Kluge
at the fund-raising reception at their estate.
   According to Mrs. Kluge, Coleman called her husband and said he
was aware of his support for Wilder but ``I'm going to win and I
think we should get to know each other.''
   Mrs. Kluge said that after that conversation her husband wrote
another $100,000 check to the Wilder campaign.
   What would Kluge's money buy if Wilder is elected governor?
   There has been widespread speculation that the billionaire's
wife yearns to sit on the University of Virginia Board of Visitors.
   Smith brushed off such suggestions, saying that given Kluge's
wealth, ``There's nothing Doug Wilder can do for John Kluge. What
can anybody do for John Kluge?''

   The Swedish publishers of a new
Estonian-language newspaper were rushing an extra edition across
the Baltic on Tuesday after the first run of issues sold out in one
day, the editor said.
   Hasse Olssen said 7,000 copies of the 16-page monthly Are Paev
(Business Paper) sold at newsstands and another 3,000 promotion
issues were sent by direct mail.
   ``This is the first joint venture in publishing in the Soviet
Union, so it's very exciting,'' said Hasse Olsson, who also edits
the popular Swedish business daily Dagens Industri (Industry Today).
   Are Paev, a tabloid printed on pink newsprint, is 51 percent
owned by the Swedish publishing company Bonniers, owner of Dagens
Industri, and 49 percent by the Estonian management company Minor,
Olsson said.
   Bonniers was shipping another 13,000 issues to the Estonian
capital of Tallinn.
   ``This being the Soviet Union, we have to change the content a
little,'' Olsson said, and the paper includes instructive articles
such as how to set up a company and how to understand stock markets.
   Are Paev, with a full-time staff of three Estonians and two
Swedes, will become a weekly next year, when it will be printed in
Tallinn.

<HEAD>Nuns Win Reprieve for Their Chickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Roman Catholic nuns won a reprieve
Tuesday for their flock of egg-laying chickens, which had been
marked for slaughter by health inspectors.
   Lawyers for 14 nuns at Our Lady of Passion Monastery in the
central England town of Daventry appealed to the High Court for a
review of a Ministry of Agriculture order permitting inspectors to
destroy the nuns' 5,000 chickens.
   Judge Sir Konrad Schiemann said he would review the slaughter
order at a hearing Friday.
   The nuns accused Minister of Agriculture John Gummer of
``failing to comply with the rules of natural justice.''
   The chickens were targeted for slaughter after a salmonella
victim in nearby Bedworth blamed their eggs for her food poisoning.
Mother Catherine, head of the autonomous order, said the
monastery's eggs had never been tested.
   Mother Catherine said the strain of salmonella _ typhimurium _
has been in the convent's chickens since 1913 and did not pose a
serious health risk. She said the Bedworth outbreak had been caused
by another strain, enteriditus.
   The nuns last week blocked roads leading to the convent and
barricaded themselves in the henhouse to keep out health inspectors
and ministry officials. They said the convent might have to close
if the income from selling eggs was lost.
   The government authorized its veterinarians to close
egg-producing plants and slaughter chickens after a food poisoning
scare earlier this year involving salmonella in eggs.
   The British Egg Producers Association said they were delighted
the judicial review had been granted and said it would be a test
case which could force the government to rethink its approach to
tackling salmonella contamination.

   President Carlos Andres Perez asked
Latin American nations on Tuesday to take ``strong collective
action'' against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who survived another
coup attempt last week in Panama.
   ``In Panama there is no longer a constitutional regime, but a
simple military dictatorship ... engaging in dramatic excesses,''
Perez told a news conference.
   Noriega commands Panama's Defense Forces and so controls the
government there.
   Perez accused that government of executing rebel officers
imprisoned after the coup failed.
   The government denied news accounts of some coup leaders being
executed after surendering, but Perez said he had reports that,
``with a great deal of precision ... officers of the Panamanian
Defense Forces have been executed while in prison.''
   He gave no details nor did he spell out what action Latin
America should take.
   At the funeral in Panama City on Tuesday of a Defense Forces
captain involved in the coup, his widow said her husband was killed
in prison and did not commit suicide as rumors had it.
   Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo was reported to have committed suicide in
prison by hanging himself. The official coroner's report said he
died of asphyxiation.
   But his widow, Luz Elaine, said Lorenzo was ``a very Catholic
man'' who would never have killed himself and vowed at her
husband's coffin, ``I will shout it to the world until justice is
done and the truth is known.''
   Panamanian military officials have said eight officers and two
sergeants were killed in the rebellion Oct. 3, including its
leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi. Several U.S. reports have said an
enraged Noriega personally shot Giroldi to death minutes after the
coup failed.
   In Washington, the Bush administration said Tuesday the United
States had flown some coup leaders to Miami, along with members of
their families.
   The United States has tried to get Noriega out for nearly two
years. It applied economic sanctions against Panama after federal
grand juries in Florida indicted him in February 1988 on charges of
drug trafficking and money laundering.
   Noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a U.S. plot
to retain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, when it is to be
turned over under treaties signed in 1977.
   Panama led the agenda for talks between Perez and President
Francois Mitterrand of France, who arrived Monday for a 48-hour
official visit.
   On Monday night, at a banquet for Mitterrand, Perez said the
Noriega regime was ``sowing terror (by) executing Panamanian
officers.''
   At the news conference Tuesday, he ruled out military
intervention, saying it ``would be a tragedy for the whole
continent.'' He added that Latin American action undertaken ``in
solidarity with the Panamanian people'' would spare the region
worse evils.
   The president declared that Latin America was allowing a
military dictatorship in Panama despite its repudiation of attempts
to overthrow civilian governments in Argentina, Ecuador and Peru by
force.
   That, he said, ``could be a dangerous sign of regression for
Latin America's democratic process. It compels us to see ... a
dictorship in Panama as a threat for the entire continent.''
   Observers said the call for joint action could lead to formal
expulsion of Panama from the Latin American Group of Eight, whose
other members are Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, Colombia,
Mexico and Venezuela.
   Panama was suspended early in 1988 after Noriega arranged the
dismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who had tried to fire the
general as Defense Forces commander.
   The Group of Eight, formed three years ago to represent Latin
America on major political and economic issues, is to hold a
two-day summit this week at Ica, Peru. Perez said other members
share his concern about Panama.
   Because of Panama's strategic position, Perez said, the crisis
there has ``global implications'' and is Latin America's most
serious problem.
   He said the Noriega regime ``lacks legality and legitimacy'' and
the coup attempt demonstrates ``that the Defense Forces' unity is
broken.'' Since the coup, Perez said, Noriega ``has unleashed an
increasing repression whose extent we cannot determine.''

<HEAD>Judge Issues Gag Order In Central Park Rape Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the case of a jogger who was raped
and nearly beaten to death in Central Park issued a gag order
Tuesday at a hearing on whether the teen-age defendants' statements
may be used as trial evidence.
   Six young men are charged with the April 19 rape and attempted
murder of a 28-year-old investment banker who was taking her
nightly jog in the park. She suffered severe brain damage and still
has partial amnesia, but is undergoing rehabilitation and has
offered to testify.
   At the request of the prosecution, state Supreme Justice Thomas
Galligan ordered lawyers in the case not to divulge any material
brought out at the hearing that prosecutors intend to use as
evidence.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, complaining about
leaks to the news media, told Galligan the material contained the
names of juveniles and other witnesses she plans to call, as well
as other information which could compromise the investigation if
revealed.
   A seventh teen is charged with attacking two male joggers and
robbing them. He is not charged with rape.
   An eighth youth, Jermaine Robinson, 15, has pleaded guilty to
robbery in connection with attacks on the male runners and is
expected to testify against the others in exchange for a one-year
sentence and youthful offender status.
   The pretrial hearing is on whether to suppress written and
videotaped statements to police in which most of the youths
implicate their codefendants.
   The defense lawyers say the statements were taken illegally from
children under duress and should be thrown out. Peter Rivera,
lawyer for defendant Raymond Santana, said his client was
browbeaten for 10 hours before he was allowed to see his parents.
Then he was told he would be allowed to go if he confessed, the
lawyer said.
   Colin Moore, lawyer for Kharey Wise, 17, said police kept his
client away from parents, counsel and food for hours before
extracting a statement.
   Outside the courtroom, Rivera said that if Galligan bars the
youths' statements to police, his client will go free.
   ``The videotaped statements are the whole case,'' Rivera said.
``Without them they have no case. I feel pretty confident that if
the law is followed, the statements will not be admitted.''
   If Galligan admits the statements as evidence, some of the
youths may have to get separate trials, partly because their
interests are antagonistic.

<TEXT>
   Candidates for new school-based councils that
will give parents unprecedented power to shape public education
rang doorbells and passed out leaflets Tuesday in a last-minute
effort to get voters to the polls.
   Elections on Wednesday at the city's 469 elementary schools and
Thursday at the 71 public high schools will determine council
members, whose sweeping authority will include hiring and firing
principals, developing school-improvement plans and spending money.
   Each council will include six parents, two teachers and two
community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will
elect teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be the
principal of the school or schools the council oversees.
   Community activists and others who spent weeks trying to
mobilize residents to participate in the 590 councils persuaded
17,256 candidates to run for nearly 5,000 unpaid council spots.
   The activists predicted a 50 percent turnout for the elections
among parents with children in the schools, urging voters without
children to participate as well in one of the most radical reforms
in big-city education this century.
   ``The basic message is that the city can't survive with the
quality of schools that we have,'' said Donald Moore, executive
director of Designs for Change, an education research and advisory
group that helped shape an education reform package.
   The local councils are a key element of the reform plan,
approved by the Illinois Legislature last year.
   The reform effort is aimed at lowering the city's estimated 40
percent dropout rate, improving dismal test scores, weeding out
unmotivated educators and eliminating other problems that have
given Chicago public schools a reputation as the nation's worst.
   ``The bad education system is really crippling the city. Whether
you have kids in school or not, it's important'' to vote, Moore
said Tuesday.
   Any city resident older than 18 is eligible to vote in the
elections.
   ``I know that the system will work if we have parent
participation,'' said Reaver Barlowe-Bell, a parent candidate at
her 15-year-old daughter's high school and a community candidate at
an elementary school.
   Mary Guyton-Smith is seeking a spot as a community
representative on the council at her alma mater, Farragut High
School.
   ``I graduated from there in 1965 and they were educating the
children then. I'd like to see it go back to what it once was,''
she said.
   Each council is to hold its first meeting within seven days of
the election, said volunteer Dalila Wong at the council hotline
telephone number. The councils are required to meet at least once a
month.

   The punch lines were missing when the nation's top
cartoonists gathered Tuesday, but the message was clear: ``People
who don't know how to read, don't get the point.''
   The cartoonists left the captions off a series of special
drawings to show how a person who can't read sees the comics, said
Mort Walker, author of ``Beetle Bailey'' and an organizer of
``Cartoonists For Literacy.''
   ``Comics have always helped people to read. A lot of people
learned to read by reading the comics,'' Walker said. ``And it's
our livelihood, after all. If people don't know how to read,
they're not reading our comics.''
   Walker said he got the artists together because he thought their
work could lead more people to read and encourage others to help
them learn. Thirty-three artists attended Tuesday's demonstration
and others contributed drawings.
   On display at the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library, the city's
main library, were drawings of ``Peanuts,'' ``Garfield,'' ``Hi and
Lois,'' ``Curtis,'' and ``Hagar the Horrible.''.
   The group's presentation in Dallas represents the first
organized effort by cartoonists to battle illiteracy. Cartoonists
have previously collectively dealt with such issues as hunger and
homelessness.
   Some of the cartoonists Tuesday turned out special drawings
during a program at the library. About 100 people watched as the
cartoonists took turns drawing their characters without captions,
illustrating how words make the comics funny.
   The cartoons promoting literacy will be distributed to
newspapers through syndicates.
   ``Hopefully, it'll dramatize the impact of the absence of the
punch line,'' said Bob Browne, creator of ``Hi and Lois.'' ``Most
of us who know how to read and write can't identify that readily
with what it must be like to not have that ability.''
   Browne's brother Chris, who draws ``Hagar the Horrible,'' said
the brutish but lovable Viking is well suited as a spokesman for
the effort.
   ``He can't read, so it's a natural for this sort of thing,''
Chris Browne said. ``It's a point of, not so much humor, but pathos
in our script.
   ``I think that for a long time now, cartoonists have felt that,
it's time for us, since we're communicators, to do something,'' he
said. ``It takes very little effort. In life you do whatever you
can. It's like baseball _ you bat from wherever you're standing.
And this is where we stand.''
   Bill Hinds, creator of ``Tank McNamara,'' sometimes pokes fun at
illiterate or uneducated athletes in his popular strip.
   ``The comics, I'm sure, are widely read by a lot of people who
don't read anything else in the newspaper,'' Hinds said. ``The
funny pictures attract people who don't normally read. And I trust
there are a lot of sports people out there who don't do a lot of
reading.''

<HEAD>House Would Expand Power of White House Environmental Agency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Tuesday that
would expand the power of a White House environmental agency that
critics said was allowed to atrophy under the Reagan administration.
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would give the Council
on Environmental Quality power to require federal agencies to take
into account the effects of their actions on the world environment.
Such issues as acid rain, ocean pollution, the ozone layer and
global climactic change would come under the council's purview.
   The voice vote in the House signaled renewed confidence,
particularly among Democrats, in an agency that under Reagan was
seen as having little power, said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who
sponsored the legislation.
   ``The council is minuscule in terms of its budget,'' Studds
said. But he said it ``really is the spokesman on the environment
for the president and it sets the tone for the administration.''
   Separate legislation, which is now in a House-Senate conference
committee, could potentially double the council's budget to $1.5
million.
   The current chairman of the council is Michael Deland, who
formerly headed the federal Environmental Protection Agency's
Boston office and gained attention for his efforts to clean up
Boston Harbor.
   Deland said of the White House council Tuesday, ``It did not
have a high visibility for the last eight years, to put it mildly.''
   He said the bill approved by the House could serve a valuable
secondary purpose by sending a message to Brazil that the United
States is serious about protecting the global environment.
Brazilian officials have criticized the United States for calling
for preservation of the Amazon rain forest while at the same time
tolerating pollution within its own borders.
   ``Before we can put on our preacher's garb and go to Brazil or
anywhere else in the world we need to cleanse our own hands, to get
our own house in order,'' Deland said. ``There are a number of
steps that could be taken here in the U.S. to set an example to try
and help others.''
   Under the House bill, federal agencies would have to consider
alternatives to any action that would have a harmful effect on the
environment of another nation or of areas such as Antarctica that
are outside the jurisdiction of any nation.

<HEAD>Man Shot In Head With Nail Gun Should Be OK, Doctor Says</HEAD>

   A nail accidentally fired from a nail gun
penetrated about 1{ inches into a carpenter's brain and nailed his
cap to his head, but the doctor who removed the nail said he
shouldn't suffer any serious effects.
   ``I've had worse headaches,'' said carpenter Lance Grangruth,
who said the headache was the only complication he suffered.
   ``I didn't actually feel it go in,'' he said. ``I heard the gun
go off.
   ``I tried to take my hat off and it wouldn't come off. Then I
knew it had gone in.''
   Dr. William Himango said he used pliers Monday to remove the
2-inch nail from the frontal lobe of Grangruth's brain at St.
Luke's Hospital. Grangruth, of Barnum, was kept in intensive care
for observation.
   ``If he were to pick a place to put a nail in, he picked exactly
the right place to put it in,'' Himango said.
   The same injury to other parts of the brain could have caused
functional damage or death, Himango said.
   Grangruth was working on a garage Monday in Hermantown when a
co-worker, perched on a ladder, lowered his arm while holding the
gun's trigger, said police Officer Dan Perich. The co-worker didn't
realize Grangruth was standing below.
   Although the co-worker was holding the regular trigger, a nail
gun won't fire until a safety trigger at the muzzle also is
depressed by pushing it against the work surface where the nail is
wanted.
   When the gun touched Grangruth's head it went off, with 120
pounds of air pressure driving an 8-penny galvanized nail _ about
an eighth-inch thick _ through his baseball cap and into his
forehead.
   Grangruth and his co-worker went to a nearby house to call an
ambulance.
   Perich found Grangruth alert and a little pale, but not bleeding.
   ``He was sitting on the couch talking,'' Perich said. ``He
walked around with the nail in his head.''

   Hundreds of supporters saluted defiant peace
activist Abie Nathan with balloons and a trumpet flourish Tuesday
as he became the first Israeli to go to jail for meeting with PLO
chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``There is no replacement for dialogue; no guns or stones will
solve the problem,'' Nathan said before stepping through an iron
gate into Eyal Prison, 15 miles northeast of Tel Aviv.
   He also called on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to follow his
example and meet Palestinian leaders ``to continue the search for
peace.''
   Nearby, a protester hoisted a huge red-and-white balloon that
said: ``Dialogue, Not Bloodshed.'' A trumpet blared, and young
supporters sang ``Give Peace a Chance.''
   The six-month sentence of the 63-year-old Nathan comes at a time
when Israel's coalition government is deeply split over whether to
meet with a PLO-sanctioned delegation in Cairo to discuss proposals
for bringing peace to the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc on Friday jettisoned a proposal
for such talks by its coalition partner, the Labor Party. It said
the plan could lead Israel to indirect talks with the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist group and refuses to meet.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a meeting
with the Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers within two weeks to
try to revive stalled peace efforts, Israeli and U.S. officials
said Tuesday.
   Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Baker had proposed the three-way meeting be held in Washington to
work on terms of Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo.
   Meanwhile, left-wing Israeli legislators said they would try to
change the 1986 ``Anti-Terror Amendment'' under which Nathan was
convicted for a September 1988 meeting with Arafat in Tunis,
Tunisia.
   The law provides for a maximum three-year sentence for
unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist organization.
   Several Israeli activists have previously been sentenced to six
months for meeting with PLO leaders in Bucharest, Romania, in
November 1986, but they remain free awaiting rulings on appeals.
   Nathan, sentenced on Oct. 3 after pleading guilty to the
charges, did not file an appeal.
   Before entering the minimum-security lockup Tuesday, Nathan
vowed to continue his peace efforts in an emotional speech to 700
supporters.
   ``They clipped my wings only for a little while, but they know I
will be back on the air,'' said Nathan.
   Nathan is owner of the ``Voice of Peace,'' an unauthorized radio
station that broadcasts to Israel and neighboring Arab states from
a ship in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The Indian-born Nathan became known as a crusader in 1964 when
he made a dramatic flight to Cairo to appeal for peace.
   In the West Bank on Tuesday, an Arab assailant who allegedly
collaborated with Israeli authorities fatally shot a 16-year-old
Palestinian in the chest in the refugee camp Fawwar, claiming the
youth stoned his car, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the
fatality but gave no details.
   Elsewhere in the occupied territories, soldiers shot and wounded
11 Palestinians during clashes with stone-throwing demonstrators,
the reports said.
   During the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation, 587
Palestinians and 40 Israelis have been killed. Palestinians have
killed more than 120 suspected collaborators with the Israelis.
   Also Tuesday, Israel radio quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
as saying 40,000 Palestinians have been detained during the
uprising and more than 15,000 wounded.

   First lady Barbara Bush got UNICEF's annual
Halloweeen fund-raising drive off to an early start Tuesday,
depositing quarters in the collection boxes of a witch, a soldier,
a Dutch girl, a king, an astronaut, a football player and the
Statue of Liberty.
   The costumed children came calling at the White House to help
Mrs. Bush draw attention to National UNICEF Day, better known as
Halloween.
   These trick-or-treaters emerged from the South Portico of the
presidential mansion with Mrs. Bush and her dog Millie.
   After depositing a quarter in each of their orange collection
boxes, Mrs. Bush found she had three left.
   ``What do I do with the three extra quarters?'' she asked the
children, brought to the White House by UNICEF officials from six
states and the District of Columbia.
   She resolved the problem by slipping the coins into the boxes of
three of the masqueraders.
   Mrs. Bush is honorary chairwoman of the annual fund-raising
drive for the United Nations Children's Fund.
   A Philadelphia minister, Rep. Clyde Allison, initiated the
practice in 1950 of having children raise funds for UNICEF instead
of soliciting candy on Halloween. Allison's charges raised $17;
since then, trick-or-treaters for UNICEF have pulled in $90 million.
   Organizers hope to raise $3 million this year to help provide
safe drinking water and basic health care for poor children in
developing countries.

<HEAD>White House Accused of Violating Laws on Record-Keeping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers seeking access to Reagan
administration computer tapes Tuesday accused the White House of
``wholesale violations'' of federal record-keeping laws.
   Lawyers for the private National Security Archive and
organizations of librarians and historians made the accusation in a
procedural motion submitted to U.S. District Judge Charles Richey.
   Richey ruled on Sept. 15 that private citizens have the right to
challenge White House decisions to erase the computer tapes, which
are of the kind discovered by investigators in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The lawsuit was filed on the day before President Reagan left
office and sought to prevent scheduled destruction of 12 days worth
of secret electronic memos in a system used in the Executive Office
of the President.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker issued a temporary
restraining order in January barring the destruction of the tapes
before the case went to Richey. The tapes, known as PROFS tapes
after the initials of the computer system, have since been
preserved under court order.
   In the PROFS system, the tapes automatically record all
communications for use in restoring the system if the computer
``crashes.'' In the Iran-Contra affair, memoranda that had been
erased in computer terminals of the participants were discovered by
investigators on the backup tapes.
   No one knows what is on the tapes at issue in the case before
Richey.
   Richey's Sept. 15 ruling opened the way for further proceedings
in the case, including the pre-trial discovery process in which
plaintiffs and defendants exchange information about their cases.
The plaintiffs hope to obtain more information in discovery about
what is on the tapes.
   The Justice Department on Sept. 27 asked to have the case
transferred to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, arguing that prolonged lower court proceedings would
interfere with President Bush's performance of his constitutional
duties.
   In their response to the Justice Department, lawyers for the
challengers said Tuesday, ``It is obvious that the defendants want
... to avoid responding to plaintiffs' discovery, which will show,
without question, that there have been wholesale violations of the
Presidential Records Act and the other federal records laws through
the routine destruction of information generated over the PROFS
system.''
   ``This court should put an end to defendants' wasteful and
obstructionist tactics,'' said attorneys Katherine A. Meyer of
Public Citizen Litigation Group and Kate Martin of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   In addition to the National Security Archive, a Washington
nonprofit group that researches national security issues, the
plaintiffs include the American Library Association, the American
Historical Association and the Center for National Security Studies
of the ACLU.
   The Justice Department argued in September that the case
presents ``a threat to the president's authority.''
   The plaintiffs replied that the department had not spelled out
what authority it referred to but presumably it meant the
``authority to make unilateral (and unreviewable) decisions to
destroy the PROFS information, regardless of whether it falls
within the definition of `presidential records' that Congress has
mandated must be preserved for the benefit of future generations.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly one-third of the nation's homeless
people are impaired by alcohol or drug dependency, and about one in
five suffer severe mental illness, according to a survey of both
public and private relief agencies.
   The survey, which estimated the overall homeless population at
up to 2 million _ an 18 percent increase since 1987 _ also
indicated that from 28,000 to 32,000 homeless people have AIDS or
diseases such as AIDS Related Complex. Moreover, the AIDS group is
likely to increase by 87 percent in just the next year, it said.
   The report was issued late Tuesday by The Partnership for the
Homeless, Inc., of New York City, the nation's largest private
service organization for the homeless, and was based on
questionnaires circulated to more than 500 public and private
agencies in 46 citie and localities.
   The survey was released three days after upwards of 100,000
people demonstrated in Washington in behalf of the homeless as well
as all Americans yearning for more affordable housing. The
Partnership proposed a ``national agenda'' for dealing with the
issue, including these steps:
   _An increase in the minimum wage, now $3.35 per hour, to $4.85
over the next three years.
   _Modest increases, graduated for family size, in the Earned
Income Tax Credit for the working poor.
   _Uniform minimum amounts for welfare benefits, which now vary
greatly from state to state, beginning at one-half the poverty
level in 1990 and rising to at least the poverty level four years
later.
   Coupled with other steps, including a $680 million increase in
direct housing assistance, the Partnership said the plan would
necessitate a $2.8 billion boost in 1990 over current government
spending.
   ``This is a watershed opportunity to begin a new decade with a
comprehensive attack on all the root causes of homelessness,'' said
Partnership President Peter P. Smith. ``The American people have
made it clear that they want some swift and effective action taken
to address a problem that has become a national disgrace.''
   The New York City group, which has conducted similar surveys
since homelessness began to surge early in the decade, said the
latest results found little or no increase in the number of
homeless families, reversing a four-year trend. The family portion
of the homeless population has steadied at 31 percent, the survey
said.
   The survey found shortages of emergency shelter for the homeless
in all 46 localities, and virtually all reported turned homeless
people away from shelters and other relief services. Overall, it
said, the emergency needs of 37 percent of the homeless go unmet.
   The report said 21 percent of the homeless are impaired by
mental illness, which afflicts mostly single men (25 percent) and
single women (28 percent). About 11 percent of homeless youth are
mentally impaired, it said.
   Drug and alcohol dependency afflicts 31 percent of the homeless,
including 17 percent of those in the family group, it said.
   The report said less than 6 percent are homeless by choice, down
from 7.3 percent in the 1987 survey.
   The survey reported the biggest increases in the numbers of
homeless in Everett, Wash., 70 percent; Salt Lake City, 67 percent;
Newark, N.J., 60 percent, and Wichita, Kan., 50 percent. No city
reported a decrease, and only in Corpus Christi, Texas, Seattle and
Wilmington, Del., were no increases reported.
   It said also there were increases in the ``hidden homeless'' _
families doubled or tripled up with other families in substandard
housing _ in all but one city, St. Paul, Minn.

   The Library of Congress will open its files to
a cable television continuing education program next year,
officials said Tuesday.
   The library's resources will be available Jan. 1 to the Mind
Extension University, an Englewood, Colo.-based subsidiary of Jones
International Ltd.
   James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, said Jones
International and the university donated $1 million to facilitate
the program.
   ``Cable television will allow us to make available to the
broadest extent possible the information and knowledge resources
assembled at the Library of Congress,'' Billington said in a
statement.
   The Global Library Project will produce library-related
informational and instructional programming for librarians and the
public to be shown one hour a day on the Mind Extension University.
   The university is a TV network run by Jones Intercable, the
nation's 12th largest cable operator and a subsidary of Jones
International. It offers undergraduate and master's degrees and
non-credit programs through 13 U.S. colleges and universities, and
is available to more than 5 million cable households and 2.4
million satellite dish owners, the library said.
   The project also will form a task force of industry leaders to
advise its American Memory program on American culture and history.
   The American Memory program will draw from the library's
collection of manuscripts, recordings, books, motion pictures and
graphic and photographic materials.

   Taxpayers who received a six-month extension

Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday.
   However, the agency said in a statement that it won't assess

   If the filing delay was due to Hugo, it said, taxpayers should

   Former Communist Party leader Luis
Corvalan on Tuesday returned from 13 years of exile in the Soviet
Union and immediately declared support for the opposition's
presidential candidate.
   The endorsement, however, could prove an embarrassment for the
candidate, Patricio Aylwin. His main opponent has been accused
Aylwin of forging an alliance with the extreme left.
   Upon arrival at Santiago's international airport, Corvalan, 73,
said he would participate actively in the campaign for December
elections.
   More than 200 Communist activists waved party banners, cheered
and tossed red carnations at Corvalan.
   He told reporters, ``I come prepared to participate in all the
upcoming battles, the first and the principal one being the
election.''
   ``I will do what I can for the victory of the sole opposition
candidate, Patricio Aylwin,'' he said.
   However, Corvalan's return was seen a potential setback for
Aylwin, a centrist Christian Democrat backed by 17 parties.
   His leading opponent, Hernan Buchi, a former finance minister
for the military government, has repeatedly accused Aylwin of ties
to the extreme left.
   Aylwin was nominated by a coalition with parties ranging from
the center-right to socialists that defeated President Augusto
Pinochet in an October 1988 referendum. At that time, voters
rejected a proposal that Pinochet remain the country's leader until
1997, forcing him to call the national elections scheduled for Dec.
14.
   The pro-Moscow Communist Party was excluded from the opposition
coalition largely because of its ties with urban guerrilla
organizations. It nonetheless has called on its ranks to support
Aylwin.
   ``Right now, there has to be just one united front, to give a
decisive blow to the dictatorship and move forward with the full
democratization of the country,'' Corvalan declared at the airport.
   A former senator, Corvalan was the Communist Party's
secretary-general for more than 30 years until early this year,
when a party congress decided to replace him with Volodia
Teitelboim.
   He was a close ally of former President Salvador Allende, a
Marxist whose elected government fell when Pinochet seized power in
a 1973 coup. Corvalan was immediately arrested and imprisoned with
many other leftists.
   In 1976, he was freed and expelled to Moscow in exchange for the
release of Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky.
   Corvalan was officially exiled until Sept. 1, 1988, when the
government lifted bans on the return of political enemies.

<TEXT>
   Arab mediators urged members of
Lebanon's parliament Tuesday to speed up talks aimed at ending
their nation's 14-year-old civil war, but a conference source said
talks just ran in ``vicious circles.''
   He quoted a member of the three-man Arab League mediating
committee as telling the 63 deputies:
   ``You have often said you would solve your country's problems in
10 hours if left alone with no external forces meddling. But we see
you have spent 10 days here without achieving results.''
   The source spoke on condition of anonymity and would not say
which mediator made the comment. The three are foreign ministers
Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Ghozali of Algeria and
Abdul-Latif al-Filali of Morocco.
   Mediators held separate meetings with groups of legislators,
trying to gain agreement on a proposed reconciliation charter.
   Talks began after a cease-fire took hold in Beirut on Sept. 22
that ended six months of artillery duels between Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian forces and an alliance of Syria and Moslems militias. The
shelling killed more than 900 people.
   In Beirut on Tuesday, snipers exchanged gunfire along the
Lebanese capital's dividing Green Line and the first battle
fatality was reported since the truce took effect. First Lt.
Abdul-Rahman Aslan, a Shiite Moslem, was killed and three soldiers
were wounded in a clash between Moslem troops and Christian army
units.
   An 18-member task force in Taif is formulating a draft for
political reforms.
   Deputies were reported to be moving slowly toward a peace plan
after hard-line Christians conceded that immediate Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon would allow militias to take control of
Moslem regions.
   The presence of Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon is the main
issue that has threatened to undermine the talks.
   The Arab committee proposes a phased Syrian withdrawal from the
Beirut area to be completed in two years. A total pullout would
depend on Israel's ending its occupation of a security zone in
south Lebanon and conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact.
   The Moslems and their Syrian backers have said Damascus should
withdraw its troops only after a political settlement of the civil
war has been achieved.
   Before the Christians agree to political reforms, they want
guarantees of a Syrian pullout within six months.
   Acknowledgement by Christian legislators that a quick Syrian
withdrawal could spur more turmoil raised speculation that a
compromise was in the works. Later, however, ``sharp differences on
the Syrian role were renewed, and it was as if the deputies were
back at the starting point,'' one source said.
   Another said, ``They keep moving in vicious circles, going back
on what they had indicated they will approve.''
   Syrian troops have been in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun says Syria violated its mandate
by backing the Moslems in the civil war.
   Moslems say they now make up 55 percent of Lebanon's population
and want more political power than was accorded them in the
unwritten national covenant going back to independence from France
in 1943, when Christians were in the majority.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, State Prosecutor Rallis Gavrielides said in
court Tuesday that six Lebanese men being tried for illegal arms
possession there all confessed they went to Cyprus from Lebanon
last May to assassinate Aoun.
   Under Cyprus law, arms possession carries a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment. Plotting to kill, the charge that was dropped,
is punishable by a lesser maximum of 14 years imprisonment.
   Gavrielides said the accused confessed they intended to shoot
down Aoun's helicopter. Aoun was to pass through Cyprus en route to
Morocco to attend an Arab summit meeting on Lebanon, but canceled
the trip.

   Officials said Tuesday a U.N. relief
plane, its crew and passengers had been released two weeks after
the plane made an emergency landing in northeastern Uganda.
   Army commander Salim Saleh said the twin-engine C-119 Fairchild,
its two American pilots, two British passengers and three Kenyan
crewmen were released Friday.
   Tarcis Kabwegyere of the Foreign Ministry said the aircraft was
expected to leave for Nairobi on Wednesday. U.N. officials, who
have not reported the names of those aboard, were not available for
comment.
   Relatives in the United States identified Ted King, 26, of
Paradise, Calif., as one of the American pilots. They said the
other was named Dan Rinner but they did not know his hometown.
   The plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 at Kaabong in
northeastern Uganda after running out of fuel in bad weather while
returning to Lokichoggio, Kenya, from a relief flight to southern
Sudan.
   Kaabong is about 50 miles south of Lokichoggio, a staging point
for the U.N.-coordinated Sudan famine relief effort.
   The United Nations has been flying food and supplies from Kenya
to southern Sudan since April.
   Saleh said Uganda detained those on the plane until an
investigation showed they were telling the truth. Officials said
earlier they held the plane to determine whether the crew and
passengers had ``ill intentions.''
   Last year, a plane registered in Kenya delivered military
equipment and supplies to rebels fighting the government of
President Yoweri Museveni. The army seized the goods.

   Fire crews on the aircraft
carrier USS Forrestal searched Tuesday for the cause of an
electrical fire in an elevator machinery room that slightly injured
11 sailors, the Navy said.
   ``They are doing damage assessment and checking the electrical
systems very carefully,'' Cmdr. Tim Taylor said Tuesday.
   The ship was scheduled to leave Thursday for six months in the
Mediterranean Sea. Taylor said he did not know what effect the
Monday fire will have on the trip.
   The fire was largely confined to a room containing machinery for
an elevator that raises aircraft from the hangar deck to the flight
deck. No aircraft were aboard the Forrestal at the time.
   Crews cannot begin repairs until a report on the fire is
complete, Taylor said.
   The 1,086-foot-long Forrestal is based at Mayport, east of
Jacksonville on the St. Johns River.
   From 2,500 to 3,000 sailors were on the ship when fire broke
out, said Bert Byers, a Navy spokesman near Jacksonville.
   The Forrestal was the first U.S. aircraft carrier designed to
operate jets. It is the third-oldest U.S. carrier in active
service, though it has been modernized several times.

   Dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov on Tuesday denied
rumors that he will become artistic director of the Paris Opera
Ballet.
   The current artistic director, Rudolf Nureyev, a fellow Soviet
ballet dancer who defected to the West for artistic freedom, is
touring the United States in ``The King and I.''
   Baryshnikov resigned as artistic director of American Ballet
Theater in late September. He is working on a new ballet with
choreographer Mark Morris in Brussels.
   In a telephone call to his agent Edgar Vincent, Baryshnikov
said, ``I definitely deny that I have been, am or will be
interested in this post. There have been no talks _ and I underline
the word no _ between anyone from the Paris Opera Ballet and me and
this rumor is purely the figment of someone's imagination.''
   The rumor is mentioned in the November issue of Vanity Fair and
is said to be circulating in Paris.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney complained
Tuesday that interference by members of Congress undermined the
ability of the Bush administration to handle last week's Panamanian
crisis.
   ``It's really not their bailiwick,'' Cheney said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   He contended the lawmakers ``cannot contribute anything in a
positive nature while the crisis is still being managed.''
   ``We had situations here where members of Congress were
literally calling (executive branch) agencies downtown, or even
people in Panama, as these events unfolded, demanding information.
That creates all kinds of problems,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney, who served more than 10 years in the House before
becoming defense secretary this year, declined to name any names.
   The secretary's remarks came in the wake of a barrage of
criticism from Capitol Hill about the way Bush administration
officials dealt with last week's abortive coup against the
Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Cheney argued that administration and military officials were
forced to answer the congressional queries, even though they were
trying to do their jobs in a crisis environment.
   The defense secretary said a second problem was created when
lawmakers got information _ ``under these circumstances, it usually
tends to be just a small piece of the total picture,'' and public
statements based on that information sometimes were found later to
be inaccurate.
   Not only will lawmakers make ``potentially embarrassing''
mistakes, Cheney contended, they ``certainly complicate our lives
when they run out and make public pronoucements in front of the
press, knowing only half of what there is to know.''
   Cheney cited as a case in point the assertion that Noriega was
offered to U.S. officials.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., repeatedly has contended that was the
case, although Cheney and other administration officials say
they've found no evidence that such an offer was ever made.
   ``The president is the commander-in-chief. He's the one who has
to manage a crisis. You cannot have every member of Congress
involved,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary said that while members of Congress have
legitimate oversight roles, ``they ought to refrain from trying to
intrude in the process while it is still unfolding.''
   On budget issues, Cheney said he would recommend to President
Bush a veto of the defense authorization bill if funds for
strategic programs such as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative are inadequate and Congress has added too much
money for weapons he has proposed for cancellation.
   In response to calls from Republican lawmakers that the
administration take a stand on final budget total for SDI, Cheney
said the Pentagon was seeking the $4.5 billion approved in the
Senate version of the defense authorization bill. But acknowledging
the realities of current Senate egotiations with the House, which
approved $3.1 billion, he said, ``It's not a matter of our
dictating a particular number and saying this is absolutely got to
be (it).''
   Questioned about congressional warnings that a fleet of 132 B-2
bombers at an eventual cost of $70 billion is impossible in the
current fiscal climate, Cheney retorted that if Congress accepted
his budget there would be no problem in finding the money.
   ``We showed them how to do it,'' he said, referring to the
budget he proposed in May that included cancellation of the Marine
Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat
jetfighter _ weapons that Congress wants to keep alive.

   President Bush has accepted an invitation by
the leaders of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia to attend a summit
conference on drugs, the White House announced Tuesday evening.
   ``The president will go,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. He said that having a summit within 90 days was
``within the time frame we have been considering. It's reasonable.''
   The three leaders are meeting in Ica, Peru. Their countries
account for most of the cocaine produced or processed in Latin
America.
   Fitzwater also said the United States had no objection about
inviting European leaders. The press spokesman said the United
States will be in touch with Latin leaders concerning the time,
location and agenda items for a summit. He said that security
concerns would not stand in the way of a summit. ``That could be
worked out.''
   As for a meeting Nov. 20 meeting of lower-level officials for
preliminary discussions, Fitzwater said, ``I'm sure that's fine
with us.''
   Fitzwater said the most likely site for a summit would be in one
of the countries that extended the invitation. He said the United
States already had considered having a drug summit in Jamaica,
Barbados, Venezuela and Colombia. ``We've looked at all kinds of
options _ I don't think that would be an obstacle from our point of
view.''

   Rape and incest victims are victimized
again under a state law that requires them to report the crimes
before they can get publicly funded abortions, a lawmaker said
Tuesday while pushing for change in the law.
   New legislation would eliminate the reporting requirement. It is
part of a nine-part package of bills designed to reduce abortion
restrictions in Pennsylvania and offer an alternative to proposals
for further controls.
   The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on a
series of abortion-related bills Friday.
   The sponsor of the reporting requirement repeal, state Rep.
Babette Josephs, said the requirement serves ``no law-enforcement
value.''
   The law is especially tough on young girls who have been raped
by a male relative and do not have family support to report the
crime, she said.
   ``Unable to obtain an abortion, she puts her own life at some
risk, probably because of her young age, and has a child who's
unwanted,'' she said.
   Sue Carver, a counselor at the Choice Hotline in Philadelphia,
said many women fear retaliation from their attackers if they
report the crime. Callers to the hot line reported having problems
with police who doubt their stories, she said.
   Vicki Smink, spokeswoman for the state Public Welfare
Department, said the number of Medicaid-funded abortions dropped
from 436 in fiscal year 1987-88 to 36 the following year. The
Abortion Control Act of 1988, which included the reporting
provision, was signed into law March 1988.
   The legislature's chief abortion opponent, state Rep. Stephen
Freind, said the reporting requirement is designed to catch rapists
and prevent fraudulent reporting of a crime to obtain public
funding for an abortion.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Group Calls off Rail Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of a political movement in the southern
republic of Azerbaijan suspended on Tuesday a rail strike that
choked off supplies of fuel, food and housing supplies to
neighboring Armenia, a member said.
   ``We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia as
of 22:00 (10 p.m.),'' said Ingilap Aslanov, a member of the
grass-roots People's Front and of the group's strike committee, in
a telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital Baku.
   He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Soviet
legislators in Moscow a chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demands
to remove special Kremlin administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh
area _ the source of a bloody ethnic dispute between Azerbaijanis
and Armenians.
   Soviet troops moved into the Caucasus republics last week to
break the blockade that has been strangling Armenia and the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. About 400 trains with
60,000 cars were reported idled.
   Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hours
authorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through to
Armenia.
   But Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told the Supreme Soviet
legislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage has
stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in Armenia's fields.
   Reports said freight arriving in Armenia under military guard
was damaged.
   Aslanov said the Azerbaijan People's Front wanted the issue of
Nagorno-Karabakh taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled for
demanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question.
   If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the People's Front will call a
general strike that once again will include the railroads, he said.
   The People's Front leadership made the decision after thousands
of people gathered Sunday on the main square of Baku, he said.
   The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, but
Armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through Azerbaijan
dried up almost three months ago.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening the fall session of the
Supreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break the
transportation deadlock.
   After hearing Tuesday from Voronin, the Supreme Soviet once
again called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to end their dispute.
   Voronin said ``blown-up bridges and continuing strafing of
trains'' still makes transport difficult in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have engaged in ethnic violence for
19 months, largely over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians want control of
the area, a section of Azerbaijan where most inhabitants are
Armenian. Azerbaijan wants to retain control, and seeks an end to
the special administration from Moscow that was imposed in January
in an effort to calm the situation.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Tuesday that
factory-built temporary houses for victims of last December's
Armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glass
and crushed window frames during transit.
   Prefurnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project
arrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, the newspaper
said.
   ``They simply cannot be restored,'' Pravda said.
   Tass said it is proving particularly hard to restore transport
of supplies in Nagorno-Karabakh. The regions of Martuninski and
Gadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday,
the newspaper Red Star said Tuesday.
   Krasnaya Zvezda also said weapons were found hidden in sacks of
flour on an Armenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied any
knowledge of the weapons.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
proposed a meeting with the Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers
in the next two weeks to try to revive stalled peace efforts,
Israeli and U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Baker had proposed a five-point plan. They said that according to
the plan, the three-way meeting would be held in Washington and the
participants would try to work out the terms of Palestinian-Israeli
talks in Cairo.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
confirmed that Baker, in recent telephone discussions with the
Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers, outlined the ``framework
for getting to a dialogue'' and suggested a meeting in Washington.
   She said the two governments had not yet responded to the idea
of a meeting.
   ``The secretary is working with the government of Israel and the
government of Egypt, trying to produce a framework that would meet
Israel's and Egypt's basic concerns about beginning a dialogue
between Israelis and Palestinians,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The Israeli officials said Baker's proposal focuses on working
out an agenda for the talks in Cairo, and reaching agreement on the
difficult issue of who will represent the Palestinians.
   The U.S. initiative came after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc voted down a proposal in the inner Cabinet on
Friday to accept an Egyptian call for talks with Palestinians in
Cairo.
   Palestinians have criticized the decision, saying Israel is
blocking the peace process.
   Baker first outlined his ideas to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid in telephone calls
beginning Friday, after which they were presented in writing by
U.S. Ambassador William Brown, the Israeli officials said.
   As part of the consultations on the Baker proposal, Israel's
ambassador in Cairo, Shimon Shamir, met with Abdel-Meguid Tuesday
and then flew to Israel to consult with Arens.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking on Israel
Television, said Shamir and Arens were ``taking this proposal
seriously'' but would not automatically accept Baker's ideas or
even his invitation for talks in Washington.
   ``We don't have to agree to everything just for the sake of
agreement,'' he said.
   Dan Naveh, an adviser to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, told The
Associated Press there could be ``an opening'' for holding such
talks in Washington, but said no formal invitation had been offered
or decision made.
   Another government official said Israel accepted the idea of
talks with Palestinians, but wanted the right to veto proposed
Palestinian negotiators. He said the problem with Egypt's proposal
had been its indirect effort to involve the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``We can't sit for dialogue with a delegation that gets its
authority from the PLO or is part of the PLO,'' said the official.
   Israel officially views the PLO as a terrorist organization and
refuses to deal with it.
   The government official also said Israel would not agree to an
open-ended agenda, which was demanded by the Palestinians. He said
talks should be limited to implementing Israel's plan, set forth in
May, to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Cairo, a Foreign Ministry source said Egypt is studying
Baker's proposal. He spoke on condition of anonymity and did not
elaborate.
   Earlier Tuesday, 30 right-wing members of the 120-seat Knesset,
Israel's parliament, warned Shamir they opposed talks with
Palestinians in Cairo and would oppose him in parliament if he went
forward with that plan.
   They expressed fears that the Baker proposal, like the Egyptian
plan before it, would drag Israel into indirect talks with the PLO.
   Michael Eytan, a Likud member, described the Baker proposal on
Israel radio as ``a new initiative to bring the PLO into the game.''
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the left-leaning Labor Party
said his party would accept the U.S. proposal and warned that the
ruling coalition could dissolve if the idea was rejected.
   ``If Baker's proposal is rejected by Likud, I think the basis
for this government will not exist,'' he said. ``Without it, there
is no justification to go on with a deadlocked government.''

   The presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia,
where the illegal cocaine trade has its roots, invited President
Bush on Tuesday to attend a drug summit within 90 days. He accepted
immediately.
   In a brief communique at the end of a five-hour meeting on a
common anti-drug strategy, the leaders said European leaders also
should take part in the summit, to be held in Latin America. They
pledged to continue ``all-out war'' on drug trafficking.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``The
president will go.'' He said 90 days was ``within the time frame we
have been considering. It's reasonable.''
   In their communique, Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Virgilio
Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia said both the
production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed.
   The statement appeared to reflect Latin American concern over
Bush's emphasis on police and military actions against the trade.
   Garcia, Barco and Paz suggested details of the summit be worked
out at a meeting Nov. 20 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, of lower-level
officials.
   Fitzwater said the United States had no objection to
participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in
the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: ``I'm
sure that's fine with us.''
   Garcia has been promoting inclusion of European nations as
active participants in a war against the cocaine traffic. If the
United States is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine over its
borders, he says, smugglers will shift their focus to Europe.
   The Peruvian president read the communique to hundreds of
reporters gathered in Ica for the closed-door summit, but did not
answer questions.
   A battalion of 300 soldiers guarded the Las Dunas Hotel, site of
the meeting, and 3,000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this
desert city of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of Lima.
   Heavy security was ordered in case of attacks by the Shining
Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that has fought Peruvian governments
since 1980 and works with traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga
Valley, source of more than 60 percent of the world's coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine.
   A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, a northern city
where five Latin American foreign ministers were meeting to prepare
the agenda for a summit of the Group of Eight countries that begins
Wednesday in Ica.
   It went off at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging
the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed
responsibility.
   Ica suffered two brief blackouts Tuesday morning, but officials
said technical problems caused them, not sabotage.
   Peru, Colombia and Bolivia have said military-style repression
of the drug trade should be accompanied by more U.S. economic aid
to provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds
of thousands of peasants who grow coca.
   Barco began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons Aug. 19 and
has received $65 million worth of U.S. military aid to help in the
effort.
   Garcia has been especially vocal on what he considers the
limitations of the Bush plan, which includes $261 million for the
three countries, mainly in the form of weapons.
   ``If Peru's Huallaga Valley produces 60 percent of the coca
leaf, how is it possible the Peruvian government is assigned $60
million when $8 billion is to be spent on the fight within the
United States?'' he asked foreign reporters last week. ``This
doesn't seem serious to me.''
   Peru and Bolivia produce more than 90 percent of the world's
coca. Colombian drug cartels turn semi-refined coca paste from the
two countries into pure cocaine and smuggle it to the United States
and Europe.
   Hundreds of thousands of peasants in Peru and Bolivia live by
growing coca. Officials of both countries say there is little hope
of eradicating the crop unless the growers have another way of
making a living.
   Colombia says it needs stable world prices for coffee, its main
legal export. Otherwise, the Colombians say, the cocaine-dependent
economy could collapse if the war against drug trafficking was
successful.
   ``It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes
very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets,'' Garcia said.
``It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed market
for the products that could substitute for coca.''
   Peru has an added worry because of support the Shining Path has
among the peasants who grow coca. The rebels protect the peasants
against a U.S.-financed coca eradication program, in return
collecting a ``tax'' of 10 to 15 percent of their earnings.
   Peruvian officials fear Shining Path ranks will expand swiftly
if the government succeeds in reducing the cocaine trade without
providing alternate sources of income to peasants.
   ``We have a double problem in the Huallaga Valley _ coca
cultivation and subversion,'' Garcia said. ``Unless coca
substitution is gradual, all we will acheive is to make poor
peasants even poorer and push them into the arms of the subversive
movement.''

   Some of the military forces involved in the
failed coup attempt in Panama have been flown by the United States
to Miami and invited to seek political asylum, the Bush
administration said Tuesday.
   The State Department said 42 Panamanians had been admitted on
humanitarian grounds. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the group included ``coup members and their families.''
   The Panamanians ``had reason to believe the Noriega regime would
seek them out for persecution, either because of alleged
involvement in the Oct. 3 coup attempt, or because of their family
relationship with the alleged coup plotters,'' the State Department
said.
   The group is believed to include Adela Bonilla Giroldi, widow of
the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi. She was accompanied by
members of her family.
   Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking coup
participant to escape capture, also was reported in the United
States.
   Fitzwater refused to identify any of the refugees, saying the
publishing of their pictures might result in their deaths.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will interview the
Panamanians on Friday, said INS spokesman Verne Jervis. ``I assume
some will ask for asylum'' while others may cite some other legal
basis for remaining in this country, he said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
Panamanians are being received by the U.S. Catholic Conference,
which provides assistance to refugees and people given asylum. U.S.
officials in Miami are debriefing them.
   Mark Franken of the U.S. Catholic Conference said from New York
that his group assured the Panamanians that their whereabouts would
not be divulged.
   ``Those that have relatives somewhere in the United States, we
will try to reunite them,'' he said. ``Those that don't, we will
try to find resettlement sites around the country. These people
came in virtually with what they have on their backs.''
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon said there had been dissension and
confusion among the coup leaders and an argument about what to do
with Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said it was clear that Giroldi
``had no intention, ever,'' of turning Noriega over to the United
States.
   However, Williams said an unnamed officer taking part in the
coup insisted that Noriega be given to the United States and argued
with Giroldi.
   Williams said the officer eventually gave up the dispute and
left the military headquarters because he feared that Noriega had
or would become aware of his opinions.
   Williams said the officer was among those who met later with
U.S. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, second in command of U.S. forces in
the area.
   Later the Pentagon issued a statement saying that ``there was no
mention to Gen. Cisneros that there had been any internal debate''
among the coup plotters.
   The spokesman said it isn't clear to what extent those claiming
to have held Noriega for several hours really had him under their
control.
   ``You have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying,
`Well, we ought to' turn Noriega over to the United States. He
doesn't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates (to the United
States) that the people holding Gen. Noriega still have no
intention of turning him over to the United States,'' Williams said.
   ``There was never a request for us to come and get him, they
never offered him to us.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that he had erred last week by saying
U.S. troops were deployed in Panama at two key points merely to
safeguard Americans and to protect the Panama Canal.
   In fact, the United States had been asked by the rebels to
station the forces to block reinforcements for Noriega.
   Fitzwater said he had not been aware of the facts when he made
his original statement. Fitzwater also had said the United States
had only third-party contact with the rebels before the coup, when,
in fact, U.S. officials were in touch directly with Giroldi.
   Fitzwater said he didn't know if President Bush had been aware
of the direct discussion with Giroldi.
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater defended the administration's handling
of the matter and the decision not to provide U.S. military force
to the rebels.
   Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void,
Fitzwater said Bush ``had plenty of information, he made the
decision that he thought was best and the decision we still think
is right. We don't have any questioning about the correctness of
that decision.''
   Fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaints
about congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularly
in Panama.
   ``We don't have any specific complaints,'' he said.
   Fitzwater also said the United States had no plan for additional
economic sanctions against Panama.
   Meanwhile, it was announced in Panama that John Bushnell, a
30-year Foreign Service veteran, would replace John Maisto as
charge d'affaires, the acting head of the U.S. embassy.
   Bushnell has served in Argentina, Colombia, Switzerland and in
the Dominican Republic during the dispatch of U.S. troops there in
1965.
   Ambassador Arthur Davis was ordered home in May.

<TEXT>
   Some opposition politicians on Tuesday
predicted political instability as a result of compromises made at
a historic Communist congress that dissolved the old party and
formed a new Socialist group.
   The four-day congress that ended Monday overwhelmingly approved
a new party line calling for ``a constitutional state based on a
multiparty system where the source of the power is the will of the
people expressed in free elections.''
   It adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a
break with the Leninist mold. But still unclear is whether the new
party will divest itself of all remnants of Communist rule, and how
fast.
   The congress elected Rezsoe Nyers, formerly Communist Party
chairman, as president of the new party. It named a 25-member
presidium, where reformers are in the majority.
   Imre Pozsgay, a key reformer on the presidium, had complaints
about the new party, Hungarian radio said Tuesday. It quoted him as
saying in an interview with a Finnish newspaper that ``too many
differences among the reformers'' exist.
   The opposition initially reacted to the new party with
skepticism, and some people privately said they were not impressed
by the change because economic problems persist.
   Speaking at a rally of about 600 people Tuesday, Nyers
acknowledged that the new party had image problems. ``Some still
feel that the Communists are incapable of democratization,'' he
conceded.
   He told reporters later that ``major changes are required for
the party to win the people's trust.''
   In his speech, Nyers said three issues divided the party: party
chapters at the workplace, the workers' militia, and the assets of
the disbanded party.
   Radical reformers demand ending party representation at the
workplace and abolishing the workers' militia, an armed unit of the
old party now likely to come under army control.
   Nyers said some delegates to the congress felt the new party
should not accept the assets of the old. But he said that would
have made the new party ``poorer than the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, the largest independent opposition party.''
   Zoltan Biro of the Democratic Forum expressed skepticism about
the political changes.
   ``I do not consider fortunate the agreement between the various
forces, although I am glad that the left wing of the party, which
does not wish to accept democracy, cannot feel at home in this
successor party,'' Biro told the Mai Nap newspaper.
   He was apparently referring to the congress' decision to reject
radical reformers' demands that diehard Marxists be shut out of the
party.
   ``The best solution would have been a clear split, with the left
wing of the party going off on its own,'' Biro was quoted as
saying. ``Judging by the composition of the presidium, such a split
should not be ruled out.''
   ``We suspect that no essential change occurred'' at the party
congress, said Tibor Vidos of the opposition Free Democrats.
   ``Despite the role of the platforms, the real decisions were
made in camera by the platform leaders. We fear that this party
will remain a source of instability in the country.''
   Zoltan Rockenbauer, a leader of the League of Young Democrats,
said he believed unity was achieved at the congress through
compromise on the part of radical reformers and could lead to ``the
new party's loss of credibility in the public view.''
   A Budapest taxi driver said: ``They can talk till they drop. All
I know is that I work 14 hours a day to feed my two kids.''
   Political observers here agree effective dismantling of
Communist control is a long-term task.
   To achieve credibility before elections to be held by next June,
the new party will have to relinquish its hold on the media,
dissolve the workers' militia, surrender its privileges and
dissolve its chapters at the workplace.
   It will have to open its books, turn its assets over to the
government and have them shared at least in part by the new
political parties.
   The Ferenc Muennich Society, a hard-line Communist group, said
it will discuss its future Wednesday.
   On Monday, the Marxist Unity Platform, another conservative
group, said the old Communist Party remained functional and urged
true Communists not to join the new one.

   Tropical storm Dan swept across
southern Luzon toward Manila with winds up to 62 mph early
Wednesday, the 16th tropical storm or typhoon to hit the
Philippines this year.
   Officials said Typhoon Angela killed 62 people and left 47
others missing when it hit northern Luzon last Friday.
   Weather forecasters said Dan was centered about 80 miles
southeast of Manila at 4 a.m. and was headed north-northwest toward
the capital at 20 mph.
   No immediate reports of casualties came in. Strong winds
uprooted trees and toppled power lines in Manila, electricity was
about 80 percent disrupted, and Philippine Airlines canceled all
morning flights from the capital.
   Government offices were closed in Manila and classes canceled at
all schools in the capital and at U.S. military installations at
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay naval base.
   The coast guard banned domestic sea traffic leaving Manila and
in the central Visayan Sea.
   Dan roared ashore at 9 p.m. Tuesday in Albay province, about 200
miles southeast of Manila. It swept across the Bicol peninsula of
southeastern Luzon and over Quezon and Laguna provinces during the
night, officials said.
   Coastal residents were warned to seek higher ground because of
the threat of flashfloods and huge waves, they added.

<TEXT>
   Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a
leading South African moderate, told members of the governing
Conservative Party on Tuesday he backs Britain's stand against
tough economic sanctions to end apartheid.
   Leaders of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches in Liverpool
called for stronger economic pressure on South Africa, however, at
a separate meeting with delegates to the party's annual four-day
conference in this seaside resort 200 miles northwest of London.
   Buthelezi praised Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's position on
South Africa, which supports mild sanctions. He said tough
sanctions would not help end apartheid, the government policy of
racial separation.
   ``Political propaganda has attempted to establish the myth that
black South Africans are pro-sanctions and support the politics of
violent confrontation inside the country,'' he said. ``Nothing
could be further from the truth.''
   Buthelezi said money from the European Economic Community was
being used to support those who favor of violence in South Africa.
He told Britain to stand firm against such support of
``revolutionary violence.''
   Catholic Archbishop Derek Worlock and Anglican Bishop David
Sheppard, who recently returned from South Africa, said at the
separate meeting that Britain is seen as South Africa's closest
ally and should step up pressure on its government.
   The churchmen spoke for the Southern Africa Coalition, made up
of 80 groups campaigning for fundamental change in Britain's policy
toward South Africa.
   The bishops said in a joint statement: ``This is clearly not the
moment to consider any easing of existing pressures.
   ``Instead, we are persuaded that further selective, effective
and targeted measures, chosen in the diplomatic, political and
economic fields, should be applied progressively. We desire most
urgently to see an end to the evils of apartheid.''

<HEAD>Launch of Soviet Module Delayed Because of Guidance Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet space officials said Tuesday that the delay
in the launch of a module for the space station Mir was prompted by
worries about its guidance and docking system.
   The official news agency Tass quoted chief cosmonaut Vladimir
Solovev as saying the module, which had been scheduled for launch
in mid-September, will instead blast off Nov. 28.
   Two modules are to be flown to Mir, and Tass did not say which
one was affected by the delay.
   One module was to carry quail eggs to be hatched in an
experiment on weightlessness as well as a ``space motorcycle'' to
be used in short trips between objects in space.
   The second module includes a telescopic camera for studying the
stars and equipment to grow vegetables and crystals for electronics.
   Solovev told Tass that some elements of the module's guidance
and docking system have proved unreliable in ground tests. He said
scientists decided to delay the launch even though the system has
worked in the past.
   The Mir station was unmanned for more than four months earlier
this year to cut down on costs and give scientists a chance to
prepare the modules. Cosmonauts Alexander S. Viktorenko and
Alexander A. Serebrov blasted off Sept. 5 for a six-month mission
aboard Mir.
   In the past year, the Soviet space program has also struggled
with other problems, including the loss of two expensive
international Mars probes.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will assume a greater
portion of paying for damage in Puerto Rico from hurricane Hugo,
contributing more than $35 million, the White House announced
Tuesday.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency guidelines call for the
federal government to pay at least 75 percent of the eligible costs
for repair of roads, bridges, utilities, parks and some non-profit
facilities, while the local government pays 25 percent.
   Under a decree by President Bush announced Tuesday, FEMA will
pay 75 percent of such costs until the total reaches $10 per
capita, or $35 million. Above that amount, the government will pay
100 percent of the costs, the White House said. Puerto Rico Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon requested the extra aid on Oct. 4.
   Bush granted a similar funding request for South Carolina.

<HEAD>Timman, Speelman Draw Sixth Game; Timman Leads 3.5-2.5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Timman of the Netherlands on Tuesday agreed to
a draw with Jon Speelman of England after 53 moves in the sixth
round of their World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal and
retained a one-point lead.
   With two games remaining, Timman leads 3.5-2.5. A win scores 1
point and a draw .5.
   ``For Speelman, time is beginning to run out,'' said Leontxo
Garcia, a Spanish chess commentator.
   Following a blunder on the 17th move, Speelman, playing white,
struggled a pawn down in an endgame for the rest of the game.
   In the other semifinal, former world champion Anatoly Karpov
took a surprise timeout against fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov to
postpone their fifth game until Thursday.
   Karpov is leading 2.5-1.5 after four games, but he has been off
form throughout the contest. His only victory came in the third
game when the heavily outranked Yusupov blundered horribly in a
favorable position.
   Following Yusupov's timeout on Sunday, the two Soviets will have
had a four-day break before resuming the second half of their duel.
   The winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game match beginning in
October 1990. The winning semi-finalists will face off in the
candidates' final next March.
   The most dramatic moment Tuesday came when Speelman pondered
over his 17th move. After 21 minutes, Speelman's move let the
Dutchman win a pawn with a simple trick.
   ``Jon sees 12-move tactics in positions like this. What's he
doing falling for a two-mover,'' said Jon Tisdall, an international
master who acts as Speelman's chief second.
   ``He wouldn't fall for this trick in a blitz game,'' he said.
   Following a series of exchanges, Timman emerged a pawn ahead in
an ending with rooks and pawns, but he was unable to create any
serious winning prospects.
   The seventh game is scheduled for Thursday with Timman playing
white.
   Neither player has so far used his one allocated timeout.
   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be
played followed, if necessary, by sudden-death tiebreakers at
increasingly high speeds.

   A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the
right of the Agency for International Development to deny financial
aid to private groups supporting abortions in foreign countries.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled against constitutional challenges filed
by three family planning organizations, two foreign and one based
in the United States, that had sued AID in 1985 challenging the
policy.
   The Reagan administration decided in 1984 that it would no
longer contribute to non-government organizations which perform or
promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.
   In 1988, U.S. District Court Judge June Green ruled that the
policy violated the constitutional right of the U.S.-based group,
DKT Memorial Fund Ltd., to associate with the foreign organizations.
   The foreign groups refused to comply with AID's abortion-related
restrictions. They are the Parivar Seva Sanstha based in New Delhi,
India, and Population Services Family Planning Programmes Ltd. of
London.
   The appeals panel reversed Green in a 2-1 decision, while
upholding other portions of her decision favorable to AID.
   ``AID essentially says DKT is just as free to associate'' with
the foreign groups ``as they ever were. They just can't do it on
our money,'' said the appeals court opinion by Judge David Sentelle.
   ``The only thing that presently prevents DKT'' and the foreign
groups ``from associating ... is the unwillingness or inability of
DKT and its prospective partners to fund the project,'' said the
opinion.
   Sentelle said that if DKT and the foreign groups are willing to
finance the project with their own money or from a source other
than U.S. foreign aid funds ``then they can undertake the project
immediately.''
   The appeals court returned the case to Green with instructions
that it be dismissed.
   In a dissent, Judge Ruth Ginsburg said AID has
``unconstitutionally deployed its puissant purse to restrain the
privately funded speech and association of domestic
non-governmental organizations engaged in family planning work
overseas.''
   AID has continued its policy while appealing Green's decision.

   Two people died and two others suffered
minor injuries Wednesday when a hot air balloon they were riding in
struck overhead power lines, police said.
   It was the third serious ballooning accident in Australia since
August.
   Police said the pilot and a woman passenger were electrocuted
when the balloon became entangled in power lines. Two other
passengers suffered slight injuries after jumping from the gondola
carrying them.
   A police spokesman said the balloon, operated by Mudgee Romance
Balloons, was only feet from the ground when a gust of wind blew it
sideways, causing the canopy to hit overhead power lines.
   The group had been on a dawn sightseeing flight near Mudgee, a
country town 140 miles northwest of Sydney.
   Thirteen people died on Aug. 13 when a hot air balloon plummeted
2,000 feet to the ground in an accident near the Australia Outback
town of Alice Springs.
   Last Saturday, six people were injured, including one seriously,
when a hot air balloon smashed into a tree after being dragged
about one mile along the ground by strong winds.

   The Supreme Court turned away free-speech
arguments Tuesday and allowed the use of a federal racketeering law
against 26 anti-abortion protesters in Philadelphia.
   The court let stand a successful lawsuit against the protesters
by the operators of an abortion clinic in that city.
   Similar lawsuits, each invoking the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), have been filed against
``pro-life'' activists in cities such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and
Brookline, Mass.
   Using the federal law lets those who win suits collect three
times whatever financial damages they prove, a feature not
available in many suits filed under state law. In the Philadelphia
case, the clinic operators were awarded about $2,600 in tripled
RICO damages.
   In a series of past rulings, the Supreme Court has permitted
broad use of the law _ allowing lawsuits by anyone whose property
or business is harmed by a ``pattern'' of illegal activities.
   The litigation strategy has proved troubling to some abortion
rights advocates, who fear that political protesters will be
labeled ``racketeers'' and held financially liable for nothing more
than expressing their views.
   For example, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Antonio
Califa recently wrote: ``The ACLU believes that civil RICO's
potential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression is
enormous.''
   But in upholding a $108,000 award against the 26 Philadelphia
protesters last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
their actions ``went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech and
protest.''
   The tripled damages under RICO formed only a small part of the
total damages. Of the $108,000, $65,000 went to attorney's fees and
more than $40,000 went to the clinic as non-RICO damages.
   The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully
entered the Northeast Women's Center in Philadelphia. According to
trial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor,
damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassed
patients.
   Tuesday's action does not preclude the nation's highest court
from granting review in some future case in which more peaceable
anti-abortion demonstrators are sued under the racketeering law.
   ``This is one battle in a long war,'' said Michael McMonagle,
one of the 26 Philadelphia protesters and executive director of the
Pro-Life Coalition of Southeast Pennsylvania.
   ``We intend to continue our efforts to non-violently save
children and mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. This
case will not deter that one bit,'' McMonagle said.
   Edmond A. Tiryak, the abortion clinic's lawyer, said the Supreme
Court action ``shows that our society will not tolerate the use of
fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on
women seeking abortion services.''
   In their appeal, the 26 protesters decried ``an unprecedented
and dangerous expansion of'' the federal law primarily aimed at
fighting organized crime. They said the law was being used to
stifle political expression.
   ``Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... Martin
Luther King was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property
and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business
policies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appeal
contended.
   ``So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheid
with the goal of changing the investment policies of a
university,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violation
should be found if no economic profit motive exists.
   Only Justice Byron R. White, who cited a split among federal
appeals courts over the for-profit requirement in RICO cases, voted
to study the Philadelphia protesters' appeal. The votes of four
justices are needed to grant such review.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to use a Missouri case to clarify when sentencing judges
may hand down extra prison time for habitual criminals.
   _Said it will decide in a Texas case what retroactive effect to
give its ruling last June that allowed states to execute mentally
retarded killers if jurors are allowed to take into account the
defendant's mental state.
   _Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine
Puerto Rico men accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargo
depot in Connecticut six years ago.
   _Set aside a $1,000 fine against an Easton, Pa., newspaper for
publishing a bookmaker's telephone conversations that were tapped
by police.
   _Agreed to referee a battle over patent rights for medical
devices, granting an appeal by Eli Lilly and Co. that seeks
reinstatement of a $26.7 million award won, and then lost, against
a competitor.

<HEAD>History Professor Receives First Tenure Bid in 19 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard University expert on
Vietnamese history said she's been offered tenure, nearly two
decades since the school made its last such appointment within the
history department.
   ``It's a milestone, and I hope it's also a precedent,''
associate professor Hue-Tam Ho Tai said in an interview Friday. ``I
hope it will be the first of many more such promotions.''
   Tai said she had been offered a lifetime post, but the school
administration had not completed contract negotiations with her.
Harvard officials said a tenure appointment would not be announced
until it becomes official.
   The last junior professors tenured in the history department
received their promotions in 1970.
   In recent years, critics have insisted the tenure system favors
established scholars over young professors from inside Harvard. The
history department, in particular, was at the center of controversy
three years ago when a pair of popular American history professors
were denied tenure.
   Last year, the department formed a committee to improve the
status of junior professors. The committee recommended such
measures as more internal promotions to make junior faculty feel
more like valued members of the department.
   Tai, 40, received her doctorate from Harvard in 1977, and
published a book in 1983 on peasant politics in Vietnam. A second
book on radical politics in Vietnam is scheduled for release soon,
she said.
   The history department voted to tenure Tai in 1987, but an
advisory committee expressed reservations because she had not
finished her second book.
   Rather than being forced to leave Harvard, Tai said she received
an extended contract so she could finish the manuscript.
   If Tai accepts the university's offer, she will be the third
tenured woman in the history department.
   Tai said Harvard's vigorous tenure system is particularly hard
on women, since female scholars often have young children and
family responsibilities.
   Women comprise about 8 percent of the tenured professors in the
faculty of arts and sciences, and 27.7 percent of the junior
faculty.

   A federal judge Tuesday night rejected a
request to block the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis and its
nuclear-powered cargo, saying ``this court will not substitute its
own judgment'' for that of space experts.
   Three environmental groups had asked that the liftoff be
scrubbed on the grounds the nuclear generators, used on 22 previous
missions, posed unacceptable risks.
   ``Countdown has already begun, and the government states that
the mission is ready for launch,'' said U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch. ``The court concludes that NASA has complied with
requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act.''
   After the judge ruled, though, the mission was postponed,
perhaps until Monday, because of a faulty engine control system. It
had been scheduled for launch on Thursday.
   The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and two other
environmental groups had sought to stop the launch on grounds that
deadly plutonium-238 would spread across the skies of central
Florida in case of an accident.
   ``It is not the function of this court to decide whether the
government's decision to go forward with the Galileo Mission is a
good one,'' he said in a written opinion. Instead, he said, he only
needed to rule whether the environmental impact statement filed by
the Natiional Aeronautics and Space Administration has enough
information ``to allow the agency to take a hard look at the issues
and make a reasoned decision.''
   Never before had a court been asked to stop a manned launch.
   Gasch said that granting a temporary restraining order requested
by the three citizens' groups would have a costly adverse effect on
the public interest _ $164 million just to maintain the Galileo
program until the next launch opportunity in 18 months.
   Long delays have already raised the cost of the Galileo mission
to $1.5 billion.
   The three groups contended NASA failed to follow environmental
rules and should be stopped from launching Atlantis because ``there
is a very high probability of an accident'' that could spread
deadly plutonium over central Florida.
   To gain momentum for its six-year trip to Jupiter, the Galileo
probe will be sent looping around Venus and twice around Earth. The
citizens groups contend the greatest danger will be when the probe
comes within 600 miles of Earth in December 1990 and within 200
miles two years later. But NASA says the chances of an accident
then are 5 in 10 million.
   The probe will carry two electrical generators, each carryign
24.7 pounds of plutonium-238. These generators produce electricity
from the heat generated by the radioactivedecay of the plutonium.
   ``An accidental plutonium release at various stages of the
mission might cause an increase in cancer rates _ although it is
disputed whether increase would be significant,'' Gasch said in his
17-page opinion. ``NASA concludes that the residual risks
associated with the Galileo Mission are two to three times less
than many of the risks associated with everyday life.''
   One of the plaintiff lawyers, Edward Lee Rogers, said after the
judge's ruling, ``We thought we had a very strong case in terms of
the violations of the National Environmental Policy Act.''
   Rogers, attorney for the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice, had had argued earlier that, ``The so-called estimates of
risk are very tenuous themselves because they (NASA) don't have
good historical data.''
   ``Columbus didn't have much experience either,'' said Gasch at
the hearing, the day after the federal holiday honoring the
discoverer of America.
   ``He wasn't going to contaminate the world,'' Rogers countered.
   The coalition, which has threatened to disrupt the launch
physically if it doesn't succeed in court, claims ``irreparable
harm'' can result if the shuttle should have a launch explosion
similar to the one that destroyed Challenger and killed its crew of
seven in 1986.
   ``There is great disagreement as to the likelihood of a
plutonium release,'' said Rogers.
   But Steven Frank, a Department of Justice lawyer arguing the
NASA case, accused the citizens groups of waiting until the 11th
hour before bringing their suit and sitting out the environmental
hearings in the past few years.
   ``Some of the scientific missions planned for Galileo would have
to be scrapped with a delay of even a few days,'' he told Judge
Gasch. NASA hopes to get a close-up view for the first time of two
asteroids, Gaspra and Ida, but has said the launch must be by
mid-October to make the rendezvous.
   NASA has sent 38 of RTGs _ for radioisotopic thermoelectric
generators _ into space on 22 missions. Some, like Galileo, had
more than one RTG.
   Three of the RTGs were involved in accidents, but only one
resulted in a release of plutonium _ by design, NASA says. Since
then, the agency contends, the RTGs have undergone a design change
and ``the most comprehensive analysis ever performed'' shows it
would prevent plutonium release even in an accident like that of
Challenger.
   Rogers argued that NASA failed to consider other times and
launch vehicles for Galileo. The opportunity for a launch to
Jupiter comes again in 1991 and in 1993. NASA said it cannot get a
single-use Titan 4 rocket from the Air Force for such a launch
until 1995 and that the plaintiffs had not shown anything would be
gained by a delay.
   The citizens groups argued that two major environmental studies
disagree on the risk involved in the Galileo launch, but government
attorney Frank said ``both reports, using different approaches,
calculate very low risks.''
   The other two groups involved are the Christic Institute and the
Foundation on Economic Trends.

   Chill, autumnal temperatures prevailed in the Atlantic Coast
states Tuesday, with record lows for the date set or tied in nine
cities, and heavy thunderstorms overnight causing flooding in
Florida.
   Asheville, N.C., reported a low of 33 degrees, breaking the
record low of 35 for the date set in 1987. Atlantic City, N.J.'s
low of 30 beat the 32-degree mark of 1979, and Hartford, Conn.'s

   Record lows were tied in Columbia, S.C., 38 (set in 1895);
Concord, N.H., 23; Greensboro, N.C., 37; Raleigh, N.C., 37;
Roanoke, Va., 32; and, Worcester, Mass., 27.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 Tuesday morning was 16 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   In Florida, overnight thunderstorms through Tuesday morning
dumped 7 inches of rain on St. Augustine between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m.,
making some downtown streets impassable. Rockledge got 6 1-3 inches.
   Predawn thunderstorms left small hail on southwestern Lower
Michigan. Thunderstorms produced small hail over northern Kentucky
at mid-morning, and half-inch hail near Bardstown, Ky., in early
afternoon.
   Rainshowers and occasional thunderstorms continued through
mid-afternoon on the Georgia coast and Florida, as well as from
southern Lower Michigan across western New York, western
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, the eastern two- thirds of
Kentucky and north central Tennessee.
   Rainshowers were scattered over the western portion of
washington state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42

   NASA on Tuesday night postponed the
launch of space shuttle Atlantis for several days because of a
faulty master control system in one of the spaceship's three main
engines.
   The flight had been scheduled for Thursday. Officials said the
launch could be rescheduled for as early as Monday, but they would
not have a definite date for a day or two.
   The delay was announced shortly after a federal judge in
Washington rejected a request by three anti-nuclear groups that the
launch be scrubbed because Atlantis will carry a plutonium-powered
planetary spacecraft bound for Jupiter. Robert Richie, a spokesman
for the Christic Institute, one of the groups, said the decision
would be appealed.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said the decision to delay the launch
came after engineers had tested the suspect master controller for
several hours and could not learn why it had given a false signal
during a check Monday night.
   Sieck said the controller was being replaced and that work was
starting immediately.
   Earlier, officials had said that a changeout would mean a delay
of about a week. But officials said the task might be accomplished
sooner and Sieck said, ``We expect to have a new launch date in the
next couple of days.''
   The countdown, which began Monday, was halted.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in Washington heard 2{ hours of
arguments before issuing his ruling.
   The anti-nuclear groups had asked that the liftoff be scrubbed
on grounds that radioactive plutonium 238 particles would spread
over east-central Florida if Atlantis exploded. The plutonium is in
two nuclear-powered generators that provide electricity for the
Galileo spacecraft bound for Jupiter.
   ``The court concludes that NASA has complied with requirements
of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' Gasch said.
   Never before had a court been asked to stop a space launch.
   Justice Department attorneys representing NASA had replied that
the $1.5 billion, six-year Galileo mission to Jupiter carried
``very low risks'' and that the two nuclear generators aboard the
probe were well shielded and similar to 38 that have flown on 22
previous space missions.
   NASA test director Mike Leinbach reported earlier Tuesday that
during overnight testing there was an erroneous reading in a
computer-operated controller in one of Atlantis' three main
engines. The device, the size of a 17-inch portable television,
controls all engine functions during liftoff.
   Subsequent tests did not reproduce the bad reading, but because
it was not thoroughly understood, officials said they might have to
replace the unit.
   ``We have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem
and that there is no chance it will re-occur in flight and put us
in jeopardy,'' said Bob Crippen, director of the Mission Management
Team which gives final clearance for launch.
   The controller has two main channels, and it is in the backup
channel that the problem occurred. The backup B channel would not
be used unless there was a failure in the A channel.
   ``The worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and
have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no
probability of that,'' Crippen said.
   The five astronauts who are to fly Atlantis on the five-day
mission received briefings Monday on the flight plan and status of
the countdown.
   The anti-nuclear groups said earlier that if they lost in court
they would attempt other means to stop the liftoff.
   ``We're going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the
court doesn't prevent the launch,'' Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of
the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the three
groups that filed suit, said.
   After hearing the judge's ruling, he said, ``On our side, we're
sad because the court didn't rule in our favor, but on the other
side, we feel that we've succeeded in bringing the issue to the
public that they are planning to put nuclear power in space. ...
We're going to go with our plan to put people on the launch pad.''
   Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough.
   ``We have patrols out in the area near the pad,'' said Gary
Wistrand, deputy director of the space center's security office.
``We've installed various types of of tactical intrusion devices.
Hopefully, if they try this tactic, we'll be able to detect and
apprehend them before they are successful in getting to the pad.''
   He also noted there are alligators and rattlesnakes in the
swamps near the launch pad that could deter intruders.

   A Panamanian newspaper executive said
Tuesday that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has stamped out freedom of
the press and put Panama through ``the darkest moment in its
history.''
   ``Liberty of expression does not exist,'' Roberto Eisenmann,
executive director of La Prensa of Panama City, told the annual
assembly of the Inter American Press Association. ``Free journalism
is incompatible with the regime of Noriega. The only hope of
restoration is with the fall of Noreiga.''
   About 450 members of the Inter American Press Association from
the United States, Canada, Latin American and the Caribbean were
meeting in Monterrey for the group's 45th general assembly. The
organization's main objective is to protect freedom of the press.
   In other remarks, the owner of the Bogota, Colombia, newspaper
El Espectador said his daily may close its Medellin office after
the slaying Tuesday of two employees by traffickers angry about its
anti-drug crusade.
   Luis Gabriel Cano also said the entire 102-year-old newspaper
may have to close eventually because of financial problems caused
by the bombing of the main offices by drug traffickers last month.
   ``I don't know if we'll be able to continue operating in the
city of Medellin under the circumstances,'' said Cano, president of
El Espectador's editorial board.
   Marta Luz Lopez, the newspaper's administrator in Medellin, was
fatally shot in the neck in her car, police there reported. Her
mother was injured in the shooting, which occurred at a traffic
light.
   An hour later, the newspaper's circulation manager, Miguel
Soler, was shot and killed near his home.
   Drug traffickers killed Cano's brother, Guillermo Cano, in 1986.
   El Espectador has been singled out by the traffickers because it
is ``frank ... and independent,'' said Cano, noticeably shaken by
Tuesday's events.
   He said the company is trying to get bank loans to cover the
estimated $2.5 million in damage caused by the bombing by drug
traffickers last month.
   The newspaper needs financing within the next 60 days, he said,
``or we'll cease to exist.''
   Cano said he would ask the journalists' organization to send a
message to the Colombian government asking that journalists receive
more protection.
   The group's press freedom committee released a resolution
``energetically condemning'' Tuesday's violence and asking the
Colombian government for ``quick action'' in capturing the
attackers. Colombian traffickers have been warring with the
government for nearly two months over a crackdown on drug lords.
   In his remarks, Eisenmann said La Prensa was shut down and its
offices remain occupied by Noriega's troops.
   He said Panorama Catolico, a Roman Catholic newsletter
circulated at Sunday Mass, is the only independent news medium
still operating within Panama.
   Jaime Padilla Beliz, owner of the newspaper El Siglo, was
recently arrested, tortured and expelled to Venezuela, Eisenmann
said.
   ``In regard to the number of national and foreign journalists
that have suffered beatings, jailing, torture, shootings and exile,
the list is long and unending,'' he said.
   Eisenmann called for ``multinational cooperation'' in dealing
with the Noriega-controlled government, which he called ``the first
narco-military regime in the world.'' He did not give details of
any plan, however.
   Noriega began his press crackdown in February 1988, when federal
grand juries in Florida indicted him on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges. He denies the charges.
   Since then, the United States and Panamanian opposition groups
have been trying to force him from power. A military coup against
him failed last week.

   State lawmakers Tuesday convened a
special session on abortion that drew thousands of chanting
demonstrators and national attention, although the Legislature's
Democratic leaders predicted no new restrictions.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez called the 3{-day session soon
after the U.S. Supreme Court in July upheld a Missouri law giving
the state more authority to regulate abortions.
   Martinez's proposals include banning public financing and use of
public resources for abortions, expanding regulations for abortion
clinics, requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women who are
at least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women
seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses.
   Both the House and Senate met for about a half-hour Tuesday and
referred numerous bills, many of them abortion-related, to
committees, which began work.
   In the first vote of the session, the Senate Health and
Rehabilitative Services Committee rejected by a 9-3 vote a
seven-day waiting period so a woman could undergo pre-abortion
counseling. The panel also rejected by the same margin a ban on use
of public funds, employees or facilities for abortions.
   The Senate Health and Rehabilitative Services Committee defeated
the first four bills Tuesday, proposals which would have pushed
viability requirements from 24 to 20 weeks, ban public resources
for abortion, create a state center to promote adoption as an
alternative to abortion, and force women to wait a week and undergo
counseling before having an abortion.
   The head of the Senate Health Care Committee, Sen. Jeanne
Malchon, predicted late Tuesday that four other bills her panel was
scheduled to debate Wednesday will also be defeated.
   The House HRS committee, meanwhile, heard testimony but planned
no action until later in the week.
   Despite widespread criticism by Democrats that the session will
accomplish nothing and may result in unconstitutional law, Martinez
repeated his view that the entire package should be considered.
   ``Having a hearing on each of these bills is important to the
people of Florida,'' Martinez said. ``All of these, I think,
deserve a good debate.''
   As uniformed police closely guarded the doors to the Senate and
House chambers, pro-choice and anti-abortion demonstrators marched
around the Capitol and chanted, putting forth their messages on
their chests, in their songs and in the air.
   The pro-choice side sang ``America the Beautiful'' and had a
banner-trailing airplane saying ``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   Anti-abortion protesters wore a T-shirt saying, ``Spoken As a
Former Fetus ... I'm Glad I'm Here.
   Tallahassee police spokesman Phil Kiracofe said two arrests were
made Tuesday.
   A 14-year-old boy was charged with a misdemeanor because of a
derogatory message on his jacket that referred to the governor, and
49-year-old Carl Carlander, a pro-choice supporter, was jailed on a
charge of aggravated battery after he allegedly struck a man in the
face with a video camera.
   Police raised their estimate of people who attended the
demonstration, from 8,000 people to between 10,000 and 11,000
people. There was plenty of jeering on both sides, but no other
reports of violence.
   Inside, Senate President Bob Crawford and House Speaker Tom
Gustafson, both Democrats, promised that both houses would give
Martinez's proposals due consideration.
   There had been talk of ending the session a few minutes after it
begins, but Crawford said that wouldn't happen.
   ``I think they'll all be considered,'' he said of the abortion
proposals. ``We will abide by the rules of the Senate and I will
enforce those rules fairly.''
   Both Democrats predicted no new restrictions on access to
abortions, especially since the state Supreme Court ruled last week
that the state's privacy law protects a woman's right to an
abortion. The court knocked down as unconstitutional a 1988
parental-consent law for Florida minors seeking abortions and
protected women's abortion rights in the first trimester.
   ``If the effort is simply to restrict the ability to choose an
abortion, that is not a generally well-received idea,'' Gustafson
said. ``The issue is can you really do anything in this area
without violating privacy over and over and over again?''
   Since his initial, more sweeping proposals, Martinez has focused
on enacting tougher health regulations on abortion clinics. Three
South Florida clinics have been closed in the last two weeks by the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative services after
inspectors found unhealthy conditions.
   Martinez repeated Tuesday that he was not backing off but
suggested that negotiations with legislators were focusing on the
new clinic rules.
   ``Right now there is a lot of conversation about everything,''
the governor said. ``Our staff is leading discussions. We've got a
full package out there. We're pushing all pieces of legislation.''
   Gustafson and Crawford said they were not convinced tougher
abortion clinic regulations were necessary, particularly since the
state successfully closed the three clinics.
   Crawford said the session could wind up as soon as Wednesday
night, depending on what bills emerge from comittees. He said most
legislators find the session difficult politically and morally and
would like to finish as soon as possible.
   Gustafson agreed, saying, ``The sense I get from my members is
that the sooner we can resolve the issues in front of us, the
better they'd like it.''

<HEAD>Son Found Guilty of Killing `B' Movie Actress Susan Cabot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of B-movie actress Susan Cabot, who
was found bludgeoned to death nearly three years ago in her
deteriorating home, was convicted Tuesday of involuntary
manslaughter in his mother's killing.
   Timothy Scott Roman, 25, was convicted in the death of Miss
Cabot, 59, who appeared in such low-budget 1950s films as ``Wasp
Woman,'' ``Machine Gun Kelly'' with Charles Bronson and
``Tomahawk'' with Rock Hudson, early in their careers.
   Roman's first attorney, Chester Smith, argued that Roman, who
was born a dwarf, sustained brain damage from experiments to boost
his growth. That first trial ended in a mistrial because Smith
became ill.
   Roman was convicted on the same day defense and prosecution
attorneys presented final arguments in a non-jury trial before
Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp.
   Defense attorney Richard Lasting said he was pleased with the
verdict because Roman originally had been charged with murder.
   Roman could receive up to four years in state prison when he is
sentenced Nov. 29 in Van Nuys Superior Court.
   Ms. Cabot's body was found Dec. 10, 1986, after Roman called
police to the dilapidated Encino home they had shared. She had been

   Hometown support for Rep. Barney Frank has
dwindled markedly since he admitted employing a male prostitute
he'd previously hired for sex, according to a survey published
Tuesday.
   Of 300 registered voters polled, 74 percent said they would have
voted for Frank before the disclosure of his relationship with
Stephen L. Gobie, but 56 percent of them said they now would vote
to return him to Congress.
   ``If congressional elections were held last week, over one-half
of Newton's voters would choose to re-elect ... Frank, but his
hometown support has slipped significantly,'' The Tab weekly
newspaper study concluded.
   Frank's district includes the Boston suburb of Newton, his
hometown.
   Sixteen percent of those polled Oct. 2 said they would not have
voted for Frank before the relationship was disclosed in August.
That number grew to 23 percent following the disclosures, the
survey said.
   Frank spokesman Douglas Cahn declined to comment Tuesday on the
survey.
   Of the poll participants, 47 percent said they would not vote
for Frank because of his admitted poor judgment in his relationship
with Gobie; 19 percent cited Frank's admission he hired a
prostitute; and 7 percent noted his sexual preference.
   But 37 percent of those questioned said the above factors would
not sway their votes, according to the poll conducted by First
Research of Boston.
   The telephone survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6
percent, questioned 132 registered Democrats, 134 Independent and
non-affiliated voters and 36 Republicans.
   A spokeswoman for the local election commission said the
breakdown for 46,582 registered voters as of April 1 was 23,109
Democrats, 18,203 Independent and non-affiliated voters and 5,270
Republicans.
   Frank, a five-term Democratic congressman and outspoken liberal
who was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1988 after disclosing his
homosexuality, sent a letter to constitutents last month
apologizing for ``some serious mistakes in judgment years ago.''
   The House ethics committee has scheduled an inquiry into Frank's
18-month relationship with Gobie, who went public in August with
his claims he ran a prostitution ring out of the congressman's
Capitol Hill apartment.
   Frank has acknowledged paying Gobie for sex and then hiring him
as a personal assistant and driver, but says he threw Gobie out in
August 1987 when he learned of the prostitution operation.

   The Senate Democratic leader accused the White
House Tuesday of trying to scuttle congressional talks aimed at
ending the partisan stalemate over a Republican-backed plan to cut
the capital gains tax.
   House and Senate leaders of both parties met for nearly two
hours but reached no agreement in their dispute, which has delayed
Senate work on a deficit-reduction bill.
   Unless the budget-cutting measure is passed by Monday, spending
cuts in many defense and domestic programs will be automatically
triggered by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The bargaining, which began last week, resumed as congressional
experts estimated the size of the spending cuts that would occur
Monday. Their non-binding estimate: $41.3 billion, out of a $1.2
trillion budget.
   The sticking point in the deficit-reduction talks has been GOP
efforts to have the Senate vote on a plan to reduce the capital
gains tax rate, which President Bush promised to fight for during
his election campaign.
   Leaders of both parties have been maneuvering for parliamentary
advantages in how that vote will occur. They have been exploring
ways to keep the capital gains cut _ along with other controversial
provisions _ from being attached to the Senate's $14 billion
deficit-reduction bill, which is considered must-pass legislation.
   Asked Tuesday if the administration would accept a stripped-down
deficit-cutting measure in exchange for a separate Senate vote on
capital gains later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``We believe the capital gains provision should be a part'' of the
bill.
   After Tuesday's meeting of congressional leaders, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Fitzwater's comments
had ``complicated'' the talks.
   ``It appears that the White House is intent on torpedoing this
discussion,'' he said.
   He added, ``The administration doesn't really care about the
deficit.''
   The House last week approved its own $11 billion
deficit-reduction bill that contained a two-year capital gains tax
cut, an extension of child-care programs, a rollback of Medicare
benefits for elderly people with serious, long-term diseases, and
other controversial provisions.
   The House provision would make the maximum capital gains tax
rate 19.6 percent for two years, instead of the current maximum of
28 percent (33 percent for some taxpayers).
   Democrats and Republicans agree that slimming down that bill _
and figuring out a way to deal with the numerous initiatives in
contains _ is such a difficult task that avoiding the Gramm-Rudman
cuts is all but impossible.
   ``You're not going to avoid'' the automatic cuts, said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``I think we're all pretty
much in agreement on that.''
   The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projected
deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 is not below $110
billion.
   The Congressional Budget Office projected Tuesday that the
shortfall will be $141.3 billion, necessitating cuts of $41.3
billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs. The
office said many domestic programs would take a 10.7 percent cut
and many defense programs would take a 15.6 percent cut. Some
programs in both areas are exempt from spending reductions under
Gramm-Rudman.
   The CBO projections are merely advisory. The White House's
Office of Management and Budget issues its binding projections
Monday. They are expected to require about $16 billion in cuts,
divided equally between defense and domestic programs.

   MGM-UA Communications Co. broke off
its $1.5 billion merger agreement with Qintex Group on Tuesday and
said it will sue the Australian media conglomerate for breach of
contract and fraud.
   MGM-UA's board of directors voted to cancel the buyout because
Qintex Australia Limited failed to deliver a $50 million letter of
credit as required last month, MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow
said in a telephone interview.
   ``We have done everything we possibly could,'' Barbakow said.
``We really wanted this deal and we did everything we possibly
could to hold it together and come up with an approach that they
could perform under. And they couldn't work it out.
   ``Obviously, we are looking at all our alternatives, which could
include a sale'' to another party, Barbakow said.
   The film and television studio, subject to an intense bidding
war that spanned almost two years, said it would bring a $50
million lawsuit against Qintex in federal court alleging breach of
contract, fraud and other damages.
   Qintex was to have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit
for $50 million by Sept. 22, one week after Qintex outbid media
mogul Rupert Murdoch for MGM-UA by $100 million.
   ``Almost every day, Qintex assured us that the letter of credit
would be immediately forthcoming. We believe it is now clear that
Qintex repeatedly misled us regarding its ability to furnish the
letter of credit,'' Barbakow said.
   Qintex Chairman Christopher C. Skase disputed Barbakow's
allegations, saying in a letter to the Brisbane Stock Exchange
dated Oct. 11 that MGM-UA had unlawfully terminated the agreement.
   Skase said in his letter that Qintex had met the terms for the
letter of credit but MGM-UA asked for ``additional letters of
credit and substantial liquidated damages.''
   Dan Saks, a spokesman retained by Qintex, said that Skase would
not elaborate on the remarks made in the letter. Qintex is an
operator of resorts and an Australian commercial TV network.
   MGM-UA's assets include a film production and marketing company,
a domestic film distribution unit, a one-third interest in a
worldwide film distribution company, an international TV
distribution concern and MGM-UA home video.
   The deal was valued at $1.5 billion. Including the MGM-UA
junk-bond debt that Qintex would have assumed, the total deal would
have cost Qintex $1.9 billion.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Tuesday welcomed the release of eight top-security political
prisoners in South Africa as ``a major step in the right
direction.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, attending the first day of the annual conference
of her governing Conservative Party, said: ``Naturally we all hope
that it will lead on to the release of Nelson Mandela and open the
way for negotiations on a new constitution for South Africa.''
   The announcement of the release, on South Africa's state
television, said discussions had been held with Mandela and he had
``confirmed again his own release is not now on the agenda.'' Among
those freed was his close friend, Walter Sisulu, 77,
secretary-general of the ANC from 1949-54.
   ``It is a major step in the right direction,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk telephoned the prime
minister in Blackpool before the official announcment was made,
aides said.
   British government sources, quoted by the domestic news agency
Press Association, said the announcment justified Mrs. Thatcher's
opposition to tough economic sanctions against South Africa. She
has favored maintaining contact with Pretoria as a means of pushing
for negotiated reforms in South Africa.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock also welcomed de
Klerk's announcement. ``If it is true _ this is great news and many
will want to give tribute to Walter Sisulu for his strength and
courage in all these years in prison.
   ``Surely now the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all
other political prisoners in South Africa cannot be delayed.''

   A single-engine sightseeing
plane made a forced landing in the Grand Canyon on Tuesday,
injuring the three people aboard, authorities said.
   Passengers Angelika Ericka Ruhland, 27, and Klaus George
Donnerbauer, 28, both of Germany were treated at the Grand Canyon
Clinic, he for a broken arm and she for a broken leg and possible
spinal injuries, said Grand Canyon National Park spokesman Chuck
Lundy.
   The pilot, Richard Boyce, 27, of Lancaster, Calif., was listed
in stable condition at Flagstaff Medical Center with multiple
broken bones, including his pelvis, jaw, ribs and ankle, said
hospital spokeswoman Laurin Bosse.
   Boyce has more than 2,000 hours of flight experience and has
worked as a pilot for Lake Powell Air Service in Page since June
1988, company spokesman Denny Paradee said.
   Paradee said it was the first accident involving injury to
passengers in the company's 15 years of operation, Paradee said.
   Park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said the tower at Grand Canyon
Airport received a distress call from the plane before it went down
in the canyon about three miles west of Phantom Ranch, in the
bottom of the canyon below Grand Canyon Village on the south rim.
   Ms. Oltrogge said the plane was found outside approved flight
corridors for the canyon. Paradee said the flight originated from
Page and was on a 1{ hour scenic tour when the incident occured.
   Ten people were killed and 11 people were injured Sept. 27 when
a Grand Canyon Airlines sightseeing plane crashed on landing near
the runway.

   An investigation is under way into the
cause of a fire in an electrical transformer and generator at the
Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant, officials said Tuesday.
   The fire was in a structure separate from the plant's reactor.
   ``It did not involve any of the nuclear portions of the plant,''
said Ken Clark, a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's regional office in Atlanta.
   He said a fire prevention specialist and an electrical engineer
would work with the Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. to try to determine
the cause.
   Company officials said the fire Monday night did not pose a
threat to the public. No one was injured.
   ``Since the fire was located on the steam side of the plant in
the turbine deck and at the transformer, it remained external to
the concrete buildings which house the nuclear systems of the
plant,'' said R.B. Richey, nuclear project manager. ``At no time
was there any danger to the public.''
   The turbine deck is about 300 feet from the reactor building.
   CP&amp;L spokeswoman Elizabeth Bean said hydrogen gas leaked when
the fire spread through lines running from one of three
transformers to a generator. She said there was a hydrogen gas
fire, but there was no explosion.
   Ms. Bean said officials don't know whether the fire started in
the generator, which uses hydrogen gas as a cooling agent, or in
the transformer.
   The fire was reported about 11:20 p.m. The fire was completely
out and the hydrogen leak was contained by 2:43 a.m. today, CP&amp;L
officials said.
   The Fuquay and Holly Springs fire departments were called to the
scene at the plant, which is located 15 miles southwest of the
Raleigh city limits.
   Because of damage to equipment, the plant was closed for a
refueling outage scheduled to begin next week, the company said.
Refueling, inspection and maintenance are expected to keep the
plant down for eight to 10 weeks.
   The nuclear plant began commercial operations in May 1987. The
$3.9 billion, 900-megawatt plant has one nuclear reactor. The plant
is 15 miles southwest of the city limits.

<HEAD>Ohio University to Receive Patent on Gene-Transfer</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY57</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio University announced Tuesday it expects
to receive a patent this week for a genetic engineering process
that has revolutionized medical and agricultrual research.
   The ``DNA microinjection process'' was developed by Thomas E.
Wagner, a molecular geneticist at the university, and Peter C.
Hoppe, a researcher at Jackson Laboratories at Bar Harbor, Maine.
   Microinjection is a microsurgical technique in which genetic
material with a new, desirable trait is injected into an embryo
shortly after fertilizaion.
   It is being used to develop genetically modified animals that
could boost agricultural production and improve medical and
pharmaceutical research and manufacturing.
   In microinjection, the developing embryo incorporates the new
gene into its genetic makeup, passing on the improved trait to
future generations of so-called ``transgenic'' animals.
   ``Transgenic animals are emerging as a fundamental tool in
medical and pharmaceutical research and product development,
chemical safety testing and in the improvement of the health and
value of livestock animals,'' said Paul Schmitt, president of
Princeton, N.J.-based DNX Inc., the only business licensed by the
univeristy to use the process.
   ``Since the patent covers a fundamental and widely used
technology, we expect to establish a broad commercial licensing
program,'' he said.
   Wagner and Hoppe assigned the patent to OU, and Wagner's
royalties will go to the OU Foundation, which supports research by
the Edison Animal Biotechnology Center in Athens. Wagner is
director of the center.
   In 1981, Wagner led a team first that used the technique to
transfer a gene for rabbit hemoglobin _ the material in red blood
cells that carries oxygen thoughout the body _ into a mouse embryo,
passing rabbit blood traits to the mouse.
   Pigs, rats, mice, goats and other animals have since been
altered using the technique.
   Wagner was first interested in the concept for boosting
agricultural production, such as by producing cows that give more
milk or animals that are disease-resistant.
   He said there is even more potential in medical research,
including development of mice and other research animals that can
develop human diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, and can be used to test medications.
   Sheep have been bio-engineered to produce milk carrying a vital
human blood clotting factor that hemophiliacs need, Wagner said.
Mice have been altered to produce milk containing TPA, a protein
prescribed for heart attack victims.
   The process works because it is natural for chromosomes, the
cell's long strands of genes, to be damaged. While the cell repairs
itself, the foreign genetic material is incorporated into
chromosomes. The altered egg is then implanted into a surrogate
mother.
   Ohio University said DNA microinjection was the technique
employed by Harvard researcher Phil Leder to develop the first
patented transgenic animal, the ``Harvard mouse.''
   Microinjection also is used in the development of improved
livestock, much of which is done by DNX.
   DNX was formed in 1984 as the Edison Center's private-sector
partner to develop commercial applications of prototype organisms
produced by OU scientists.

   Walter Sisulu and other
African National Congress leaders jailed 25 years ago with Nelson
Mandela will be freed unconditionally soon, but Mandela will remain
in prison, President F.W. de Klerk said Tuesday.
   They are among eight aging, longtime prisoners de Klerk said
would be released to ``contribute to the spirit of reconciliation
which is presently evident in our country.''
   He said Mandela, regarded by many black South Africans as their
leader, was told of the proposed releases in advance.
   Murphy Morobe, spokesman for the banned United Democratic Front
anti-apartheid alliance, was with Mandela at his home on the Victor
Verster prison farm north of Cape Town when the releases were
announced on state television.
   ``Mr. Mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight
after all his efforts to secure their release,'' Morobe said, and
quoted Mandela as saying to South Africans: ``The people are going
to be greatly endowed by the leadership who are coming out of
jail.''
   Morobe and a few other black anti-apartheid leaders were at the
Mandela house, including Albertina Sisulu, wife of Mandela's close
friend and ANC colleague, the 77-year-old Sisulu, a leading
political strategist of the banned ANC.
   Cassim Saloojee, a member of the group, read a statement from
Mandela, 71, saying ``My release is not an issue at this stage.''
Saloojee added: ``His deepest concern is that all the other
comrades be released.''
   In Blackpool, England, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed
the announcement of the releases, calling it ``a major step in the
right direction.''
   The releases had been expected as ammunition for Mrs. Thatcher
to use at the forthcoming Commonwealth summit against imposing
further economic sanctions on South Africa. The summit, in
Malaysia, begins Oct. 18.
   De Klerk acknowledged the decision was ``taken against the
background of requests and representations from various sources
over a long period.'' He said the views of moderate blacks,
including leaders of tribal homelands whom the African National
Congress rejects, had ``carried special weight.''
   On Wednesday, De Klerk is to meet in Pretoria with three of the
most prominent black South African clergymen: Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu; the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches; and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general
secretary of the South African Council of Churches.
   They have said they want to establish before the Commonwealth
conference whether de Klerk ``is serious about dismantling
apartheid and entering negotiations to bring about a truly
democratic South Africa.''
   After the release announcement was broadcast, Chikane said:
``This was one item. The greater part of the agenda has to do with
creating a climate conducive to negotiation.
   ``If we do not get a clear indication of what Mr. de Klerk is
going to do, and his aim is just to release leaders to come and
live in an apartheid society, then we will continue calling for
sanctions in this country.''
   Chikane said he understood Mandela's position ``that his release
is not the critical thing. His release without a package to end the
apartheid system would be meaningless. I understand him to be
saying his release cannot be a substitute for the freedom of the
people.''
   De Klerk said the men would be freed ``as soon as the necessary
formalities can be dealt with, which can take some time.'' A prison
official said privately the process can take from an hour to two
weeks.
   According to the president, ``all relevant factors were brought
into consideration, including the fact that most of these prisoners
had already served many, many years of their sentences and are
already advanced in years. ... A favorable climate currently exists
in which the release can take place.''
   The most prominent prisoner on the list is Sisulu, who ran
day-to-day operations of the ANC as its secretary-general in
1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign.
   He was sentenced to life in June 1964, along with Mandela and
other leaders of the ANC's internal military wing, for sabotage and
plotting the overthrow of the white goverment. Mandela already had
spent two years in prison.
   Mandela's other co-defendants to be freed are Ahmed Kathrada,
60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba,
69.
   Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who briefly took command of the ANC military
wing, Spear of the Nation, after Mandela's co-defendants were
arrested in July 1963, is to be released from a life term he
received after a separate trial in 1964.
   De Klerk's announcement also named Oscar Mpetha, an 80-year-old,
partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his
five-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release next
year.
   Mpetha, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the ANC
leader in Cape province and, during the appeal of his terrorism
sentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the United
Democratic Front.
   The judge said he did not want to send Mpetha to prison but that
the Terrorism Act, since repealed, required it.
   No information was immediately available on the eighth man,
Jafta Masemula.
   Two other co-defendants of Mandela, Dennis Goldberg and Govan
Mbeki, were freed previously.
   Goldberg, the only white convicted in the trial, was deported in
1985.
   Mbeki was released two years ago in what the government said was
a test case for the possible release of Mandela. He was banned from
speaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown,
even though the government said his release was unconditional.

   An electrician who fell 12 stories through a
glass atrium and into a basement cafeteria died in a hospital
Tuesday.
   Troy Livingston, 24, had just finished changing the neon on a
sign atop Medical Center Tower I and was gathering equipment when
the accident occurred early Monday afternoon.
   ``He backed right over the edge of the building,'' said police
Sgt. Pat Kilough.
   Livingston already had removed a safety harness and was walking
backward, gathering rope, when he stepped off the roof and
plummeted through the glass ceiling of a four-story atrium.
   As Livingston fell, he hit a 23-year-old man sitting near a
second-floor landing. The man, whose identity was not released at
his family's request, was listed in stable condition Tuesday
afternoon at St. Luke's.
   Livingston hit a table, then bounced onto the floor of the
medical office building.
   Kilough estimated Livingston's fall to the second floor at 100
feet, and said he fell another 40 feet to the basement cafeteria.
He was taken to St. Luke's Hospital next door, where he died about
3:40 p.m.

   NATO must improve the effectiveness of its
conventional weapons to counter the vastly superior number of
Warsaw Pact troops and advances in Soviet technology, according to
a Jane's reference book published Wednesday.
   Editors Ted Hooton and Ken Munson of ``Jane's Battlefield

intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe is a major step toward
greater reductions in nuclear weapons by the United States and
Soviet Union.
   But they warned that ``as important as it is to the continuing
peace process, the INF carries with it some serious concerns for
both the United States and its NATO allies.
   ``Warsaw Pact forces are already vastly superior numerically to
those of NATO, and this advantage in numbers is further enhanced by
the recent rapid growth in Soviet technology.''
   The editors said in the preface that despite the new Soviet
policies of openness and economic reform, ``the post-INF climate
must not allow complacency to override vigilance.''
   ``On the contrary, the current imbalance of conventional forces
demands nothing less of the Atlantic Alliance than a major
improvement in the battle management effectiveness of its
conventional weapons, and the key to this is constant,
round-the-clock surveillance.''
   Hooton and Munson said the dangers of inefficient or inadequate
battlefield surveillance were demonstrated all too clearly in July
when a pilotless Soviet MiG fighter plane flew halfway across
Europe before crashing in Belgium.
   The Soviets said their radar operators were distracted by a
military flight exercise and failed to notice the plane that flew
across Poland, East Germany, West Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium after the pilot ejected into the Baltic Sea.
   ``Not until the runaway was, literally, eyeballed by a
Dutch-based pair of USAF F-15 pilots, after a 21-minute air search,
did a NATO ground station become fully aware of the true
situation,'' the editors said.
   ``This time the overflight was accidental; but what if, next
time, it is not?''
   They said surveillance equipment to detect thermal heat from
soldiers and equipment, even when concealed by darkness, mist and
battlefield smoke, is being developed. However, NATO has been
unable to decide which of three such systems being developed by its
member countries it should use, they said.
   The new generation of airborne battlefield surveillance radars
will reduce the likelihood of a surprise attack on the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, but will not prevent it, the editors
added.

<HEAD>Environmental Ballot Issue Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and prominent state
Democrats on Tuesday proposed a sweeping environmental protection
initiative for the 1990 state ballot.
   The key goals are a phase-out of cancer-causing pesticides,
reducing gases and chemicals that cause the global warming, and
protecting the coast with tough water standards and oil-spill
prevention and cleanup measures.
   ``This is a moment in history when we are waking up to the
reality that we are killing ourselves,'' Attorney General John Van
de Kamp told a news conference to unveil the Environmental
Protection Initiative of 1990.
   The drafting committee included members of the California League
of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the
Sierra Club, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a
Better Environment.
   The committee also included Van de Kamp, who is running for
governor, Assemblyman Tom Hayden, and a representative of Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy's office.
   ``The point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a
decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental
action through programs for preserving a clean ocean, clean food,
clean atmosphere and a clean government,'' Hayden said.
   The group plans to begin collecting signatures next month to get
the issue on the ballot.
   The initiative would create an elected statewide office of
environmental advocate to make certain California's environmental
laws are observed.
   Among other aspects, it would create a $300 million bond program
for acquiring ancient redwood forests and to fund reforestation
efforts.
   The initiative's advocates say it would protect the state's food
supply by phasing out cancer-causing pesticides by 1996 and by
making regulatory agencies require improved chemicals by 1997.
   The initiative would protect the coastline with tough,
health-based standards for discharge of toxic pollutants into state
waters. It would also require public sewage treatment plants to
meet federal Clean Water Act standards by 2000.
   A $500 million fund for prevention and clean up of oil spills
would be established, and on that same front, the initiative would
create a spill prevention policy allowing drilling leases within
the three-mile state limit only in the event of a national energy
emergency.

   President and Mrs. Barbara Bush attended a
performance of the Joffrey Ballet at the Kennedy Center Tuesday
night that included the world premiere of a balletic salute to
vaudeville commissioned in honor of the presidency.
   The 40-member dance company based in New York and Los Angeles
displayed the versatility of its repertoire, from a classical
opening set to the music of Saint-Saens to a revival of a dance for
two called Sea Shadow to a solo performance set to the Negro
spiritual, ``Touch Me.''
   The premiere was of a piece called ``The Pantages and The Palace
Present TWO-A-DAY,'' which began with an actual scene from a
Hollywood film and then ran the gamut of vaudeville dance scenes,
from dancing girls waving pink flumes a la Sally Rand to
tap-dancing society swells to flamenco dancers to a Miss Sunny who
descended onto the stage clinging precariously to a silver
quarter-moon.
   This new Joffrey ballet was commissioned by industrialist David
H. Murdock to honor ``the office of the American presidency.''

   Communist officials met opposition leaders in
Dresden and talks were expected soon in Leipzig in the first sign
of a shift in the East German government's hard-line stance, news
reports said Tuesday.
   Prominent Lutheran official Hans Otto Furian meanwhile said in
East Berlin that the Communist Party ``must give up its grip on
total power.''
   Also in East Berlin, pro-democracy activists said at least 500
protesters arrested in Dresden were freed the past two days. The
activists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those freed
were among about 1,000 people arrested in Dresden during
demonstrations last week and over the weekend.
   The activists did not say if any of the demonstrators faced
charges. Officials in Dresden have said all demonstrators not
involved in violence will be released.
   Some Communist Party officials showed increasing signs of
willingness Tuesday to talk with pro-democracy activists. But East
German leader Erich Honecker reiterated his hard-line position.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III seemed to hold out a
carrot of U.S. economic aid Tuesday if East Germany follows the
reform path of its neighbors.
   In an interview on ``CBS Evening News,'' Baker said, ``It's time
for perestroika (reforms) to come to East Germany.''
   ``We're prepared to assist economically, improve our relations
with those countries that do move forward toward political
pluralism and to more of an open society from an economic
standpoint.
   ``We simply hope that countries like East Germany will opt for
that approach rather than moving backwards to the approach that's
failed communist regimes in the past, the approach of repression by
force.''
   Conflicting reports emerged as to whether the Lutheran Church
had taken up a dialogue with the central government or whether the
contacts remained on the local level.
   West Germany's ZDF television network, quoting high-level church
sources, said talks about the unrest ``had begun with central
offices'' in the East German government. It did not elaborate.
   ZDF said talks between local Communist leaders in Leipzig and
pro-democracy activists also are set to begin. It gave no timetable.
   Talks between Communist officials and opposition activists
already have been held in Dresden.
   Communist officials in Dresden first met with opposition leaders
on Monday. Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer said another meeting was
scheduled for next week.
   The 77-year-old Honecker has given no indication he is about to
change his hard-line ways.
   In a meeting Monday with Chinese Vice Prime Minister Yao Yilin,
Honecker repeated allegations that Western ``imperialists'' are
poised to threaten his country.
   Honecker and Yao recalled the events of June in Beijing, when
troops crushed a pro-democracy movement.
   ``In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learned
from the counterrevolutionary revolt in Beijing and the present
defamation campaign against the GDR (East Germany) and other
Socialist states,'' the East German news agency ADN said.
   Honecker's statement appeared to signal a willingness to crush
dissent, if necessary.
   Manfred Stolpe, deputy director of the Lutheran Church
Federation, earlier Tuesday denied a West German radio report that
said high-level talks had been held between church leaders and
government officials in East Berlin.
   But he said ``working groups'' did exist on several levels to
discuss the current situation. He did not elaborate.
   Christof Ziemer, superintendent of Dresden's Lutheran Church,
said topics discussed were election reforms, travel restrictions
and release of those arrested during demonstrations.
   The events in Leipzig and Dresden were the first significant
sign of any breakthrough in the country's hard-line stance,
although East Germany's state media ran lengthy commentaries
Tuesday denouncing the unrest and accusing many of the
demonstrators of having ``lengthy criminal backgrounds.''
   Hans-Juergen Sievers, a Lutheran pastor in Leipzig, said in a
West German radio interview he believed the decision by Leipzig
officials to work for dialogue ``was certainly not made alone
without discussions with others.''
   But he said it was too soon to tell whether that might signal a
change in East Berlin's course.
   Several of Leipzig's most influential party leaders signed a
declaration Monday saying they would work for a dialogue between
the government and opposition groups.
   Among the signatories was Roland Woetzel, Leipzig's Communist
Party chief and his top ideologue, Jochen Pommert.
   No violence was reported Monday night in Leipzig, when 70,000
demonstrators paraded in the country's largest single pro-democracy
protest since a 1953 uprising was put down by Soviet troops.
   East Germany's ruling Politburo also met Tuesday for the first
time since the demonstrations.
   It was the first Politburo meeting since Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged Honecker to undertake reforms during a
lengthy meeting in East Berlin on Saturday.
   At least 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months.

<HEAD>Brothers' Ordeal Helps Clarify Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 12-13, `The Disciplinary ..., to CORRECT spelling
of Stenhach.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because lawyers George and Walter Stenhach hid
a broken rifle butt in a 1982 murder case, lawyers in Pennsylvania
today have clearer guidelines for handling evidence that could hurt
their clients.
   For their trouble, the Stenhach brothers have tarnished
reputations and a wounded law practice to rehabilitate. But at
least they don't have criminal records or jail sentences.
   ``Hopefully this is the end of it, and we can get on with our
lives,'' George Stenhach said.
   The men from Coudersport spoke at a news conference Monday,
after the deadline had passed for the state Supreme Court to try to
have them disbarred.
   The Stenhachs were defending John L. Buchanan against a
first-degree murder charge in 1982 when Buchanan told them where to
find the butt of the murder weapon.
   ``If we turned it over to prosecutors, we would be accused of
ineffective counsel,'' said George Stenhach, 38. ``If we did not,
it would be withholding evidence.''
   The brothers decided that turning over the evidence would
violate their client's rights. They kept the butt in their office.
   The judge in Buchanan's trial learned about the rifle butt and
ordered the Stenhachs to surrender it, which they did. It was never
entered as evidence. Buchanan was convicted of third-degree murder.
   The Stenhachs were arrested 10 months later on charges of
conspiracy, tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. They
were convicted and each was sentenced to a year of probation and
fined $750.
   Pennsylvania Superior Court overturned the conviction in 1986,
saying the laws were too vague. The court ruled, however, that
defense attorneys must turn over physical evidence although
prosecutors may not tell the jury where the evidence came from.
   The state Supreme Court let the Superior Court ruling stand in
1987, but in April 1987 the court's Office of Disciplinary Counsel
charged the men with seven violations of the professional code.
   The Disciplinary Board dismissed the charges, saying the
Stenhachs ``have suffered greatly yet with humble dignity. We
believe that they have acted in a manner entirely consistent with
the highest standards of this profession.''
   ``Throughout the whole thing, my brother and I always had a gut
feeling, a good feeling, we would be exonerated, and that kind of
helped us through,'' said Walter Stenhach, 33.
   The dilemma the Stenhachs faced is ``one lawyers think about a
lot during law school and hope they never confront during
practice,'' said John Dingess, one of 10 lawyers from Kirkpatrick &amp;
Lockhart in Pittsburgh who donated their time to help the Stenhachs.
   The Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association, the National
Association of Criminal Defense and the Public Defenders
Association of Pennsylvania also supported the brothers.

   Anti-nuclear activists say they'll
try to invade the launch pad of the space shuttle Atlantis if a
court challenge today fails to block liftoff of the ship with its
radioactive plutonium payload.
   The countdown ticked toward a launch at 1:29 p.m. Thursday as
NASA waited for word on whether the flight can proceed and deploy
the nuclear-powered space probe Galileo.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch was to hear oral arguments
today in Washington from attorneys representing the space agency
and three citizens groups seeking to block the launch. There was no
indication when the judge might rule.
   The opponents sought a temporary restraining order because
Galileo, which Atlantis' five astronauts are to dispatch toward
Jupiter, carries two nuclear generators fueled by 49.4 pounds of
plutonium-238 dioxide.

   Consumers may soon be paying higher prices for
prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the
market and cost-conscious buyers are left with fewer low-priced
options, some industry observers say.
   Dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations
and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for Food and
Drug Administration approval.
   The scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and
result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval. Some
generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force
prices up, but others say the industry will remain competitive
enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases.
   A more immediate concern for consumers, however, is the possible
effect of the recalls.

   President Bush must ``put a line in the sand''
to head off further funding cuts for Star Wars, say the missile
defense system's hard-core backers who seek a sharper
administration view of the program's purpose.
   These Republican lawmakers _ who bristle at use of the term Star
Wars rather than the formal Strategic Defense Initiative _ say Bush
must act now as House and Senate negotiators thrash out the defense
budget for fiscal 1990.
   ``We need them to weigh in on this conference,'' Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said in an interview last week.
   ``The administration has to put a line in the sand on what is
not acceptable to them,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member
of the House Armed Services Committee. ``Unless the administration
is willing to come out and do something, it's going to continue to

   Michael Bishop was unsure about becoming a
doctor, and Harold Varmus wrote his thesis on Dickens, not DNA. But
today the pair share the Nobel Prize in medicine.
   The two microbiology researchers at the University of California
at San Francisco celebrated their award on Monday, by toasting each
other with French champagne at a news conference at the university.
Then they headed to Candlestick Park to watch the San Francisco
Giants win the National League playoff series against the Chicago
Cubs.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery of a collection of normal genes that can
cause cancer when they go awry.
   In 1976, their research showed that normal genes that apparently
control cell growth can undergo alterations that lead to the
uncontrolled growth that is cancer.

   The millions of elderly Americans moving to
new retirement homes don't arrive empty-handed, say researchers who
calculate that states like Florida and Arizona wind up billions of
dollars to the good.
   On the other hand, the departure of retirees is taking away
billions from such states as New York and Illinois.
   The movement of elderly Americans to the Sun Belt has been
widely reported in recent years, and residents of many retirement
towns have expressed a fear that the social services needed by
older residents will drain local resources.
   ``They're wrong,'' conclude Charles F. Longino Jr. of the
University of Miami and William H. Crown of Brandeis University.
``For most of the communities that receive them, retired migrants
are pure gold.''

   Sailors on the aircraft
carrier USS Forrestal worked today to cool hot spots from an
electrical fire in an elevator machinery room. Nine sailors
received minor injuries, a Navy spokesman said.
   The fire broke out about 8:30 p.m. Monday and was believed to be
mostly confined to the room, which contains machinery for an
elevator that raises aircraft to deck level.
   Cmdr. Tim Taylor said it could have traveled along cables to
other areas of the ship. ``Electrical fires can be deceiving. We
won't know the scope until they trace the cableways and find the
source,'' he said.
   Fire crews from the naval station, east of Jacksonville on the

But the flames were fought by the ship's crew.

<TEXT>
   It's said that those who forget history are
doomed to watch it on cable.
   That isn't all bad. And if you're up for a first-rate new
history series, tune in tonight to the debut of ``The Road To War.''
   Airing on the A &amp; E Network, this eight-part series, a
co-production of A &amp; E and the BBC, studies the origins of World
War II in the two decades that preceded Hitler's invasion of Poland
in September 50 years ago.
   What makes this ``Road'' different from previous series about
the war, such as the excellent ``The World at War,'' is that it
examines the social and political events leading to World War II in
each major nation involved.
   Each nation gets a separate, one-hour look. In order of
appearance, they are Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the United
States, France, Italy, and the Soviet Union, with the final chapter
entitled ``Global War,'' a summing-up of sorts.
   Another plus: As tonight's opening ``Germany'' shows, the BBC
team has gone to extraordinary lengths not only to unearth rarely
seen newsreel and Nazi propaganda footage, but also appears to have
struck new, crisp-looking prints of them and restored as much as
possible their sound tracks.
   All that gives a strange sense of immediacy when woven in with
interviews of now-elderly Germans _ military men, diplomats,
civilians, even a benign-looking former Nazi storm trooper.
   They witnessed Hitler's rise to power, many met him, and, in the
case of one Socialist member of the Reichstag in 1932-33, went to a
concentration camp because of him.
   Older viewers will find familiar the documentary's re-telling of
how Germany's sufferings after its defeat in World War I led to the
political triumphs of Hitler and the Nazi Party, then his
persecution and murder of Jews, his lust for domination and war.
   But regardless of the age of the viewer, this chapter is still a
valuable history lesson, one made striking with Nazi ``newsreel''
footage that includes:
   _ Shots of storm troopers at night burning what a Nazi narrator
calls ``un-German and immoral books.''
   _ Pictures of fleeing refugees, identified as as ``ethnic
Germans ... being driven out of Poland'' _ the scenes staged to
incite German support of Hitler's propaganda, his claim that he had
cause to invade Poland.
   There's brilliant editing, too, in ``Germany,'' particularly
then-and-now scenes of Vienna. The contrasts are made as one hears
old recordings of Hitler's frenzied speeches after his
``unification'' of Austria and Germany in 1938.
   It's also very, very eerie and unsettling to hear a
well-dressed, obviously educated, now-60ish witness of those times
in Vienna, explain in her soft, matter-of-fact way, why she and
others there supported Hitler.
   One reason, she says without apparent shame or regret, ``was all
about the Jews ...'' It gets worse as she continues, saying,
``first of all, it was their behavior, and their appearance ...
they really didn't belong to Vienna, in a way.''
   Incredible.

   HERE COMES THE JUDGE _ As expected, Cable News Network says that
Catherine Crier, a young former Texas district judge with no news
background, and veteran newsman Bernard Shaw will co-anchor its new

Monday.
   She will anchor from CNN's Atlanta headquarters, he from its

   The big networks tape-delay their newscasts for broadcast on the
West Coast because of the three-hours-later time difference there.
CNN's new show, a spokeswoman says, will be fed live nationally,
with no tape-delay showings.
   ROAD TO PEACE _ Next Monday also is when CNN starts the sixth

<HEAD>PBS Documentary Profiles FDR Aide Harry Hopkins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Hopkins had something in common with
Samuel Pierce. Both were in charge of programs to help the poor.
Both got a lot of criticism for the way they ran them.
   In the case of Pierce, former President Reagan's housing
secretary, critics have said the poor people weren't getting the
help.
   In the case of Hopkins, the trouble was that they were getting
the help, and critics of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal didn't
like it.
   Pierce's troubles have been in the news recently as
congressional investigators probe his administration of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's housing subsidy
programs.
   The story of Hopkins, the social worker who headed the Works
Progress Administration and later became Roosevelt's most trusted
wartime aide, is told tonight in a 90-minute PBS documentary airing
at 9 p.m. EDT.
   ``Hopkins kept the WPA free of scandal and became one of the
most vilified public servants in modern times,'' narrator Walter
Cronkite says.
   Businessmen said the New Deal agency undermined the morals of
workers and created boondoggles for the lazy. Hopkins said if he
deserved any criticism it was ``that I didn't do enough when I had
the chance'' to help the down and out.
   Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the
New Deal, who appears on the program, said in an interview, ``There
is a difference between having idealists in government and having
people who are there either to promote their own careers or to make
contacts so they can make more money after their government
service. Idealists have many faults, but they rarely steal.''
   Among others who reminisce about Hopkins on the documentary is
the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., a young senator in New Deal
days, who talked to the filmmakers in one of his last interviews.
   ``You never heard of Harry Hopkins trying to make any money,
getting Roosevelt to approve some project over there, getting some
fellow a contract. He wouldn't any more have asked for that than he
would have asked for the Lord to come down in person,'' says Pepper.
   Pamela Harriman, who met Hopkins when she was Winston
Churchill's daughter-in-law and Hopkins came on a wartime mission
to Britain, is interviewed on the program, for which two Harriman
family foundations provided part of the funding.
   She said the foundations took no part in planning for the
documentary, but were called on for help when the producers needed
to send three staff members to Moscow to obtain Soviet newsreel
footage.
   Hopkins had a brusque manner and a talent for getting at the
heart of things, which prompted Churchill to tell him jocularly
that the British crown was going to name him ``Lord Root of the
Matter.''
   The producers originally chose this for the title, but dropped
it in favor of the more down-to-earth: ``Harry Hopkins: At FDR's
Side.''
   ``You know, people today, the young, don't know who Harry
Hopkins is,'' Mrs. Harriman said. ``And he really was a giant, that
tiny little man, and he did a yeoman's job.''

   At a time when many corporations have loaded up
on high-cost debt in the form of junk bonds, eight large concerns
stand out from the field. Over the past decade, they have had
almost no long-term debt.
   All are successful companies, too, and their success is
recognized in the stock market by relatively high price-earnings
ratios. That is, investors are willing to pay a premium for shares
of these debt-free companies.
   The significance of low corporate debt rises whenever the
economy is thought to be facing a period of falling corporate
profits, because low-debt companies generally are in a better
position to survive.
   In contrast, high-debt companies, especially those loaded with
costly junk bonds, face greater dangers during a time of lower
corporate profits, because it takes cash to paythose high-interest
charges.
   The eight companies _ Crown Cork &amp; Seal, Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, Longs Drug Stores, Tambrands,
Tootsie Roll Industries, Weis Markets and William Wrigley Jr. _ are
the stars of a larger grouping.
   These eight emerged from a study by mathematician Gerald
Perritt, who screened New York Stock Exchange listings on one
variable: companies whose long-term debt over the past 10 years
averaged less than 5 percent of capital.
   He found only 34.
   Perritt is head of Investment Information Services, a
Chicago-based company he founded after leaving college teaching. It
publishes an array of investment information, including Blue Chip
Values, a 17-issues-a-year newsletter.
   It was for that publication, obviously conservative, that he
sought the lowest-debt companies. Perritt is hardly a purist; he
recognizes that in expanding economies a company leveraged with
debt might do very well. But among other things, he also wanted to
show that companies can succeed with low debt.
   The 34 companies have done very well and investors know it, the
proof of which is their willingness to pay a premium. The average
price-earnings ratio of the group is 17 times the previous year's
earnings, well above the norm.
   Not only is that multiple higher than most Big Board stocks, it
also applies to companies that must pay very low dividends _ about
2 percent on average late this year _ simply because they finance
growth from within.
   To his surprise, Perritt found five of the 34 _ The GAP, Longs,
H &amp; R Block, Melville, Weis _ are retailers, a category that
usually borrows heavily to finance real estate investments or
long-term leases.
   While Perritt demonstrates that growth can be obtained without
large debt, there is little mystery to the popularity of junk
bonds, temporary though that popularity might be.
   Corporate borrowers like the quick capital that junk bonds
raise. Buyers like the high returns. And, judging from the tax
code, Uncle Sam likes to lend his support to the idea.
   The latter's involvement in junk bonds is seldom noted, but it
is there, allowing issuers to lower their costs through tax
deductions. For a company paying 40 percent combined state-federal
tax, a 13 percent cost becomes 7.8 percent.
   That latter rate, observes analyst John P. Dessauer of Orleans,
Mass., is low enough to make debt bearable for the corporation. And
from the investor viewpoint, the 13 percent rate is higher than the
long-term return on stocks.
   But still, as Perritt points out, debt isn't a necessity for
corporate performance _ or for investor performance either.

<HEAD>Lane Smith Plays Richard Nixon in ABC's `The Final Days'</HEAD>

   Lane Smith almost didn't play Richard M.
Nixon in the ABC movie ``The Final Days'' because, through a
misunderstanding, he was asked to read for another role.
   Smith portrays the former president during the Watergate crisis
that led to his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. The three-hour movie,
based on the book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, will be
telecast Sunday, Oct. 29.
   Executive producer Stu Samuels had him in mind for the lead
role, but the casting people mistakenly had him read for the role
of J. Fred Buzhardt, special White House counsel for Watergate.
   ``They had looked at everybody for Nixon,'' said Smith. ``They
looked at Albert Finney in London. Everybody. Then Susie Glicksman,
a casting director who was not involved, sent my picture to Stu and
said, `Here's your Richard Nixon.' But they had me read for the
Buzhardt role, which Richard Kiley got.
   ``It got down to the wire and they still hadn't found Nixon.
Then Stu learned I'd read for Buzhardt. They called me on a Friday
to read on a Monday. I looked all over town for video tapes on
Nixon and finally found one. I knew they didn't want an imitation
of Nixon, but I knew I had to have the physical aspects.''
   Smith stood up. He pulled his pants up above his waist. ``I
noticed that he wore his pants high,'' he said. ``His jacket was
always buttoned and he often had his hand on his hip.''
   He demonstrated and suddenly he was transformed into Nixon.
``Once I had that I was able to get on to the emotions,'' he said.
   ``I saw him as a man who had suffered a great loss. I wasn't
concerned about the politics. What concerned me was: How did he get
through this dilemma? I tried to make him a human being.''
   Two clues gave Smith ``the key to the man,'' he said.
   ``I looked at his resignation speech and thought it was a little
bizarre. Woodward gave me the clue. He'd talked to people who had
been there. Richard Nixon had finally taken off his mask and showed
himself as vulnerable and suffering. And when he got down on his
knees with Henry Kissinger, I think that process restored him to
his roots. So, having those clues, I was able to portray him.''
   Nixon has protested the portrayals in ``The Final Days,'' which
tells of his last days in the White House. In a letter to sponsor
AT&amp;T, his spokesman John H. Taylor said the company should change
its slogan to ``Reach Out and Smear Someone.''
   Besides challenging the accuracy of ``The Final Days,'' Nixon
``objects strongly to being depicted by an actor without his
consent,'' said his lawyer, William E. Griffin, in a letter to
Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   ABC said it was satisified with the fairness and accuracy of the
program.
   In addition to Smith and Kiley, it stars David Ogden Stiers as
Gen. Alexander Haig, Ed Flanders as Nixon aide Leonard Garment,
Theodore Bikel as Henry Kissinger, Graham Beckel as press secretary
Ron Ziegler, James B. Sikking as Elliot Richardson, Diana Bellamy
as Nixon secretary Rose Mary Woods and Susan Brown as first lady
Pat Nixon. Hugh Whitemore wrote the screenplay, and Richard Pearce
directed.
   Smith has just completed a role in ABC's ``Challenger,'' a movie
about the explosion of the space shuttle on Jan. 28, 1986. He plays
Larry Malloy, chief engineer at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
   His latest feature film, ``Night Games,'' starring Roy Scheider,
opened recently. ``American Built,'' a movie about motorcycle
racing filmed in France, will be released soon.
   At the time ``The Final Days'' is telecast Smith will be in
Thailand for ``Air America,'' a movie about the airline operated in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War by the Central Intelligence
Agency. It stars Mel Gibson.
   ``I play a U.S. senator who's sort of an innocent abroad,'' he
said. ``He's heard a rumor that a Vietnamese general is involved in
the drug trade, but the American government is ignoring it to keep
his army in the field. He's also heard that a few Americans are
lining their pockets.''
   Smith, a native of Memphis, Tenn., studied at Carnegie Tech and
the Actors Studio in New York. On the stage he played McMurphy in
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and won the Drama Desk Award
for his role in ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''
   He's been in such movies as ``Weeds,'' ``Places in the Heart,''
``Frances,'' ``Prince of the City,'' `` Honeysuckle Rose'' and
``Red Dawn,'' and such TV movies and miniseries as ``Gideon's
Trumpet,'' ``Something About Amelia,'' ``Chiefs,'' ``If Tomorrow
Comes'' and ``Dress Gray.''
   His only series was CBS' ``Kay O'Brien'' in 1986, in which he
played a surgeon.

   One day on the set of ``On Golden Pond,'' Jane
Fonda was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair, when she
felt co-star Katharine Hepburn reach over and tug at her cheek.
   ``How do you feel about this?'' Hepburn asked, peering from
behind. ``This is your box that carries your persona. What do you
want this to be?''
   Image is what Hepburn meant. What kind of a person does a face
suggest?
   Fonda didn't have a ready answer, even though neutrality is
impossible for this self-styled crusader.
   At age 51, she's still in training. Memoirs don't interest her.
A house in Montana will have to wait _ there's too much to do. Her
outlook remains shaped by possibility, and by now her public knows
that it's never too late for a new Jane Fonda.
   ``It literally doesn't occur to people, maybe even women more
than men because women don't have as many options for change, that
you can become very, very different, and it's never too late and it
can be very profound,'' she said in a recent interview.
   ``You just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to
settle in. Anything can happen. I feel fortunate that I have this
characteristic of openness.
   ``People say, `Have you fulfilled your dreams?' I never had any
dreams. My projections of the future were maybe I'd OD at 25 and
end up lonely and self-destructive. I never had dreams, I never
expected anything, so everything was a surprise to me.''
   Relaxed Jane:
   She sat on a sofa at the Regency Hotel in jeans and blue flannel
shirt, occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table
and nibbling chocolates.
   She talked about open participation and activism. Something's
wrong? Well, let's form a committee, organize, protest. Do
something! Get involved! It starts with each of us. We can change
the world!
   No wonder a special screening in New York of her new film, ``Old
Gringo,'' was a benefit for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Foundation. Fonda and co-star Gregory Peck were there. So were the
Kennedys: Ethel, Caroline, John Jr., Kathleen, Robert Jr.
   Wealth, glamour, power and idealism: Fonda and the Kennedys.
Feasts for the tabloids.
   The latest? The drug bust of Vanessa Vadim, the daughter Fonda
had with her first husband, French filmmaker Roger Vadim. The
21-year-old Brown University student was arrested Oct. 6 with a
friend, Thomas Feegal, outside a reputed drug den in lower
Manhattan. At her arraignment, she pleaded innocent to obstructing
governmental administration, loitering for the purpose of
purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct.
   Patrician Jane:
   She was born in New York in 1937, the daughter of a highly
respected film actor, Henry, and his wife, Frances Seymour Brokaw
Fonda, a descendant of Lady Jane Seymour, a wife of King Henry
VIII. She committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told
it was a heart attack. Jane learned the truth a year later from a
gossip magazine.
   Her brother, Peter, also went into movies, leaving a testament
to the 1960s with the haunting ``Easy Rider.''
   Fonda went to private schools on both coasts and wound up
partying at Vassar College. Unsure of a career in acting, her
confidence grew in the late '50s under the guidance of Method
acting guru Lee Strasberg.
   Thespian Jane:
   There was Broadway and Hollywood in the early '60s. She had
great reviews in bad shows, but her career was going nowhere. She
escaped to France and made Vadim's ``La Ronde'' in 1964, a
vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring
Simone Signoret. She and Vadim married a year later.
   Sex Kitten Jane:
   She was dubbed ``La BB Americaine'' by the French press, a
reference to Brigitte Bardot, who was once married to Vadim. Among
Fonda's roles over the next three years: a woman who seduces her
stepson (``La Curee''), a business executive's mistress (``Any
Wednesday'') and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot
and wins (``Barbarella'').
   Hanoi Jane:
   In 1968, around the time of ``Barbarella,'' students in Paris
nearly toppled the government, and opposition at home to the
Vietnam War overflowed. At first, she defended the United States'
involvement, but soon changed her mind _ completely.
   ``I've taken many paths; I've broken all the rules,'' Fonda
said. ``I left Hollywood and went to Europe at the time when I
shouldn't have. I came back, not as an actress, but as an
activist.''
   Nearly 20 years later, her celebrated visit to North Vietnam,
when she appeared on Radio Hanoi and begged American soldiers to
stop the bombings, still isn't completely forgotten.
   Last year, a Waterbury, Conn., vet tried to circulate bumper
stickers that read, ``I'm Not Fond'a Hanoi Jane,'' while the
actress was there filming ``Stanley and Iris'' with Robert De Niro.
   Fonda apologized last year on national television to veterans
who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at
reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   And her name is still invoked by conservatives in political
campaigns: ``Do you want Jane Fonda running this country?''
   ``I'm a good scapegoat,'' she said. ``I can be painted in to an
image which causes a lot of hostility. I may not be that person but
that's irrelevant.''
   Tom and Jane:
   She divorced Vadim in 1970, and met activist Tom Hayden, a
founding member of the radical Students for a Democratic Society.
She married him three years later, and they had a son, Troy, now
16. They separated earlier this year.
   Dick and Jane:
   ``Fun With Dick and Jane'' was a 1976 satire with George Segal.
But in real life ``Dick and Jane'' meant President Nixon and the
``enemies list,'' a collection of actors, authors and activists
deemed subversive by the administration.
   Fonda was in the elite: wiretapping, harassment of friends, a
failed drug bust and agents reporting on Vanessa's kindergarten
class.
   ``Sometimes, I literally feel like somebody who walks through a
field of gunfire and doesn't get hit,'' Fonda said. ``I don't shy
away from ambushes and I don't particularly have any armor. I just
go through it and the shots miss me. It's not like I'm protecting
myself. I just live my life and I don't think about it.''

<TEXT>NEW YORK: ``... about it.''    Oscar Jane:    Politics and all,
Hollywood honored Fonda. In 1969, she earned an Academy Award nomination
for her role as a Depression-era marathon dancer in ``They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?'' Two years later, when she won the best actress Oscar as a
prostitute in ``Klute,'' she gave a surprisingly subdued acceptance speech
and snubbed the traditional Governors' Ball.    ``I have not bought in
to my celebrity,'' she said in the interview. ``I'm not a snob, I don't
just like people who are famous. My friends aren't famous. I don't live
like a Hollywood star.    ``Everybody couldn't believe my father and Katharine
Hepburn didn't know each other _ as if Hollywood is this little community
where everybody knows each other. Very often, father was quite reclusive.''
   She won the actress trophy again in 1978 for ``Coming Home.''    There
were other Oscar nominations for Hollywood's political princess: actress
in ``Julia'' (ting actress in ``On Golden Pond'' (r981).    Capitalist
Jane:    In 1977, Fonda and producer Bruce Gilbert formed Indochina Peace
Campaign, an independent company that would make ``thought-provoking and
commercial'' films. Two of their projects, ``On Golden Pond'' and ``Nine
to Five,'' each grossed over $100 million.    ``I have an instinct for
what's happening,'' Fonda said. ``I've only had one failure _ `Rollover'
was the only film that didn't work. I don't know, it's timing, timing.
`China Syndrome,' then Three Mile Island. `Nine to Five.' The National
Union of Secretaries formed right after it. `On Golden Pond,' my dad was
going to die. `Coming Home,' the first real film about vets.''    Deltoid
Jane:    In the late '70s, the onetime revolutionary empress became a
leotard liberal with her entry into the fitness market. Today, she has
eight videos on the market, and all have been in the Top 20 selling videocassettes.
   It began in 1979 with a fitness studio in Beverly Hills. Two years
later, ``Jane Fonda's Workout Book'' was in the stores with more
than a million copies in hard cover alone. The video is the biggest seller
ever, earning close to $40 million.    Did she worry that her movie career
would be forgotten?    ``In the very beginning I did, because when I started
the workout business I was not making many movies,'' she said. ``I thought
that might overtake the other. But I realized pretty quickly it wasn't
the case. And even if it did, I am pretty much someone who lives not according
to image. I do what I want.''    Whither Jane?    ``Old Gringo'' was
conceived in 1980 when Fonda met Carlos Fuentes, the celebrated Mexican
author, and saw herself for the part of schoolteacher Harriet Winslow,
an American spinster whose life is transformed during the Mexican revolution.
   Cary Grant once said that Ingrid Bergman was the only actress whose
name alone could guarantee a film's financial backing. That's changed over
the years, and Fonda was an actress who helped when she and Oscar-winner
Vanessa Redgrave starred in ``Julia,'' a critical and commercial
success.    ``There's certainly more than one woman now, but it's definitely
double-tiered, there's no question. Forty years ago, it would have been
unthinkable,'' Fonda said.    ```Old Gringo' went through a number of
administrations and the first few just humored me. Sometimes that happens
in studios. They want to keep a star happy.''    Burt Lancaster was supposed
to play the role of iconoclastic author Ambrose Bierce, but couldn't get
medical insurance for the strenuous location work. Peck stepped in.  
 ``He and my father are the two male legends I have worked with,'' Fonda
said. ``There's a kind of combination of smoothness of craft, depth of
experience, combined with the willingness to really work hard, probe deep
and not take it for granted.    ``You could expect that at a certain point
in someone's life, but not many would be ready to still do that _ turn
themselves inside out. It's very painful; it's risky. My dad did it in
`Golden Pond.' Peck did it here.''    And what's next for the ever-changing
Jane? ``Stanley and Iris'' is due for release later this year. Fonda is
also considering an American remake of the popular Spanish comedy, ``Women
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.''    And the Kennedys pop up once
again. Fonda has the rights to Neil Sheehan's Pulitzer Prize-winning book
on Vietnam, ``A Bright Shining Lie,'' a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Book Award.    All that money and eight years of Ronald Reagan
have softened Fonda just a little. She's no subversive, but don't expect
a book called ``Second Thoughts.'' Neo-liberals don't appeal to her. Causes
never run out. Retirement is doubtful: After more than nine lives in the
public eye, she has no interest in landing gently on her feet.    ``I
am in the streets, in theaters, in restaurants, in grocery stores. I run
in the park. I run in streets. I talk to people. I take buses. I won't
have it any other way,'' she said.    ``Could I give it up some day for
life on the farm? Yeah, absolutely. But I wouldn't retire, I'd probably
organize the neighborhood.''

   Striking Boeing Co. machinists met with 25 other

   Federal HUD officials approved $35 million in
loans on the last day of fiscal 1988 in an apparent rush to spend
the money before it was transferred to another program, according
to auditors and agency documents.
   Most of the Section 312 multifamily housing loans were approved
despite incomplete applications or processing, according to
auditors who alerted the department's general counsel to the
questionable loans. The auditors were told the government was
legally bound to fund nearly all of them.

   A nationwide vote of pilots could be the
proverbial last straw for Eastern Airlines' pilots, who have
entered their eighth month of a bitter strike.
   The Air Line Pilots Association ballot on continuing strike
payments to the Eastern pilots, if negative, would withdraw
financial support from the beleaguered strikers and force them to
pull down their picket lines after numerous setbacks in their fight
against Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo. The votes were to be counted
today.

   Charity began at home for Wal-Mart stores
founder Sam Walton, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his $9 billion fortune with
his four children.
   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge, with an estimated net
worth of $5.2 billion, climbed into first place on Forbes' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of $672 million last year, more than the gross national
product of Lesotho, Forbes said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, Yale educated 22 of the richest,
Harvard 17 and the University of Pennsylvania 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of $895
million, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of $854
million.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from last year, a 22 percent
increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4 percent
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost
of which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion.
   The list, released Monday, appears in the Oct. 23 issue of
Forbes and is based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8.
   At the pinnacle is Kluge, 75, of Charlottesville, Va., whose
holdings rose an estimated $2 billion from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, Forbes said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   Walton, 71, of Bentonville, Ark., who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his Wal-Mart and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from $6.7 bilion, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at $1.8 billion.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor Warren Buffett,
59, of Omaha, Neb., the head of Berkshire Hathaway, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to $4.2 billion. Behind him is
Sumner M. Redstone, head of moviehouse operator National Amusements
Inc. and TV-cable giant Viacom, with $2.88 billion.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to $275 million from $225 million.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ Japan is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to Forbes. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher Kenneth Roy
Thompson. Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, is worth about $15 billion, making him the
richest, Forbes said.
   Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list,
including Laurence and Robert Tisch of Loews Corp. at $1.36 billion
apiece, entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian at $1.29 billion,
indicted junk bond financier Michael Milken at $1.27 billion and
Trans World Airlines Inc. boss Carl Icahn at $1.2 billion.
   Donald Trump also is among the individual standouts, adding $700
million to his empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a $1.7
billion total.
   For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire
is 33-year-old William Gates III at $1.25 billion. Gates dropped
out of Harvard to found Microsoft, a computer software company, in
1972.
   St. Louis beer and baseball magnate August Anheuser Busch Jr.,
who died Sept. 29 at age 90, is included on the list with $1.5
billion. Forbes said it compiled its profiles before he died.
   The youngest person on the list is Caroline Marie Getty, 32,
daughter of the late George Getty, with her $330 million
inheritance. The oldest remained 94-year-old Mansfield Freeman of
Greensboro, Vt., whose $360 million worth includes a stake in
insurer American International Group.
   Among the losers were real estate investor and builder Fred
Trammell Crow, whose net worth, Forbes estimated, sank to $300
million from $775 million, thanks to softness in commercial real
estate. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione slipped into something
less comfortable and dropped off the list.
   About 20 percent, or 82, of those listed live in or near New
York City; Los Angeles is second with 32 and San Francisco third at
19. Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major
league sports franchise.
   Publisher Malcolm Forbes included his own biographical data and
outside reported estimates of his net worth but refused, as usual,
to divulge his wealth. Forbes' sketch was included in the under
$500 million category. ``I'm solvent,'' he said.

   Forbes magazine says its estimates of the net
worth of what it considers the 400 wealthiest Americans are
``deliberately conservative.''
   The magazine said its basic principle in compiling the estimates
was to ``think in terms of how much a prudent buyer ... might be
willing to pay for a person's net assets.''
   Among the factors used in compiling the estimates, which Forbes
released Monday:
   _Blocks of publicly traded stock were priced at the market close
Sept. 8.
   _Privately held companies were valued according to estimated
revenues and earnings and to prevailing price-earnings ratios for
publicly traded companies in similar businesses.
   _If earnings and cash flow weren't known, the magazine said, it
adopted valuations typically used in particular industries.
   _For trusts and other inter-family arrangements, Forbes said it
worked on a case-by-case basis ``applying common sense.''
   ``The fortunes of the very rich are, of course, very difficult
to calculate,'' Forbes said. ``Often it isn't even clear exactly
who owns a great fortune.''

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans paid an unusual amount of
attention to Alaska in the past year, tuning in to news ranging
from the rescue of stranded whales to the cleanup of the nation's
largest oil spill.
   Heidi Kuhn wants to hold their attention.
   The newswoman-entrepreneur owns Alaskan Newslink, a Juneau-based
television news service that has provided reports from Alaska to
stations across the country since last spring.
   Kuhn came up with the idea almost by accident.
   Last April she met a California news producer and reporter in
Juneau. They noted how much interest there was in Alaska news, how
expensive it was to send a TV crew here and how there was no
inexpensive alternative.
   ``You hear of businesses getting started on cocktail napkins.
That's what happened,'' she said.
   Just days before, Kuhn had been on vacation out of state when
the Exxon oil spill occurred. She recalled how a television news
report made it sound as if Alaska's entire coastline was threatened
by oil.
   ``I don't think they had any perception of how large the state
of Alaska was,'' she said. ``I realized there was a need in the
market for immediate news access to Alaska from the perspective of
an Alaskan reporter.''
   Her first national story had nothing to do with oil. It was a
feature on Juneau's Fourth of July celebration.
   What makes fireworks in Juneau so special? In July it doesn't
get dark enough to have a good fireworks show until about midnight,
so the city holds its annual display in the early morning of July 4.
   ``I picked up the phone and called `Good Morning America,''' she
recalled. ``I told them I can offer you video of the first town in
the country where fireworks have occurred.''
   They bought it, and ABC viewers across the country had fireworks
with their breakfast. Later that day, Juneau's fireworks were shown
on the ``CBS Evening News.'' The Alaskan Newslink had hit the big
time.
   Last month, when Exxon completed its summer oil-spill cleanup,
Kuhn was one of a small army of ``stringers,'' as free-lance
reporters and photographers are known, covering the story in
Valdez. She found a free-lance TV cameraman and did reports for
several big-city stations, including ones in New York and San
Francisco, paying a local public TV station to use their satellite
uplink equipment.
   ``I produced, wrote and edited my own piece. I did my own
reporting and a personalized standup,'' she said. ``I also got in
the truck and drove up to the top of the hill and satellited it all
off.''
   In two days she earned about $2,000 profit.
   Not bad for a 31-year-old mother of three whose previous news
experience was a stint as a weather reporter at Juneau's KJUD-TV.
Her extensive business and marketing experience has helped _ she
formerly was West Coast sales manager for American Express Co. _
and she said she's learned a lot about news by seeking advice from
professionals.
   One of those professionals is in her own family. Her uncle, John
B. Sias, is president of the ABC Television Network Group, part of
Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   In addition to selling her own reports, Kuhn has a contract with
Gov. Steve Cowper's office to notify news directors in the Lower 48
when the state's news reports are available via satellite. Cowper's
office has been providing free video reports on spill-related
topics, and part of Kuhn's job is to report how they've been used.
   Kuhn said she worked especially hard to make her spill reports
balanced because of her business relationship with the state.
   ``News directors are very smart,'' she said. ``The first time
you put together a public relations type of video, your business is
over.''
   Rick Little, managing editor of KPIX-TV in San Francisco, said
Kuhn has become ``a great resource'' to his station for video that
otherwise would be unavailable.
   ``She's found a real need and she's filled it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jaguar, General Motors In Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC said it is in talks with General Motors
Corp. about a possible cooperative operating agreement, setting the
stage for a tug-of-war between GM and Ford Motor Co. over the
British automaker.
   Jaguar said Monday that GM was considering buying a minority
stake in Jaguar as part of such an arrangement.
   Ford announced three weeks ago that it wanted to buy up to 15
percent of Jaguar, and left open the option of making a full bid
for the British company.
   Ford said the approach was friendly, but Jaguar called Ford's
interest unwelcome. The money-losing luxury car company maintained
that it wanted to remain independent, but it also said it might be
interested in building ties with a major auto company. It was
widely believed to be holding talks with General Motors.
   Jaguar's brief statement said: ``Jaguar and General Motors Corp.
are in discussions concerning the possibility of the two companies
entering into certain manufacturing, marketing and other commercial
joint venture arrangements. As part of these arrangements, General
Motors is considering taking a minority interest in Jaguar.''
   Jaguar declined to elaborate.
   GM spokesman John Pekarek in Detroit confirmed his company has
had discussions with Jaguar for several months regarding possible
joint manufacturing, marketing and other ventures.
   ``In this connection, GM is discussing the possibility of
acquiring a minority interest in Jaguar to assist Jaguar in
remaining an independent British owned manufacturer,'' Pekarek
said, refusing to elaborate.
   From Dearborn, Mich., Ford said the announcement by Jaguar and
GM ``does not affect our view in any way'' about the advantages in
a Ford-Jaguar association.
   ``We believe Ford is uniquely qualified to assist Jaguar because
of our long commitment to he UK, our British research, research and
development capability, our sourcing to UK suppliers, and our
continuing investment in our UK manufacturing facilities,'' the
Ford statement said.
   The announcement came after London's Stock Exchange closed.
Jaguar finished at 685 pence, or $10.82, a share, down 46 pence, or
73 cents, on active trading of 10 million shares.
   Dealers said the price fell on speculation that an alliance with
GM could discourage a hostile bid by Ford or any other auto maker
for Jaguar.
   Trading has been very heavy since Friday, when Ford, which
previously owned 1 percent of Jaguar, received U.S. regulatory
clearance to buy up to 15 percent. Ford received early clearance
from the Federal Trade Commission, which must approve major share
acquisitions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
   Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from
taking more than a 15 percent stake before the end of 1990 and give
the British government a ``golden'' share with which it may block
any bid for the formerly state-owned company. These conditions were
imposed when the British government privatized Jaguar in 1984.
   Analysts have said Jaguar needs to link up with a major car
company to provide the economies of scale necessary to remain
competitive.

<HEAD>ALPA Vote Could Be Last Straw for Eastern Pilots</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Results of vote will not be released until Wednesday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After eight months of a bitter walkout by
Eastern Airlines pilots, a nationwide vote of pilots to be counted
today could be the proverbial last straw for the striking Eastern
fliers.
   The Air Line Pilots Association ballot on continuing strike
payments to the Eastern pilots, if negative, would withdraw
financial support from the beleaguered strikers and force them to
pull down their picket lines after numerous setbacks in their fight
against Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo.
   At the same time, an upcoming Senate vote on Eastern could turn
into a disappointment for the striking pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants if their request for a blue-ribbon investigative
commission is defeated.
   The 40,000 or so ALPA members were balloted last month on
whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their wages
to their colleagues at Miami-based Eastern, which is trying to
emerge from bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier.
   Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits to
Eastern pilots averaging about $2,400 a month per flier since the
walkout began March 4. But the number of pilots paying those
special assessments has decreased as the strike has worn on _ some
have unilaterally decided to stop paying _ according to ALPA, which
represents pilots at nearly all the nation's major carriers.
   If the ALPA vote is negative, ``It would be in everyone's best
interest to go about their business and relocate to other
airlines,'' said Louis A. Marckesano, an airline analyst at the
Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   ``I think the strike basically is over,'' he said Monday.
``Neither side has won; they've just sort of mortally wounded each
other.''
   The mail-in ballots, which had to be postmarked by midnight
Sept. 25, are expected to be counted today and the results
announced Wednesday.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline would have
no comment on the matter until after the vote had been announced,
and ALPA spokesman John Mazor in Washington was unavailable Monday
because of the Columbus Day holiday.
   The striking Eastern pilots, whose ranks have dwindled to around
2,400 from 3,600 when the walkout began, remained defiant.
   ``I feel confident,'' said Skip Copeland, head of the Eastern
pilots union. Asked what might occur if the majority of ALPA
members vote to stop the payments, he replied, ``It can't happen; I
can't even give that any consideration ... . If Lorenzo were able
to beat us, there's no telling who's next.''
   Copeland said the vote likely won't be 100 percent in favor of
sustaining the benefits, but he insisted that the majority will opt
to do so. If the pilots abandoned their Eastern colleagues, ALPA's
bargaining position with all the carriers would be weakened, he
warned.
   The pilot leader cited strong support, especially from
counterparts at mega-carriers United Airlines and Northwest
Airlines.
   Also this week, the Senate could vote on a bill, supported by
the pilots, to set up a commission that would investigate the
Eastern dispute. In a cloture vote last week, the Senate decided to
cut off debate on the bill.
   But the White House and the Transportation Department have
lobbied heavily against the bill, and President Bush is likely to
veto it. In that case, if Congress couldn't muster the votes to
override his veto, the pilots could suffer another crushing blow to
morale.
   ``It would be terrible,'' Copeland said. ``We're looking to the
Congress for a fair shake.''
   In the latest setback for the pilots, Eastern received
permission last week from a federal bankruptcy judge to dip into
$75 million held in escrow and to sell a $30 million note that it
owns.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland also postponed until
Dec. 15 a hearing on the unions' request for a special trustee to
be appointed to run Eastern in place of current management, which
is controlled by parent Texas Air Corp. Consideration of the
Eastern unions' request has been put off several times by the judge.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly lower against most major
foreign currencies in early European trading today, and the British
pound continued its slide.
   Gold prices remained little changed.
   Currency dealers in Frankfurt said the dollar had drifted lower
in thin trading because of the absence of Japanese traders marking
a national holiday.
   They predicted the dollar will move higher in the next few days,
now that central bank intervention appears to have tapered off,
except for the Bank of England which is trying to shore up the
sagging pound.
   ``There's no intervention going on at the moment and it doesn't
look like there's anything else on the horizon that could bring the
dollar down,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at
Manufacturers Hanover in Frankfurt.
   ``And at the same time there's lots of commercial demand.''
   In London, the pound fell to $1.5689 from $1.5775 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8863 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6480
Swiss francs, up from 1.6457; 6.3975 French francs, down from
6.4005; 2.1288 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1310; 1,384.00 Italian
lire, unchanged; and 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749.
   Financial institutions were closed in Japan today for Sports
Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 143.30
yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $362.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $362.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $362.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $362.30, compared with $362.80 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.54 to close at a bid $363.08.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.07 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $5.09.

<HEAD>Other Unions Pledge Support as Boeing Machinist Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM COUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sixth day of the Boeing Machinists' strike
brought good news for pickets with some 25 other unions pledging
support for the walkout against the aerospace giant.
   The union had asked for help in case the strike proves to be a
long one, said Tom Baker, president of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 751.
   The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers in
Washington state.
   No contract talks were scheduled as of Monday. There have been
no talks since 57,800 Machinists walked out Oct. 4 after rejecting
a three-year Boeing Co. contract offer.
   The strike affects Boeing plants in the Seattle area, at
Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., and several other sites.
   ``This was a real upbeat meeting,'' Baker said after Monday's
one-hour session with other labor leaders. ``People are willing to
do whatever they can do monetarily. They're going to form a
hardship fund, that type of thing.''
   Other unions expressed solid support, said Larry Kenney,
president of the Washington State Labor Council.
   Boeing officials, meanwhile, said they didn't know how to
interpret the meeting and union support.
   ``I still don't think anybody at this point knows how long a
strike it will be,'' said Paul Binder, Boeing spokesman.
   Another Boeing official, Harold Carr, said the company was
waiting for more specific demands from the union before resuming
negotiations.
   Baker angrily dismissed Carr's statement.
   ``...The Boeing people who were involved in the negotiations
know what our position is. They're just playing games,'' he said.
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond left a recording on his answering
machine saying no talks were scheduled.
   In an Everett hotel north of here, recruiters from Intertec
Aviation Co. of Phoenix, Ariz., said they were deluged by hundreds
of people answering their newspaper ad for aircraft maintenance
workers. The visit was planned before the strike.
   ``When I got to town Sunday night, there were already 15 people
waiting at the hotel,'' recruiter Jack Tubert said Monday. ``We
hired 10 of the 15 people.''
   Tubert said many Boeing machinists were among those interested.
He said some of the people Intermec has hired on this trip were
strikers but he did not have exact figures.
   The two-year-old company is looking for licensed supervisors and
mechanics and must hire 100 people before Jan. 1, he said.
   In Wichita, where Boeing Military Airplanes is headquartered,
hundreds of strikers rallied early Monday before joining pickets
for a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was a similar
rally in Everett, where the 747s and 767s are built.
   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began: a 747 to
Malaysia Airlines and a 757 to Ansett Worldwide, an Australian
leasing company which will pass the plane on to Air Belgium.
   Before the strike, Boeing committed to delivering 57 jetliners
before the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record orders
have given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s.
   That backlog and the steady stream of overtime that workers have
been asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for better wages
and less overtime.
   Boeing's offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with
3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percent
of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990.
   Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per
quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved to
account for virtually all inflation.
   Boeing said a Machinist in a middle skill grade, such as an
engine mechanic, could see pay go from $34,389 this year to $43,138
in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, but
excluding $13,000 in bonuses and any overtime.
   Workers, who have seen bonuses but no increases in their base
wage for six years, say that's not enough.
   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for the
first half of 1989, and had profits of $614 million on sales of
$16.96 billion in 1988.
   The strike is the Machinists' first against Boeing since 1977
when there was a 45-day walkout.
   Industry analysts say what happens at Boeing will affect labor
talks at other aerospace plants. Talks have been extended in a
Machinists contract that expired Sunday with Lockheed Corp. in
Marietta, Ga.
   The union's contract with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's only U.S.
competitor for jetliners, expires Oct. 22.

<HEAD>Airlines Haven't Picked Up Many Abandoned Braniff Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a few airlines serving Kansas City
International Airport have stepped in to provide service lost when
Braniff Inc. cut its routes drastically almost two weeks ago.
   America West has added flights to Las Vegas, Nev., and Omaha,
Neb., while USAir has added two flights to Indianapolis.
   All three cities were eliminated from Braniff's schedule when
the bankrupt carrier decided to operate with 20 departures out of
the Kansas City airport. Braniff had 93 flights in and out of
Kansas City International daily before filing for bankruptcy
protection.
   But airlines have not responded by adding flights to Boston,
Philadelphia and at least 15 other cities where Braniff had direct
service.
   Braniff filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws in Orlando, Fla., less than two weeks
ago. About 2,800 of the company's 4,800 workers were laid off as
part of Braniff's attempt to reorganize as a small carrier.
   Additional cities that Braniff dropped as destinations from
Kansas City include Albuquerque, N.M.; Atlanta; Cleveland; Denver;
Detroit; Houston; Miami; Milwaukee; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma
City; San Antonio, Texas; St. Louis; Seattle; Tampa, Fla.; Tucson,
Ariz.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Wichita, Kan.
   Many of those cities have direct flights from Kansas City by
other airlines, but some of the other cities can only be reached by
changing planes.
   For example, there now is no direct flight out of Kansas City to
Boston, said Kathy Sudeikis, executive vice president of Overland
Park, Kan., travel agency Brennco Travel Inc.
   ``People get used to having those direct flights,'' she said.
``It just gets to be a pain when they're not available any more.''
   Given that most airlines have a limited number of aircraft
already used in other routes, it appears unlikely that the other
cities dropped by Braniff will be picked up soon by another
carrier, Ms. Sudeikis said.
   William Hill, president of Trans-Mark Travel, said carriers that
had direct flights to some of the cities eliminated by Braniff had
not experienced shortages.
   ``The other airlines have easily absorbed the demand,'' Hill
said, noting that this is an off-season for air travel.
   Hill added that Braniff's cutbacks had not had an impact on air
fares, either.
   ``It's probably too early for that,'' he said.
   Cities to which Braniff retained its service but that have been
the targets of expansion by other carriers are Los Angeles and San
Francisco. Both USAir and United Airlines have added flights to
both of those destinations since Braniff's bankruptcy.

a joint takeover bid for Ferranti International Signal PLC, a
troubled British defense electronics concern.
   In a brief announcement, British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF
confirmed they were talking with Ferranti about a possible bid or
other areas of cooperation.
   British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF didn't indicate what they
might be willing to pay for Ferranti.
   Analysts noted that a bid wasn't likely to be made at much more
than 70 pence, or $1.10 a share owing to the company's difficulties.
   Ferranti shares were down 1.5 pence at 58 pence in early
afternoon trading on London's Stock Exchange. At that price,
Ferranti's 748 million shares outstanding are worth a total of 434
million pounds, or $681 million.
   Ferranti has sought links with a major defense contractor
following the discovery last month of contract fraud involving its
U.S. subsidiary, International Signal and Control Ltd. of
Lancaster, Pa. Ferranti said the fraud would require it to write
off 185 million pounds, reducing its net asset value by almost half.
   British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF had been rumored to be
interested in assisting Ferranti, although previously both
companies had refused comment.
   Ferranti Chairman Derek Alun-Jones has said talks were being
held with a number of major defense companies about a partial or
full takeover of Ferranti. But he has cautioned that a decision on
a rescue plan for Ferranti was still weeks away.
   British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF have requested that Ferranti
allow them access to information about the company.
   British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF would be equal partners in a
bid for Ferranti, though management control would lie with British
Aerospace, the companies said.

<HEAD>Airline Plans Purchase of West German Airplanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines Inc. has purchased 33
twin-engine, turbo-prop airplanes from a West German manufacturer
amid speculation that the carrier is a takeover target.
   Sandra Allen, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Midway, said the
company has signed a letter of intent to buy the Dornier Deutsche
Aerospace 328 airplanes for $244 million. She said the airline
holds an option on an additional 40 planes, which seat 30 people
each.
   Midway started a decade ago as a discount carrier serving the
Midwest. Since then, the airline, the nation's 16th largest, has
grown from three destination cities to 51.
   Analysts say the rapid growth of the company makes it an
attractive takeover target.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. announced in August it might seek control
of the airline. The Pittsburgh-based engineering company has since
increased its stake in Midway to 9.6 percent of the carrier's
outstanding stock.
   But Midway officials say they see no cause for alarm.
   ``We consider it a normal business investment and treat it
accordingly,'' Ms. Allen said. She said Midway has not held talks
with Ampco officials.
   Ms. Allen said the airline will begin receiving the new aircraft
in April, 1993.
   The planes will replace the Dornier 228, a 19-seat airplane
Midway now uses on its feeder routes into Midway Airport, the
airline's base of operations on Chicago's Southwest Side.
   During the transition to the new aircraft, Midway will lease 12
Embraer 120 aircraft from Dornier, Ms. Allen said.
   The airline recently introduced first-class service and earlier
this year ordered 74 new jets from McDonnell-Douglas Corp., a deal
worth about $2 billion.
   Midway also recently acquired Eastern Airlines gates and routes
out of Philadelphia. Ms. Allen said Monday that Midway's
Philadelphia hub, the airline's second, will go into operation in
mid-November, with Midway planning 36 daily departures from that
city.

<TEXT>
   The central bank Tuesday raised
short-term interest rates for the fourth time in two weeks.
   Belgium's three-month treasury bill rate, considered the key
rate, was raised by a quarter of a point to 9.55 percent. The one
and two-month rates were raised to 9.55 percent each from 9.2 and
9.25 percent respectively.
   The central bank did not comment on the rate increases.
   But foreign exchange dealers said they appeared aimed at
supporting the Belgian franc, which was under pressure from the
strengthening Deutsche mark following last week's interest rate
increase in West Germany.
   West Germany's central bank raised its key lending rates 1
percent, to help stem its booming economy. That brought the
discount rate to 6 percent and the Lombard rate to 8 percent.
   The 1 percent rate hike was matched by Britain, Austria and the
Netherlands. France and Switzerland announced smaller increases.
   Analysts said the increases were part of a coordinated effort by
major industrialized nations to pressure the dollar, which lately
has defied intervention by central banks from major industrialized
nations.

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slick magazine ads will get more of
the money Chrysler Corp. spends to market its luxury Chrysler-brand
cars in 1990 than will television spots.
   The strategy differs from previous years when 60 percent of the
advertising budget went to broadcast and 40 percent to print media.
This year's split will favor print media 70 percent to 30 percent
for broadcast.
   ``We think luxury car prospects don't view as much
general-interest television as the population at large,'' Jim
Jamdasek, national advertising manager for Chrysler brand, said
Monday.
   Chrysler officials, like those of other automakers, refuse to
divulge specific amounts in advertising spending.
   Jamdasek said Chrysler will continue advertising its luxury
models on television, notably around professional football,
basketball and golf events and on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.''
   Magazines that will carry advertising for Chrysler cars include
Black Enterprise, Fortune, Golf Digest and Real Estate Today.
   Plymouth advertising, which is geared to a younger, less
affluent market, will be heavily focused on broadcast, spokeswoman
Kelly Laseki said.
   For Dodge and Jeep brands, advertising will be split on a 75-25
percent basis, with the majority going for broadcast ads.
Advertising for Eagle brand cars will be split 65 percent for
broadcast and 35 percent for print.

<HEAD>Court, in N.J. Case, Rejects Effort to Limit Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected, by a 6-3
vote, a Bush administration appeal aimed primarily at limiting tax
deductions for some real estate investors.
   The court let stand a ruling that favored investors in the
purchase of a New Jersey apartment complex.
   Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M.
Kennedy voted to hear arguments in the case, but they fell one vote
short of the four needed to grant such review.
   The case stems from the purchase in 1978 of the Summit House
garden apartment complex in West Orange, N.J., by Pleasant &amp; Summit
Associates.
   George and Sharon Prussin were among the partners in Pleasant &amp;
Summit who bought the complex for $7.76 million. All or almost all
of money came from loans to the Prussins.
   The couple claimed losses on the property, in depreciation and
other deductions, of more than $762,000 for 1978 and 1979.
   The Internal Revenue Service in 1985 disallowed the losses and
said the Prussins owed the government about $400,000.
   The IRS said the fair market value of the apartment complex was
$4.2 million at the time of the purchase, not the $7.76 million
claimed by the investors. IRS officials said the transaction was
intended to be a tax shelter, creating big deductions by inflating
the purchase price.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in at least a partial
victory for the Prussins, ruled last November 1988 the claimed
deductions should not be disallowed completely.
   The Prussins should be allowed to claim a deduction based on the
fair market value of the apartments, the appeals court said. It
ordered a trial judge to determine the 1978 fair market value.
   The government appeal said the 3rd Circuit court ruling will
``produce grave inequities in tax administration and cause a
substantial disruption in the efforts of the Internal Revenue
Service to achieve a prompt and fair disposition of a large number
of tax shelter cases, especially cases involving real estate
shelters.''
   The appeal said that at least $630 million could be at stake in
tax deficiency payments the IRS is seeking.
   The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Prussin,
88-2133.

   The 12-nation European Community hopes
to reach a new deal soon with the U.S. administration on the trade
bloc's steel shipments to the United States, an EC source said on
Tuesday.
   The source, who asked not to be named, said there was ``a big
chance things will be settled this week.''
   EC and U.S. officials are scheduled to discuss a new quota for
EC steel shipments later this week under an extension to a
five-year-old voluntary restraint agreement.
   U.S. officials were not available for comment.
   The EC has limited steel shipments to the United States since
1984 under an agreement which expired on Sept. 30.
   The United States limits steel imports from a total 29 countries
including Japan, South Korea and Brazil and EC steel-producing
nations.
   Under a new agreement, which would expire on March 31, 1992, the
EC is hoping to raise its share of the U.S. steel market to 7
percent from the current level of 6.8 percent.
   The United States wants to limit all major categories of
imported steel to 18.4 percent of the U.S. market.

<HEAD>What Senators, Regulators Said About Lincoln Savings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-S&amp;L Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from an April 10, 1987, memo written by
William Black, a savings and loan regulator in San Francisco, to
Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Black and other regulators met privately in Washington with five
U.S. senators who questioned the handling of Lincoln Savings, its
parent company American Continental Corp., and its chairman,
Charles Keating, who was a large contributor to the senators.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, responsible for
overseeing savings banks in California, Nevada and Arizona, wanted
to seize Lincoln in 1987. After Keating's complaints, supervision
was transferred to Washington. Regulators finally seized control of
Lincoln last April, after ACC filed for bankruptcy protection.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SEN. DENNIS DeCONCINI, D-Ariz.: We wanted to meet with you
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could
injure a constituent. ... They (Lincoln) have two major
disagreements with you. First, with regard to direct investment
(where the S&amp;L becomes a partner in a real estate venture). Second,
on your reappraisal. They're suing against your direct investment
regulation. ... We suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending. I know
something about the appraisal values of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. They appear to be grossly unfair. ... Lincoln is prepared to
reach a compromise value with you.
   SEN. ALAN CRANSTON, D-Calif.: (Arriving.) I'm sorry I can't join
you, but I have to be on the floor to deal with the bill. I just
want to say that I share the concerns of the other senators on this
subject. (Cranston leaves).
   SEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Ariz.: One of our jobs as elected officials
is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC is a big employer
and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special
favors for them. ... I don't want any part of our conversation to
be improper. ... I'd like to mention the appraisal issue. It seems
to me ... there's a problem. Arizona is the second fastest growing
state. Land values are skyrocketing. That has to be taken account
of in appraisals.
   SEN. JOHN GLENN, D-Ohio: ... Even the accounting firm says
you've taken an unusually adversary view toward Lincoln. To be
blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs. If things are
bad there, get to them. ...
   JAMES CIRONA, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco: This meeting is very unusual, to discuss a particular
company.
   DeCONCINI: It's very unusual for us to have a company that could
be put out of business by its regulators. ...
   RICHARD SANCHEZ, supervisory agent: Lincoln had underwriting
problems with all of their investments. ... The examiners looked at
52 real estate loans that Lincoln had made since the 1984 exam.
There were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan
files. ...
   CIRONA: These underwriting practices violate our regulatory
guidelines.
   BLACK: They are also an unsafe and unsound practice. ...
   SEN. DONALD RIEGLE, D-Mich.: Where's the smoking gun? Where are
the losses?
   DeCONCINI: What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up
their act?
   CIRONA: This is a ticking time bomb. ...
   RIEGLE: These people saved a failing thrift. ACC is reputed to
be highly competent.
   BLACK: Lincoln was not a failing thrift before ACC acquired it.
It met its net worth requirement. It had returned to profitability
before it was acquired. ...
   MICHAEL PATRIARCA, director of agency functions: I'm relatively
new to the savings and loan industry, but I've never seen any bank
or S&amp;L that's anything like this. This isn't even close. You can
ask any banker you know about these practices. They violate the law
and regulations and common sense.
   GLENN: What violates the law?
   PATRIARCA: Their direct investments violate the regulation. Then
there's the file stuffing. They took undated documents purporting
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes
more than a year after ...
   GLENN: Have you done anything about these violations of law?
   PATRIARCA: We're sending a criminal referral to the Department
of Justice. Not maybe, we're sending one. This is an
extraordinarily serious matter. ...
   DeCONCINI: The criminality surprises me. We're not interested in
discussing those issues. Our premise was that we had a viable
institution concerned that it was being over-regulated.

   While skepticism remains over Donald Trump's $7
billion bid for American Airlines, one of the company's largest
stockholders said today it has sold all its holdings in parent AMR
Corp. to cash in on the higher stock prices generated by the
billionaire's offering.
   Windsor Fund manager John B. Neff said his mutual fund sold the
last of its 425,000 shares Monday, getting $104 per share, or $44.2
million. The sale cleared out Windsor's holding in AMR, which at
its height was 4 million shares during the quarter ended July, 31,
1988.
   Overall, AMR was the second most actively traded stock on the
New York Stock Exchange Monday, inching up 87{ cents in composite
trading to close at $104.62{ as 1.2 million shares changed hands.
By late morning today, AMR had fallen $1.87{ to $102.87{ per share.
   Neff said he had begun selling last Thursday, getting $107 a
share hours after Trump's $120 offer was made public _ the stock's
highest price before slipping back.
   Trump's cash offer for the airline's 58.9 million shares has
been met with suspicion by many in the financial community who see
it as a ploy to drive up the price and enhance Trump's own holdings.
   American, the nation's largest and most profitable airline, has
had little to say about the offer beyond its initial response that
the bid would be considered ``in due course,'' although the company
said it preferred to remain independent.
   Trump said he would put up $1 billion of equity in the deal, and
believes financing is readily available for the remainder.
   However Neff, who has managed the conservative Windsor Fund for
25 years, said, ``I have a hard time taking Mr. Trump seriously.
$120's a very full price, and I don't know where the financing is
going to come from.''
   ``This isn't loose change,'' he said.
   He also questioned Trump's $1 billion equity commitment. The
developer's wealth is estimated in the latest issue of Forbes
magazine at $1.7 billion, and Neff said, ``I kind of wonder if he's
really going to bet everything on AMR. One, it's cyclical, two it's
well run to start with, three the pilots and other prima donnas are
very important on this and what if they don't go along and finally,
is Congress going to sit on its hands and see the third biggy
disappear.''
   The parent companies of Northwest Airlines recently was taken
private in a $3.65 billion buyout and the parent of United Airlines
is in the midst of a $6.75 billion employee-management takeover.
   The deals have led to increased Congressional scrutiny, and
legislation is pending that would require the federal
Transportation Secretary to approve airline takeovers.
   The Windsor Fund, based in Valley Forge, Pa., is an $8.8
billion-asset mutual fund that has consistently ranked among the
top performers of funds investing in stocks. For the past 10 years,
the fund has averaged a 20.57 return on its investments.

   At a time when many corporations have loaded up
on high-cost debt in the form of junk bonds, eight large concerns
stand out from the field. Over the past decade, they have had
almost no long-term debt.
   All are successful companies, too, and their success is
recognized in the stock market by relatively high price-earnings
ratios. Tha buttons, elegant slacks worn with chic leather boleros
combined to create a slick town-and-office wardrobe.
   But Genny was certainly not all work and no play. With her hard

   Karl Lagerfeld, the eccentric pony-tailed German who designs the
Fendi label, never travels with the pack. His new spring-summer
collection is no exception.
   Neither town nor country, the Fendi warm weather collection
presented in an elegant downtown palazzo Monday night caters to the
woman who has a wardrobe full of clothes but just can't resist
Karl's latest fling.
   Astrology is the name of Lagerfeld's new game with signs of the
zodiac appearing on the pockets of blazers, the prints of party
dresses, and on the handbags and luggage of the Fendi's famed
leather line.
   The Fendis call this new look ``personalized fashion,''
guaranteeing that the client's individual birth sign will appear on
the item.
   Lagerfeld, who designs his own prints, draws inspiration for his
demure party dresses with short petticoated skirt from the drawings
in children's picture books and the abstract black and whites of a
De Chirico painting.
   For a quieter look Fendi presented a series of sand or black
silk jersey outfits made up of a long tunic top worn over a
matching long narrow skirt or tights.
   A lover of the unconventional, Lagerfeld, who also designs for
Chanel as well as having his own label, paraded his 40 models down
a runway which wound its way through the seated guests, to the
``tune'' of a woman deep in the throes of love. The suggestive
sounds shocked some of the Fendi aficionados, used to the warm
family atmosphere that has become the trademark of the five Roman
sisters.
   What no one banked on was that a power failure would turn off
the lights and the music for several minutes.
   While Lagerfeld has happily reconciled his peripatetic
designer's life _ he is based in Paris, teaches design in Vienna,
and designs for Fendi in Rome _ the fashion crowd is eager to find
out how Milanese Gianfranco Ferre is faring since he accepted the
post of designer for the famed Dior house in Paris.
   His spring-summer ready-to-wear collection, his first Italian
production since his triumphant debut in Paris in July, was one of
the most-awaited events of the Milan fashion week.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Hit 23-Month Low On Harvest Selling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices slumped to 23-month lows
as a harvest-related sell-off continued this morning on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Grain futures were narrowly mixed.
   The early decline in the soybean market followed a steep drop on
Monday in a reaction to fine harvesting weather over the weekend.
   Dry conditions are expected to continue in the Midwest this
week, speeding the corn and soybean harvest along and keeping
pressure on prices.
   Further selling was based on indications of better-than-expected
corn and soybean yields and expectations that the Agriculture
Department will increase its harvest estimates in a crop report due
out Thursday afternoon.
   One survey of traders' expectations shows pre-report estimates
averaging 1.91 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.39 billion bushels
of corn compared with the USDA's September estimates of 1.89
billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with December at
$2.34 a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with December
at $1.40 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4\ cents lower with
November at $5.53} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .62 cent higher with October at
72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent higher
with October at 83.15 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to
.50 cent higher with October at 47.10 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent to .40 cent higher with February at 46.97
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co.'s Aerospace
operations in Syracuse began shipping products to the Navy and Air
Force today after defense department officials determined the
company had corrected serious procedural and quality control
problems.
   Defense Contract Administration Services personnel returned to
inspecting equipment ready for delivery, lifting the government
sanctions that held up more than $16 million in partial payments to
GE, said Michael R. Flannery, DCAS administrative contracting
officer in Syracuse.
   The U.S. Department of Defense had allowed only essential
products to leave GE since February, when the company was caught
violating a number of defense department regulations. The Syracuse
operation was allowed to continue limited manufacture of products.
   The company received the severe and rare sanctions because it
was found to be mixing production on contracts for both the U.S.
military and foreign governments, whose specifications were less
stringent, on the same production line.
   Flannery said the company had corrected the problem of
comingling by making the specifications and procedures required by
U.S. contracts the standard for all its production lines.
   The company also has guaranteed it will repair or replace any
product in the field that is shown to be deficient.
   GE spokeswoman Connie Grasso said the company will now attempt
to increase production to recoup time lost during the sanction
period.
   In an effort to improve the Syracuse operation, GE announced a
restructuring in September, creating separate divisions for its
radar and sonar operatons.
   Now, GE's radar division is based in Moorestown, N.J., while its
sonar and related underseas systems are built in Syracuse.
   The government-imposed sanctions affected all but 12 of
GE-Syracuse's 1,100 defense contracts.

   Both measures were part of a decree signed Monday night by

   The government hopes to attract $12 billion to $15 billion in

<HEAD>Chevron Files Suit for Permission to Send Tankers Through Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron USA and 17 other oil
companies filed suit to overturn a California Coastal Commission
decision and allow oil shipments from offshore fields through the
Santa Barbara Channel.
   The suit, filed last Friday in Santa Barbara County Superior
Court, seeks to overturn an August ruling by the commission that
blocked the shipments from the Point Arguello oil fields. The
commission's ruling blocked a temporary county permit allowing
tankers to operate between the Point Arguello project's marine
terminal near Gaviota and Chevron's refinery in El Segundo.
   ``We believe the Coastal Commission ignored numerous prior
findings made by itself and the county in previous permit
proceedings and approvals concerning our project,'' said Richard T.
Hughes, offshore district land supervisor for Chevron, which is
leading the legal fight.
   Commission officials could not be reached for comment on the
suit Tuesday. A person at the commission's main office in San
Francisco said no one with information on the action was
immediately available to discuss it.
   The head of Get Oil Out, a local citizens group opposed to
offshore oil development, criticized the move, however.
   ``I think it's a bad move on their part and won't get them
anywhere,'' said GOO President Henry Feniger.
   The consortium has invested about $2 billion in the project. Oil
officials believe the field contains about 300 million barrels of
crude.
   Permission to ship the crude is one of the last remaining
obstacles facing the project, which has yet to produce any oil.
   The League of Women Voters of Santa Barbara County and GOO
appealed the granting of the county permit to the commission,
arguing Chevron did not demonstrate that it could adequately handle
a massive oil spill like the 10 million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill
in Alaska's Prince William Sound last March.
   The opposition groups also complained that a proposed pipeline
project would not be in place before the tankers were to begin
shipments and that the company had not explored other options for
transporting the oil.
   Chevron had once agreed to build a pipeline but the proposal was
scrubbed when elected officials and communities along the route
filed legal challenges, said Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy.
   The county Board of Supervisors said it approved a permit for
the tankers last May because supervisors believed Chevron's Marine
Emergency Management Plan adequately addressed the possibility of a
disastrous spill.
   Point Arguello is about 40 miles northwest of downtown Santa
Barbara, which is about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The Santa Barbara Channel is the sea passage between the
mainland and a string of pristine islands that provide homes to
various wildlife.

<HEAD>President Says Company Had First-Qtr Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of Wang Laboratories Inc.
says the company posted another loss in the first quarter of its
fiscal year, but he says the company will become profitable after
some jobs and assets are cut.
   ``We have built up some layers of bureaucracy and processes that
probably are not essential to the ongoing conduct of our basic
business,'' company president Richard Miller said.
   The computer manufacturer posted a loss of $374.7 million for
the final quarter of the last fiscal year, leading to the
resignation of Frederick Wang, son of company founder An Wang, as
president. Miller became president Aug. 23.
   For the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, Wang should show an
operating loss in the range of $30 million to $70 million, Miller
told The Boston Globe on Monday.
   Miller said, however, he expected the company to begin showing a
profit by June 30, the end of its fiscal year.
   ``I would expect that we would have the operating earnings into
the black,'' he said.
   But Miller said the profits would not be enough to offset
earlier losses, making it necessary for Wang to cut more of its
workforce.
   The company has reduced the number of employees by 20 percent to
25,000 since Jan. 1. Miller declined to say how many more may lose
their jobs.
   He said the company plans to sell about $800 million in assets
not considered vital to its future, including real estate, credit
subsidiaries and telephone switchboard units.
   He said he hopes to sell $400 million to $500 million of the
assets within the next six months. The money will be used to reduce
debt and interest payments.
   Miller said revenues for the first quarter of this fiscal year
were about 13 percent lower than the $684 million for the first
quarter of last year. The company had a restated profit of $13.1
million that quarter.

<HEAD>Study Says Most of Nearly 3,000 New Businesses Survive After Three
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of nearly 3,000
businesses that started up three years ago have survived, a survey
released Tuesday said.
   The study by American Express Co.'s Small Business Services
division and the National Federation of Independent Business said
that 77 percent of the 2,994 fledgling businesses in its survey are
still in business after three years of operating.
   Sixty-five percent of those entrepreneurs said their level of
personal satisfaction equaled or exceeded their original
expectations, the study said.
   ``This study helps debunk the myth that most new businesses
fail,'' said Barbara Barsa, vice president at Small Business
Services.
   The study said the successful businesses had six common
characteristics: self confidence; an initial investment of at least
$50,000; emphasis on service rather than price; hard work;
full-time devotion; and product knowledge.
   Success rates varied by industry, with the manufacturing sector
having the highest survival rate, 82 percent, according to the
study. That was closely followed by construction, 79 percent;
service, 75 percent; and retailers, 73 percent, it said.

   Soybean futures prices sank to 23-month lows
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as a harvest-related sell-off
stretched into the fourth straight day.
   Corn futures also retreated under harvest pressure while wheat
and oat futures were narrowly mixed.
   The corn-and-soybean harvest is advancing rapidly under
near-perfect fieldwork conditions and analysts said the
higher-than-expected yields are hastening and extending the normal
seasonal drop in prices.
   Many traders are betting that the Agriculture Department will
revise upward its harvest projections in a crop report slated for
release after the close on Thursday.
   Last month, the USDA estimated 1989 U.S. soybean production at
1.89 billion bushels and corn production at 7.32 billion.
   But most analysts expect Thursday's numbers to be substantially
higher. One news service survey shows analysts' soybean estimates
ranging from 1.86 billion to 1.96 billion bushels and corn
estimates ranging from 7.29 billion to 7.52 billion bushels.
   At the close, soybean futures were 4\ cents to 7\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in November at $5.52{ a bushel, the
lowest close for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 11, 1987.
   Wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December
at $4.06} a bushel; corn futures were { cent to 2 cents lower with
December at $2.33\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher
with December at $1.40{ a bushel.

   International Paper Co. said Tuesday it
posted a 6.5 percent rise in its third-quarter profit due to strong
demand for paper and specialty products and acquisitions.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, International Paper's
net income totaled $214 million, or $1.91 a share, up from $201
million, or $1.74 a share, a year ago.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $2.9 billion from $2.4 billion
in the same 1988 period.
   For the first nine months of 1989, net earnings totaled $667
million, or $5.91 a share, up 28 percent from $548 million, or
$4.76 a share, during the comparable 1988 period. Revenue totaled
$8.4 billion, 20 percent higher than the $7 billion recorded for
the January-September period last year.
   John A. Georges, chairman of International Paper, the largest
U.S. producer of paper other than newsprint, said that strong
demand for bleached board resulted in a price increase in August
that contributed to third-quarter results.
   Earlier this year, International Paper acquired French paper
maker Aussedat Rey, the second largest paper producer in France.
   In September, the Purchase, N.Y., company acquired the assets of
the former Newport, R.I., division of Reichhold Chemicals, which
were added to its chemical business, Arizona Chemical. Last year,
it acquired Bergvik Kemi, a chemical manufacturer based in Europe.
   It also recently has acquired specialty wood and paper companies.

<HEAD>Earnings Rise 60 Percent in Third Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fannie Mae said Tuesday its earnings soared 60
percent in the third quarter as yields increased on its mortgage
portfolio and fee income rose.
   Fannie Mae, formally known as the Federal National Mortgage
Association, is a congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned
company that provides money for home buyers by purchasing mortgages
from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to
investors.
   For the third quarter, earnings were $211.9 million, or 80 cents
a share, on total interest income of $2.81 billion, compared with
$132.4 million, or 55 cents a share, on interest income of $2.61
billion in the same period of 1988.
   For the first nine months of the year, net income totaled $570.1
million, or $2.17 per share, an increase of 61 percent over $354
million, or $1.48 per share in the first three quarters of last
year.
   Fanie Mae President Roger Birk listed three reasons for
increased third quarter earnings:
   _An improvement in the margin on mortgages and other investments
in its portfolio to 79 basis points from 53 basis points a year ago.
   _An increase in the size of the company's investment portfolio
to an average balance of $115.9 billion from $108.9 billion a year
ago.
   _Growth in guaranty fees, earned when the company buys mortgages
and packages them into securities, to $103.6 billion from $84.4
billion a year ago.
   Birk also noted a decline in foreclosures and related losses,
which permitted the company to reduce its addition to loss reserves
from $80 million in the second quarter to $75 million in the third.

   The London International Financial Futures
Exchange said Tuesday it will introduce an electronic trading
system next month to extend its trading hours in hopes of
attracting more international business.
   With a Nov. 30 launch date, the LIFFE will beat the much larger
Chicago futures exchanges to the punch with an automated trading
system.
   But the LIFFE system, at least initially, will extend the London
exchange's trading day to just 11 hours compared with the 24-hour
capability of systems being developed by the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Officials of the Chicago exchanges said they would have to study
the LIFFE's system to weigh its potential impact on their own
businesses.
   But at first blush, the LIFFE's system looks like competition
for the Board of Trade's proposed trading network, dubbed Aurora,
said BOT spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   ``Competition isn't the worst thing _ it's often good for the
overall market,'' O'Connell said. ``The Board of Trade looks at
this as something good for the industry.''
   Michael Jenkins, LIFFE's chief executive, announced the
exchange's plans at a futures and options trade show in Chicago.
   As planned, the system would operate from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.
London time for trading of Euromark and West German government bond
futures. An early trading session, from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. London
time, would be added in the first half of 1990, as would all the
exchange's other futures and options contracts.
   Some of those contracts, such as U.S. Treasury bond futures and
international currency futures, compete with products offered by
the Chicago exchanges.
   Futures exchanges around the world are trying to extend their
trading hours to capture more foreign business.
   The LIFFE system resembles the Board of Trade's proposed Aurora
system, allowing traders sitting at computers to identify and trade
with each other. The Board of Trade announced plans for Aurora in
March but has not set a launch date.
   The Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, is also
working with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on a possible joint
venture in electronic trading.
   The Merc is working separately on Globex, a blind trade-matching
system slated for a launch early next year. The New York Mercantile
Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange and the French futures
exchange MATIF have agreed to offer some of their products for
trading on Globex.

   Stock prices lost ground today as many investors
decided to cash in on the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell for the first time
this month. Led by blue-chip issues, Wall Street had advanced to
record highs recently.
   Many market strategists have expected the Dow average to show
some resistance as it approaches the 2,800 mark, which it has never
surpassed.
   Analysts said today's retreat was due mainly to profit-taking.
Although volume picked up sharply from Monday's sluggish pace, the
market remained featureless, they said.
   ``Dull, dull, dull,'' said Mitchell Meisler, an executive vice
president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``There's no overriding theme right now.''
   Traders are watching interest rates, especially in Europe, and
looking toward corporate earnings reports for the third quarter due
out soon.
   ``You could see some surprises, both on the downside and the
upside,'' Meisler said.

   Oil futures prices advanced Tuesday amid
concerns about supplies of foreign crude.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 15 cents to close at $20.17 a
42-gallon barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading, matching
a 15 cent gain in Monday's session.
   Traders bought U.S. oil on fears there wouldn't be enough crude
coming into this country from overseas, said Andrew Lebow, an
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Nigeria canceled two planned cargoes of crude in mid-September,
and the energy market was concerned that mid-October shipments
might be put off as well, Lebow said. Traders bought WTI contracts
as a hedge against that possibility.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc also
advanced.
   The November contract for domestic heating oil gained 0.87 cent
to close at 59.64 cents a gallon, compounding a 0.59 cent gain in

   And wholesale unleaded gasoine for November delivery climbed
1.00 cent to settle at 55.99 cents a gallon, following a 0.19 cent

   The dollar ended sharply higher Tuesday after
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that U.S.
interest rates would remain firm in the near term regardless of the
currency's movements.
   Gold prices slipped here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $361 a troy ounce, down $2.10 from Monday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold also
at $361 an ounce, off $1.50.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rally mainly to remarks
from Greenspan in Moscow on Tuesday.
   Greenspan said ``attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates
may lead to destabilizing international capital flows, and
ultimately have to be abandoned.'' He said paying inordinate
attention to intermediate targets in setting monetary policy ``may
not promote the attainment of long-term goals.''
   The Fed has been under pressure from the Bush administration to
take action to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against
foreign currencies this year. It has also been urged by some
officials to ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of
recession.
   Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said
many dealers interpreted Greenspan's remarks to mean that the Fed
probably wouldn't push down interest rates any time soon, thereby
keeping the dollar from declining.
   ``The market was poised to move up and that was a nice
catalyst,'' said Johnson.
   The British pound, meanwhile, continued its sharp drop Tuesday
despite last week's hike in Britain's interest rates. One dealer
said there is a lack of confidence in sterling.
   In London, it cost $1.5580 to buy one pound, cheaper than
$1.5775 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.5520 in New York, down
from $1.5775 Monday.
   Tokyo markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. But in
London, the dollar was quoted at 143.25 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Monday. The dollar stood at 144.50 yen in New York, up from 142.85
yen Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.9083 West German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6670
Swiss francs, up from 1.6485; 6.4655 French francs, up from 6.3995;
1.17625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17525; and 1,394.875 Italian
lire, up from 1,383.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.8965 West
German marks, up from 1.8865; 1.6545 Swiss francs, up from 1.6457;
6.4300 French francs, up from 6.4005; 2.1290 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.1310; 1.1735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749; and
1,382.40 Italian lire, down from 1,384.00.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $362 a troy ounce from late
Monday's $362.75. In Zurich, gold closed at $362 an ounce, down
from $362.80 Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.54 to close at $363.08 an
ounce.
   Silver prices fell. On the New York Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery dropped 2 cents from Monday to $5.03 a troy ounce.
Silver fell in London to $5.06 an ounce from $5.09.

<HEAD>Ford Shutting Down Escort Plant for Three Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production at Ford Motor Co.'s Wayne assembly
plant will stop for about three months to retool the factory for
the next generation of Escort subcompact cars, the company said
Tuesday.
   The United Auto Workers union said it anticipates fewer than 100
layoffs because of the changeover.
   The Wayne assembly plant west of Detroit, Ford's principal
source for the Escort, will stop production Nov. 22 and resume in
late February or early March, Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said.
   During that time, the plant will undergo an extensive retooling
for the new Escort, which will be introduced to the public next
spring as a 1991 model.
   The retooling is part of a $1.5 billion project Ford is
undertaking for the new generation of Escort and Mercury Tracer
cars.
   Along with the Wayne plant, Escorts and all Tracers will be made
at Ford's Hermosillo, Mexico, plant, which stopped production in
late August. Pitcoff said the plant would not build 1990 Tracers
since it had no facilities to install passive restraint systems
required by the U.S. government for 1990 model year cars.
   There are about 3,300 hourly workers at the Wayne plant. Dale
Smith, financial secretary of United Auto Workers union Local 900,
said during the down time, workers will be retrained on the new
production processes.
   Ford currently makes Escorts at its Edison, N.J., plant in
addition to the Wayne factory. Pitcoff said he didn't know when
Escort production would stop at the Edison plant to make way for
changing the plant to producing Ranger small pickup trucks.
   Ford needed the new source for Rangers after deciding to build
the Explorer sport-utility vehicle at its Louisville assembly plant.
   In the 1989 model year, 366,354 Escorts were sold, making it the
best-selling car in the United States for the fourth-straight model
year.
   ``This changeover (at Wayne) jeopardizes our string of
continuous model and calendar year sales titles for Escort,''
Pitcoff said. Escort was the best-selling car during the 1987 and
1988 calendar years.
   The Honda Accord was the second-best selling car in the country
during the last model year with 362,437 being driven off dealer
lots. The Ford Taurus was third at 360,237 sales.

   A major institutional investor in AMR Corp. said
Tuesday it has sold all its shares to take advantage of inflated
stock prices in the wake of Donald Trump's $7 billion buyout
proposal for the company that owns American Airlines.
   Since last Thursday, when Trump's $120 per share offer was made
public, Windsor Fund has sold its 425,000 shares, said John B.
Neff, who has managed the fund for 25 years. ``We're out as of
yesterday,'' Neff said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, little additional information emerged on Trump's bid,
revealed last Thursday in a letter to the company.
   Trump told The Associated Press in New York he was serious about
acquiring the airline, although he would not reveal any details of
his financing. Trump also said he would leave the airline's
headquarters in Fort Worth.
   AMR's stock fell in trading in the New York Stock Exchange,
closing down $3.25 a share at $101.50, reflecting speculation that
Trump's offer is a ploy to increase the value of his AMR stock and
not a serious offer for the airline.
   ``I have a hard time taking Mr. Trump seriously. $120's a very
full price, and I don't know where the financing is going to come
from,'' Neff said. ``This isn't loose change.''
   At one time, the Windsor Fund held 4 million shares of AMR
stock, and airline said in its annual report institutional
investors hold about 80 percent of its 58.9 million outstanding
shares.
   The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that some
institutional investors were considering backing Trump, despite AMR
Chairman Robert L. Crandall's reputation as one of the industry's
top executives.
   Trump had pitched his bid somewhat in the institutions'
direction, promising to give them an immediate payoff in a company
that has never paid a dividend since the holding company was
created in 1982.
   ``This is the whole essence of the strategy,'' said analyst
Kevin Burke at First Union Corp., a bank holding company in
Charlotte, N.C.
   He said Trump is saying ``he wants to pay you off right now,''
while Crandall has essentially said he would ``deliver more profits
down the road than if I paid out 4 percent in a dividend.''
   Most observers are awaiting some response from AMR, which has
said nothing beyond its initial promise to review the offer ``in
due course'' while adding it preferred to remain independent.
   The most-often mentioned alternatives include finding a friendly
buyer, putting together a management-labor buyout deal, selling a
large chunk of stock to employees or establishing a special
dividend through a restructuring.
   Neff, in a telephone interview from his Valley Forge, Pa.,
office, said he had raised the issue of the dividend with Crandall
many times.
   ``It's been a sticky issue,'' he said.
   AMR officials refused to discuss the policy, referring questions
to the company's 1988 annual report, which includes almost a full
page in defense of the no-dividend policy.
   ``The airline business is very capital intensive, and the funds
that would be required for payment of a dividend are being used
instead for capital expenditures,'' the report says.
   Noting that the company has averaged $1.03 billion in capital
expenditures annually since 1983, and anticipates to spend $1.9
billion a year for the next five years, the report says, ``To pay a
dividend in the midst of this capital spending seems
counterproductive. Every dollar paid out as a dividend is one more
dollar that would have to be financed, assuming a constant cash
position.''
   AMR denies the policy short changes stockholders, saying
``Reinvestment of earnings, with resultant share appreciation, is
more beneficial to shareholders than receipt of dividends,
especially on an after tax basis.''
   Other profitable airlines, however, do pay dividends. For
example, Delta Airlines paid $1.20 last year and has paid a
dividend during the last 40 fiscal years while growing to become
the nation's third largest carrier behind American and United Air
Lines.
   ``We believe that it's part of our responsibility to
stockholders to maximize their stake in the company,'' Delta
spokesman Jim Lundy said. ``It's best for us to return a portion
(of profits) through dividends.''
   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, paid dividends each
quarter going private recently in a $3.65 billion buyout. USAir
Group Inc. also has paid dividends.

   John G. Smale announced Tuesday he was
resigning as chairman and chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
as part of a series of top-level personnel moves.
   Smale, 62, made the unexpected announcement to shareholders at
the consumer products giant's annual meeting, saying he wanted to
spend more time with his family. He has been the company's chief
executive for the last nine years and leaves office effective Jan.
2.
   Succeeding Smale as chairman and chief executive will be Edwin
L. Artzt, who now is vice chairman of the board and president of
Procter &amp; Gamble's international operations.
   Company president John E. Pepper will give up most of his
responsibilities for Procter &amp; Gamble's domestic operations to
oversee the international business.
   Smale announced the changes at a shareholders' meeting
punctuated by a demonstration by animal-rights activists. Several
dozen picketed outside the company's headquarters while others
questioned Smale during the meeting about Procter &amp; Gamble's use of
animals for product-safety testing.
   The company in recent years has been a target of animal rights
activists, but maintains that marketing certain products without
animal testing would be unsafe.
   Nine shareholders expressed concerns about animal testing
Tuesday to Smale, who declined to say how many animals are being
used in product testing. He said the company had reduced the number
of animals it uses by one-third in the past five years and will
continue seeking alternatives.
   Shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split that will become
effective Oct. 20, increasing the authorized number of common
shares from 500 million to 1 billion.
   After resigning his executive position, Smale will remain a
Procter &amp; Gamble employee and will serve as a director and as
chairman of the board's executive committee.
   ``By January, I will have been president and then chairman of
Procter &amp; Gamble for nearly 16 years,'' Smale said. ``I will have
been the chief executive officer of the company for nine years.
I've reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family
it's time to turn this responsibility over to someone else.''
   Smale has led the company into new product lines and oversaw an
$805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining
management. During Smale's tenure, the company acquired
Richardson-Vicks, some major brands from G.D. Searle, and Noxell
Corp. Those moves gave the personal care-products giant a wide base
in over-the-counter drugs and beauty products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had sales of $21.4 billion in the fiscal year
ended June 30 and net earnings of $1.6 billion.
   Smale also helped the company branch out into foreign markets.
Roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal year were based
outside the United States, and Smale said the figure should top 50
percent in a few years.
   Artzt, 59, has been vice chairman of the board and president of
Procter &amp; Gamble International since 1984. His first major
promotion was in 1969 when he was named vice president of the food
products division.
   Procter &amp; Gamble also announced the selection of three vice
presidents to the posts of executive vice president.
   Group vice president B. Jurgen Hintz will be responsible for the
company's domestic paper products, cellulose and chemicals, and
food and beverage businesses; Durk I. Jager, also a group vice
president, will be responsible for domestic soap, detergent and

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge on Canadian Strike Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices staged a dramatic turnaround Tuesday,
rising to new contract highs early in the session before plunging
on reports that a 3-month-old strike at a Canadian copper mine was
nearly settled.
   ``It was a very violent day,'' said James Steel, a metals
analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. in New York.
   On other commodity markets, soybeans sank to 23-month lows while
grain futures were mixed; energy futures rose strongly; precious
metals retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 2.6 cents to 3.6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $1.2805 a pound, 5.65 cents
off its intra-day high of $1.337.
   The market opened with strong gains, continuing the upward
course that copper prices had taken since mid-year, when strikes
and other production problems at major mines around the world began
threatening supplies.
   But in the afternoon, reports surfaced of significant progress
in a strike at Highland Valley Copper's mine near Logan Lake, B.C.,
where workers walked off the job July 6 in a contract dispute.
   Highland Valley spokesman Rod Killough confirmed there had been
a breakthrough in negotiations over the weekend.
   ``We resolved all issues apart from pensions and wages and we
are close on those,'' Killough said in a telephone interview. ``We
can see some light at the end of the tunnel.''
   The mine's normal output is just under 1 million pounds per day,
Killough said.
   Problems continue at large copper operations in Mexico and Papua
New Guinea, but analysts said Tuesday's whipsaw price movement
suggested further selling was likely.
   ``Regardless of the news, this should have follow-through to the
downside,'' said Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Soybean futures sank to 23-month lows on the Chicago Board of
Trade as a harvest-related sell-off stretched into its fourth
straight day.
   The corn-and-soybean harvest is advancing rapidly under
near-perfect conditions and analysts said the higher-than-expected
yields are exaggerating the normal seasonal drop in prices.
   In addition, many traders are betting that the Agriculture
Department will increase its harvest projections in a crop report
slated for release after the close on Thursday.
   Soybean futures settled 4{ cents to 6} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in November at $5.52{ a bushel, the lowest
settlement for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 11, 1987.
   Wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December
at $4.07 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1} cents lower with December
at $2.33\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with
December at $1.40{ a bushel.
   Oil futures prices advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid supply fears that prompted speculation Nigeria may cancel some
of its crude oil shipments this month. Nigeria canceled two planned
cargoes of crude last month.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 15 cents
higher with November at $20.17 a barrel; heating oil was .70 cent
to .87 cent higher with November at 59.64 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .73 cent to 1 cent higher with November at 55.99 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar strengthened against other major currencies.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.30 lower with October at $361 a troy
ounce; silver, falling for the fourth straight day, was 2 cents to
3.4 cents lower with December at $5.03 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were .33 cent to
.90 cent higher with October at 72.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .10 cent to .38 cent higher with October at 82.95 cents a
pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .62 cent higher with
October at 47.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent
to .22 cent lower with February at 46.55 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard Announces New Personal Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful new personal computer using
a new computer standard governing the accessories used in and with
the machine was announced Tuesday by Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Dubbed the HP Vectra 486 PC, the floor-standing, 60-pound unit
uses a new standard developed by a consortium of nine computer
companies.
   Last year, the group broke away from the latest standard of
International Business Machines Corp., in a challenge to IBM's
control of design standards for PCs that is based on its own,
called Micro Channel, which is used in IBM's PS-2 computers.
   The Vectra 486 _ the first to use the new standard dubbed
Extended Industry Standard Architecture _ ``marks the beginning of
a new era in the PC industry and for HP as a supplier of
high-performance PCs,'' said Robert Puette, general manager of
Hewlett-Packard's personal computer group.
   The computer that will be available early next year comes in
three standard models priced at $13,999, $16,999 and $19,999.
   Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, predicted that
competition would drive prices down later in 1990.
   The Vectra 486 comes with two megabytes of memory, a floppy disk
and choice of hard disks with various capabilities. It also has
eight slots designed for add-in boards built for EISA.
   ``In the past, users were forced to discard expensive DRAMs
(dynamic random access microchips) when upgrading their PC's
memory,'' said Puette. ``With the new memory subsystem of the HP
Vectra 486 PC, HP is the first supplier to protect users' initial
investment in PC memory.''
   Hewlett-Packard is an international giant in computers and
electronics. The Palo Alto-based company posted revenue of $9.8
billion in its 1988 fiscal year. It has 95,000 employees.

<HEAD>Investment Advisor Company Reveals 10.24 Percent Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Memphis, Tenn.-based investment management
concern increased its stake in British advertising conglomerate
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Company PLC to 10.24 percent, it was disclosed
Tuesday.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Southeastern Asset Management Inc. said it paid $79.7 million over
the last two months to buy 3.4 million ordinary shares of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, the world's largest ad holding company.
   That increased Southeastern's holdings to 5.3 million American
Depository Receipts (ADRs) _ or 16.1 million ordinary shares _
constituting 10.24 percent of the outstanding shares.
   Instead of buying shares in foreign companies through overseas
securities markets, an American individual or company can buy
shares in the form of ADRs, which represent a receipt for foreign
shares held by a U.S. bank. ADRs entitle the shareholder to all
dividends.
   Southeastern, an investment advisor to individual and
institutional clients including retirement plans and endowment
funds, said it was buying the shares for ``investment purposes on
behalf of client accounts.''
   Southeastern said it was making the public filing because it
``has been contacted by one or more third parties'' about
restructuring transactions ``other than a change of management or
control'' of London-based Saatchi.
   In the SEC filing, Southeastern said it had an investment
philosophy of ``identifying undervalued situations'' and ``has no
present intention to seek control of (Saatchi &amp; Saatchi) or
otherwise to participate in the management.''
   Southeastern also said that it ``will not initiate any
acquisition or buyout proposal'' that involves securities in the
portfolio of the registered investment company it advises, but is
open to proposals from other entities.

<HEAD>USX Adopts Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp.'s board of directors adopted a
shareholder rights takeover defense on Tuesday, saying it wanted to
deter coercive takeover tactics.
   Adoption of the plan, which was effective Tuesday, came less
than a week after takeover strategist Carl Icahn disclosed that he
was studying the feasibility of making a bid for the
Pittsburgh-based steel and oil giant.
   Icahn controls 13.06 percent of USX's stock, including an
additional 4.25 million shares acquired last week.
   USX fell 50 cents to $38.12{ a share Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Shareholder rights plans, commonly known as a ``poison pill,''
generally are aimed at thwarting hostile takeovers by making them
prohibitively expensive.
   The USX plan would take effect once a person or group acquired
at least 15 percent of the company's common stock.
   Under the plan, shareholders would be issued one stock right for
each common share they already hold. The USX board could give
shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock,
at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right, thus
increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire.
   USX said the plan was designed to prevent someone from gaining
control of the company without offering a fair price to all
stockholders.
   Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines Inc., said his group was
considering making proposals for ``business combinations'' with
USX. He made the comment in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission last Thursday.

<HEAD>Fugitive Businessman Charged With 493 Counts in Alleged $16.5 Million
Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese businessman made more than $16.5
million by trading on inside information he bought from a junior
analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., a federal securities fraud
indictment unsealed Tuesday charges.
   Fred C. Lee, a fugitive believed to be in Taiwan, was charged
with 493 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, securities fraud, wire
fraud and fraud in connection with a tender offer.
   The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
almost a year ago but remained under seal as investigators
continued their search for Lee, U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said.
   The $16.5 million in illegal profits described in the indictment
makes the case the second largest insider-trading case behind the
Ivan Boesky scandal in 1986. Boesky, the now-jailed stock
speculator, agreed to return $50 million in alleged illicit profits
and pay $50 million in penalties to the government.
   Authorities decided to unseal the charges against Lee in hopes
publicity surrounding the case would help apprehend him, Romano
said. He added that the United States does not have an extradition
treaty with Taiwan covering the offenses in the indictment.
   Lee faces up to five years in prison on each of the 493 criminal
charges and tens of millions of dollars in fines, Romano said.
   The prosecutor also said Lee, through his attorneys, agreed to
pay $25 million to settle a civil complaint brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in June.
   Lee, 39, was accused of paying the Morgan Stanley analyst,
Stephen S. Wang Jr., $200,000 for non-public information about
upcoming mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts involving
companies represented by the investment firm.
   The indictment identified 16 deals between June 1987 and July
1988, long after the Wall Street insider trading scandal made
headlines, in which Lee earned more than $16.5 million.
   Lee allegedly carried out the illegal transactions by trading in
more than 40 accounts at eight foreign and domestic brokers, the
indictment said. Some accounts were in Lee's name but most were
listed in the names of relatives and other third parties.
   Wang entered into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors in
September 1988 and pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in
connection with his scheme with Lee.
   Wang, 25, who no longer works for Morgan Stanley, originally was
sentenced to three years in prison but his term was reduced to
eight months and he was recently released.
   He joined Morgan Stanley in June 1988, working in leveraged
buyouts before transferring to mergers and acquisitions.

   Stock prices lost ground Tuesday as many
investors decided to cash in on the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, falling for the first
time this month, declined 6.08 points to 2,785.33.
   Led by blue-chip issues, Wall Street had advanced to record
highs recently. Many market strategists have expected the Dow
average to show some resistance as it approaches the 2,800 mark,
which it has never surpassed.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 831 down, 652 up and 493 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 147.56 million
shares, up from 130.72 million in Monday's session, which had been
the lowest level in more than two months.
   Analysts said Tuesday's retreat was due mainly to profit-taking.
Although volume picked up sharply from Monday's sluggish pace, the
market remained featureless, they said.
   ``Dull, dull, dull,'' said Mitchell Meisler, an executive vice
president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``There's no overriding theme right now.''
   Traders are watching interest rates, especially in Europe, and
looking toward corporate earnings reports for the third quarter due
out soon.
   ``You could see some surprises, both on the downside and the
upside,'' Meisler said, referring to the company reports.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Airlines'
parent AMR tumbled 3] to 101], apparently reflecting investor
skepticism about a $120-a-share offer made last week by New York
developer Donald Trump.
   AT&amp;T was down } at 43, Compaq Computer fell 2| to 102\ and IBM
lost 1 at 108\.
   Burlington Resources jumped 1{ to 52~ amid renewed takeover
rumors, Paramount Communications was up } at 63} and Exxon gained [

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 176.78 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.29 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.34 to 199.00.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.76 to 409.73, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.67 at 359.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

<HEAD>Digital Unveils Software Designed for Mixing Computer Brands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., suffering from a sales
slump, unveiled a system of office software Tuesday designed to
allow computers made by different companies to share information
and work together.
   The action marks the latest move toward equipment that is
compatible across the computer industry, easing some of the
confusion for customers who have had to struggle with diverse
systems, analysts say.
   ``With any large company, the most important and hardest
business problem is that they have all these different types of
desktop computers, and they want all these people to work
together,'' said Henry Ancona, Digital's vice president for
business and office information systems.
   The new system will be compatible not only with Digital's VAX
computers but with popular systems from International Business
Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc., as well as software from
Microsoft Corp., the company said.
   Workers using this system ``can share computing software, and
transmit data, documents and pictures,'' Kenneth Olsen, president
of the Maynard-based company, said in a statement. ``It's just
common sense.''
   The software, which was presented Tuesday at an office computer
convention in New York, will be available next year.
   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind IBM,
was long known for the compatibility within its VAX system. Digital
promoted this with the slogan ``Digital has it now,'' a jab at its
giant rival, whose systems until this year lacked that capability.
IBM now has software that can run across the full range of its
machines.
   But company officials and analysts said Digital's move takes
compatibility further by linking computers from different companies.
   ``We believe that reflects the reality of the market,'' Ancona
said. ``It would be arrogant to tell a customer that if you buy our
computer, you have to throw out everything else you've invested
in.''
   ``I think DEC's made a very significant step forward,'' said
Terry Shannon, an analyst with International Data Corp., a computer
research firm based in Framingham.
   ``Digital is saying if you don't have a Digital PC (personal
computer), it's fine,'' Shannon said. ``Their concern is the
underlying system.''
   Computer software, which runs the machines, is becoming a more
lucrative market than the computers themselves, which are becoming
less expensive, Shannon said.
   Also, Digital can employ the integrated system to introduce its
products to customers using other brands of computers, and possibly
persuade them to use more Digital equipment, said Sonny Monosson,
publisher of The Monosson Report in Boston, which monitors
activities at Digital.
   The introduction of the new system comes as the company tries to
reverse a sales slump.
   Digital's earnings slid 22 percent for the year that ended July
1, and the company has frozen salaries and transferred hundreds of
employees from manufacturing to sales jobs.
   Last week, John J. Shields, who was in charge of sales and was
long regarded as the No. 2 man at Digital, resigned. Analysts noted
that he had fallen out of favor amid the company's slowdown.
   Part of the company's slump could be blamed on Digital's rapid
introduction of new products, which confused sales people and
customers, analysts said.
   But that will not be the case with the new system, Ancona said,
since the programs will build on the VAX system, not depart from it.
   ``There has been confusion ... it would be complicated about
what they had and didn't have,'' said Walter Ulrich, an analyst
with Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge-based management and
technology consulting firm.
   ``But now they're able to give a more simple message about what
they're doing,'' he said.

   Mister Donut, the second-largest franchised doughnut chain in

<HEAD>Levi Strauss Decides Against Sponsoring Channel One Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., one of eight advertisers who
bought commercial time during last spring's test of the Channel One
news show for teens in the classroom, has decided against being a
sponsor when the service goes national in the spring.
   The San Francisco-based apparel maker said Tuesday it felt that
sticking with media vehicles like network and cable television
would offer a more efficient and less expensive way to reach the
audience of young men aged 14 to 24 that it targets with ads for
its Levis 501 jeans.
   Dan Chew, marketing manager for Levi Strauss, said the
controversy that Channel One stirred among some national education
groups and others about permitting paid pitches in the classroom
played no role in Levi's decision.
   ``We never reached the point internally where we discussed the
issue of in-school advertising,'' he said. ``I'm not sure how that
would have come out.''
   Chew declined to say how much Levi Strauss was being asked to
pay for commercial time on Channel One, but said the company felt
it could reach a wider audience at less cost by sticking with
traditional media.
   Whittle Communications, the producer of Channel One, is
currently lining up advertising support and signing up schools for
its daily 12-minute news shows that will include two minutes of
paid advertising.
   It hopes to make Channel One available in 8,000 schools reaching
6 million teens by the end of 1990.
   Whittle spokesman Tom Ingram said the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
media company won't discuss in advance which advertisers have
signed up for the national rollout of the service, scheduled for
March 1990.
   Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle announced last month that
after 90 days of advertiser recruitment, Channel One was already
more than halfway toward its goal of selling $90 million in
commercial time the first year. He said some of the companies who
were in the test program in six schools last spring would be
included in next spring's rollout while others would not.
   Among other advertised products in last spring's test were candy
from M&amp;M-Mars Co.; chewing gum from Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.; shampoo,
deodorant, acne medication and potato chips from Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.; and mints and cough tablets from Warner-Lambert Co.

<HEAD>K mart Chairman Says New Stores, Ad Appearances Will Help 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opening 43 new K mart discount stores in the
fourth quarter could boost the end of a lackluster year at the
nation's second-largest retailer, Chairman Joseph Antonini said
Tuesday.
   Antonini also said at a news conference that he will make some
personal appearances in television ads in an effort to lure
customers. ``I can go on TV in front of the American public and
tell them what we are doing,'' he said.
   In addition, Antonini outlined a $1.3 billion expansion plan
that would increase the number of K marts to 2,500 by 1995 from the
current 2,283.
   Lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates and
better-than-expected employment raise the possibility of the kind
of strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year,
Antonini said.
   Because the economy seems to be holding up, he said, ``We're
more optimistic than we were four months ago.''
   K mart will open 43 new stores this fall and complete expansions
of 63 others by the end of October, Antonini said.
   He said he already made television commercials being tested in
the Pueblo and Colorado Springs areas of Colorado, and will appear
in national television ads during two Christmas specials K mart is
producing.
   One is ``Christmas in America,'' a movie that will star Kenny
Rogers. The other a special on Christmas entertaining with author
Martha Stewart, who also lends her name to a line of K mart
household products.
   K mart bought national television advertising during about 24
weeks this year and will increase that to about 30 weeks next year,
keying some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars,
Antonini said.
   He said last week that cutting prices to gain customers has
reduced profit margins and is expected to lower third-quarter
earnings below last year's.
   The company reported earnings of $145 million in its second
fiscal quarter, which ended July 26. That was down 10.9 percent
from a year earlier, though second-quarter sales of $7 billion were
up 4.8 percent.
   September sales of $2.6 billion were up 6.1 percent from
September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing stores open
for the full year.
   From the start of the fiscal year Feb. 1 through Sept. 27, sales
reached $17.7 billion, up only 4.7 percent overall and a sluggish
1.2 percent on a comparable-store basis.
   K mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of $803 million on sales of
$27.3 billion.
   Profit margins will improve as the company connects 2,200 of its
stores to a centralized inventory computer system by the end of
next year for greater marketing precision, Antonini said.
   ``We know what product sells in Hoboken, New Jersey, we know the
price it sells for, and we know how many sold on Monday,'' he said.
``We never knew that before.''

other types of non-petroleum exports, Mexican Commerce Secretary
Jaime Serra Puche said Tuesday.
   The agreements, reached during President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's visit to the United States last week, will help Mexico's
developing economy and further reduce its reliance on petroleum
exports, Serra Puche said.
   ``The most important thing we've done is set up a program to
promote trade, rather than just resolve problems as they come up,''
Serra Puche said.
   ``Before it was a passive agreement,'' he said. ``Now we have an
active agreement, with dates and deadlines for considering
improvements in trade.''
   He said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher will be
visiting Mexico next month for further talks on expanding trade.
   One 30-month agreement more than doubled Mexico's quota for
steel exports to the United States, from about 370,000 tons
annually to about 800,000 tons, he said. The exact tonnages depend
on the mix of steel products involved.
   Serra Puche said the United States also agreed to consider
lifting tariffs on 43 categories of products, including data
processing equipment, beer, car parts, plastics, glass and crystal
products, toilet paper and other paper products, jalapeno chilis
and alphabet blocks for children.
   He said Mexico felt it deserved concessions because it had gone
so far to free its own market of government control and
protectionist rules.
   ``Right now we have one of the most open economies in the world.
That allows us to ask for reciprocity,'' Serra Puche said.
   Intellectual property rights remain a sticking point. U.S.
industry has long complained that Mexicans steal patented ideas,
especially in the pharmaceutical field, and some firms refuse to
invest in Mexico for fear their patents will not be respected.
   Serra Puche said Mexico wants to resolve the problem in order to
modernize its industry, but that nothing would be done to put the
Mexican pharmaceutical industry out of business overnight.
   He said forthcoming negotiations will lead to a higher textile
quota for Mexico, adding that the Mexican textile industry's main
problem in the past had not been quotas but competitiveness.
   He said that with the opening of Mexico's economy to foreign
competion since Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, Mexican industry has become much more competitive in both
quality and price.
   Under previous protectionist policies that virtually prevented
imports of everything from chocolate bars to refrigerators, Mexican
manufacturers got away with making shoddy goods at high prices for
the domestic market.
   With regard to steel, Serra Puche noted that Mexico exported
$286 million worth to the United States in the first nine months of
1989, up from $232 million in 1988. Steel is Mexico's
eighth-largest export, he said.
   Also reached, said Serra Puche, was an agreement to push closer
commercial relations along the U.S.-Mexico border, including
examination of new customs protocols and agreements to allow trucks
to circulate freely on both sides of the border.
   Serra Puche said Mexico's overall non-petroleum exports have
risen from $4 billion in 1983 to $15 billion in 1988, with a
further 10 percent increase expected this year. Petroleum has
dropped from 90 percent of Mexico's export trade to 30 percent,
although that is also partly due to the drop in world oil prices
since 1982.
   He said efforts were being made to push exports to Europe and
the Far East, but the United States remains the world's largest
consumer market and Mexico's closeness to that market is an
advantage.
