<HEAD>Mubarak Meets Libyan Emissary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak and high-ranking
Libyan official Ahmed Gaddaf Dam met on Wednesday to discuss
improving relations between their two countries, the state-run
Middle East News Agency reported.
   It said the meeting is a continuation of conciliatory talks that
started between Mubarak and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi at
last week's Arab League summit at Casablanca, Morocco.
   Gaddaf Dam is a cousin of Gadhafi and Libya's intelligence
chief. He came to Cairo Tuesday.
   The agency gave no details on the meeting or elaborate on the
duration of the visit.
   The summit was Egypt's first since 1976. Cairo's relations with
the Arab League plummeted in 1977 with the late President Anwar
Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. Egypt's league membership was suspended
and most Arab states cut diplomatic ties in 1979, after Sadat
signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state.
   Libya is among the last to soften its attitude toward Egypt.
   Mubarak told Egyptian journalists before Wednesday's meeting
that Egyptian-Libyan relations ``are on the threshold of a new era
based on a right foundation of frankness.''
   On Monday, Egypt reopened its borders with Libya for the first
time in more than a decade. The land route is used mainly by
thousands of Egyptians working in Libya. During the years the
border was closed, Egyptian workers had to travel between the two
countries by way of Greece or some other point.
   Negotiations are under way between a Libyan civil aviation
delegation and Egyptian authorities for restoring direct air
service between Cairo and the Libyan capital Tripoli.
   Egyptian-Libyan relations had been strained since 1972, when
Sadat rejected a bid by Gadhafi ffor an immediate merger of the two
countries. They fought a brief border war in 1977.
   Mubarak's government has charged Gadhafi with several atttempts
to assassinate Libyan dissidents in Egyptian exile. It suspected
Libya of laying mines in the Gulf of Suez and Red Sea that damaged
20 ships in the summer of 1984.

   A radical environmental group's founder and three
other people were arrested Wednesday on charges they conspired to
sabotage two nuclear power plants and an Energy Department bomb
factory in the West, the FBI said.
   Two men were arrested early Wednesday while trying to use a
propane torch to cut down a utility-line pole leading from an
electrical substation in Wenden, Ariz., FBI officials in Washington
and Phoenix said.
   A woman was arrested in Prescott, nearly 80 miles northeast of
Wenden, in the alleged plot, the FBI said.
   A third man was arrested in Tucson on charges of conspiring with
th others to sabotage commercial nuclear power plants at
Wintersburg, Ariz., and near San Luis Obispo, Calif., as well as
the federal government's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near
Golden, Colo.
   The FBI said the defendants were members of a radical
environmentalist group calling itself the Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist
International Conspiracy.
   The organization, which took its name from the former Arizona
governor who was impeached last year, has sent communiques to news
organizations in the Southwest claiming responsibility for criminal
acts, the FBI said.
   The FBI said the arrests resulted from a three-year undercover
investigation that began after vandals cut power lines at the Palo
Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Wintersburg, 50 miles west of
Phoenix, in May 1986.
   David Foreman, 42, who founded Earth First! _ the exclamation
point is part of the name _ in 1979, was arrested in Tucson on a
charge of conspiracy. He appeared before a federal magistrate there
and was ordered held without bond.
   The other three appeared in Phoenix and also were ordered held
for an appearance Friday in U.S. District Court.
   Mark L. Davis, 39, and Marc A. Baker, 37, both of Prescott, were
charged with conspiracy to sabotage a nuclear facility as well as
destruction of an energy facility, destruction of property used in
interstate commerce and destruction of government property.
   The FBI said they were arrested while trying to cut down a
utility pole supporting a power line that links an electrical
substation with two irrigation pumping stations of the Central
Arizona Project, a multibillion-dollar canal system bringing
Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson.
   Margaret ``Peggy'' Katherine Millett, 35, of Prescott, was
arrested and charged with the same crimes, the FBI said.
   The FBI also investigated acts of vandalism against ski-lift
equipment at a Flagstaff ski resort and the cutting of power-line
poles at three uranium mines last year in northern Arizona, the
bureau said.
   Foreman is a co-founder of Earth First!, said Rod Mondt, a
spokesman in the Tucson office of the group's journal.
   The loosely organized group, which has no officers or formal
membership, didn't plan the attack, Mondt said, but added:
   ``Some of us support the right to do those kinds of things.''
   Earth First! was inspired in part by ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,''
a novel by the late Edward Abbey about a trio of
environmentalalists who try to blow up the Glen Canyon Dam.
   Mondt said he was unaware of an organization called the Evan
Meacham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy, but noted that the
organization's acronym would be EMETIC, a word defined as a
medicine or other substance that causes vomiting.

<TEXT>
   The government, enforcing its policies to
discourage Vietnamese refugees from coming to this British colony,
on Tuesday towed a boat with 109 Vietnamese to a remote island,
officials reported.
   They said boats carrying 745 refugees entered Hong Kong waters
Tuesday and a vessel with 109 people was towed to Tai A Chau, an
island 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong, because other facilities
were filled.
   Tai A Chau has virtually no shelter.
   ``We have had more than 2,300 arrivals over the past three days.
Our accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed,'' said
Hong Kong refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.
   He said the people taken to Tai A Chau would have to stay aboard
the boat or on the dock. ``There is one school building which some
people may be able to use, but I think most will not be able to
have covered accomodations,'' he added.
   The refugees will remain on the island until the government can
find a place for them and then process them, Hanson said. He said
he did not know how long that might take.
   Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong received hundreds of
thousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forces
defeated the U.S.-backed governments in South Vietnam and Cambodia
in April 1975.
   But thousands of Vietnamese are still fleeing their homeland.
   A year ago Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats all
Indochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation
unless they can prove they fled political persecution.
   But that has not curbed the influx.
   For the first five months of this year 13,182 boat people have
arrived in Hong Kong.
   Vietnam has agreed to attend an international conference on
Indochinese refugees that is to be held in Geneva June 13-14.

<HEAD>Elementary Student Gives Away $3,000 To Buy Friends</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old elementary school student,
apparently feeling he needed more friends, decided to buy them with
thousands of dollars of his father's money.
   No one is exactly sure how much money the youngster spread
around the school in his pursuit of friendship, although officials
have recovered $3,000 from classmates and their parents.
   ``He was handing out $5, $10, $20 and $100 bills,'' said Richard
Scruggs, the school system's security officer. ``The boy apparently
got into his father's stash.''
   The money-for-friendship enterprise was uncovered by Ritta
School Principal J.W. Jones last week when a student asked him to
break a $10 bill.
   Jones asked where the student had gotten the money, and was told
the fourth-grader was giving it away.
   Jones said no disciplinary action was taken against the
spendthrift youngster. Officials checked to make sure no coercion
was involved in the payments, but the gifts apparently were made
freely, Scruggs said.
   And with some success; the boy ``was making friends real well,''
said Tom Shumpert, assistant superintendent of the Knox County
school system.

<HEAD>Experts: Another Asteroid Will Pass Close, But No Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An asteroid will pass by Earth just a
little more than 8 million miles away this Saturday, the closest
approach since a ``near miss'' in March, but presents no danger to
the planet, astronomers say.
   The asteroid, estimated to be one to two miles across, may be
visible as a faint star, and will grow brighter as it approaches at
20 miles per second, astronomer Billy Cooke said in a release
Tuesday from the University of Florida.
   On March 23, an asteroid came within 450,000 miles of Earth,
which was considered a near miss in astronomical terms.
   Brian Marsden, associate director of the Harvard Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, said Tuesday that the asteroid due
Saturday is the sixth relatively close approach this year. He
called the number a ``statistical fluke.''
   Marsden said no one should worry about this or any other known
asteroid _ the one that hits probably won't be spotted until it's
too late to do anything.
   ``It's not a question of if an asteroid will hit us, but when,''
Cooke said. ``And it will make earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and
other natural disasters pale in comparison to its destructive
force.''
   Some astronomers believe an asteroid larger than a quarter mile
across hits the Earth once about every 50,000 years. The last
crater formed by an asteroid occurred in Arizona about 50,000 years
ago, Cooke said.
   An asteroid that struck the Earth 65 million years ago may have
wiped out the last of the dinosaurs, some scientists believe.
   Such a strike today would have effects similar to nuclear war
without the radiation. It would level buildings for several hundred
miles and would create giant tidal waves, Cooke said.
   Scientists in the 1960s and 1970s thought asteroids that pass by
Earth were rare; today they believe there may be hundreds and
possibly thousands of them. It is unclear if there are more
asteroids or if astronomers have simply become better at finding
them, Cooke said.

   A new public service announcement against
capital punishment features an unusual cast of characters: the
homeless.
   The Amnesty International television commercial, to be offered
soon for international broadcasts, uses 50 homeless people.
   ``I didn't want people that were well-fed, happy human beings,
to try to pull off the roles of people all over the world who have
been imprisoned for long periods of time,'' said commercial
director Tony Bill, who co-produced ``The Sting'' and directed ``My
Bodyguard.''
   ``The homeless are disenfranchised people, and they are people
who are, in effect, oppressed,'' said Bill, who like others donated
work for the project.
   The black-and-white ads cast the homeless as prisoners facing
execution, their heads covered in bags before an imaginary killing.
The 30- and 60-second commercials conclude with the shot of a
falling guillotine blade.
   Bill said the faces of the homeless, unlike those of
professional actors, naturally are filled with hopelessness and
defeat.
   ``I think by seeing them on the screen, your attention is drawn
to them,'' Bill said. ``We're talking about a larger issue. The
homeless people sort of represent people in prison.''
   Bill, who runs the Venice restaurant, selected his cast from the
crowds of people who gather for a free meal the restaurant provides
every Tuesday. Those cast were paid $40 for the one-day commercial
shooting and given lunch.
   ``The saddest thing was to see them leave at the end of the
shoot,'' said producer Clare Baren of Riverrun Films. ``It was
horrible to think where they were going back to. They were just
really terrific people.''
   The commercial's makers hope television stations across the
country and around the globe will broadcast the spot. It also will
be shown at the commercial competition at Cannes starting June 19.

<TEXT>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Subject: El Paso Intelligence Center.
   Mission: Collect and share with law enforcement agencies
information on drug-, weapon- and alien-smugglers.
   Number of arrests: None.
   ``Our first task is tactical intelligence _ that which the field
agents can use to cause an arrest or seizure,'' says William
Norsworthy, director of the center at Fort Bliss that publishes its
phone number but reveals little else.
   EPIC might tell the Coast Guard where to find a specific
marijuana-laden ship off the Florida coast. Or it might tell the
Texas Department of Public Safety who a certain smuggler hangs
around with.
   But it looks farther downrange, too.
   ``What's going to happen two years from now in what part of the
world? We try to figure that out,'' said Norsworthy.
   At EPIC, representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidence
and piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displays
drug smugglers and other criminal organizations. The law
enforcement consortium doesn't make seizures or arrests and doesn't
take credit for the arrests it produces.
   ``They are our primary source of intelligence,'' said Jim Bowen,
senior tactical coordinator for Operation Alliance, an El
Paso-based union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drug
smugglers along the U.S.-Mexican border. He declined to recount
specific cases in which EPIC information resulted in large-scale
busts.
   EPIC started out in 1974 as the Southwest Border Intelligence
Service, with 35 employees from the Drug Enforcement Administration
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service working in cramped
quarters.
   Four years later it had a congressional mandate, a new name, 106
employees from six federal agencies and 16,000 square feet of space
in central El Paso.
   Now the 15-year-old intelligence network occupies a brand-new,
57,000-square-foot building on Fort Bliss, where 200 employees of
the DEA, INS, Customs Service, Coast Guard, Marshals Service, FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Secret
Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms labor 24 hours
a day.
   Some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles,
but Norsworthy said that's rare at EPIC. ``It's pretty unique in
that we all get along good. After 90 to 120 days, agents lose their
agency identity and become part of EPIC.''
   EPIC gives Operation Alliance ``threat assessments'' _ dossiers
on illegal organizations, along with when and where they are
expected to operate next. It prepares similar assessments for the
Miami-based Lightning Operations Center, which tries to keep drug
shipments out of southern Florida.
   Other information goes to the agencies making up EPIC, the lead
law enforcement agencies in 50 states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Samoa. It gets upwards of
300,000 inquiries a year.
   Usually, when police ask for information, EPIC asks why.
   ``Something made someone make that call _ either he saw or heard
something,'' Norsworthy said. ``We ask for that information, and we
build on that. We look for patterns and trends all the time.''
   Bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle: an ID number
on the tail of a plane, a series of large cash bank deposits and
the sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in an
arrest and seizure.
   Sometimes it turns out that different police agencies are
investigating the same organization but aren't aware of each other.
In those cases, EPIC brings the agencies together and helps plot
investigation strategies.
   Some of the information comes from those cases. Other times,
member federal agencies contribute. Some data come from FBI and DEA
offices abroad.
   Each agent working at EPIC is limited to the investigative
methods his or her agency is permitted under U.S. law; a wiretap,
for example, would require a court order.
   If there's any criticism of EPIC among law enforcement agencies,
it's that the center's computer system needs to be upgraded.
   ``Just bring them up to the state of the art,'' Bowen said.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Coleman, D-Texas, represents the district where
EPIC resides. A few years ago, he helped fight off a proposal to
move it to Washington. Now he would like to improve its computers.
``My goal is to make it the absolute state-of-the-art
intelligence-gathering center in the country,'' he said.
   Just how advanced the computer and communications systems are is
a secret. Norsworthy isn't telling, but he said a police agency
calling EPIC probably will find the information it wants on a
suspect.
   ``If he's ever been the subject of an investigation or an
associate of someone who's been the subject of an investigation,''
he said, ``chances are pretty good.''

   The bombardment of Beirut and the blockade of
its ports has produced an anonymous armada of small craft bringing
in food, ammunition and even whisky to the 1 million trapped
Christians. Here is a report on how it stays afloat.

<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OQAIBEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most nights, a dozen small cargo ships
zigzag through shellfire for ports along Lebanon's Mediterranean
coast to deliver food and ammunition to Christians besieged by
Syria and its Moslem allies.
   Others dart in during daylight, often as shells and rockets
explode around them and knots of people stand on shore and cheer.
   The ships' cargoes have become the lifeline for the estimated 1
million Christians trapped in their enclave north of Beirut.
   ``This is why there are no serious shortages,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
``The ships bring in vegetables, canned fruit and cattle as well as
ammunition.''
   Not all the provisions are essentials. An east Beirut
businessman said one company recently received 11 containers of
whisky.
   The police spokesman said at least 12 ships a day make it
through the Syrian blockade. They dock mainly at Jounieh, 12 miles
north of Beirut, and the ancient port of Byblos, 10 miles farther
north, and at smaller harbors in between.
   Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two
or three ships out of every 15 carry weapons and ammunition from
Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival and the Christians' only ally in the
Middle East.
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
began on March 8 when Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun ordered his
troops, most of whom are Christians, to blockade ports run by
Moslem militias. Fierce artillery battles followed and the Syrians
blockaded Christian ports.
   Despite a cease-fire called by the Arab League on May 11, the
Syrians shell the Christians' coastal strip daily to try to prevent
supplies from reaching Aoun's forces.
   In recent days, the Syrians have deployed navy gunboats to
tighten the blockade, and some cargo ships have been turned back.
   Yet some Christians believe the Syrians are not tightening the
noose as much as they might.
   ``With the firepower the Syrians have they could be doing a lot
more,'' one source said. ``We don't know why there is this
restraint, except possibly because they're not yet prepared to go
all the way.''
   The danger zone is about six miles off the coast.
   Boutros Sassine, 23, was a crewman aboard the 1,000-ton Lebanese
freighter Paula, which took several hits on May 18 as it approached
Oqaibeh, five miles north of Jounieh, with a cargo of food.
   He and three other crewmen were wounded when a Syrian 130mm
shell hit the mast.
   Lying in St. George's Hospital in east Beirut, his head heavily
bandaged, Boutros said the freighter was about five miles off
Oqaibeh ``when the shells started falling all around us.''
   ``Some of them were hitting only a few feet away, sending
cascades of water over us. Then we were hit. I saw my brother
Boulos and the others fall,'' he said.
   ``A fishing boat which was in the vicinity came through the
shelling and took us ashore,'' Boutros said.
   A Christian source said that most of the ship captains come from
the Oqaibeh area.
   ``Their agency pays them about $5,000 a trip,'' he said. ``The
seamen who used to earn $200 a month now get $200 a trip, which
usually lasts between 24 and 48 hours.''
   The ships sail mainly between the Christian enclave and Cyprus,
100 miles to the northeast. But Christian sources reported that
some also pick up cargoes of fruit and vegetables from the southern
ports of Sidon and Tyre, both run by Moslem militias.
   A police spokesman in Sidon said merchants charter boats to take
produce to the Christian enclave.
   ``They don't want to waste their produce,'' he said. ``They're
ready to sell to the devil.''
   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia, which controls Tyre, tried to
stop merchants there from sending goods to east Beirut.
   But sources said the businessmen, who pay hefty fees to Amal,
told the militia they would stop only if the militia bought all
their produce.
   The traffic is not all one-way. About 15,000 Christians have
fled the enclave aboard ferries from Cyprus. The vessels anchor
offshore, and passengers must take a nerve-jangling ride in small
boats in darkness _ and often under shellfre _ to reach the ferries.
   Hundreds more have evacuated aboard a Norwegian Hovercraft, the
Santa Maria, which slips into Jounieh and other ports at night.

   This country's parliament has a
tradition of free public access, so it wasn't much trouble for
about 50 masked intruders to barge into the chamber and rip up
documents as legislators looked on.
   The intruders, said by police to be members of a radical
squatter's organization, fought briefly with unarmed parliament
guards during Tuesday's raid. Police said they arrested about 30,
but the rest escaped.
   It was the first time demonstrators had disturbed a session of
the Folketinget, or parliament, police said
   Parliament's chairman, Erik Ninn-Hansen, said afterward that the
intruders would be prosecuted and that security in Christiansborg
Palace, which houses the parliament, would be reviewed.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 29-year study of cancer in Sweden
shows the rate of cases increased faster among women than men,
especially skin cancer caused by too much sun.
   Malignant melanoma caused by overexposure to ultraviolet rays
was increasing by 6.6 percent a year and ine 1987 represented 3.5
percent of all cancer cases, said Jerzy Einhorn of the Karolinska
Hospital.
   A law requiring doctors to report all cancer cases to a national
registrar since 1958 has yielded ``a unique foundation'' for health
care and planning, since it covers 100 percent of the population in
specific areas, Einhorn said.
   The study, released Tuesday by the hospital, covered Stockholm
and Gotland, a large rural island in the Baltic.
   Sven Tornqvist, who was in charge of the register, said the rate
of all forms of cancer increased by 29 percent for women and 15
percent for men in the Swedish capital from 1958 to 1987. The
figures were higher in Gotland.
   Malignant melanoma ``could become the major form of cancer in
the next century'' because many people who have damaged their skin
have not yet developed the disease, Einhorn said.
   He attributed the increase among Swedes to their more frequent
holiday trips to warmer countries and their penchant for sunbathing.
   One reason for the general rising incidence of cancers is that
people are living longer, Einhorn said.
   Lung cancer was the most common cancer, but it decreased among
men along with a decline in smoking.

   Tourists got an after-hours look at the Roman Forum
and free tours of the ancient ruins, the Palatine Hill and the
Coliseum because of an unusal work protest by the caretakers.
   The Forum is normally closed on Tuesday afternoon, but the
caretakers chose instead to work overtime and give away free
tickets as a way of protesting work conditions and ``Cultural
Ministry bureaucracy.''
   The workers said they want more money and they want the ministry
to train them and offer guided tours of the Forum. They also want
the ministry to hire more people and to keep the site open for more
hours.
   Tourists in Italy often miss the chance to see archeological
sites and musems because of limited visiting hours and recurrent
strikes.
   The unusual protest was designed to gain public support, said a
woman employee who asked not to be identified.
   ``If we stopped work, we would just get a bad press. This way we
can show people that we are also interested in them,'' she said.

   By accusing India of unfair trade
practices, the United States may have dealt a major setback to
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's cautious efforts to open the vast
Indian market to foreign goods.
   In a nation that has long aspired to self-sufficiency and thrown
up a bewildering and costly barricade of red tape to foreign
investment, the few U.S. brand names to reach consumers have
achieved overnight popularity.
   Wrangler jeans, CBS music cassettes and Chesterfield cigarettes
are among American goods that entered India after Gandhi's
government started easing the protectionist policies of his mother
and predecessor, Indira Gandhi.
   Pepsi is poised to follow.
   All are manufactured in India under license and in association
with local partners, with the foreign share limited to 40 percent.
   The opening of Indian markets started in 1985, a few months
after Gandhi took office. But observers say last week's citing of
India under the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act could hurt the process.
   ``The U.S. perception seems to be that it can open up Indian
markets with a crowbar,'' said industrialist Hari Shankar
Singhania. ``From the logical point of view, it is better to use
goodwill.''
   ``Maybe they got impatient. I doubt whether the intended results
will follow _ and maybe contrary reactions will set in,'' he added.
   In an editorial entitled ``A Super Folly,'' the pro-government
Hindustan Times said: ``By branding India as an unfair trade
partner at a time when the country is attempting to move towards
more open trade, the U.S. runs the risk of reversing the tide of
opinion building up in favor of liberalization.''
   A U.S. Embassy official acknowledged India had eased its trade
restrictions but said much remains to be done.
   ``There has definitely been some liberalization, but there is a
considerable distance to go,'' he said, speaking on condition he
not be identified further.
   Washington accused India of violating the 1988 trade act by
impeding direct foreign investment and closing its insurance market
to foreign companies. The law allows the United States to impose
tariffs of 100 percent on goods from India if negotiations fail to
remove the barriers within 18 months.
   Despite its tentative reforms, India still levies customs duties
in excess of 200 percent on some foreign goods and industrial
components.
   The government has yet to respond to the American invitation for
negotiations. Its only comments have been that the U.S. action is
unfair and irrational.
   ``Negotiations cannot be held under threat. How can you expect
any self-respecting country to do it?'' said Singhania, who led a
delegation to the United States earlier this month to try to ward
off the citing of India under the Omnibus Trade Act.
   A U.S. delegation also came to New Delhi earlier this month for
discussions with Indian government officials.
   ``We justified our restrictions because of our balance of
payments constraints,'' said Anwarul Hoda, a Commerce Ministry
official who took part in the talks. ``But even while offering
justifications, we are liberalizing. Our trade has never been so
liberal.''
   Hoda and Singhania noted that India's trade surplus with the
United States has been declining, from $1 billion in 1987 to $700
million in 1988.
   They said Washington's tough measures were unjustified since
India was responsible for less than 1 percent of the United States'
overall trade deficit. Japan, which also was cited, is responsible
for 44 percent. Only one other nation was singled out _ Brazil.
   Both Hoda and Singhania acknowledged the tremendous appeal of
U.S. goods and services for India's 880 million people.
   ``U.S. brands, techniques and marketing systems are the best in
the world,'' said Singhania, president of the J.K. Organization,
which makes synthetic fabrics, paints and cosmetics.
   Among consumer items, U.S.-franchised stereo cassettes hold a
virtual monopoly in India's Western music market.
   ``CBS cassettes sell very well,'' said Kishore, a salesman at a
New Delhi music shop who declined to give his last name. ``Since
they came in the market, Music India (the major local company) has
dropped.''
   Another indicator of the appeal of American goods is the U.S.
Embassy's semiannual sale of obsolete equipment.
   A weekly news magazine, India Today, said recently that buyers
bid feverishly for 10-year-old air conditioners, sometimes offering
more than the price of a new Indian model, because ``of the strong
mystique of the foreign brand.''

<TEXT>
   People at George Bush's campaign
rallies in southwestern Michigan last year heard first from his
foremost cheerleader, Peter Secchia.
   The outspoken and sometimes abrasive state Republican party
leader positioned himself at the podium for more than an hour
before Bush's arrival and led thousands of supporters in songs
taunting Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   As Michigan's national committeeman since 1980, Secchia never
has been at a loss for words.
   Until now.
   After months of tireless work on Bush's behalf, Secchia was
rewarded with a nomination as ambassador to Italy.
   It initially appeared the 52-year-old Italian-American lumber
magnate would sail through Senate confirmation, but Secchia's
propensity for coarse humor and off-color remarks have haunted him.
   For example:
   _ A few days after Bush's selection of Dan Quayle to run as vice
president, Secchia defended Quayle amid rumors linking him
romantically to a former female lobbyist. ``If that's the only
thing you can say about a 41-year-old man _ that he danced close
with a good-looking woman _ then I think he'll make one hell of a
vice president.''
   _ Secchia doesn't deny he made an offensive hand gesture to a
political foe in the basement of a bar, but after it was reported
called it good-natured political sparring.
   _ A January 1988 Harper's magazine article about the Michigan
GOP portrayed Secchia as a sexist and quoted him as making vulgar
remarks about the size of a woman's breasts. Secchia says he was
misquoted.
   _ In August 1988, Secchia said of his political adversaries, ``I
know what sodomy is because that's what Democrats are always doing
to me.''
   Secchia complains his comments have been misinterpreted, and
that some of the people now judging him in Washington don't
understand his humor.
   There's been grumbling in Italian newspapers over Bush's
selection of an ambassador who is an expert fund-raiser with a
sharp tongue but little foreign policy experience.
   In the Senate, Secchia's confirmation vote was stalled until at
least Wednesday because of concerns of Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   The delay caused Secchia, the grandson of Italian immigrants, to
miss Bush's visit to Italy last week.
   ``He's certainly not pleased ... with reports that the Senate
wants to make him twist in the wind as punishment for so-called
past sins,'' said Jeff Davis, a Secchia employee fielding media
calls. Secchia has declined all requests for interviews since his
confirmation was stalled two weeks ago.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Secchia's
nomination, but Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., warned that
Secchia might be an embarrassment.
   At home in Grand Rapids, those who know Secchia well see him
primarily as a generous, hard-working, good-hearted community
leader _ who just happens to put his foot in his mouth occasionally.
   ``He's a street fighter,'' said businessman Charles Yob, a close
friend and political associate. ``When he wants something, he goes
for it.''
   Even his political foes acknowledge Secchia has been a driving
force in the state Republican Party.
   As chairman and chief executive officer of The Universal Cos.
Inc., the father of four has turned the Grand Rapids business into
a $400 million lumber, restaurant and real estate empire, the
fourth-largest building products distributor in the country.
   He has vowed to tone down his rhetoric when he takes on his new
job in Italy.
   But some of his political adversaries are dubious.
   ``I never suspected I would hear the name Peter Secchia in the
same sentence with the word diplomat,'' said Mark Fox, a Lansing
attorney and deputy state director of Dukakis' campaign.
   ``His mouth works faster than his mind. ... I don't think it'll
be long before he'll put his foot in his mouth when he gets over to
Italy,'' Fox said.
   But others believe Italy will be disarmed.
   ``I get the feeling that he is moving on to a different phase of
his life, where he going to learn and practice the art of
diplomacy. But I know it probably won't come easy,'' national GOP
Committeewoman Ronna Romney said.

   High schools are requiring students to read
almost exactly what they did 25 years ago: heavy on Shakespeare but
light on works by female and minority authors, according to a
survey.
   Eighty-four percent of public high schools assign students
``Romeo and Juliet,'' the tearful Shakespearean play that tops the
list of required works, according to the nationwide survey by the
Center for the Learning &amp; Teaching of Literature at State
University of New York at Albany.
   But only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by
a female author _ ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee. No
works were by minorities, according to the survey of 322 public
schools, 80 Catholic schools and 86 private schools conducted last
spring.
   ``I think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned
with emphasizing good literature. They continue to assign classics
complemented with modern and accessible works,'' said the survey's
author, Arthur N. Applebee.
   ``At the same time, it's disturbing that there are essentially
no books by minority authors working their way into the canons, and
little representation of women.''
   Following ``Romeo and Juliet,'' 81 percent of public high
schools required ``Macbeth.'' ``Huckleberry Finn,'' the classic
Mark Twain novel, was the third most assigned work, with 70 percent
requiring it.
   The rest of the top 10 were, in order, ``Julius Caesar,'' by
Shakespeare, ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' ``The Scarlet Letter,'' by
Nathaniel Hawthorne, ``Of Mice and Men,'' by John Steinbeck,
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' ``The Great Gatsby,'' by F. Scott
Fitzgerald, and ``Lord of the Flies,'' by William Golding.
   The most frequently assigned books by minority authors are
Lorrainne Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' required in 19
percent of schools, and Richard Wright's ``Black Boy,'' required by
7 percent, the survey found.
   Applebee added, however, that commonly used high school
literature anthologies frequently include works by minority and
female authors.
   The survey appeared to answer conservative critics who have
lately accused schools of watering down curricula and retreating
from the classics. Such charges gained currency in the recent
best-sellers ``The Closing of the American Mind'' by Allan Bloom,
and ``Cultural Literacy,'' by E.D. Hirsch.
   The study also showed, surprisingly, that public, private and
Catholic high schools are assigning nearly identical books, said
Applebee.
   At the 80 Catholic schools surveyed, the top-10 list included
the same books as public schools, but in different order.
``Huckleberry Finn'' ranked first, followed by ``The Scarlet
Letter'' and ``Macbeth.''
   ``Macbeth'' topped the list at 86 private schools surveyed.
Unlike public and Catholic schools, that top-10 list included
Homer's epic poem, ``The Odyssey,'' but omitted ``Of Mice and Men.''
   The report replicated a similar survey 25 years ago by the
Educational Testing Service. Shakespeare dominated the list, as he
does now. ``Romeo and Juliet'' replaced ``Macbeth'' in first place,
apparently boosted by the popularity of the film version.
   ``Silas Marner,'' by George Eliot, was the only book showing a
dramatic change in popularity. The 19th century novel about an old
miser who turns to a more human life through his love of a little
girl ranked third 25 years ago, but dropped off the top-10 list in
the latest survey.
   The survey had a margin of error of 3 points.

   In a city where pork bellies have made commodity
traders rich, it took a European, Chef Louis Szathmary, to master
the art of turning goose livers into gold.
   After 26 years, Chef Louis next month is closing his North Side
restaurant called the Bakery.
   ``I grossed more than $1,300,000 a year for 26 years, and that's
only five dinners a week _ no lunch, no bar and no `early birds,'
'' Szathmary said.
   ``Some restaurants give a discount for diners who arrive before
5 p.m., but I never did that because my meat supplier couldn't
guarantee quality that early.''
   The income estimate is even more remarkable in that the Bakery
has never seated more than 170 people at one time, and all of its
five-course dinners had a fixed price: from $5 in 1962 to $25 this
year.
   When Szathmary opened the Bakery, it was one of Chicago's first
restaurants outside of the downtown area to feature classic French
cuisine. Resembling an unpretentious European inn, it also was one
of the first where the food got top billing over the decor.
   It was also a place to sit down and listen to Szathmary
philosophize about food. Every night he was in town, he visited
each table, talking with patrons as he doled out his fresh country
pate.
   ``We have every day fresh flowers, and sometimes the silver
matches, but the important thing is the food on the plate,'' he
said.
   And the food on the plate often is beef Wellington. It may be a
haute cuisine cliche now, but Szathmary made his first hit by
smearing beef with goose liver pate and baking it in a pastry shell.
   ``The food writers joke about beef Wellington now, but they all
raved about it once, and I know 50 percent of our sales after 26
years is still beef Wellington.''
   Other popular items at the Bakery have included pork loin
stuffed with Hungarian sausage and roast duck served with cherry
sauce.
   On his retirement at age 70, Szathmary is giving his
24,000-volume cookbook library to the University of Iowa. Other
items in the collection will go to Johnson &amp; Wales University in
Providence, R.I.
   ``Some of my cookbooks go back to the late 1400s and they may be
important in teaching the history of food,'' he said.
   Some of his more modern works, though, were written by Szathmary
himself, who is the author of ``The Chef's Secret Cookbook,''
``American Gastronomy,'' ``The Chef's New Secret Cookbook,'' ``The
Bakery Restaurant Cookbook'' and the 15-volume ``Cookery
Americana.''
   A native of Transylvania, Szathmary came to this country in
1951, and spent 11 years in food research before becoming a
restaurateur.
   ``I could not do it now,'' he said. ``The restaurant business
has changed too much. ...
   ``One thing I am proud of, though,'' he added. ``I never served
one kiwi fruit.''

<HEAD>Wright Not Saying Yet If He'll Resign; Colleagues Assume He Will</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS graf 5 to restore first reference to The Washington Post</HEAD>

   House Speaker Jim Wright declared Tuesday, ``I
think I know what I should do,'' but didn't say whether that meant
he'd resign over ethics charges. Colleagues assumed he would quit
and were even beginning to push.
   Meanwhile, sources confirmed Tuesday night that the FBI is
conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of payroll
padding on the staff of Rep. William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat
who is seeking a House leadership post.
   Gray, who is seeking the majority whip position in anticipation
of the expected resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, confirmed
earlier in the day that he had been approached by two
Philadelphia-based FBI agents on Monday.
   But Gray denounced as an ``outrageous lie'' a televised report
that he was under criminal investigation.
   CBS and The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as
saying the Justice Department was launching a preliminary criminal
investigation of Wright. Justice Department sources have previously
said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings against
Wright and had not decided whether to look into his financial
dealings.
   The Post also quoted a source as saying Wright planned to
announce his resignation either Wednesday or Thursday, but delay
its effective date so the House ethics committee could rule on
whether he accepted gifts from a business partner with a direct
interest in legislation.
   Wright, after returning from a weekend getaway in Virginia's
Blue Ridge Mountains, told reporters, ``I don't have a statement
right now. I expect to have one before the week's out.''
   ``I think I know what I believe to be in my best interests and
the interests of the institution,'' Wright told reporters as he
returned to the Capitol. ``I want to be fair to myself, my family,
my reputation, and I want to be fair to this institution that I've
served for 34 years.''
   While the Texas Democrat held his cards close, fellow Democrats
were openly angling for leadership posts in what they expected to
be a major shakeup in the House hierarchy.
   A handful of senior lawmakers were pushing for the No. 2 and No.
3 jobs of majority leader and majority whip. That assumes, as most
in th House do, that Wright will soon resign and the current
majority leader, Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, will be elevated
to the speakership.
   The current whip, Rep. Tony Coelho of California, had been
expected to fight for the No. 2 job, but he said Friday he would
resign in the face of separate ethics questions about a bond
investment he made. He said a congressional investigation of that
issue could harm the party.
   Gray said he had been told by FBI agents that he was neither a
target nor a subject of a criminal investigation. But government
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a CBS News
report that the FBI was conducting a preliminary inquiry into
allegations regarding personnel and expenditures in the
congressman's office.
   One source said there were allegations of a no-show employee
being kept on Gray's payroll. The source stressed, however, that
the FBI's inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not
know whether it would lead to a full-scale criminal investigation.
   Though Gray denied that he was a target or subject, under the
FBI's definition of a preliminary inquiry, no one is a subject or
target of such a probe.
   Some Democrats were making clear they were running out of
patience, and one lawmaker pointedly referred to Coelho's
announcement as an example for Wright to follow in deciding what to
do about the ethics committee's allegations of financial
impropriety.
   ``He has to take a hard look at how Coelho conducted himself,''
said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., calling the Californian's gesture
``courageous and selfless.''
   ``It is in the best interests of the institution and the
Democratic Party to get this mess behind us,'' Slattery said.
``Regrettably, that involves the resignation of the speaker.''
   Last week, sources close to Wright said he had all but reached a
decision to resign his leadership post and was leaving for the
weekend to draft a statement, defending himself, that could be
delivered along with the announcement of his resignation as early
as Wednesday. But they also cautioned that Wright was torn between
such a move and fighting the ethics charges to some legal
conclusion.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, said Tuesday, ``I hear that he's
going to resign.'' Wilson, who is a close ally of the speaker but
said he had not talked to him this week, added, ``My personal
opinion is that he'll do it Wednesday or Thursday.''
   One source close to Wright said he did not expect an
announcement until at least Thursday. Another source said the death
Tuesday of Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., could cause Wright to delay
as House members would be involved with attending services for
Congress' oldest member.
   Wright alluded to his legal fight and to a motion to dismiss the
most serious charges against him, telling reporters, ``I'm
convinced our motions are legally well grounded.''
   The ethics committee is due to take up the motion to dismiss
charges at a meeting on Thursday, and it was seen as likely to
reject the defense effort.
   Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the senior Republican on the
ethics committee, said in answer to a question that the panel also
might expand its action to other ethics allegations against Wright,
a reference to Wright's investment in a gas well drilling venture
and a deal involving a nursing home company.
   ``It's possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those
two issues,'' Myers said,
   Wright has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating
House rules, including charges he circumvented limits on outside
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and charges he
improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth, Texas,
businessman with a direct interest in legislation.
   Should Foley be promoted into Wright's job, Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., remains the favorite to succeed him, although Rep.
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., also has expressed interest in the job.
   The most ferocious contest is expected for Coelho's whip post.
Gray, Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich., and Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., are
running, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., also has been mentioned
as a candidate.
   Bonior, already running full-speed, said Tuesday he's telling
colleagues his middle-class constituency makes him the best
candidate.
   The suburban Detroit Democrat claimed 60 solid commitments of
support, slightly less than half the 130 he said he needed to win.
   Bonior said the demographics of his district _ a blue-collar
industrial area seasoned with middle-level managers _ ``is
contrasted, of course, to the constituencies on the West Coast, Mr.
Waxman, and the inner-city constituency of Mr. Gray.''

<HEAD>Court Official Issues Final Recommendations in Louisiana Desegregation
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special official appointed to draft an
integration plan for Louisiana's higher education system
recommended Tuesday that no universities be closed or merged and
that they be governed by a powerful unified board.
   The final recommendation by Paul Verkuil, who was appointed by a
three-judge federal panel, contained few changes compared to his
preliminary proposal April 18, said John Kennedy, an attorney with
Gov. Buddy Roemer's administration.
   ``I don't think this is a cosmetic plan,'' Kennedy said at a
news briefing Tuesday night. ``I think you will look on the
landscape of higher education in five years and it will not be the
same. The changes will be fundamental _ quality and desegregation.''
   The court will have the final say on the plan. Kennedy said he
did not know if the judges would hear further comment from the
parties in the case _ including the predominantly black Southern
University System, the U.S. Justice Department and Grambling State
University's alumni association _ before deciding whether to
approve it.
   Kennedy said Roemer, who had pushed for a single board with
authority to implement desegregation plans, was pleased by
Verkuil's recommendation.
   ``The single board is the linchpin of this whole thing,''
Kennedy said.
   State Sen. William Jefferson of New Orleans, an attorney for the
Southern University System, said he had not seen the recommendation
and declined to comment immediately. Other parties were not
available for immediate comment.
   Verkuil was appointed to draw up a new plan after the court
ruled last year that a 1981 desegregation agreement between the
state and the Justice Department had failed. The plan called
primarily for spending millions of dollars to upgrade faculty,
programs and facilities at Southern and Grambling.
   The dispute began 15 years ago when the Justice Department filed
a lawsuit against the state accusing it of operating a dual system
of higher education for blacks and whites.
   Under the plan recommended Tuesday by Verkuil, president of
William and Mary College in Virginia:
   _ The single governing board would consist of 17 members,
including at least seven blacks. Verkuil said the board should show
a geographic balance, represent all schools and include a student.
   Board members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed
by the state Senate. Members would not have to come from existing
boards.
   Black leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to
the needs of historically black Southern University and Grambling.
   _ All current university systems would be abolished in favor of
one system under the unified board. A new president for higher
education would be selected and an interim president would be
appointed during the search.
   _ Louisiana State University would be the state's flagship
institution with the greatest number of graduate programs and the
toughest admission standards. Currently, all Louisiana colleges
have an open-admissions policy.
   _ A second tier of schools _ Louisiana Tech, Southern University
at Baton Rouge, the University of New Orleans and the University of
Southwestern Louisiana _ would also offer graduate programs, but
fewer than LSU. Those schools would have less stringent admissions
standards.
   Kennedy said Verkuil's recommendation would allow the new board
to add other schools to the second tier.
   Other four-year colleges would have still less restrictive
admissions and limited graduate degree programs.
   _ Two-year community colleges would offer open admissions and be
responsible for most remedial education.
   _ The state must continue to spend money to enhance Southern and
Grambling. Verkuil did not recommend a dollar amount.
   Previous agreements between Grambling and Louisiana Tech to end
program duplication should be carried out, while the LSU and
Southern law schools in Baton Rouge should agree to let students at
one school take courses at the other, Verkuil said.
   Kennedy said Verkuil recognized the state's financial
difficulties, including a projected deficit of more than $700
million for the next fiscal year and possible cuts to higher
education.

   Higher ticket prices, strong long-running
musicals, several acclaimed new plays helped Broadway end its
season with a record box-office take.
   Theaters took in $262 million, up 4 percent over the 1988-89
season's total of $253 million, according to figures released
Tuesday.
   The League of American Theaters and Producers also said
attendance was 8 million, off slightly from last season's record
8.1 million but still higher than the 7 million of two years ago.
   ``It was a good season. It had strong box-office dollars and
solid attendance,'' said George Wachtel, the league's director of
research. ``There were fewer musicals but there were more plays.
Over the last four years, it was one of the best seasons,
attendance-wise.''
   Much of the box-office strength came from long-running musicals
particularly ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables,''
each grossing more than $500,000 a week, and other veteran hits
like ``Cats'' and ``Me and My Girl.''
   The only new musical to demonstrate much box-office muscle is
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' which has been running at slightly
under capacity since it opened in January. The compilation of dance
numbers from some of the choreographer's biggest hits has been
grossing about $520,000 a week.
   It also has a top ticket price of $55.
   The average ticket price rose from $31.10 to $33.90, up 6
percent from last year, the league said. Much of the rise, Wachtel
said, was because theatergoers were paying full price for tickets
to hot shows like ``Phantom'' and ``Les Miserables,'' which are not
available at half-price discount.
   Only seven musicals _ including a revival of ``Ain't Misbehavin'
'' _ opened on Broadway during the 1988-89 season, compared with 15
the previous year. They included such flops as ``Legs Diamond,''
``Chu Chem'' and ``Welcome to the Club,'' as well as such
still-running shows as ``Black and Blue'' and ``Starmites.''
   ``For a variety of reasons, it's becoming increasingly difficult
to mount a large musical,'' Wachtel said. ``But I do look to the
fact that there were two seasons fairly recently when there was as
many as 20 musicals. You have to be optimistic to be in this
business and we are.''
   Twenty-one plays, including nine revivals, opened on Broadway
during the 1988-89 season. Among the biggest successes were Neil
Simon's farce, ``Rumors,'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' which is the favorite to win the best play Tony on
June 4.
   Box-office receipts also climbed for touring productions in the
United States and Canada, jumping to a record $255 million. It was
a 14 percent increase from the previous season's $223 million.

<HEAD>Authorities Use Memories of Cultural Revolution to Fight Students
^Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In their gloves-off campaign to end the
pro-democracy movement, authorities are tapping the painful
memories of the chaotic Cultural Revolution to turn public opinion
against the students.
   But students reject any comparison of their campaign with the
ultra-leftist 1966-76 movement, during which the nation was plunged
into turmoil by young Red Guards unleashed by Mao Tse-tung in a
power struggle.
   Conservative leaders including Premier Li Peng and senior leader
Deng Xiaoping in recent days have increased pressure on students to
stop their 6-week-old protests.
   The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, on Tuesday
published a letter from seven unidentified intellectuals who
chillingly warned of a new Cultural Revolution if the protests did
not cease.
   ``Our middle-aged generation who walked away from the Cultural
Revolution purgatory still can painfully and clearly remember the
lawlessness and turmoil of those 10 years,'' they wrote.
   ``The national economy was on the verge of ruin ... there was no
peace in the party, the country or anywhere.''
   ``We ask all comrades who in those 10 years of catastrophic
terror lost loved ones, wasted their youth and suffered hardship to
call on their sense of responsibility to history and society,'' the
letter said. ``Warn your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat
of this tragedy of history.''
   Chinese in their 30s and older have vivid memories of communist
China's darkest decade, when Mao mobilized millions of youth to
save his revolution from entrenched bureaucrats.
   His Red Guards ruled the streets for two years before the army
was called in to restore order. Gangs of youths tore down temples
and churches, burned books, seized government ministries, ransacked
homes and persecuted intellectuals.
   Estimates of deaths from political turmoil during the decade are
as high as 1 million. Millions more were persecuted and their lives
destroyed.
   Students who have joined this spring's protests are quick to
point that their approach is different.
   This year's demonstrations have been peaceful. Students have
gone out of their way to ensure their marches and sit-ins are
orderly. Beijing's citizens have reacted not with fear but with
heartfelt support, donating money and food to the protesting
students.
   ``We have been calm and orderly,'' said a 22-year-old senior
from Nanjing Polytechnic College. ``If there's turmoil, you can say
it's created by the government.''
   The government cracked down on the protests by declaring martial
law on May 20, but leadership divisions over how to deal with the
students created a bitter power struggle.
   The conservatives appear to have toppled moderate Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly is under house arrest. A
diplomatic source says party documents accuse Zhao of helping
incite demonstrations and of using the student movement in a bid to
seize power.
   The student protesters reject comparison to the Red Guards, who
were called to the streets by Mao as his followers.
   ``I think that up to now, our student movement has not been
exploited by anyone,'' said a senior from Puyang Teachers Academy
in Anhui province. He and other students argue their movement is of
the masses, not of a government faction.
   Although all Chinese share horrific memories of the Cultural
Revolution, not all share the concern that history is poised to
repeat itself.
   ``This time the people want democracy,'' said a 41-year-old
mathematics professor from Beijing Normal University who was in
Tiananmen Square to support the students. ``A second Cultural
Revolution can't come. I am not afraid.''

<HEAD>City Loses Bid to Block Resumption of Pipeline Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday rejected a request
by city officials that he prohibit a pipeline company from resuming
operation of a fuel line that blew up in a deadly fireball last
week.
   City Attorney James Penman said San Bernardino County Superior
Court Judge Ben Kayashima's decision had been expected.
   Penman attorney has unsuccessfully sought to block the Calnev
Pipe Line Co. from resuming pipeline operations or to persuade
Calnev executives to relocate the 14-inch diameter fuel line away
from city residents.
   The devastating explosion, fueled by unleaded gasoline being
pumped through the line, killed two people and injured dozens more
last Thursday.
   A federal investigation into the cause has focused on the
possibility that the pipe was damaged by the wreck of a Southern
Pacific freight train, which derailed in the same area May 12.
   Calnev attorney Charles Diamond said the federal government, not
local government, has sole authority to regulate interstate
commerce, including products shipped by pipeline. Calnev has moved
aggressively to establish federal jurisdiction in the case.
   James J. Manning Jr., another Calnev attorney, told Kayashima
that the fuel company had every intention of abiding by regulations
set by the federal Office of Pipeline Safety. The company will not
open the pipeline without OPS approval, Manning said.
   Penman complained, ``We're having a very difficult time trying
to get Calnev to comply with federal laws and to get OPS to comply
with federal laws.''
   But in issuing his decision, the judge said the 1979 Hazardous
Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 gives the Office of Pipeline Safety
authority to determine pipeline safety.
   In a related development in Los Angeles, Calnev sought a U.S.
District Court order that would effectively force the city to allow
the company to reopen the pipeline in accordance with federal
regulations.
   Over the weekend, Calnev obtained a similar federal order
prohibiting city officials from interfering with the repair and
replacement of the damaged 14-inch diameter pipeline.
   Penman vowed to continue the fight, but conceded the city faces
an uphill battle.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Granted, it was a less-than-elegant
paraphrase of the solemn pronouncement of the North Atlantic
Council. Sixteen heads of state in summit conference assembled, and
President Bush summarizes a line of their communique as ``blah,
blah.''
   But no offense intended. He was just skipping over words,
hurrying to get to the heavy stuff. And nobody cared more about the
heavy stuff than George Bush.
   It gave Bush, by his account, a double hit. He did keep
reminding himself, out loud, that this was good for the alliance,
not only the United States. Or George Bush, president thereof.
   After weeks of taking flak while Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev took bows for his arms-control offensive, Bush had his
own, dramatic proposal in place, with the blessings of the NATO
summit.
   His euphoria was showing.
   At a Brussels news conference, the president was asked why his
arms offer didn't seek to eliminate nuclear weapons. Bush said
repeatedly that the West proposes to reduce nuclear weaponry, not
go to zero.
   ``Well,'' he said, ``the communique addresses itself to where
nuclear forces are concerned'' _ and stopped reading the text.
   ``Blah, blah,'' he abbreviated. ``Land, sea, air-based systems,
including ground-based missiles _ in the present circumstances as
far as can be foreseen, they'll be needed in Europe.''
   And when will the alliance get rolling with a specific
negotiating offer on the Bush plan? The president lapsed into
NATO-speak:
   ``NATO is tasked to be back on September 7th, with our internals
to be farther along.
   ``... We all remember September 7th, don't we?'' he asked, and
laughed.
   That's the day the campaigning Bush pronounced to be Pearl
Harbor Day, three months ahead of the real one on December 7.
   He also laughed when asked whether his attitude toward the
critics is now ``I told you so.''
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``Not really. No, listen, I'm not going
to get into that game with Congress, or anyone else.''
   But it wasn't the only game in town, Brussels or Bonn.
   Bush was so enthusiastic he even waived his rule against talking
to reporters at photo-taking sessions, briefly, on Tuesday. ``We'll
make an exception ... just to say, yes, I'm very pleased. ... It
was a united alliance; plenty of credit for everybody there.''
   That was at the headquarters of the European Community, where
Bush's exit was briefly delayed when he tried to make his way
through the middle of a brown curtain that had no opening in it. He
flailed briefly, then went around end.
   At the American School in Brussels, he rated the summit
``marvelous.'' At the Chancellery in Bonn, he said it had been good
for the United States, good for NATO, good for West Germany, and
could be good for the Soviet Union, too.
   Was the president feeling up?
   ``Have you ever seen him down?'' said Mrs. Bush as they flew to
Bonn.
   ``You are a friend among friends,'' West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl told the president in welcome. He'd been in Brussels,
too, and got back shortly before the ceremony.
   Never mind the weeks of friction between Bonn and Washington
over German demands for quick negotiations seeking cutbacks in
short-range nuclear missiles. ``I told him that I don't believe
German-American relations have ever been better,'' the president
said.
   The short-range missile compromise may yet come back to haunt
Kohl politically, although he said Tuesday the Bush visit would be
a boost in the 1990 West German elections.
   Maybe Bush's upbeat mood about the NATO summit was catching.
``There are only winners,'' said Kohl, who, if he was one,
certainly didn't win much.

<HEAD>Experts Say Soviets Still Understate Military Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
disclosed a level of military spending nearly four times as high as
the Kremlin has admitted in the past, but U.S. analysts say his
estimate is still low though likely to rise as economic reforms
continue in Moscow.
   ``The Gorbachev figure seems quite short,'' said Abraham Becker,
a RAND Corp. analyst who has published numerous studies on Soviet
military spending.
   Another U.S.-based expert on the Soviet economy, Jan Vanous of
Planecon, says Gorbachev's figure is ``kind of low'' and ``raises
more questions than it answers.''
   Gorbachev, in what was hailed in Moscow as a breakthrough for
``glasnost,'' or openness, said the Soviet Union spends 77.3
billion rubles, or $118 billion per year at the rate of exchange
set by the Kremlin, compared with the figure of $32 billion
announced by Soviet officials last October.
   The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Soviet defense
spending at 115 billion rubles to 125 billion rubles, and says that
roughly equals the $300 billion that the Pentagon spends annually,
according to Richard Kaufman, an expert with the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress.
   That committee annually publishes the authoritative U.S.
analysis of the Soviet economy by the CIA and the Pentagon's
Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Converting the ruble figure directly to dollars is virtually
meaningless, the experts said, because the Kremlin uses several
rates of exchange and the Armed Forces have access to materials and
devices that are simply not available to civilian enterprises.
   Moreover, they said, the ruble estimate likely will increase
considerably when the Soviets carry through long-promised changes
in wholesale prices.
   Becker, Vanous and other experts predicted that Gorbachev's
announcement would fuel Soviet discussion on military spending,
producing yet higher estimates and a lively political fight between
reformers and conservatives.
   ``The most important thing about the figure offered by Gorbachev
is not the number itself but the debate that it is going to start
in the Soviet Union,'' said Ed Hewett of the Brookings Institution
in Washington.
   Hewett compared arguments raging over the Soviet spending
deficit, which was disclosed for the first time last October after
the Kremlin for years had claimed to have a balanced budget. Since
last fall, the figure has been revised upward by several noted
Soviet economists, none of whom appear to have definitive figures,
said Hewett.
   Gorbachev did not break down Soviet military spending by
category, and his number did not appear to include research and
development costs, estimated at more than 11 billion rubles by
Vanous.
   The biggest discrepancy, said U.S. analysts, is that Soviet
military prices are based on artificially low production costs
rather than the true market value of goods.
   ``The Soviets have an acute shortage of micro-computers,''
Vanous said by way of example. ``It is impossible to get them in
the civilian sector. If there was a meaningful market, the price
would be quite high.''
   ``The micro-computers that go into MiG (fighters) don't cost
very much, but there are enterprises in the civilian economy that
would be willing to bid five or six times as much'' as the military
pays for them, said Vanous, a Czechoslovakian emigre whose firm
specializes in Soviet Bloc economies.
   The military also consumes expensive metal alloys that simply
are unavailable to the rest of the economy, he said.
   Moreover, there are numerous hidden military costs, such as
armaments sold to client states on favorable terms or the extensive
civil defense system, including hardening of some subway lines
against nuclear attack, which are not included in the defense
budget, said Vanous.
   Gorbachev's ``number makes it clear that the government lied in
the past,'' said Vanous. ``It lied a lot in the past and now it
will lie a little bit. Gorbachev's announcement has legitimized
debate on this issue.''
   Soviet reformers have been pressing the Soviet Defense Ministry
for more than a year to provide a more accurate accounting.
   Gorbachev said defense spending would be cut by 13 percent and
the savings channeled into social services, a course advocated by
the reformers.
   According to the figure provided by Gorbachev, the Soviets spend
about 9 percent of their gross national product on defense. The CIA
estimates that the Soviets spend 15 percent to 17 percent of GNP,
compared with 6 percent for the United States. Because the U.S.
economy is twice as large as that of the Soviet Union, the
superpowers' spending is not far apart, said Kaufman.
   The CIA makes its estimates by observing Soviet military
production and activities, then calculating what they should cost,
said Kaufman.

<TEXT>
   From socialist France, traditionally
wary of American influence in Europe, to conservative Britain,
eagle-eyed for any sign of U.S. isolationism, the Europeans are
crediting President Bush with seizing back the arms control
initiative for the West.
   For Bush, the NATO summit marked an impressive debut with
America's often restive West European allies.
   Gone are the grumblings about Bush's getting off to a slow
start, leaving foreign policy vaccuums and letting Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev hog the stage.
   And the plaudits were a good deal more than official courtesy
demanded.
   ``Mr. Bush is a very sympathetic man. ... He looks toward
Europe, he has a feeling for Europe, he is an understanding ally,''
French President Francois Mitterrand told a news conference at the
end of the two-day summit Tuesday.
   Bush scored his biggest hit by unveiling sweeping proposals for
big cuts in American and Soviet troops strengths and conventional
arms in Europe.
   The initiative, presented as a challenge to Gorbachev, could end
the much-feared Soviet superiority in conventional weapons.
   It also was a major factor in pushing the divided Europeans into
an agreement on the future of short-range nuclear missiles, by
tying negotiations to the implementation of an accelerated
conventional arms agreement.
   Even British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has said in
the past that any cut in U.S. troop levels in Europe would send the
wrong signal to the Soviets, welcomed the prospect of troop
reductions to 275,000 soldiers each.
   Along with the other NATO leaders, she said the plan had been
the key factor in averting a deadlock over the future of
short-range nuclear missiles.
   Immediately after Bush unveiled the offer in a closed-door
meeting of the allies, Mrs. Thatcher said the president had
``transformed the summit.''
   ``His leadership set the tone for the whole meeting,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner.
   With a last-minute compromise, the allies agreed to superpower
negotiations to reduce the weapons, but only on strict conditions
linked to progress on both getting and carrying out conventional
arms cuts.
   ``I think he has given a very clear lead,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
``But I never had much doubt about the quality of (his) leadership.
I much prefer a leader to be measured rather than dashing into
things. ... In the long run you get policies right.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who had an exceptionally close relationship with
former President Ronald Reagan, appeared at the summit to strike a
good personal note with Bush.
   Because of the alphabetical arrangement _ United Kingdom and
United States _ the two leaders sat next to each other throughout
the summit and usually left meetings chatting together.
   British officials said they had no sense that Bush's proposals
to withdraw some American troops reflected a desire for the United
States to loosen the costly ties that now bind it to Western
Europe's defense.
   ``We saw it seizing back the arms control initiative ... and
that's not to be sneezed at,'' said a senior British official.
   Said Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez: ``European unity is
reaffirmed.''
   For Bush, it seemed, at least for now, things could not have
gone better.
   ``I was elected to do what I think is right,'' he said. ``I have
been told by others here that the allies really have never had a
meeting that is more upbeat. ... Whatever political arrows may have
been fired my way, it's all been worth it.''

<TEXT>
   A report by an anti-nuclear group that
spotlights the worst-run commercial reactors may inadvertently give
the industry some solace.
   Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, which advocates a
phased shutdown of the nuclear industry, issued a ``Nuclear
Lemons'' report Tuesday identifying what it called the 20 least
safe and economic nuclear power reactors.
   The report, based on government and industry documents mostly
for 1987 and 1988 activity, said six of the 10 worst reactors were
in Florida, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. It said these pose a public
health risk and should be shut down permanently.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses and monitors
safety at all commercial reactors, declined comment on the report.
The commission is due Thursday to issue its regular semi-annual
report on the worst-run nuclear plants.
   The Public Citizen report, while identifying the industry's weak
performers, also contained information that points to some overall
improvement in safety.
   For example, it reported that Detroit Edison Co.'s Fermi-2
reactor, situated near Newport, Mich., ranked fifth-worst in the
industry, based in part on the number of its emergency shutdowns
over the past two years. The plant was forced to temporarily shut
down seven times in 1987 and five times last year.
   That is a substantial improvement, however, over its record as
described in Public Citizen's 1988 ``Nuclear Lemons'' report that
also rated Fermi-2 fifth-worst overall. That report said Fermi-2
had 30 emergency shutdowns in 1985 and eight the following year.
   Also, this year's report said the 1987-88 industry average for
emergency shutdowns was 3.5, compared with a 7.4 percent average
for the previous two years.
   Public Citizen's figures also showed that the total amount of
radiation to which workers were exposed at the worst-performing
plants in 1987 was down by about 20 percent from the average
exposure level at the worst reactors in last year's report.
   The economics of nuclear power, however, did not show a similar
improvement.
   This year's report said the average operating and maintenance
costs at the least efficient reactors averaged $72 per kilowatt of
power generated in 1987, the latest year for which such data was
available. Last year's report cited a $65-per-kilowatt average for
1986.
   Public Citizen said the No. 3 reactor at the Turkey Point
nuclear station near Florida City, Fla., was the worst in the
industry, based mainly on a low rating for plant management and a
relatively high incidence of ``forced outages,'' or unplanned
shutdowns.
   The No. 4 reactor at the same station was rated 10th worst.
   Carl Pounds, a spokesman for Florida Power &amp; Light Co., which
owns the Turkey Point reactors, said the report masked a ``vast
improvement'' in the plants' performance in 1988. He said, for
example, that the number of Turkey Point regulatory violations fell
to 29 last year from 37 the year before.
   Pounds said Public Citizen used ``a grab bag list of NRC
reports'' to reach its conclusions.
   ``I would characterize it as perhaps a distorted view of nuclear
performance that is designed to create fear and apprehension among
the public,'' he said.
   Public Citizen rated each nuclear reactor on 10 different
indicators of economy and safety.
   Included on Public Citizen's list is the problem-plagued Rancho
Seco plant, near Sacramento, Calif., the object of more NRC
inspections over the last three years than any of the nation's
other 109 operating reactors.
   Sacramento residents vote next week on whether to permanently
shut Rancho Seco.
   The report said six reactors ranked among the worst in six of
the 10 categories. In addition to Turkey Point No. 3 and Rancho
Seco, these were Oyster Creek No. 1, of Forked River, N.J.; the No.
2 and 3 units at Peach Bottom, in Pennsylvania, and the Fermi-2
plant near Newport, Mich.
   Public Citizen said four reactors scored among the worst in five
of its categories. These were Sequoyah units 1 and 2, near Daisy,
Tenn.; the Pilgrim No. 1 reactor near Plymouth, Mass., and the
Turkey Point No. 4 reactor.

the AIDS virus has been developed by federal scientists, providing
researchers with a laboratory animal to test drugs and vaccines for
combating the fatal disease.
   Dr. Thomas J. Kindt of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases said Tuesday that because of the new technique,
laboratories everywhere will be able to use the New Zealand white
rabbit as a model for studying infections of the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
   Research into AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has
been severely handicapped because there has been no animal model to
test treatment agents for the disease.
   Kindt said the rabbit now can provide that model.
   ``If you inject this animal with human cells infected with HIV,
the infection will take in the rabbit,'' he said. Within four weeks
after the injection, the rabbit's immune system starts showing
signs of reacting to the virus, a finding that is called
seroconversion.
   Once this has occurred, Kindt said the rabbit could be used to
test drug treatments for the disease.
   Kindt said the rabbit could also be used to test candidate AIDS
vaccines.
   ``We could inject the rabbit with the vaccine and then after a
period of time challenge it with the HIV cells and see if it
reacted to the virus,'' he said.
   Until now, the chimpanzee has been the only non-human animal
that can contract true AIDS and, thus, could be used as a model for
studying the disease. But chimps are becoming increasing rare and
now typically cost up to $60,000 each, said Kindt. New Zealand
white rabbits cost about $40 each and a good breeding pair can
produce up to three litters a year, generally with eight rabbits
per litter.
   ``A very immediate and urgent need exists for thousands of
experimental animals to test promising agents already used
effectively (in test tubes) and others proposed for use against
AIDS,'' said Kindt.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has announced that
there are at least 100 anti-AIDS drugs, vaccines and other agents
that are stalled in development because there is no appropriate
animal model available for testing.
   Kindt said that the rabbit, when exposed to HIV, develops some
of the classic human symptoms of AIDS, including enlarged lymph,
spleen and thymus glands and a decline in the numbers of healthy
T-cells, one of the immune system cells.
   Typically, he said, a rabbit infected with AIDS can live for
about a year, unless it develops a major secondary infection, which
is common because AIDS destroys the immune system. Uninfected
rabbits, said Kindt, will live up to five years.
   The method of giving the rabbit AIDS involves injecting it with
about five million infected human cells. Seroconversion follows in
about four weeks. The process can be speeded up, said Kindt, by the
injection of about 50 million infected human cells.
   Kindt said that new studies need to be conducted to see if a
rabbit infected with the AIDS virus can spread the disease to other
rabbits through sexual intercourse, a common way of spreading the
disease among humans.
   He said tests have shown that AIDS can be spread between the
laboratory animals by injecting blood from an infected rabbit into
another rabbit. AIDS is often spread among human drug users who
share needles or syringes.
   Kindt led a team of NIH scientists that developed the technique
to infect the laboratory rabbits. Others on the team are Dr.
Henrietta Kulaga, Dr. Thomas M. Folks, and Rosamond A. Rutledge.
   A license to commercially produce the laboratory rabbit for AIDS
research has been given to RRI Inc., a newly organized company, by
the NIH. Kindt said the company plans to produce about 3,000
rabbits annually at a biologically secure laboratory in Frederick,
Md. Other facilities are to be built later in Canada, Italy and
Japan, to make the animal available to researchers worldwide.

   Democratic congressional leaders who had
fretted at the slow pace of the new administration's foreign policy
formulation now are singing President Bush's praises for his
initiatives on arms control at the NATO summit.
   What had been a chorus of criticism turned into a crescendo of
applause Tuesday as Bush emerged from Brussels, Belgium, with the
NATO alliance solidly behind the new U.S. proposal on conventional
arms cuts, and united again on short-range nuclear missile strategy.
   ``We may be at an important turning point in history, one in
which the security environment in Europe can be transformed,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
   ``The specter of war which has haunted that continent throughout
the 20th century may be receding,'' said Michell, who previously
had criticized Bush as slow to respond to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's disarmament initiatives.
   ``The president hit all the right chords with his proposals on
conventional arms reductions in Europe,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Aspin said, ``the agreement seems to guard against
denuclearization of Europe, which was his and (British Prime
Minister) Margaret Thatcher's greatest fear.''
   Aspin, long a watchdog of Pentagon spending, added there could
be ``substantial'' savings for U.S. taxpayers if Bush convinces the
Soviets to buy his plan for deep troop cuts in Europe.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said
Bush's proposal underscores ``the dangerous Soviet conventional
(weapons) advantages'' and gives NATO a ``sound negotiating
position.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said, ``I applaud and very much support the
president's decision to move along this path.''
   ``I trust that this proposal will be approved by our NATO allies
and by the Soviets,'' said Pell.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Gorbachev and Bush now have
created ``a once-in-a-century opportunity to transform the
East-West security relationship.''
   ``With his latest proposals, the president has shown that he is
convinced that Gorbachev is ready to change the military balance in
Europe, and that he is willing to commit the U.S. to be an active
partner in this process,'' Levin said.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Foreign
Relations subcommittee on European affairs, said Bush put ``a very
substantive'' conventional arms proposal on the table, along with
``a politically necessary'' nuclear proposal.
   ``He has demonstrated an understanding of the dynamic at work in
NATO in terms of responding to Gorbachev,'' Biden said.
   Moreover, the president has silenced, at least for the moment,
those who criticized his allegedly dilatory start in coming to
grips with the challenge poised by the Gorbachev inititives, Biden
said.
   ``The time had nearly run out and I think he took it right up to
the wire,'' Biden said. ``But I think it's sort of a vindication
for him.''

   The military seems to be proving every cloud
has a silver lining, even when the cloud is created by a destroyed
missile.
   The Air Force on Tuesday offered a ``good news'' story, although
it looked like some stretching. The military frequently criticizes
the press for reporting only ``bad news'' stories, ignoring all the
good things that happen inside today's armed forces.
   Recall, first, that on May 11 the Air Force conducted the first
test flight of the new Midgetman long-range nuclear missile. The
missile had to be destroyed by a range safety officer when it went
out of control, apparently because of a second-stage rocket nozzle
malfunction.
   Tuesday, the Air Force issued a press release that began: ``The
Air Force announced today the first flight of the (Midgetman)
achieved almost 85 percent of its mission objectives, instead of
the previously announced 50 percent.''
   It seems that staying up in the air is only 15 percent of the
objective.

<HEAD>Sailor Named in Insurance Policy Blames Inexperience for Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sailor named as beneficiary of a
life-insurance policy of a buddy who died in the explosion aboard
the USS Iowa says many of the crew working in the gun turret where
the blast occurred lacked experience and had never worked together.
   Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt told reporters Tuesday
the crew was hastily assembled before the April 19 exercise and gun
turret No. 2 was undermanned by as many as 30 positions.
   ``The gun crew never worked together. This was to be their first
shoot,'' Truitt said.
   Truitt said a number of experienced crew members did not report
for duty and were replaced with less experienced sailors.
   ``Some of the people that were missing had relatively key places
and possibly inexperienced people had to be put in their jobs to
fill them,'' Truitt told a news conference.
   Truitt said his friend Clayton Hartwig, the crew head killed in
the blast, was assigned to participate in the exercise at the last
minute.
   Fred P. Moosally, the Iowa's captain, has said his best gun crew
manned the No. 2 turret. The Navy has also said such crews are not
always fully staffed during peacetime exercises.
   Truitt and his attorney, Ellis Rubin of Miami, suggested the
explosion that killed 47 sailors may have occurred when an
inexperienced sailor pushed bags of gun powder too quickly into the
magazine of the gun.
   Pushing the bags too quickly against the projectile could cause
friction and heat that could spark an explosion, Rubin said. Truitt
said the sailor assigned that job was barely qualified for the
position.
   ``I want the Navy to tell us he was qualified, and was tested
and instructed in this delicate job,'' Rubin said. He declined to
release the name of the deceased sailor.
   Rubin said Truitt told Navy officials he believed the explosion
was sparked by a too rapid a loading of the powder bags.
   The attorney also suggested that the gunpowder in the bags was
volatile because it had been improperly subjected to high
temperatures during storage.
   The Navy has acknowledged the powder was not properly stored but
said chemical tests indicated faulty storage had not made it more
explosive.
   Rubin demanded an apology from the Navy for news leaks he said
falsely linked his client to a murder-suicide plot with Hartwig.
   ``We are asking from an identified spokesman in the Navy, that
they clear this gunner mate's name,'' Rubin said.
   According to published reports, the Navy has investigated the
relationship between Truitt and Hartwig, who named his friend as
sole beneficiary in a $50,000 double-indemnity life-insurance
policy.
   The Navy, however, issued a statement saying that it has made no
official finding ``regarding possible culpability, nor made any
allegations concerning any individual as it relates to the
explosion which occurred aboard the USS Iowa on April 19, and
considers actions of that nature to be premature, speculative and
not in the best interests of the naval service or any of the people
or families involved.''
   The Navy said it would release findings of its investigation
when it was completed.

<HEAD>UPI Reporter Says He Was Fired For Turning Over Book</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A reporter for United Press International says
he was fired for refusing to let his bosses look at a book he is
writing about the news service.
   ``I'm outraged, but not surprised,'' said Gregory Gordon, who
had been a UPI reporter for nearly 18 years, much of it as the
service's chief investigative reporter.
   ``We asked to see the manuscript, not to censor it,'' said Al
Rossiter Jr., executive editor of UPI. ``He was dismissed because
he refused to assure UPI that the book he is writing about UPI is
beneficial to the company and that it was not a conflict of
interest between him and UPI.''
   Rossiter said a conflict of interest would be if Gordon ``were
writing something derogatory about UPI.''
   Gordon is co-author of the book, ``Down to the Wire,'' with Ron
Cohen, who was fired three years ago as UPI's managing editor. The
book, to be published next January, describes ``the last decade of
UPI's fight for survival,'' Cohen said.
   Gordon said that on his return from his honeymoon in early May,
he was asked the status of the book by Rossiter. A week later, he
said, he received a letter asking either for a review of the
manuscript or ``a written declaration that it contains nothing
derogatory about UPI, its managment or its ownership.''
   Gordon said the news service's managment knew he and Cohen were
writing the book, for which 200 people _ mostly present and former
employees of UPI _ were interviewed.
   ``I told him the book was written by two people who had a
combined 43 years with UPI and we were very sympathetic to the
institution,'' Gordon said. ``He said they needed to see the
manuscript. I told Jim Arnold, senior vice president of UPI, that I
was shocked that a wire service that for years fought for the First
Amendment, would follow such a course.''

   A woman who went to court to prove she's
the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams Sr. will make
her professional singing debut Sunday at a festival honoring her
late father.
   ``I'm going to do it for a tribute to my father,'' said Cathy
Deupree Adkinson, who was born in Montgomery five days after
Williams died on Jan. 1, 1953.
   As a professional singer, Mrs. Adkinson is using the name ``Jett
Williams,'' which combines the last names of her parents.
   Mrs. Adkinson plans to sing several of her father's songs at the
Hank Williams Memorial Association's annual music festival Sunday
in Evergreen, 75 miles southwest of Montgomery. She will be
accompanied by two members of his original Drifting Cowboys band.
   She was born Antha Belle Jett, the daughter of Nashville, Tenn.,
secretary Bobbie Jett, with whom Williams lived during the summer
of 1952 but never married. An Alabama judge ruled in 1987 that Mrs.
Adkinson is Williams' daughter.
   The only child from Williams' two marriages is entertainer Hank
Williams Jr.

   A prosecutor said charges won't be filed
against actor Timothy Bottoms, who was booked after a motorist told
authorities that the actor confronted him with a gun.
   ``He did have a gun, but he didn't display it in a rude, angry
or threatening manner as required,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Don Grant.
   Bottoms was booked for investigation of brandishing a gun on a
road, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor, after
the motorist told the California Highway Patrol he was confronted
by the actor on U.S. 101 on May 10.
   The decision not to file charges against ``The Last Picture
Show'' actor was made last week, Grant said.
   Bottoms had a .22-caliber pistol and ammunition in his station
wagon when it was pulled over by officers, but the weapon wasn't
loaded, Grant said.
   The actor's spokesman, Sandy Bresler, has declined comment.
   Bottoms, 37, made his film debut in 1971 in the movie ``Johnny
Got His Gun.'' His other films include ``The Paper Chase'' in 1973
and ``Invaders From Mars'' in 1986.

wasn't wearing a white hat.
   Wearing a black hat and packing pistols, Lyden rode down Main

   ``I'm dumbfounded by the overwhelming response,'' said Lyden,
who was born in Hildreth 83 years ago and graduated from high

south-central Nebraska, a few miles from the Kansas border.
   ``I never thought this recognition would happen to me,'' Lyden
said as he signed an autograph for a young fan.
   Lyden's career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s, mainly in
``B'' movies although his credits include ``The Gunfighter'' with
Gregory Peck and ``Red River'' with John Wayne.
   Lyden said he once tried to be a movie ``good guy.''
   ``I shaved off my moustache and even put on a white hat, but it
didn't do any good,'' he said. ``Hollywood had me typecast as a bad

   ``Most people that have exotic tastes want something clean, not
too much cleanup, easy maintenance, and it is a conversation

   A model of the multimillion-dollar monument
designed to symbolize Los Angeles was ridiculed when it was
unveiled six months ago, but it got a warmer reception up north.
   The ``Steel Cloud'' model has been on display in San Francisco.
   ``I really hope it gets built,'' said San Francisco architect
Michael Harris.
   The model is a replica of the $33 million project backers hope
will span over the Hollywood Freeway as Los Angeles' answer to the
Statue of Liberty.
   The conglomeration of structures would house museums, gigantic
aquariums, theaters and eateries. It would be propped up on a grid
of exposed steel beams.
   Some critics of the project say it looks like the ruins left by
an earthquake, but supporters say the design is gaining acclaim.
   ``To me it symbolizes the openness of L.A.,'' said architect
Mark Horton, a director of the Art &amp; Architecture Exhibition Space,
where the model is on display.
   ``We've been moving very fast,'' said Nick Patsaouras, chairman
of the privately funded West Coast Gateway Committee, which is
trying to get the project literally off the ground.
   ``People have begun to take the work more seriously,'' said
architect Hani Rashid, the 30-year-old New Yorker who designed the
monument. ``It's not so much a one-liner joke any more.''

   Indiana Jones liberated the Holy Grail from the
Nazis and delivered a treasure to box offices across the country: a
record $46.9 million in ticket sales in its first six days.
   ``Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade,'' the third and presumably
final installment in the adventures of Steven Spielberg's
archaeologist, also toppled records for week, weekend and
single-day admissions, according to figures released Tuesday.
   ``It's been fantastic,'' said George Pappas, assistant manager
of downtown Philadelphia's Sameric 4. ``On opening day, we had
people lining up at 8:30 a.m. for the 8 p.m. show. First time I've
ever seen that for a movie.''
   ``I haven't been home since last Wednesday,'' when the
consistently sold-out show opened, said John Pellegrino, manager of
the Loews 34th Street Showplace in New York
   Russell Duncan, regional marketing manager for General Cinema
Theaters in Chicago, said ``The Last Crusade'' was going ``like
gangbusters _ they love it.'' It was being shown in 11 of the
company's area theaters.
   ``The Last Crusade,'' which opened May 24 on 2,327 screens, set
a mark for the largest single-day gate in movie history, selling
$11.2 million in admissions on Saturday alone. For the four-day
Memorial Day weekend, it grossed $37 million.
   By comparison, last year's mega-hit ``Rain Man'' collected $7
million in its opening three-day weekend.
   The previous six-day record-holder, Paramount's ``Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom,'' gathered $42.3 million in 1984 and drew
$45.7 million for its first full week, also the previous mark.
   The former single-day mark was held by Paramount's 1987 hit
``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' which sold $9.7 million its first
Saturday and $33 million in its opening four-day weekend.
   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' took second on last weekend's
box-office charts with $6.1 million, followed by ``Field of
Dreams'' in third with $5.7 million and ``Road House'' in fourth
with $5 million, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
   In fifth place was the most immediate victim of ``The Last
Crusade'' assault, Clint Eastwood's new movie ``Pink Cadillac,''
which opened last weekend with $4.4 million.
   In sixth was ``K-9'' with $3.1 million, ``Pet Sematary'' in
seventh with $2.6 million, ``Major League'' in eighth with $1.4
million.
   The Oscar-favorite ``Rain Man'' finished in ninth with $1.2
million, bringing its box-office receipts to $165.3 million after
24 weeks. ``Scandal'' finished in 10th with $1 million.
   ``The Last Crusade's'' fortunes were boosted by a barrage of
holiday vacationers and higher ticket prices in many of the
country's movie houses. In Los Angeles, for example, some theaters
charged $7, a dollar more than usual.
   No matter how high the price or how long the wait, audiences
were determined to see Harrison Ford's Indy save the Holy Grail _
said to be the chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper _ from the
Nazis.
   At theaters in Westwood near the University of California-Los
Angeles, lines for ``The Last Crusade'' snaked around the block
throughout the weekend. At the Mann Alex theater in nearby
Glendale, the flood of fans drained the concessions stand of ice,
hot dog buns and change. The wait for late-night screenings in
suburban theaters approached an hour.
   Audiences at some theaters cheered even the movie's opening
credits, greeted Ford's first appearance with whoops of joy and
heartily applauded the introduction of co-star Sean Connery, who
portrayed Indiana's father.
   At the AMC Walnut Mall 3 in Philadelphia, extra midnight shows
were added.
   ``We turned people away from every show,'' said manager Tracey
Scott-Hall. ``It's been sold out since last Wednesday.''
   ``It's just an extraordinary accomplishment for the movie,''
said Barry London, president of Paramount's motion picture group,
which produced ``The Last Crusade.'' ``People were just having a
great time with the movie.''
   The phenomenal opening for ``The Last Crusade'' gives Paramount
early control of this summer's box-office sweepstakes, considered
the most competitive in movie history. To capitalize on the
weekend's packed houses, Paramount attached preview trailers for
its upcoming ``Star Trek V'' and ``Black Rain'' to ``The Last
Crusade'' prints.
   Forty percent of all movie grosses usually come between Memorial
Day and Labor Day. Last summer's season was worth $1.6 billion, and
this summer is seen as potentially even more lucrative.
Expectations are high for ``Ghostbusters II,'' opening June 16;
``Batman,'' opening June 23; and ``The Abyss,'' coming July 19.
   ``The Last Crusade'' is being advertised as the final Indiana
Jones chapter. ``As far as we know, it's still the last movie,''
London said.

<HEAD>Legislators Targeted in Abortion Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest advertising campaign in the fight
over abortion rights is being sponsored by the National Abortion
Rights Action League and is aimed at newspaper readers in
congressional districts.
   ``Many of the constituents in districts around the country do
not know what their congresspeople say and do regarding a woman's
right to choose,'' NARAL executive director Kate Michelman said
Tuesday.
   The league's first target is freshman Rep. Craig James, a
Florida Republican who last year narrowly defeated veteran Rep.
Bill Chappell.
   Michelman said her group has gathered a store of ``tremendously
outrageous statements about reproductive rights and women in
general'' from other legislators and is developing a list of
targets, of which James is the first.

<HEAD>DC Bill Protects Juvenile Facing Alabama Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council has approved
legislation designed to prevent the extradition of a teen-ager
facing a possible death sentence in Alabama.
   Supporters of the measure, which will remain in effect for 90
days, said Tuesday it is needed because of uncertainty over whether
the district's ban on capital punishment could be used to block
extradition of juvenile suspects facing a possible death sentence.
That question is now before a district court.
   The 17-year-old teen-ager, identified only by the initials O.M.,
could face murder and arson charges in connection with an April
1988 firebombing of a Gadsen, Ala., apartment that took the life of
a 14-month-old boy. The teen-ager is being held here pending a
decision on Alabama's extradition request.

   With springtime's tardy entrance to
northern New England, the dreaded black flies have started buzzing
by, and folks who stay outdoors are hunting for ways to avoid the
blood-drawing bites.
   ``They kind of tend to drive you foolish,'' says James F. Dill,
a University of Maine extension specialist in pest management.
   ``They come in swarms and have a tendency to swarm around your
head. They seem to like to bite where clothing fits tightly, like
if you've got a sleeve, they like to burrow in and bite there.
   ``Of course, they'll bite everywhere,'' Dill said.
   Black-fly experts and victims in Maine say their state may
suffer more of the pests than any other in the region, although New
Hampshire state entomologist Ziegfried Thewke said the flies can be
a nuisance throughout all northern states, and even in the Midwest
and parts of the West.
   Thewke said there is no way to tell how many black flies will
infest an area in a given year. Other experts say years of low
moisture may have fewer flies, although they will always be present.
   The flies are at their worst in wooded areas with lots of clean,
running water. And they are faster than mosquitoes when it comes to
biting.
   ``A black fly will come whizzing along and land and attack,
quickly,'' Thewke said, adding that a few types of black flies give
the whole group a bad name.
   ``There are 30 some species of black flies here in New
Hampshire, but only four of them bite humans,'' he said.
   The first few tend to come out in early May, and the swarm can
be in full swing toward the end of the month, sometimes hanging
around as late as November.
   ``Sometimes we just have to wear bug nets, head nets, gloves,
longsleeve shirts and insect repellent, naturally,'' said John R.
Moring, an associate professor of zoology at the University of
Maine. ``If you're new in Maine, or a baby, sometimes you get a
worse reaction.''
   The insect repellent, called ``fly dope'' in Maine, can have its
bad side effects, however. For example, some types melt plastic.
   ``If you have plastic lenses on your glasses, you can find your
fingerprints on them, and you can find your hands sticking to the
steering wheel,'' Moring said.
   People fight the flies in many other ways, with varying degrees
of success.
   ``I don't condone this, but a lot of people will smoke big
cigars,'' Moring said. ``The smoke keeps them away.''
   Others use B vitamins or yeast tablets, believed by some to make
the body odor unattractive to the flies.
   At the Sugarloaf USA resort in western Maine, officials have
taken a more aggressive approach.
   They brought in hungry bats and built small bat houses near the
golf course.
   ``We call them `bat condominiums,''' said Sugarbush spokesman
Chip Carey. ``We put the bats in last year. They ate a lot.''

<TEXT>
   The body of Rep. Claude Pepper will lie in
state in the Capitol Rotunda as a tribute to a half-century
political career in which he championed the elderly and the poor,
his former colleagues promise.
   Pepper's political odyssey, one of the longest in American
history, ended Tuesday with his death at age 88. A Florida Democrat
who served as a state representative before his election to the
U.S. Senate in 1936, Pepper later served in the House after 12
years out of office and became its oldest member.
   ``He was always a voice for the voiceless and a helping hand for
the helpless,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Wright said
the House will adopt a resolution today so that Pepper can lie in
state Thursday.
   The Senate was also expected to approve the resolution today,
Wright said. Lying in state in the Rotunda is the highest final
honor an American can receive. It has been accorded presidents, and
more recently to the unknown soldier from the Vietnam war.
   Pepper had been hospitalized since April 6 suffering from an
undisclosed stomach ailment, which a spokesman in his office said
Tuesday was cancer. He died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
where he returned a month ago after an interim stay at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
   Pepper's colleagues said he used his opportunities to the hilt,
and to the service of his least powerful constituents.
   ``In the bosom of that small, gentle man beat the heart of a
giant _ a heart that felt the pain of a world where children go to
sleep hungry and where the old die alone,'' Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., said.
   ``He was not just a witness to the century, he helped shape the
century,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy
whip of the House.
   Pepper, born Sept. 8, 1900, on a farm near Dudleyville, Ala.,
rose from poverty to attend the University of Alabama and Harvard
Law School. In Congress, he was an architect of some of the
nation's most enduring ``safety net'' programs, including Social
Security, the minimum wage, and medical assistance for the elderly
and for handicapped children.
   He was the first national legislator to push publicly for
federal funding for the war against cancer, a disease that took his
wife, Mildred in 1979, some 43 years after they were married. They
had no children.
   In his final years, he dug in his heels against cutting Social
Security benefits to elderly retired workers _ half a century after
campaigning for establishment of the retirement program.
   President Bush, who presented Pepper with the Medal of Freedom,
the nation's highest civilian award, during a hospital visit last
Thursday, offered this summing up from Bonn, West Germany:
   ``Claude Pepper gave definition and meaning to the concept of
public service. He fought for the poor and the elderly in his own
determined way.
   ``Those who agreed with him were proud to follow his banner.
Those who disagreed with him always respected him. Claude Pepper
was a gentleman, a noble human being.''
   Others noted Pepper's extraordinary length of public service,
beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives
in 1928 at age 28.
   He went to the Senate four years into the administration of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Defeated for re-election in 1950,
he taught and practiced law until his election in 1962 to the House
from a Miami district.
   Pepper, who early on perceived the threat posed by Adolf Hitler,
earned Winston Churchill's undying affection for casting the only
vote in the Senate for the Lend-Lease Act the first time around.
   But his Senate career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw
him branded as ``Red Pepper'' _ playing on claims during the
communist scare of the era that he was soft on the Soviet Union.
   Bonior, a member of the Rules Committee that Pepper had chaired
since 1983, said the ailing congressman ``obviously was wracked
with pain but was able to bring himself together'' during Bush's
presentation of the Medal of Freedom.
   He said Pepper spoke for 10 minutes on how public service had
been the passion of his life.
   Moakley, who also was with Pepper when Bush presented the medal,
said the congressman had summoned his staff to his hospital bed to
brief him on pending legislation and casework immediately after the
ceremony.
   ``Claude was a fighter, and he died fighting,'' Moakley said.
   Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging which Pepper once headed, said Pepper will be
remembered as ``one of the country's most beloved and renowned
defenders and champions of millions of elderly Americans.''

<HEAD>Copter Strikes Cable Car Wires Over Niagara Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sightseeing helicopter struck the
wires supporting a moving cable car about 200 feet above the
Niagara River, but no were reported.
   Canadian Aviation Safety Board teams were expected to arrive
today to investigate Tuesday evening's accident, which occurred
above the churning Whirlpool Rapids.
   The Niagara Falls, N.Y.-based helicopter carrying three tourists
and pilot Mark Felderstein passed within 250 feet of the Spanish
Aero Car, struck the cables and sheared off its landing gear.
   The impact swayed the cable car that was carrying 17 passengers,
but it returned safely to its base. Felderstein landed the copter
safely on a golf course.
   Cable car tour guide Roger Barnsley said he noticed the
low-flying craft for several minutes before the impact.
   ``I was thinking it was very odd for him to be flying down that
low,'' Barnsley said. ``Nobody's ever down that low.
   ``The next thing we know, there was this impact and the landing
gear just shattered into a million pieces and dropped down into the
gorge. It all happened in seconds.''
   Barnsley said the cable car swayed for perhaps a half-minute,
but no one was in danger of being tossed from the open-air coach
and no debris came near the car.
   ``I thought he (the helicopter pilot) was gone, but he pulled it
back up. It was amazing he could control it so well,'' said
Barnsley.
   Felderstein piloted the craft about 100 yards inland to the
Whirlpool Golf Complex and allowed the passengers to jump a few
feet to the ground before the helicopter landed safely on the 10th
fairway.
   Scott B. Hughes, general manager of Rainbow Helicopter, said the
25-year-old Felderstein has been employed by the company for about
four months and has three years' flying experience.

   Government sources say the FBI is looking into
allegations of a no-show employee in the office of Rep. William H.
Gray III, but the fourth-ranking House Democrat denied any
wrongdoing and questioned the timing of news leaks about the probe.
   FBI agents are conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations
dealing with personnel and expenditures in the office of the
prominent Pennsylvania Democrat, said the sources, who spoke
Tuesday night on condition of anonymity.
   Gray, who is seeking the post of majority whip in a leadership
shuffle that hinges on the expected resignation of House Speaker
Jim Wright, denied at a news conference Tuesday night that he was a
``target'' or ``subject'' of a probe. He also disputed a televised
report that he had declined to cooperate with agents in a criminal
investigation.
   The sources stressed that the FBI did not know whether its
preliminary inquiry would lead to a full-scale criminal
investigation, and said the purpose of a Memorial Day meeting with
Gray was to advise him of the inquiry. One source said the
allegations involved a ``ghost employee.''
   Gray, the chairman of the House Democrat Caucus, said two FBI
agents from Philadelphia came to his home in Reston, Va., but he
said, ``I was told over and over again that I was not under
investigation.''
   Gray said he was cryptically told only that ``the bureau was
looking into allegations about an employee or employees, and that
they had been looking into these allegations for the past four to
five months.''
   He said, ``We pledged to provide any materials or documents to
assist in this investigation,''
   Gray said he was asking Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today
to initiate an independent counsel investigation to determine who
leaked information about the FBI visit.
   ``All I can say to you and the American people is you be the
judge as to the motives of the Justice Department leaks,'' Gray
said. ``You be the judge as to the timing. You be the judge as to
what the agenda is.''
   Chief Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he could
not discuss ``anything that has been reported about Mr. Gray or any
of Mr. Gray's comments.'' In Philadelphia, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Thomas H. Lee II also declined comment.
   Gray replied ``You bet!'' in answer to q question of whether he
would still be seeking the majority whip position being vacated by
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. ``I have done nothing wrong,'' Gray said.
   Aides to Gray said privately that they were ``in the dark''
about nature of the FBI investigation, and that they had concocted
a number of theories _ including one that Gray might have been
contacted in connection with an already existing probe on Capitol
Hill, not a new one.
   But the aides declined to elaborate, and Gray spokesman Jon
Plebani said, ``We don't know what to expect to happen next.''
After the news conference, Gray and his aides met in his office
until after 11 p.m.
   Gray, the highest ranking black in Congress, appeared on a CBS
program Sunday and said he was confident the Democratic
congressional leadership, recently rocked by ethical problems of
Wright and a questionable financial deal involving Coelho, was
headed for better times.
   Coelho announced on Saturday that he will leave the House on
June 15. Wright may resign possibly as early as today.
   The pastor of a Baptist church that his father also led, Gray,
47, is a powerful political figure in his native Philadelphia, as
well as in Washington.
   He runs his campaign committee as a virtual bank for local
Democratic candidates whom he supports. His 1988 committee reported
loans of $25,000, $20,000 and $15,000 for three city council
candidates, as well as a $15,000 loan to the re-election effort of
Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode.
   First elected to the House from one of the nation's most
impoverished districts in 1978, Gray headed the House Budget
Committee for four years before assuming the Democratic caucus post
this year.

   Fellow Marines and relatives waited anxiously
for news of the 14 men missing after a helicopter crash during a
training mission off Okinawa.
   ``There is a great somberness and pain with reports of the
tragedy or possible tragedy. We are fearful and concerned,'' said
Navy Capt. Herbert Bergsma, chaplin at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air
Station.
   A Kaneohe-based CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter with 22 Marines
crashed into the sea Tuesday night after taking off from the USS
Denver off Okinawa, Japan. Eight Marines were rescued, including
four who were injured. A search was continuing for the missing,
whose names have not been released.
   A special hotline number was set up for Marine families to call,
but they are told only if their relative was not involved,
officials said. The families of the missing were being notified
individually.
   Nancy O'Donnell, ombudsman for the 3rd Marine Regiment, was
fielding telephone calls from servicemen's wives.
   ``I hear anxiety in their voices. Some are in tears. They want
to know right now'' if their husband is among the missing, said
Mrs. O'Donnell, whose husband, Sgt. Kevin O'Donnell, is in Okinawa
but was not involved in the accident.
   The helicopter was carrying a crew of four assigned to Kaneohe's
Aircraft Group 24, and 18 passengers from the 3rd Marine Regiment.
The base is located 10 miles from Honolulu on Oahu island.
   The two units were on a six-month deployment to the western
Pacific for training.
   ``It affected two of our major subordinate commands ... so we're
very concerned,'' said Maj. Kerry K. Gershanek, the base public
affairs officer.
   While the search was the priority at the scene of the accident,
``here our first priority is to make sure our families are taken
care of,'' Gershanek said.

<HEAD>Ad Lampoons the Latest in Dukakis Bashing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America hates a loser, and no politician seems
more scorned these days than Michael Dukakis.
   The failed Democratic presidential candidate is the butt of
jokes in his home state. Question: ``What does Dukakis mean in
Greek?'' Answer: ``Mondale.''
   The Massachusetts governor also is facing a huge state budget
deficit, a cranky Legislature, a wife recovering from alcoholism
and the lowest popularity ratings of his career.
   When his car was stopped for an expired registration sticker
recently, his driver was given a warning instead of the usual $50
fine. A radio station sold cardboard cutouts of Dukakis, saying
ordinary people could avoid tickets, too, if only they had a
governor in the back seat.
   Now, a California company has started an advertisement showing a
photo of Dukakis giving a speech. ``There are some people even we
couldn't make more persuasive'' reads the huge caption.
   Fortune magazine declined to run the ad by Precision
Technologies Inc., but the two-page spread appears in the latest
California editions of Newsweek and Inc. magazines.
   The creators insist the ad isn't meant to demean Dukakis.
   In fact, the two people who came up with the idea supported him
in his bid for the White House, and one even campaigned for him,
said Ken Mandelbaum of the Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley advertising
agency in San Francisco.
   But lest the ad be overlooked, the year-old agency that has also
made controversial ads showing nudists and underwear sent a copy of
its Dukakis piece to news organizations.
   A spokesman for the governor said the unauthorized use of
Dukakis' photograph to sell a product ``shows a lack of common
sense and decency.''
   The ad pushes a product that can make a photographic slide from
the image on the screen of a personal computer.
   ``It's something that will allow anyone to make more persuasive
presentations,'' the text reads.
   ``We were sitting around talking about who was a poor presenter,
who couldn't get his points across, and Dukakis was the guy who
leapt into mind,'' Mandelbaum said.
   The only other candidate considered was Neville Chamberlain, the
British prime minister remembered for his appeasement of Adolf
Hitler. But they decided few people would recognize Chamberlain,
Mandelbaum said.
   Dukakis was in Toronto on Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. But Donald K. Stern, the governor's chief legal counsel,
said Massachusetts law prohibits use of a person's photograph for
advertising or commercial purposes without their consent.
   ``That law reflects common sense and decency,'' Stern said.
``One would hope that any company would show restraint in using
someone's likeness for commercial purposes and that any magazine
would take steps to determine whether consent has been given before
they ran it.''
   Mandelbaum said there had been some debate about the legality of
using the photograph.
   ``I think the company looked at the risks and accepted them,''
he said.
   Fortune spokesman Gary Belis said the magazine would not discuss
its reasons for rejecting the ad.
   Hank Thunhorst, national advertising manager for Inc., said he
didn't think the ad was derogatory, just trying to make a point.
   ``In the past, advertisers have used pictures of presidents that
were derogatory,'' Thunhorst said. ``They flayed Nixon pretty
good.''
   Cambridge pollster Gerry Chervinsky called the ad demeaning.
``That, after all, was the knock on Dukakis, that he was a poor
campaigner who couldn't get the message across,'' he said.
   Chervinsky's polls of Massachusetts voters last month show that
53 percent have an unfavorable view of Dukakis, and 41 percent have
a favorable view. A national survey in early April showed 39
percent rated Dukakis unfavorable and 44 percent favorable, he said.
   ``In Massachusetts there's a tremendous amount of Duke-bashing
going on,'' he said. ``Nationally, there was some lessening of
derision, because it's basically out of sight, out of mind.''
   Chervinsky said the public is used to having political figures
lampooned.
   ``It's sort of a sad commentary,'' Chervinsky said. ``If it's OK
to bash Dan Quayle, the incumbent vice president, nightly, as he is
bashed, then I guess it's OK to bash the loser.
   ``But to me it's like, leave the poor guy alone already.''

<TEXT>
   The opposition says the regime of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga is holding at least 89 political
prisoners.
   ``The prisoners are nothing more than hostages,'' opposition
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said in an interview
Tuesday.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces commanded by Noriega ``take people
prisoner for a while and then, if things are quiet, they just let
them go,'' he said. ``They take people off the street, people who
were just watching a parade.''
   The opposition charges were the latest following the May 7
presidential election, which the government nullified three days
later. International observers said the opposition, led by Endara,
won the election by a 3-1 margin.
   The Organization of American States has criticized Noriega, the
vote nullification and the beating of Endara and two other
opposition candidates.
   Opposition first vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias
Calderon said six people arrested May 24 while marching with
opposition candidates to an OAS delegation meeting ``have not even
been allowed to see their families.''
   At a news conference, Arias Calderon distributed a list of 89
people he said were political prisoners. It included opposition
spokesman Luis Martins; legislative candidate Felipe Escobar;
Antonio Galvez, Arias Calderon's bodyguard; and Jose Guillermo
Lutrel, a Panamanian Human Rights Committee election observer.
   Many prisoners were accused of threatening state security and
sentenced to a year in jail the night of their arrest, Arias
Calderon said.
   He said such sentences often are converted into fines payable at
the rate of $1 a day but inmates' relatives were told nobody is
available to collect fines.
   Messages left for a Defense Forces spokesman for comment on
Arias Calderon's charges were not returned. The Defense Forces have
not commented on the issue despite repeated requests.

<HEAD>Pigs Seen as Source of Tranplants in the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transplant doctors predict pigs will become a
main source of donor organs for people once the many technical
problems of cross-species transplantation are resolved.
   While primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better
match, pigs are cheaper, more plentiful and easier to breed, says
Dr. Hugh Auchincloss Jr., assistant professor of surgery at Harvard
University.
   ``What could change, I suppose, is that we could become better
at making artificial organs than we are now. Then we wouldn't need
the animal organs. But I don't see that as coming first,''
Auchincloss said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Transplant Physicians.
   Only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for
all types of research, according to Auchincloss.
   ``It doesn't make any sense to use chimpanzees because you're
going to make such a small impact in the well-being of humans. And
you'll make people so mad, because it is where they focus from the
point of view of animal rights, understandably so,'' he said.
   ``If you can eat the pig, I'm not sure you can't transplant the
liver,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   But some animal-rights activists say they're opposed to using
animals, whether it's chimpanzees, pigs or even rodents.
   ``Animals aren't here to be our spare parts,'' said Dr. Neal
Barnard, a psychiatrist who serves as president of the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington.
   ``They're putting all their energy into this high-tech,
incredibly expensive use of the limited resources we have to put
into health care ... and it has maybe a one-in-10 million chance of
ever working out,'' said Susan Stewart, head of the research
investigative committee for the Last Chance for Animals in Los
Angeles.
   About 30 animal-to-human organ transplants have been performed
worldwide, most of them in the early 1960s, according to
Auchincloss.
   The longest survivor was a 27-year-old woman who lived nine
months with a chimpanzee's kidney she received in 1964. The latest
patient, a 12-day-old girl known as Baby Fae, died 20 days after
receiving a baboon's heart in 1984 at California's Loma Linda
University Medical Center.
   ``If you define success as one-year survival, we still haven't
gotten one,'' Auchincloss said. ``But we've come awfully close.''
   About 50 cases also are known in which doctors attached pigs'
livers to coma patients on a temporary basis, mostly in the 1960s,
Auchincloss said. The patients' blood was passed through the pigs'
livers, but it was not clear whether the animal organs actually
performed the same function as the patients' own intact livers.
   Such drastic measures are necessary because of the critical
shortage of donated organs, according to Dr. Keith Reemtsma,
chairman of surgery at Columbia University. He performed the
record-setting transplant in 1964 that involved the chimpanzee
kidney.
   As of Tuesday, there were 14,993 people in the United States
waiting for kidney transplants, 1,252 for hearts, 767 for livers,
229 for heart-lungs, 257 for pancreases and 80 for lungs, according
to the United Network for Organ Sharing.
   ``Even if we retrieved every (human) heart that is available,
there still would be a shortage of donor organs,'' Reemtsma said.
   Research on cross-species transplants, called xenografts, is
under way at about a dozen U.S. institutions. Many of the animals
have survived several months, and a few could have gone on
indefinitely, Auchincloss said.
   Researchers at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C.,
have found the potent anti-rejection drug cyclosporine, commonly
used by human transplant patients, does not work well in
cross-species transplants involving rodents. They report greater
success with rabbit antibodies that target the cells attacking
foreign tissue.
   Such experiments must move from rodents to primates before the
procedure can be tested on people, perhaps during the next decade,
Auchincloss said. Experts know they face tough decisions when that
happens.
   ``Who do you do them on until the techniques are refined?
Children or adults?'' Caplan asked. ``Who goes first and how do you
get informed consent? What do you say?''

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound, U.S. Dollar Off Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced
back Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar edged down against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 83.94-point
loser the previous day, regained 189.86 points, or 0.56 percent, to
end trading at 34,266.75 points.
   The dollar finished at 142.70 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.10 yen. The currency moved between 142.43 yen and
142.90 yen.
   Traders said the dollar eased as market players sold it to buy
European currencies due to speculation that Britain might raise its
discount rate, following a similar move by Japan.
   The Bank of Japan announced Tuesday that it will raise its
official discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to 3.25 percent
effective Wednesday, reversing its easy money policy for the first
time in nine years.
   ``The discount rate hike in Japan has little impact on foreign
exchange dealings because it has been expected for over a month,''
said a trader with a major commercial bank.
   Speculative investors' demands for the U.S. currency remained
strong, he said.
   Analysts say President Bush's pledge for a 20 percent cut in
U.S. military forces stationed in Europe boosted the dollar because
people expected the move would help reduce the U.S. budget deficit.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index's recovery was
spurred by the yen's rebound on the currency exchange.
   But trading was directionless, said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The energy of the market has been low due to uncertainties
over the political situation and in the currency market, resulting
in thin, directionless trading recently,'' he said.
   ``The strong yen has long been a merit in stock trading, but now
its stability should be considered more than its level,'' the
analyst added.
   Some participants remained on the sidelines due to concerns over
a West German federal bank meeting Thursday, where market players
speculate the West German interest rate might be raised again, he
said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Marine helicopter crashed upside down into
the sea during night training exercises off Okinawa, and 14 Marines
were missing today and feared dead, U.S. military spokesmen said.
   Authorities said eight other Marines on board the CH-46 Sea
Knight helicopter, based in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, were rescued
shortly after the 11:55 p.m. crash Tuesday about 30 miles south of
Okinawa's Kadena Air Force base.
   The names of the missing were withheld pending notification of
next of kin, the Navy said. The cause of the accident was under
investigation.
   The Sea Knight helicopter had just taken off from the USS
Denver, said Marine Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S.
Forces, Japan.
   Rodrigues said the helicopter, built in 1967, was carrying a
crew of four and 18 soldiers assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd
Marine Regiment, Okinawa, for six months' training as part of a
unit-rotation program.
   In Washington, Marine Corps spokesman Lt. Col. Fred Peck said
the helicopter ``pitched over to the right and went into the water
inverted, upside down. I have nothing to indicate why it did that.''
   Peck said the four injured men were being treated aboard the
Denver, an amphibious transport vessel designed for amphibious
assaults and capable of carrying up to six CH-46 helicopters.
   Capt. Lenny Ryan, a Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station spokesman,
said the four suffered minor injuries.
   ``An investigation will be initiated immediately,'' Ryan said.
``As soon as they're able to talk, we'll start getting information
immediately so we can start trying to piece together what happened
in this tragedy.''
   He said the pilot was not wearing night-vision goggles at the
time of the accident.
   The helicopter went down 9{ miles southeast of Kiyan Cape, said
Nagatoshi Naruse, spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's
coast guard. He said three Japanese aircraft and six Maritime
Safety Agency patrol boats joined two U.S. vessels, including the
Denver, and four U.S. aircraft in the search.
   Another coast guard spokesman, Kazuhiro Sameshima, said the
weather in the area was fair at the time of the crash, with waves
about three feet high.
   Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture, has the highest
concentration of Marines outside of the United States, the 20,000
Marines stationed there comprise about 10 percent of the corps.
   Okinawa was under American administration from 1945 until it was
turned over to the Japanese in 1972. Under a mutual security pact,
64,000 U.S. troops are stationed throughout Japan, including 35,000
on Okinawa.
   The concentration of American troops on Okinawa, one of Japan's
most densely populated prefectures, and the island's history as a
bloody World War II battle site have made residents sensitive to
training accidents.
   Those sensitivities reached a boil this month when it was
disclosed a hydrogen bomb fell off of a U.S. aircraft carrier in
1965 and remains lost at the bottom of the ocean only 80 miles from
an inhabited Okinawan island.
   The latest tragedy came after fires aboard three U.S. warships
killed 55 sailors earlier this spring.
   On April 19, an explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47
sailors aboard the Norfolk-based battleship USS Iowa off Puerto
Rico.
   Six sailors died in an engine-room fire on the supply ship White
Plains in the South China Sea on May 9.
   An explosion and fire in a jet fuel pump room killed two sailors
aboard the aircraft carrier America May 13 in the Atlantic Ocean.

<DATELINE>KIFIL HARITH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ibtisam Bozieh woke from
a nap and peered through the green shutter when the Jewish settlers
began shooting. The shy 13-year-old had wanted to be a doctor, but
she became a martyr instead.
   Ibtisam was the 500th Palestinian victim in nearly 18 months of
rebellion against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   There was a single bullet hole in the shutter Tuesday. Members
of her family said Ibtisam, ever inquisitive, looked out at the
settlers shooting wildly in her farming village the day before and
a bullet hit her in the chest.
   Israeli media called it one of the worst vigilante attacks of
the uprising, in which 22 Israelis also have been killed. Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the raid was ``a shameful act.''
   About two dozen Jewish settlers set a wheat field and part of a
house ablaze in Kifil Harith, smashed windows in a car and a truck,
and shot up several rooftop water tanks.
   Villagers said an elderly man was struck in the face with a gun
and an 18-year-old was shot in the stomach. Police confirmed two
people were wounded.
   Northern police commander Albert Musafi said on army radio today
that six suspects were detained and being questioned. He declined
to elaborate.
   Two Israeli newspapers, Hadashot and Maariv, said the suspects
were students at Joseph's Tomb Yeshiva in Nablus, 12 miles away.
The Haaretz daily said some lived in the Yizhar settlement next to
Nablus and that more arrests were expected.
   Israel radio said 20 of the seminary students were questioned
about the case on Tuesday and that their rifles were taken for
ballistic tests.
   Two students said on the radio they were hiking through the
village to Joshua's tomb and fired their guns in response to a
stoning attack. The Boziehs live about 50 yards from the
white-domed monument at the biblical prophet's burial site.
   Gadi Ben-Zimra, one of the students, said: ``Our intention was
to hike. There was no punishment mission here. Very close to the
village, we were met with a barrage of stones and rocks.
   ``We were surrounded and, from that moment on, our lives were in
real danger. Stones and rocks were flying from the houses. ... What
we did, I mostly talk of myself, was to fire in the air only.''
   Media reports suggested the assault on Kifil Harith was linked
to a stoning attack Monday in which Yitzhak Ginzburg, the yeshiva's
rabbi, was struck in the head during a hike with students to Sinjil
village.
   Haim Malka, a West Bank police commander, said on army radio
that Jewish settlers set fires and began shooting before entering
Kifil Harith.
   A senior military commander told the daily Maariv the raid was
of unprecedented severity and the settlers ``shot like madmen.''
   It was the latest of several reprisal raids on Palestinian
villages and neighborhoods after stoning attacks on settlers.
Israeli civilians have killed 18 Palestinians since the uprising
began Dec. 8, 1987.
   Hussein Ahmed Hassan of Kifil Harith said some raiders wore the
skullcaps of religious Jews.
   ``There were about 30 of them who came through here with guns,
throwing firebombs,'' he said. ``They burned our wheat and shouted
things in Hebrew we couldn't understand.''
   Her village of 3,000 people has transformed Ibtisam Bozieh from
a soft-spoken schoolgirl to a symbol of resistance to Israeli
occupation.
   Palestinian flags of green, black, red and white _ declared
illegal by Israel _ were unfurled Tuesday on the roof of the small
stone house where she lived with her family.
   Children led by two men masked with red-checked Arab headdresses
shouted: ``With blood and fire we will redeem Palestine!''
   Inside, several dozen women in white veils sat in mourning on
the floors. Ibtisam's teacher, Subhia Abdel Salah, showed a
reporter the girl's workbooks from English class and said her
favorite subjects were English and science.
   ``She was very clever, always at the top of her class,'' said
the teacher, sitting in the living room not far from the green
shutter with the single bullet hole.
   ``All she wanted to be was a doctor,'' said Ibtisam's mother,
Samia Jamil Salem Bozieh, 46, who wore a white headscarf and a
faded dress with a floral pattern.
   She said her daughter was awakened by the shots and went to the
window.
   ``Next thing, she stumbled into the corridor and said `Mommy, I
have been shot here,''' Mrs. Bozieh said, holding both hands over
her heart. ``Then she fell dead.''
   The Boziehs have 11 other children. One of them, Ibtisam's
18-year-old sister, Hanan, said, ``It is good to die for your
country.''

   A Yale graduate charged with four
murders was a brilliant student and a star athlete, but was
frustrated entering the working world by a lingering, poorly
understood illness, neighbors and friends said.
   A judge on Tuesday set a $4 million bail for Rolando Marcello,
who was formally charged with four counts of first-degree murder
for a Memorial Day rampage that left his mother, brother, a family
friend and a neighbor dead.
   ``What would make a young boy, a promising kid, just snap like
this?'' asked Superior Court Judge Mariam Span. ``We don't know.
That fatal moment he just lost all control. This was not a
malicious boy.''
   Span did not order a psychiatric evaluation.
   Marcello, who was being held in the Union County jail, was
carried, manacled and dressed in jail khakis, into the court.
   Police said they found no indication of drug or alcohol use in a
search of Marcello's house. They recovered what they said was the
murder weapon, a 10-inch butcher knife.
   As a straight-A student at Oratory Preparatory School, where he
graduated in 1983, Marcello was named Union County Scholar-Athlete
of the Year, served as editor of the school newspaper, was captain
of the Chess Team and president of the National Honor Society.
   ``He was everything you wanted to see in a young man,'' said the
Rev. Floyd Rotunno, Oratory's headmaster. ``He was academically
gifted, but he was really well-rounded in everything. I never even
saw him angry.''
   Steve Galluzzo and Ted Sanders, who live in the tree-lined,
upper-middle class Springbrook Park neighborhood with Marcello,
said that Anita Marcello told them six months ago that her
23-year-old son was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which
also has been called Epstein-Barr Syndrome.
   The syndrome has the nickname ``yuppie flu'' because it tends to
strike high-achieving, hard-driving people in their 30s. But Dr.
Thomas Lane, director of the University of Connecticut Fatigue
Clinic, called the label ``purely a media misnomer.''
   He said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has cited the
syndrome as a new illness that can also occur in the poor and
elderly.
   ``I have difficulty connecting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as it
is now defined, to homicide,'' said Lane. But he said the syndrome
can cause depression.
   ``Suicide is certainly common,'' he said.
   The symptoms include long-term fatigue, possibly caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus, which causes a form of mononucleosis. Some
medical researchers are looking into mental illness as a cause for
the syndrome.
   ``His mother talked about this syndrome thing because people
were asking about Rolly, when was he going back to work and all
that,'' Sanders said. ``It didn't seem like anything was wrong with
him, he was just a normal kid, and a brain. He just went ape,
that's all.''
   The other victims were Marcello's 20-year-old brother, Raymond;
family friend Nelson Paiva, 20; and neighbor Mark Dennis, 36.
Neighbor Richard Hartmann was in stable condition Tuesday with stab
wounds to the chest.
   After graduating from Yale in 1987, Marcello worked a short time
as an intern with Chemical Bank in New York before mononucleosis
forced him to drop out in February 1988, neighbors said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's first lawsuit filed under a
new federal law that bars housing discrimination against families
with children has been settled out-of-court for $25,000.
   A federal court on Tuesday approved the settlement between the
Justice Department and LaFonge Associates, an apartment management
company.
   The department charged that LaFonge had refused to rent a
one-bedroom apartment to a single mother and her child.
   The case against LaFonge, owner of Somerset Mews Garden
Apartments in Franklin Township, was the first under amendments to
the federal Fair Housing Act.
   The amendments passed last year prohibit housing discrimination
against people with handicaps and those with children. Retirement
communities with special facilities for elderly people are exempt.
   LaFonge officials denied any wrongdoing.
   ``The owners do not want prolonged litigation to obscure their
long-standing commitment to providing decent housing for all
persons,'' the company said.
   ``Rather than devote substantial resources to litigation ...
involving a single isolated incident, it is far more appropriate to
resolve this issue in a way which truly serves the goal of fair
housing.''
   The $25,000 award will go to the Housing Coalition of Middlesex
County, which brought the complaint to the Justice Department on
behalf of the woman.

<HEAD>Harry Reasoner Finally Earns `Real' College Degree At Age 66</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When CBS-TV correspondent Harry Reasoner
gives the commencement speech for the University of Minnesota's
College of Liberal Arts, he will receive the journalism degree that
eluded him for almost 40 years.
   Reasoner, 66, who grew up in Minneapolis, attended Stanford and
Minnesota but never earned enough credits to receive a degree.
   But during the last few years, he received the credits he needed
by submitting about a half-dozen classes worth of independent study
to Minnesota's School of Journalism. His grades were not disclosed.
   ``The oldest B.A. in the history of the University of
Minnesota,'' Reasoner, who will receive his degree June 11, said by
telephone from New York.
   ``About 20 years ago, the Board of Regents gave me a
distinguished alumni award, which was slightly bigger than the
Congressional Medal of Honor, and I said, `Why don't you just give
me my bachelor's degree?'
   ``They said, `Why don't you take Reporting and Public Affairs
101?' I let it pass.''
   A few years ago, Reasoner met Professor Irving Fang.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing and talked to a couple of
other journalism professors and found out what it would take to
satisfy the requirements. We did it,'' Reasoner said.
   ``Honorary degrees are one thing. This is a real one. I'm proud
of it.''
   The lack of a degree hasn't hindered Reasoner, who has had a
35-year career in network news, including 13 years as co-editor of
``60 Minutes,'' the popular CBS News magazine program.
   Now, like most college graduates, Reasoner hopes his degree will
help him land a good job.
   ``I assume if I want to retire and teach journalism, now I would
qualify,'' he said.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Pronounce Uprising Leader's Execution Illegal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders have agreed that Imre
Nagy, leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, was illegally
executed two years later after being convicted of
counterrevolution, a party spokesman said.
   After Tuesday's announcement, however, Communist Party chief
Karoly Grosz said that while he did not oppose Nagy's legal
rehabilitation he was opposed to blaming the party for the
premier's execution.
   Nagy had called for open, multiparty elections before the
short-lived revolt was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   Reformers within the ruling Communist Party have backed calls
for Nagy's rehabilitation as the country moves toward a multiparty
political system.
   Also during its meeting Monday, the party's policy-setting
Central Committee decided to move up to the fall a party congress
that had been scheduled for 1990.
   The committee agreed that ``there is every indication'' that
Nagy ``was executed in the wake of a show trial and that his
sentence was a violation of the law,'' party spokesman Laszlo Major
told reporters.
   In a later television interview, Grosz claimed no part of the
ruling Communist Party had taken a position on Nagy's guilt or
innocence.
   ``Those returning the verdict were obviously influenced by other
forces'' he did not identify. ``The sentence was not a (party)
decision.''
   Major said there had been ``considerable debate'' during
Monday's session on Nagy, and the Central Committee agreed it
cannot come to a final decision, because documents are still
missing and a judicial review is still in progress.
   Major told reporters, ``Several Central Committee members
pointed out that Nagy died a committed communist.''
   The party's admission came as no surprise in the wake of a
public debate over Nagy's 1958 execution and burial in an unmarked
grave. On June 16, the remains of Nagy and some of his associates
are to be reburied.
   Major said the party would like the day to be one of national
reconciliation but said it plan to be represented at the reburial
since it was not invited. The event is to be televised to the
nation.
   Laszlo Domonkos, a deputy department head of the Central
Committee, said Tuesday that the date of Hungary's first multiparty
elections _ promised by Communist authorities _ depends on talks
with opposition groups,.
   The talks have been delayed by disagreements over the makeup of
negotiating teams and the agenda.
   Also Tuesday, two Central Committee members stepped down, the
party said in a communique. The two _ Mihaly Korom and Sandor
Rajnai, the current ambassador to Moscow, were both involved in the
Nagy case as Interior Ministry officials, say relatives of Nagy and
other victims of the post-revolt crackdown.

the state he represented in Washington for half a century as a
tireless advocate for the elderly and poor, a powerful orator and a
charming, humble man.
   ``He was a particularly talented and able man who didn't have
any selfishness in him,'' said Rep. Charles Bennett, 78, a Democrat
and now dean of the state's congressional delegation. ``He was just
interested in what he could do for mankind.''
   The body of the 88-year-old congressman, who died Tuesday, will
lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Thursday, a measure of
respect typically reserved for national heroes. He will be buried
in Tallahassee next to his wife, Mildred, who died of cancer in
1979.
   Tributes came from admirers and political foes from all over
Florida, which Pepper watched grow from mostly rural land into the
nation's fourth most-populous state, and home to many of the senior
citizens whose cause he championed.
   ``The sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory
of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people,'' said
Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``He always said it was the senior citizens who made this
country great,'' said Leila Johnson, a 74-year-old resident of
Mildred and Claude Pepper Towers, a federally subsidized
senior-citizen apartment complex in Miami, where the flag flew at
half staff.
   Mrs. Johnson remembered Pepper telling her that after working to
raise and educate their children, senior citizens are still
contributing to society.
   ``In my life, he made me think that maybe I did make a
contribution,'' she said.
   Pepper served in the Senate from 1936 to 1950, when he lost a
re-election bid after being branded ``Red Pepper'' and charged with
being soft on the Soviet Union. He taught and practised law until
winning election to the House in 1962.
   Sen. Bob Graham praised his fellow Florida Democrat as ``a
champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a prepared America to
defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older Americans.
   ``America will miss this champion but we will honor his memory
by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and human
dignity.''
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack recalled that Pepper once served
with his maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, who represented
Texas in the Senate for 42 years. He said Pepper would be missed
``by Americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of his
dedication and leadership.''
   ``Senator Pepper was as old as this century, yet he was perhaps
the first of our modern leaders for the new Florida,'' said Florida
House Speaker Tom Gustafson.
   ``When you consider he was a man who knew Orville Wright and
welcomed the astronauts back from the moon, you have an
understanding of the span of history he represented,'' said
Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon of Miami Beach, Pepper's friend
for 30 years.
   Despite his age, Pepper never lost his oratorial skills that
made him famous on the House floor.
   ``He could spellbind an audience,'' said Hal Wilkins, vice
president of development for Florida State University in
Tallahassee, which has the Mildred and Claude Pepper Library and
custody of the congressman's papers. ``He could walk into a room
filled with people and the whole room would light up.''
   Polly Sermon, a Pepper Towers resident, said she had known
Pepper since 1932 and wouldn't be living in the housing complex if
it weren't for him.
   ``He was strictly for the senior citizens _ the rock of
Gibraltar,'' Ms. Sermon said. ``If he promised you anything, you
got it. He was here for us.''
   Pepper represented the 18th Congressional District, which covers
most of Miami and all of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour and Key Biscayne.
Its center is Miami's heavily Cuban Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho,
and 50 percent of the district is Hispanic.
   A special election will be held to fill the seat.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zinka Milanov, a leading dramatic soprano for
the Metropolitan Opera for 28 years until her retirement in 1966,
has died. She was 83.
   Ms. Milanov died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital after suffering
a stroke, according to Anne Werner, a hospital spokeswoman. The
Manhattan resident had been admitted to the hospital Saturday, Ms.
Werner said.
   Ms. Milanov was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906. She
studied in Zagreb, Milan and Berlin, and debuted at the Zagreb
Opera in Verdi's ``Il Trovatore'' in 1927.
   After nine years with that company, she began singing for the
Vienna State Opera, where she appeared in the Italian repertory.
Her reputation spread throughout Europe with guest appearances in
Germany, Czechoslovakia and at the Salzburg Festival, where in 1937
she was chosen by Arturo Toscanini as soloist in Verdi's
``Requiem.''
   That year, she made her U.S. debut at the Metropolitan Opera as
Leonora in ``Il Trovatore.''
   She sang more than 400 performances with the Met until retiring
at age 59. She was one of the few principal singers to inaugurate
two successive seasons for the company _ in 1951 and 1952.
   She enjoyed a successful concert career and recorded widely in
the Italian repertoire, especially works by Verdi and Puccini.
   She was most noted for the roles of Aida in the Verdi opera and
Desdemona in Verdi's ``Otello.''
   Born Zinka Kunc, her first marriage, to Predag Milanov, ended in
divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Ljubomir Ilic.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Against Yen, Stocks Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar lost ground today against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo as stock prices rose sharply.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 83.94 points
Tuesday, gained 189.86 points or 0.56 percent to end trading at
34,266.75, a record high.
   The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.10 yen. The U.S. currency opened lower at 142.50 yen
and ranged from 142.43 to 142.90 yen during the day.
   Traders attributed the dollar's slip to a similar down-swing in
New York Tuesday.
   ``Trading was inactive, with market players only making position
adjustments at around 142.70 yen because of the absence of
market-affecting news,'' said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The expected meeting of the West German Bundesbank later today
and release of U.S. unemployment figures for May on Friday made
some investors stay on the sidelines, he said.
   Market players and news reports speculated that West German
monetary authorities may decide at the meeting to raise the central
bank's discount rate.
   The trader said the rise in Japan's official discount rate had
no major impact on the market. The Bank of Japan raised its key
rate today by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25 percent.
   On the stock market, high-tech issues attracted participants and
contributed to the sharp rise in the Nikkei index, said Kazuhiro
Nomura of New Japan Securities.
   ``Market players also were reassured by the apparent
stabilization of the yen-dollar exchange rate,'' he said.
   ``People tend to pay too much attention to the rate itself but
the market has come to consider it satisfactory as long as the rate
is stable,'' Nomura said.
   Trading was active, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 1 billion shares. Technology issues including Sony and
Toshiba attracted buyers, as did automobile issues.

   As about 100 looters _ men, women and
children _ descended on Julio Bidalle's store, the five policemen
assigned to guard it were helpless.
   Very soon, it was empty of meat, vegetables and fruit, wine and
cheese. The raiders Tuesday even took the cleaning prducts.
   ``This ruins me,'' Bidalle said.
   Vicente Senes, who owns a neighborhood grocery, said he would
help guard his store. ``I don't have any alternative,''
   Senes said as he and other grocery store and butcher shop owners
tried to protect themselves from looting that began a week ago
because of raging inflation and economic chaos in Argentina.
   A heavy metal shutter protecting the front of one store carried
a warning: ``Danger. Door Electrified.''
   Despite a state of siege declared Monday by President Raul
Alfonsin, sporadic looting continued Tuesday in Rosario, a
meat-packing city of 1 million people about 185 miles north of
Buenos Aires.
   Santa Fe provincial police reinforced by members of the
paramilitary border force guarded shops and patrolled streets.
Little public transport was running and schools, closed Monday, did
not reopen.
   Police reported at least six people killed, 70 injured and about
1,000 arrested.
   Many supermarkets were stripped Monday, particularly those near
slum districts. Most of the looters were women, children and
teen-agers.
   The manager of one supermarket said some people ``fought for a
piece of meat or a bag of mate,'' the herbal tea that is a staple
in Argentina. ``They looked like hungry poor people, but there also
were thieves who took advantage of the situation,'' he said.
   One woman in her 70s, rushing out of a food market with a bag of
groceries, shouted: ``Thank God, today I can eat!''
   Crowds gathered around many neighborhood stores Tuesday, but
guards generally were able to hold them back with shields and
truncheons.
   Daniel Rodriguez said his small market four miles from downtown
Rosario was raided three times Monday. Fifty border guards
surrounded it Tuesday morning.
   If the looting continues, Rodriguez said, ``I have two
alternatives: I can put the little I have left in the street and
give it away or I can just set fire to it all.''
   He said he opened the store two years ago ``with four cans of
preserves.''
   ``I was successful, but now what do I do?'' he said. About 100
people, most of them poorly dressed women and children, milled
around in the street beyond the ring of guards.
   Cmdr. Cesar Valdez, in charge of the guards, said he had orders
to hold off looters with tear gas or rubber bullets, ``but we are
afraid to shoot because many women have children in their arms.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Wants to Aid Non-Communist Guerrillas In Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants Congress to
support a covert supply of weapons to non-communist guerrillas
fighting Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government, The New York Times
reported today.
   The aid would be used to strengthen Prince Norodom Sihanouk's
position in negotiations with the Phnom Penh government and with
the communist Khmer Rouge forces. The newspaper attributed the
report to unidentified Bush administration officials.
   Earlier this month, the prince indicated he might be able to
reach an accommodation with the Phnom Penh government under certain
conditions.
   The Times quoted a State Department official as saying, ``We
believe that appropriate assistance will strengthen the political
standing and security of the non-Communist resistance and enhance
its position'' in negotiations for a political settlement of the
war in Cambodia.
   The official said such aid would help the non-communist force
hold its own if the Khmer Rouge tried to seize control.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said he had not been notified of
any new administration initiative on Cambodia.
   ``Their policy always was that they wanted to give lethal aid to
the Sihanouk'' forces, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman said in a telephone interview Tuesday night with The
Associated Press.
   Pell said such aid was included in an administration bill, but
he was not sure of its status and added that the administration has
not pushed for the aid.
   Pell was among three senators who wrote Bush last weekend
opposing lethal aid to Sihanouk's forces on grounds it may fall
into the hands of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``My view is that would be a major error unless there is
specific language that it not go to the Khmer Rouge,'' Pell said
when asked what his reaction would be to such a proposal from the
administration.
   The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, ruled the Southeast Asian
country from 1975 through 1978, and presided over the period in
which 1 million Cambodians died.
   A State Department official who refused to be identified would
not be specific when asked whether the administration would seek
congressional backing for lethal aid to the non-Communist forces.
   ``It's our policy to do what we can do to strengthen the
non-communist resistance,'' the official told the AP. ``We believe
that by doing so they will be better able to play the essential
political role which will be required if there is to be a
comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. And such a
settlement is the best way of controlling the Khmer Rouge.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Black Child Should Remain With White Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that a
5-year-old black child should remain with his white foster parents,
ending a three-year custody fight with the boy's black former
guardians.
   The Rev. Willie Williams, who had custody of Raymond Bullard
between 1985 and 1988, said he and his wife, Elaine, will not
appeal Tuesday's decision by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``Our family has suffered greatly,'' Williams said. ``I don't
want to keep dragging it on and on and on.''
   Williams said he has declined to see the child during the appeal
for fear of confusing him and would continue that to help the
youngster adjust to the home of John and Marilyn McLaughlin. The
boy turns 6 on June 25.
   Michael Churchill, the McLaughlins' attorney, said his clients
are hopeful ``that a long nightmare is over.''
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Mrs. McLaughlin. ``Hopefully it's
over.''
   When he was a few months old in October 1983, Raymond was placed
with the McLaughlins for what was supposed to be six months. But
his mother, who had emotional problems, was deemed not ready to
resume caring for the child at the end of the period, and Raymond
remained with the McLaughlin family.
   At age 2, he was moved to the Williams' home under a city policy
that tries to match children with culturally similar foster parents.
   The McLaughlins challenged the policy. In August, a federal
court ordered the child returned to their custody, ruling the
Constitution prevented agencies from using race as the sole reason
to remove a child from a foster home.
   The Williamses appealed the case.
   A three-judge panel ruled Tuesday that while the Williamses have
been ``superb foster parents,'' a return to the McLaughlins offered
Raymond ``the best hope of realizing his full potential.''
   A report from Dr. Eileen A. Bazelon, a psychiatrist chosen by
the city to examine Raymond while he lived with each family, said
Raymond had suffered depression and developmental problems after
leaving the McLaughlins.
   Churchill said the decision set an important precedent.
   ``This confirms that the city was wrong to remove the child on
the basis of race _ that what's most important is the child's
needs,'' Churchill said. ``We believe that it's the right decision
and should have nationwide impact.''

<TEXT>
   Tiananmen Square, a raucous rallying point for
students demanding democratic rights by day, at night becomes a
carnival ground of concerts, dancing and exotic food.
   While thousands of students camped out on the square doze in
rickety huts, night owls sing folk songs and dance to tinny sounds
from portable cassette players.
   Some sing Chinese ballads or hearty renditions of Lionel Richie
and John Denver. Others croon Peter, Paul and Mary, sometimes in
English, sometimes in Chinese.
   One night last week students held a talent show, including
serenaders and an amateur stand-up comic. Another night there was a
huge rock concert, with 10,000 fans clustered around the base of
the Monument to the People's Heroes as popular Chinese singers took
turns at the mike.
   ``I've been coming out here since the protests began,'' said
guitar strummer Cai Wei, a 22-year-old student at the Central
Academy of Fine Arts. ``The students on the square are exhausted,
so I try to provide some atmosphere for them.''
   Cai, clad only in a loose green shirt and smudged red shorts,
sings folk songs from the provinces, such as the tragicomic tale of
a man with a bad leg:
   ``For the revolution, for the party
   ``The cripple joined the army,
   ``For the revolution, for the party
   ``The cripple died for the army.''
   Traditional and romantic numbers are in. Jabs at unpopular
leaders are not.
   Unlike the strident chants of millions of protesters in the last
two weeks taunting Premier Li Peng and questioning the mental
competence of aging senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the balladeers
don't poke fun at their enemies.
   ``We're not here to insult anybody, we're seeking political
reforms,'' said a student from Beijing Normal University who gave
her name only as Liu.
   She was singing with about 20 other colleagues outside a
clumsily built tent at 4:00 a.m.
   A few couples stroll arm-in-arm under a crescent moon in the
vast expanse sweeping southward from the Forbidden City, where
China's emperors once lived, though Tiananmen has hardly become a
lover's lane.
   Some slow dance at the mini-dances that spring up spontaneously,
swaying to drippy instrumental tunes from cassette players set on
the ground.
   With sundown, the avenues bordering the square fill with vendors
of barbecued mutton, onion pancakes, dumpling soup and noodles
stretched from dough as you watch.
   But most of the food goes to curious residents of the capital
who come to Tiananmen at night for a moonlit glimpse at the
revolution, which began May 13 with a hunger strike by some 3,000
students and swelled to more than 200,000 before tapering off.
   The students, many from outlying provinces and most of them
broke, rely on donations for their meals, usually a couple of buns
twice a day, sometimes with rice porridge and a bottle of chalky
soda pop.
   ``Look how cracked my lips are,'' said a rower from Beijing
Physical Education University. ``I collapsed once during the hunger
strike. What's hardest is keeping up our strength.''
   It's easier to stay up all night because of the cold, the rower
said. ``If I sleep at night I get the chills,'' he said, squatting
on a thick cotton jacket on Tiananmen's concrete pavement.
   Overnight temperatures drop to 52 degrees.
   The food situation has improved lately, said Chen Shounan of
Anhui Industry Institute: ``The last couple of days we each got an
egg with our meals.''
   The lamps glowing in the square go out around 5:15 a.m. and the
nights wind down with the raising of the national flag by a
People's Liberation Army honor guard at sunrise.
   ``You see, we are a patriotic movement, nothing more,'' said a
Beijing Agricultural Institute coed who stayed up to join about 100
others and applaud the flag-raising. ``I may lose sleep, but it's
worth it.''

Case</HEAD>

   Hundreds of people cheered at calls for
swift, sure and lengthy imprisonment for sex offenders at a meeting
prompted by the rape and mutilation of a young boy.
   ``The case that has drawn us here tonight is everybody's worst
nightmare ... the sadistic abuse of a child,'' Karen Sundquist of
the Child Guidance Clinic, said Tuesday night.
   More than 400 people filled the Tacoma City Light auditorium for
the meeting, which was punctuated by cheers, applause and calls
from the crowd for the death penalty. At least another 50 people
watched on closed-circuit television from down the hall and dozens
were unable to get inside.
   The meeting was organized by sexual assault counselors and
community leaders to deal with the uproar after a 7-year-old boy
was raped and his penis cut off on May 20. More than $100,000 has
been raised or pledged from around the country for the youngster,
who is recovering.
   Charges of attempted murder, rape and assault have been filed
against Earl Kenneth Shriner, 39, diagnosed as retarded and
confined in prison and mental health institutions five times since
1965.
   A legislative hearing on the case is scheduled Friday in Olympia.
   ``I am angry. I'm appalled. I'm frustrated,'' said Pierce County
Executive Joe Stortini. ``We must eliminate the gap between the
mental health system and the criminal justice system.''
   County Prosecutor John Ladenburg drew one of the biggest cheers
when he called for building a mental health prison.
   He dismissed the notion that treatment could cure habitual child
sex abusers as ``a '60s mentality ... that's not the reality.''
   Mike Comte of Comte Associates, which provides therapy for sex
offenders, said the 200 people being treated in his program
``probably represent 2,000 to 3,000 victims.''
   But Comte warned that incarcerating every sex offender
indefinitely would mean 10 or 15 new prisons.
   There was an uncomfortable stirring when Comte said he
recognized men in the audience who had been through treatment
successfully ``and are now law-abiding, taxpaying citizens.''
   Loud applause also followed calls for more widespread and
explicit warnings about sex offenders, including publicizing their
names once they have completed prison terms. Also popular were
calls for laws to ensure that more sex offenders are locked up and
fewer are released.
   Most audience members were orderly during the two-hour session,
but a few interrupted speakers with shouts like ``Castrate him!''
from one man and ``What about the death penalty for the
untreatable?'' from one woman.
   Others complained bitterly of being unable to get charges filed
against ex-husbands they claimed had abused their children, and
some said they now were afraid to let their children play outside.
   ``Do I tell my hyperactive child, after they told me to let her
run around outdoors as much as possible, she has to stay in the
house and drive all of us crazy?'' one woman shouted.
   No one who spoke from the audience gave his or her name.
   State Rep. Art Wang, D-Tacoma, got a vocal response when he
urged voter approval of a state constitutional amendment to bolster
victims' rights, including a right to be heard at sentencing.
   ``Why wait till November?'' one man shouted. The Legislature has
already passed the amendment.
   State Attorney General Ken Eikenberry was among the crowd unable
to get in the building. He said he was ready to help draft
legislation to keep dangerous sex offenders and those likely to
commit sex offenses locked up.
   Petitions circulated inside and outside the building calling for
a special session of the Legislature for tougher laws against
sexual crimes that cause severe bodily harm or death.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Dismisses Kidnapping Charges Against Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have dropped charges in a
1987 child kidnapping case that had yielded a conviction of the
wrong man and a mistrial for a second suspect.
   Box Elder County Attorney Jon Bunderson on Tuesday filed a
motion to dismiss charges of child kidnapping, aggravated sexual
abuse of a child and aggravated kidnapping against Thomas C.
Headley, 32.
   Bunderson said he had consulted with the parents of the victim,
a 9-year-old girl who was abducted from a schoolyard on March 24,
1987, sexually abused and abandoned the next day across the border
in Idaho.
   ``I think this was a mutual decision we all reached,'' Bunderson
said.
   Frank Harvey, 47, of Elma, Wash., was convicted in August 1987
but released from prison four months later after authorities said
they had evidence implicating Headley.
   A mistrial was declared in Headley's trial May 19 after the
eight-member jury became deadlocked and said it could not reach a
decision because of a ``lack of facts.''
   Bunderson said those difficulties were weighed in his decision
to file the motion.
   ``I don't see that another jury would do anything differently,
to tell the truth,'' he said.
   Prosecutors also did not want to subject the girl to a third
appearance on the witness stand.
   The girl, who was 6 at the time of her abduction, had not
identified Harvey as her assailant but was able to pick Headley, of
Snowville, out of a photo collage and a police lineup.
   The case was further complicated when it was learned both
suspects drove blue cars, smoked cigarettes with brown tips, and
owned the same breed of dog.

<HEAD>Top Dissident Indicted for Unauthorized Trip to North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading dissident was indicted today
on charges his controversial and unauthorized trip to communist
North Korea violated his country's national security law.
   Prosecutors said the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, 71, and a traveling
companion, Yoo Won-ho, 59, were charged with ignoring the country's
ban on unauthorized travel to a hostile government and praising
``anti-state elements'' during a nine-day trip to North Korea.
   The two were arrested April 13 on their return to Seoul and have
been held in detention since.
   If convicted, Moon could be sentenced to anywhere from five
years in prison to death, although there is little chance he would
be executed.
   Moon's trip triggered a major controversy, with South Korean
officials saying the dissident clergyman's visit to the communist
capital of Pyongyang aided North Korean attempts to cause unrest
and discredit the Seoul government.
   While in the north, Moon met with North Korean leader Kim Il
Sung to discuss territorial reunification and other issues. Seoul
holds that talks with the north should be conducted through
official channels only and that Moon did not represent the south.
   The charges accuse Moon of asking Chung Kyong-mo, a Korean
resident in Japan, to arrange the trip.
   Yoo is charged with receiving money from leaders of Hanmintong,
a pro-North Korean organization in Japan, to buy a parliamentary
nomination from an opposition party last year. Yoo was also charged
with receiving $120,000 dollars from Hanmintong to set up an
engineering company and act as agent for the group in South Korea.
   Lee Young-hee, an editorial advisor to the liberal newspaper
Hankyoreh Shinmum, was indicted last week for attempting to arrange
an unauthorized trip to North Korea for reporters on the newspaper.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
peninsula into the communist north and capitalist south at the end
of World War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950, touching
off the bloody three-year Korean War.

<HEAD>San Francisco Rock Star Dead at 45</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENBRAE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guitarist John Cipollina, a founder of
the '60s rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service, has died of
emphysema. He was 45.
   Cipollina, whose flowing melodic style represented the San
Francisco sound at its purest, died Monday at Marin General
Hospital. He had been taken there after he became short of breath
at his home in Mill Valley.
   Born in Berkeley, Cipollina lived in San Salvador and Guatemala
as a child and moved to Mill Valley with his family at 6.
   In 1965, he helped form Quicksilver, a group that was never as
popular as San Francisco Bay area contemporaries the Grateful Dead
and Jefferson Airplane. But according to the Encyclopedia of Rock,
the band represented the epitome of the San Francisco sound.
   Cipollina, whose signature song was the Bo Diddley classic
``Mona,'' contributed some of the legendary instrumental jams of
the era.
   He left Quicksilver in 1970 and later played with the band
Copperhead and the Welsh band called ``Man.'' He also toured Europe
during the 1970s with fellow Marin musician Nick Gravenites, a
former member of the San Francisco band Electric Flag.
   Most recently, Cipollina had played with the Dinosaurs, a band
consisting of former members of Jefferson Airplane, Country Joe and
the Fish and Big Brother and the Holding Company.
   His mother, who survives him, was a concert pianist and his
godfather was pianist Jose Iturbi. His younger brother, Mario, is
the bass player with Huey Lewis &amp; the News.
   Funeral plans are pending.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today granted a
one-year extension of trade benefits to China and Hungary, based on
their peformance on human rights.
   In a notice to Congress, Bush said he was keeping the two
countries on the list of nations that enjoy the ``most favored
nation'' trading status.
   The designation protects these nations from higher tariffs that
the United States imposes on countries it deems to have poor
records on human rights and emigration.
   The Soviet Union, for example, does not have preferred trade
status, but Bush has offered to grant that designation if Moscow
formalizes its relaxed emigration policy.

<HEAD>Witness Tells of Threats Against Slain Producer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A threat from entertainer Joey Bishop and two
anonymous telephone calls prompted ``Cotton Club'' producer Roy
Radin to hire a bodyguard about six months before he was killed,
Radin's former assistant testified.
   At a preliminary hearing for three defendants Tuesday, Jonathan
Lawson said Radin sought protection after Bishop threatened to
``call out the Philadelphia Mafia on him.''
   Bishop has not been named in the case. A telephone call to a
number listed as his residence yielded no answer Tuesday evening.
   Attorneys for the defendants were trying to show that many other
people had motives to kill Radin, an obese, cocaine-sniffing
producer whose first attempt at Hollywood movie-making was aborted
by his slaying.
   The prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer Karen DeLayne
Greenberger arranged Radin's murder after they fought about her
share of profits from the movie, ``The Cotton Club.''
   Mrs. Greenberger is charged along with Alex Lamota Marti,
William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, former bodyguards for
Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt. Lowe is fighting
extradition in Maryland. The current hearing will determine whether
Mrs. Greenberger, Mentzer and Marti stand trial.
   Six months before his disappearance, Lawson recalled that Radin
hired a former wrestler named Sal to guard him. He was asked to
explain.
   ``We had a very bad experience in Atlantic City,'' N.J., said
Lawson.
   Asked to explain, Lawson replied, ``Joey Bishop made threats to
him and threatened to call out the Philadelphia Mafia on him ....
This took place in Atlantic City.''
   He indicated Bishop was part of a show Radin had staged at
Bally's casino in the gambling resort.
   ``Were you present when the threats were made?'' asked attorney
Richard Hirsch.
   ``I was present in the office at Bally's when Joey Bishop
pointed a finger at Roy and said, `I'll see that you're
straightened out because you're in my territory now,''' Radin said.
He did not explain what triggered the remarks, and further
questioning was cut off by Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay,
who ruled it was irrelevant.
   Lawson said that in the months leading up to Radin's May 1983,
disappearance, at least two anonymous phone callers threatened
Radin's life.
   He quoted one of the callers as saying, ``Radin has been
shooting off his mouth too much. He should take the deal the way it
is and shut his mouth.''
   The second caller, he said, warned that if Radin didn't heed
warnings, ``he'll find himself dead.''
   Radin's show business connections have added glitter to the
case. Actor Demond Wilson of TV's ``Sanford and Son'' was scheduled
to take the stand sometime today.
   Former Paramount Pictures chief Robert Evans, who initially was
implicated in the case, invoked Fifth Amendment protection against
self incrimination and refused to testify. He and Radin
collaborated on raising money for ``The Cotton Club'' production
after they were introduced by Mrs. Greenberger.
   Radin disappeared after leaving for dinner with Mrs. Greenberger
on May 13, 1983. His body was found a month later in a dry riverbed
65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot repeatedly in the
head.
   The defense stepped up its attack on the dead man's character
Tuesday, eliciting testimony that he physically abused his former
wife, used cocaine in excessive amounts and substituted the
tranquilizer Thorazine when he was withdrawing from cocaine.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms From Colorado to Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Scattered thunderstorms rumbled from Colorado to Michigan early
today, dumping heavy rain in the Midwest and causing some flooding,
while warm weather lingered over parts of the East.
   The heavy rains followed tornadoes late Tuesday in Michigan and
Iowa. In central Iowa, tornadoes injured three people and damaged
eight farms, according to the National Weather Service. No injuries
or property damage were reported in Michigan, authorities said.
   In central Wisconsin, flooding in North Fond du Lac near the
south shore of Lake Winnebago forced the evacuation of about a half
dozen dwellings, officials said.
   But a flash flood watch for the area was cancelled by the
Weather Service early today. ``It has calmed down pretty much,''
Renee Kissinger, a dispatcher for the Fond du Lac County Sheriff's
Department.
   In southwestern Michigan, flooding was reported in Jackson and
Lansing areas. Flood watches were in effect this morning for lower
Michigan and northwest Ohio.
   Heavy rain during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
more than an inch in Muskegon, Mich., and about three-quarters of
an inch in Lander, Wyo., and in Detroit.
   In the 24 hours ending at 9 p.m. EDT, Hopkins, Mich., had 4
inches of rain and Hamilton, Mich., received 3.75 inches.
   Other severe thunderstorms occurred over western portions of the
central and southern Plains. Farther west, snow fell early today in
Rock Springs, Wyo., and in portions of Yellowstone National Park.
   Elsewhere, late Tuesday thunderstorm winds gusted to 59 mph at
Midland, Texas, downing trees and power lines, and thunderstorms in
Florida spawned a tornado Tuesday afternoon in Pasco County, but no
major damage was reported.
   Tampa, Fla., recorded a temperature of 96 degrees on Tuesday, a
record for the date; Laredo, Texas, had the nation's high, though,
with 103 degrees.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the Great Basin across the central Rockies, the northern and
central Plains, the upper half of the Mississippi Valley and the
Great Lakes region to the north Atlantic coastal states; and widely
scattered thunderstorms over central and southern Florida.
   High temperatures were to be in the 50s and 60s from the Great
Basin across the northern half of the Rockies, most of Nebraska,
the Dakotas and Minnesota to Upper Michigan; in the 60s over
eastern Maine; in the 90s from the middle and south Atlantic
coastal states across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf
Coast states, the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and the
southern Great Plains to the desert Southwest; and a few 100 degree
readings along the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Elsewhere, highs
were mostly to be in the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 82 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   First Lady Barbara Bush dedicated a
cross-cut slab from a 750-year-old California redwood tree today as
a symbol of lasting friendship between the United States and West
Germany.
   Mrs. Bush noted that the piece of redwood had lived long and
traveled far to reach its new resting spot on a windswept knoll in
Bonn's Rheinaue Park.
   ``I hope passersby will enjoy this redwood slab and I also hope
they will be reminded of the close ties and friendship between our
peoples,'' she told about 200 West German well wishers who gathered
at the park for a brief dedication ceremony.
   Mrs. Bush, dressed in a royal blue and white silk dress with
matching jacket, said the redwood monument had been fashioned from
a tree felled in northern California's Six Rivers National Forest.
It was transported by ship from Oakland to the Dutch port of
Rotterdam, then by train to West Germany's capital.
   The 8-foot-wide slab was mounted on its side atop an oak
platform to display its rings. Small brass plaques embedded in the
wood note important dates in Bonn's history.
   The redwood gift is intended to mark Bonn's 2,000th anniversary,
which is being celebrated this year in tandem with the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the West German state.
   A White House statement said the giant redwood from which the
slab was cut had been ``harvested for environmentally sound
reasons.''
   Bonn Mayor Hans Daniels thanked Mrs. Bush for the redwood gift
and ``for the great help of the American people with the rebuilding
of the Federal Republic of Germany after the war.''
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said
the redwood display would remind visitors of ``the continuity of
the world.''
   To applause from the mostly elderly crowd, Mrs. Kohl praised
President Bush's announcement that West Germans no longer would
need visas to visit the United States.
   After the two first ladies posed for pictures with Daniels in
front of the redwood display, Mrs. Bush moved briskly through the
crowd shaking hands.
   Rheinaue Park overlooks the Rhine River between the federal
government offices and Bad Godesberg, where many foreign embassies
and guest houses are situated.

   The dollar eased in early European trading today
following Tuesday's central bank intervention. Gold prices fell.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's decline began in New York on
Tuesday afternoon and carried over into East Asian trading
overnight.
   In Frankfurt, where the dollar slipped back below 2.00 marks,
dealers said uncertainty about U.S. and West German interest rates
also put pressure on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 142.70 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.73 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.9883 West German marks, down from 2.0100
   _1.7248 Swiss francs, down from 1.7545
   _6.7391 French francs, down from 6.8085

   _1,442.50 Italian lire, down from 1,452.50
   _1.2068 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2055
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5740 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5570 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $364.25 a troy ounce, up
from $362.25 late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $363.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.85, up from $362.10 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.95 to close at a bid $364.68.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.26 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.20.

<HEAD>Domestic Partners Law Goes To Mayor After Second OK By Supervisors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law allowing unmarried couples, including
homosexuals, to register their unions and receive a document like a
marriage license was sent for signing to Mayor Art Agnos.
   The mayor has pledged to sign the legislation, which won its
second passage Tuesday by the city Board of Supervisors.
   ``This will let people love as they will,'' said Board President
Harry Britt, who sponsored the measure.
   The supervisors voted 9-0, with two absent, to support the
``domestic partners'' law allowing unmarried couples to register
their relationships publicly for a $35 fee.
   The supervisors also voted unanimously for the second time to
form a task force to examine the possibility of extending city
health benefits to the live-in lovers of city employees.
   The board passed both measures unanimously last week.
   Some religious leaders, including Roman Catholic Archbishop of
San Francisco John Quinn, have called the legislation an attack on
the family.
   A few other cities have extended health benefits to live-in
lovers of municipal employees. But San Francisco would be the first
to allow any unmarried couples to register their relationships the
way traditional couples obtain marriage licenses.

<TEXT>
   A father distraught over his 5-year-old son's
suffering from leukemia took the child from a hospital where he was
undergoing court-ordered treatment, police said today.
   David Pagan, 36, took his son, Darian, from Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Hospital sometime Sunday.
   ``We have no reason to believe the child is in any danger from
his father,'' said Sgt. Ed Burns, who added that the father's
action violated a court order.
   Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell said the father ``had indicated that he
didn't want the boy to suffer and that he wanted him to enjoy
life.''
   Pagan's brother-in-law told the Daily News that Darian had been
complaining of pain and that his father wanted to take the boy to
Walt Disney World in Florida.
   But police said they think Pagan may have taken Darian to a
cancer-treatment center in Arlington, Texas.
   Darian was hospitalized Friday under a court order requested by
the city's Child Welfare Administration because officials said the
boy was not getting the treatment he needed.
   The parents are Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not approve of blood
transfusions. But the News quoted an unidentified relative as
saying religion had nothing to do with the parents' objections to
treatment.
   The mother, Migdalia, 35, noticed Darian was missing from the
hospital Sunday evening and alerted staff. Police said the father
had been with his son at the hospital all day.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A song publishing firm has sued the
widow of rock 'n' roll star Roy Orbison for $1 million over royalty
rights from at least 15 songs he recorded late in life.
   Acuff-Rose Music Inc. claims Barbara Orbison induced her husband
to breach a $70,000-a-year songwriting contract allegedly signed in
July 1985.
   The publisher also seeks triple the profit collected by
Orbisongs, Orbison's California music publishing house, from songs
written or co-written by Orbison between July 1985 and his death in
December at age 52.
   The federal lawsuit filed Friday also claimed Mrs. Orbison and
Orbisongs have interfered with Acuff-Rose's negotiations for a
movie based on the singer's life.
   Mrs. Orbison did not immediately respond to a request for
comment relayed Tuesday through Orbison's Los Angeles-based
publicist.
   Acuff-Rose claims it should have had rights to songs including
``Handle With Care,'' ``Last Night,'' ``End of the Line,'' ``You
Got It,'' ``Dirty World,'' ``Rattled,'' ``Not Alone Anymore,''
``Congratulations,'' ``Heading for the Light,'' ``Margarita'' and
``Tweeter and the Monkey Man.''
   The lawsuit does not estimate the profit from the songs, many of
which appear on ``The Traveling Wilburys,'' an album Orbison made
last year with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.

<HEAD>Zoo Atlanta's Lowland Gorilla Willie B. Meets Girls for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everything was set for the first date: a nicely
decorated room, a convenient hammock, various playthings. And some
water hoses and tranquilizer darts, just so things wouldn't get out
of hand.
   After all, Willie B. hadn't been with a female for 28 years, and
it wasn't clear how the silverback lowland gorilla would react.
   ``I hope the gorilla's not as nervous as I am,'' Atlanta Zoo
Director Terry Maple said before Tuesday's meeting.
   The 30-year-old male gorilla was introduced to a pair of female
gorillas in a specially designed room. He had been isolated from
others of his kind for 28 years, allowed to observe other gorillas
only from a distance and through heavy mesh.
   But neither Willie B. nor the two females _ 6-year-old Kinyani
and 26-year-old Katoomba _ showed any shyness. Both females are
from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory
University.
   Kinyani and Katoomba were free to decide whether to join Willie
B. by using an overhead door large enough for them but too small
for Willie B. They waltzed right in, Maple said.
   Two other doors just big enough for Kinyani and Katoomba to
escape were available. Both used the doors several times but always
returned to the room, Maple said.
   After Willie made a few rushes, Katoomba responded with charges
of her own, and soon Willie gave way, letting the female chase him
around the room.
   ``This may be her social experience showing through,'' said
Kenneth Gould, chief of reproductive biology at Yerkes. ``She's
been through introductions before and has a history of being able
to look after herself.''
   A staring match followed, but after it broke up the gorillas sat
in relative quiet.
   ``It couldn't be going any better,'' Maple said. ``So far,
Willie has proved to be very normal in the behaviors he has shown
during the socialization process.''
   Erika Archibald, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said the norm among
gorillas is for each male to ``hang out'' with a group of females;
male gorillas tend to be antagonistic toward one another and could
fight.
   ``This is just a period of socialization for Willie B.,'' she
said.
   Dates will continue each day in the 37- by 20-foot room, Maple
said. Zoo officials hope the gorillas will mold themselves into a
family, with Katoomba eventually bearing Willie's child.
   Next week, officials plan to let the gorillas continue their
courtship outdoors. There are three other gorilla troops in the
$4.5 million Ford African Rain Forest habitat. The troops are
separated by moats.
   ``If all goes well with Willie B.'s introduction, we will be the
only zoo to have four gorilla troops on exhibit every day,'' Maple
said.

   Dead animals are piling up in
refrigerated trailers on the coast as officials collect evidence of
the vast damage caused by the oil spilled from the tanker Exxon
Valdez.
   The carcasses of 22,818 migratory birds, 733 sea otters and 51
birds of prey, most of them bald eagles, had been collected, tagged
and stored by Tuesday at four coastal cities.
   ``It's a morbid milestone we have reached this week; more than
two months after the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez, we are still
counting its victims,'' said Walter Stieglitz, Alaska regional
director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The gooey fingers of the spill have drifted more than 500 miles
from Prince William Sound across the Gulf of Alaska and beyond
Kodiak Island. About 11 million gallons of oil spilled from gashes
in the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24.
   More than 70 species of birds have been affected, the wildlife
service said. About 60 percent of the dead birds are murres, an
upright seabird with tuxedo-like markings.
   The carcasses in cold storage may represent only a small
percentage of the total number of animals killed by the spill,
officials have said.
   ``They are saying these numbers are about 5 percent of the
actual number impacted from this,'' said Craig Tidrick, a Fish and
Wildlife Service employee in Valdez. ``The carcasses are being
saved for evidence ... for the courts.''
   Surveys are underway, but the federal government has not yet
made an official estimate of the wildlife deaths.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's
speech on East-West relations as delivered Wednesday.
   Thank you, Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl. At the outset, let me tell
you that lest you think that he has forgotten his home state
because he is the chancellor of the Federal Republic, I will only
tell you that in the last 24 hours, Chancellor Kohl has been
convincing me that when I came to this state and to Mainz, I would
be coming to heaven. And having gotten here, I think he may just
about be right, I'll tell you. Thank you all very much.
   Dr. (Carl Ludwig) Wagner (governor of the Rhineland-Palatinate
State), Lord Mayor, distinguished hosts, I want to also thank these
two bands, West German and American, for that stirring music. And
Chancellor Kohl, I especially want to thank you again for inviting
me to this beautiful and ancient city on my first presidential trip
to the Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic.
   And Herr Kohl and I have concluded now our deliberations at the
NATO summit in Brussels _ an excellent start to our working
partnership as chancellor and president.
   And here in Mainz, by the banks of the Rhine, it's often said
that this heartland of mountain vineyards and villages embodies the
very soul of Germany. So Mainz provides a fitting forum for an
American president to address the German people.
   Today, I come to speak not just of our mutual defense but of our
shared values. I come to speak not just of our, the matters of the
mind, but of the deeper aspirations of the heart.
   Just this morning, Barbara and I were charmed with the
experiences we had. I met with a group, small group of German
students, bright young men and women who studied in the United
States. Their knowledge of our country and the world was
impressive, to say the least.
   But sadly, too many in the West, Americans and Europeans alike,
seem to have forgotten the lessons of our common heritage and how
the world we know came to be. And that should not be and that
cannot be.
   We must recall that the generation coming into its own in
America and Western Europe is heir to gifts greater than those
bestowed to any generation in history _ peace, freedom and
prosperity.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Says Prison Inmates Can Get Married</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the state is
violating the constitutional rights of prison inmates serving life
sentences by barring them from getting married.
   U.S. District Judge Neal P. McCurn said the state law violates
the inmates' right to equal protection and creates an
``impermissible distinction'' between them and inmates married
before sentencing.
   ``It is inconceivable to this court ... how marital status is in
any way relevant to punishment,'' McCurn wrote in a decision issued
Friday.
   The state Department of Correctional Services was sued by inmate
Richard Langone and Dari Schmall.
   Langone, 32, has served about 13 years of a 15 years-to-life
sentence for second-degree murder for a shooting when he was 18.
Since October he has been on a work-release program in New York
City.
   Schmall, 23, is expecting the couple's first child. She said
they have been engaged about five years.
   The state attorney general's office has not decided whether to
appeal, spokeswoman Nancy Connell said Tuesday.
   The corrections department had no comment until it could review
the decision, said agency spokesman James Flateau.

   This inheritance is possible because 40 years ago the nations of
the West joined in that noble common cause called NATO. First there
was the vision, the concept of free peoples in North America and
Europe, working to protect their values. And second, there was the
practical sharing of risks and burdens in a realistic recognition
of Soviet expansionism.
   And finally, there was the determination to look beyond old
animosities. The NATO alliance did nothing less than provide a way
for Western Europe to heal centuries-old rivalries, to begin an era
of reconciliation and restoration. It has been, in fact, a second
renaissance of Europe.
   As you know best, this is not just the 40th birthday of the
alliance. It's also the 40th birthday of the Federal Republic _ a
republic born in hope, tempered by challenge. At the height of the
Berlin crisis in 1948, Ernst Reuter called on Germans to stand firm
and confident. And you did _ courageously, magnificently.
   The historic genius of the German people has flourished in this
age of peace, and your nation has become a leader in technology,
the fourth-largest economy on Earth. But more important, you've
inspired the world by forcefully promoting the principles of human
rights, democracy and freedom.
   The United States and the Federal Republic have always been firm
friends and allies, but today we share an added role: partnersd in
leadership. Of course, leadership has a constant companion _
responsibility. And our responsibility is to look ahead and grasp
the promise of the future.
   I said recently that we're at the end of one era and at the
beginning of another. And I noted that in regard to the Soviet
Union, our policy is to move beyond containment.
   For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in Eastern Europe lay
dormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40
years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decade
after decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit withered
from the chill of conflict and oppression. And again, the world
waited.
   But the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The world
has waited long enough. The time is right. Let Europe be whole and
free.
   To the founders of the Alliance, this aspiration was a distant
dream. And now it's the new mission of NATO. If ancient rivals like
Britain and France or France and Germany can reconcile, then why
not the nations of the East and West?
   In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way. Look at
Poland, where Solidarity ... and the Catholic Church have won legal
status. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo on
the defensive.
   In the West, we have succeeded because we've been faithful to
our values and our vision. And on the other side of the rusting
Iron Curtain, their vision failed. The Cold War began with the
division of Europe. It can only end when Europe is whole.
   And today, it is this very concept of a divided Europe that is
under siege. And that's why our hopes run especially high, because
the division of Europe is under siege, not by armies, but by the
spread of ideas that began here, right here. It was a son of Mainz,
Johannes Gutenberg, who liberated the mind of man through the power
of the printed word. And that same liberating power is unleashed
today in a hundred new forms.

   This looks like any former company town in
West Virginia, with parallel rows of virtually identical houses, a
small, soapsud-filled creek flowing past back yards and a
played-out mine.
   But residents are worried about something unseen that sets
Minden apart _ it may be contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals.
   For years, Shafer Equipment Co. removed oil from old electrical
transformers they were rebuilding, burning some oil for heat,
giving some to residents to use in furnaces and dumping the rest in
a pit at the mouth of the former Minden mine, residents say.
   The oil is laced with polychlorinated biphenyls, known to cause
cancer in laboratory animals. PCBs bond to soil and are not
water-soluble, so any contaminated oil dumped 15 years ago could
still present a health risk.
   Frequent floods along Arbuckle Creek, which flows through town,
have dumped tons of mud from the plant into yards and basements.
Oak Hill, a city of 9,200 a few miles to the west, also gets much
of its water from the area.
   ``When you sit and think that we've been exposed to this
contamination for 15 years,'' said resident Sue Workman, ``I'm of
the opinion there is no way they could ever clean it up.''
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency has spent $3 million
cleaning up the plant, hauling away 4,735 tons of contaminated
dirt, 110 drums of contaminated liquids and solids, 23 drums of
electric capacitors and 21 transformers, said agency spokeswoman
Theresa Bickel in Philadelphia. Last month, the agency agreed to
test the soil within three miles of the site.
   But some residents, who have formed a group called Concerned
Citizens to Save Fayette County, think no amount of work will make
the town safe. They want a state or federal buyout of their town
and creation of a New Minden somewhere else _ at an estimated cost
at $20 million.
   ``Money _ should that be a consideration when people's lives are
at stake?'' asked Workman, 30, the mother of two.
   Simply moving is out of the question for most of the town's 300
families because no one wants to buy a house here, she said. ``You
can't give a piece of property away,'' she said.
   The EPA soil study will begin in September and take at least six
months, said Loretta Haddy, an epidemiologist with the state Health
Department. If high levels of PCBs are found, the Centers for
Disease Control will investigate whether they have caused any
health problems.
   A state Health Department study of the town's mortality figures
from 1979 to 1985 found nothing unusual.
   But a study by Vanderbilt University students last year came up
with vastly different results.
   The students found traces of PCBs in soil taken from 17 of 19
sites. They also surveyed 173 residents and found 62 percent of the
women surveyed had suffered miscarriages or stillbirths, or had
children with birth defects.
   Sixteen percent said they had cancer, 18 percent suffered from
liver disorders, 34 percent had skin problems ranging from dryness
to hair loss, and 31 percent reported a persistent cough _ all
apparent symptoms of PCB contact.
   ``We don't know anything about the protocol for the study, the
methods they used, anything about the study,'' Haddy said, but
added, ``We're interested in what they came up with.''
   But Workman and other residents complain bitterly about the
department.
   ``They've ignored our pleas, and finally we had to go elsewhere
to get help,'' Workman said.
   Lucian Randall, a laid-off miner, says he has evidence of PCB
contamination in the palm of his hand _ a recurring scaly patch. He
worked for about two years as a security guard during the first
cleanup of the site. He says tests have shown his blood contains
PCBs.
   ``Sure, I'm worried. But I'm 62,'' said Randall, who lives 100
yards from the plant. ``I'm worried about the kids around here.''
   The Fayette County Board of Education plans to shut Minden
Elementary School at the end of this school year, saying there
aren't enough students to keep it open. But some are sure the board
doesn't think it's safe to keep children in Minden.
   ``I don't think anybody in our group would say every health
problem in Minden is caused by PCBs,'' Workman said. ``But the
health problems are incredible, and the stress of not knowing what
to expect _ it's incredible.''

   The centennial of the giant flood that
swept 2,209 people to their deaths under a 70-foot wall of water is
being marked today with a torchlight pageant and memorials.
   ``The flood, they say, is an old story. But it isn't. It's as
new as Three Mile Island, it's as new as Chernobyl, it's as new as
the Alaskan oil spill,'' said David McCullough, who wrote a book
about the flood.
   The Johnstown flood was the nation's second-worst natural
disaster. A tidal wave killed about 5,000 people at Galveston,
Texas, in 1900.
   Floodwaters from Lake Conemaugh, a private resort created by
wealthy industrialists, broke through a poorly constructed earthen
dam on May 31, 1889, after several days of rain.
   The waters swept 14 miles down the Little Conemaugh River Valley
and slammed into the town of 10,000 people, virtually washing it
away in about 10 minutes.
   A huge pile of debris containing scores of survivors of the
flood piled up against the Pennsylvania Railroad's stone bridge,
which still stands across the Conemaugh River just below downtown,
and caught fire, causing more deaths.
   As part of today's observance, officials are opening a new
National Park Service visitors center and the renovated Johnstown
Flood Museum.
   A memorial is scheduled at Point Stadium near the stone bridge
and will include the lighting of a torch, the ringing of church
bells, sirens, brief fireworks and a citywide moment of silence.
   The two living survivors of the flood, Elsie Frum, 106, and
Frank Shomo, 100, will be the guests of honor at the annual
Survivors' Banquet at Christ the Saviour Cathedral in downtown
Johnstown.

   The Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, allow us to enlighten
millions deep within Eastern Europe and throughout the world.
Television satellites allow us to bear witness from the shipyards
of Gdansk to Tiananmen Square. But the momentum for freedom does
not just come from the printed word or the transistor or the
television screen.
   It comes from a single powerful idea: Democracy.
   This one idea, this one idea, is sweeping across Eurasia. This
one idea is why the communist world, from Budapest to Beijing, is
in ferment. And of course, for the leaders of the East it's not
just freedom for freedom's sake. But whatever their motivation,
they are unleashing a force they will find difficult to channel or
control, the hunger for liberty of oppressed peoples who've tasted
freedom.
   Nowhere is this more apparent than in Eastern Europe, the
birthplace of the Cold War.
   In Poland, at the end of World War II, the Soviet army prevented
the free elections promised by Stalin at Yalta. And today, Poles
are taking the first steps toward real elections, so long promised,
so long deferred. And in Hungary, at last we see a chance for
multiparty competition at the ballot box.
   And as President, I will continue to do all I can to help open
the closed societies to the East. We seek self-determination for
all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe. And we will ... and we
will not relax, and we must not waver. Again, the world has waited
long enough.
   But democracy's journey east is not easy. Intellectuals, like
the great Czech playwright, Vaclav Havel, still work under the
shadow of coercion. And repression still menaces too many peoples
of Eastern Europe. Barriers and barbed wire still fence in nations.
   So when I visit Poland and Hungary this summer, I will deliver
this message: There cannot be a common European home until all
within it are free to move from room to room. And I'll take another
message: The path of freedom leads to a larger home, a home where
West meets East, a democratic home, the commonwealth of free
nations.
   And I said that positive steps by the Soviets would be met by
steps of our own, and this is why I announced on May 12th a
readiness to consider granting to the Soviets temporary waiver of
the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions if they liberalize emigration.
   And this is also why I announced on Monday that the United
States is prepared to drop the ``no exceptions'' standard that has
guided our approach to controlling the export of technology to the
Soviet Union, lifting a sanction enacted in response to their
invasion of Afghanistan. And in this same spirit ... in this same
spirit, I set forth four proposals to heal Europe's tragic
division, to help Europe become whole and free.
   First, I propose we strengthen and broaden the Helsinki process
to promote free elections and political pluralism in Eastern
Europe. As the forces of freedom and democracy rise in the East, so
should our expectations. And weaving together the slender threads
of freedom in the East will require much from the Western
democracies.
   In particular, the great political parties of the West must
assume an historic responsibility to lend counsel and support to
those brave men and women who are trying to form the first truly
representative political parties in the East, to advance freedom
and democracy, to part the Iron Curtain.

<HEAD>Sousuke Uno to be Next Prime Minister, Despite Resistance</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with former prime minister's reaction,
details. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno today agreed to become
the next prime minister after leaders of the scandal-ridden
governing party, bucking stubborn resistance, decided he was the
best person for the job, a party official said.
   Uno, in Paris on official business, agreed in a telephone call
to take the jobs of party head and government leader after
expressing some reluctance, Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy party
secretary-general, told a news conference.
   ``I am not confident I can handle the job when the party is
facing such a difficult time,'' Hashimoto quoted Uno as telling
him. ``But now that the party is in an unprecedented crisis, I will
commit myself for the party.''
   Hashimoto said leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
decided that Uno, 66, is ``the most suited candidate as successor''
to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who is resigning to take
responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal involving the
Recruit Co.
   Recruit, an information and publishing conglomerate, is accused
of seeking favors and influence through political donations and
bargain-priced share transactions that benefited leading
politicians.
   Those linked to the scandal include Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Takeshita's predecessor; Takeshita; and party Secretary-General
Shintaro Abe.
   Uno is not known to have received Recruit money. That and his
expertise in foreign affairs were said to be his main selling
points.
   But some opposed Uno because he is a senior member of the party
faction of Nakasone, during whose 1982-87 tenure most of the
Recruit scandal took place.
   ``I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest
office, which only one person can assume, to a sort of managing
director of the Nakasone company,'' former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda told reporters after Hashimoto's announcement.
   Fukuda's name was one of many that surfaced during the long
search for a successor to Takeshita.
   Hashimoto said the decision to pick Uno was worked out in
day-long meetings involving himself; Takeshita; Masayoshi Ito,
chairman of the party Executive Council; Michio Watanabe, chairman
of the Policy Board; and Ichiro Yamanouchi, party leader in the
upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   He said party legislators would probably confirm Uno as party
leader Friday. The Parliament, where the governing party has a big
majority, then will vote on Uno for prime minister.
   Before Hashimoto's announcement, a group of 48 younger
legislators said party leaders should halt their search for a new
prime minister and ``take responsibility'' for the Recruit scandal
first _ in effect resign their party posts.
   ``Now that the party had adopted measures to take responsiblity
for the scandal, we demand the party to implement them first,''
said Shizuka Kamei, head of the Liberal Progressive Alliance. ``If
party leaders are going to neglect responsibility measures and
appoint a new prime minister, we are prepared to support our own
candidate.''
   Party elders such as former prime ministers Fukuda and Zenko
Suzuki suggested a separation of the jobs of party head and prime
minister.
   The party elders had argued it would be too much a burden for a
prime minister to also handle party reform.
   ``The prime minister has to be one person, but difficulties in
the party will not allow one person to handle both the party and
the government,'' Fukuda told reporters. ``I suggested something
like a collective leadership in the party.''

<HEAD>Black Woman Says She Was Forced Out Of House Days After Moving In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black woman says racial harassment forced
her and her two young children to abandon the first house she ever
owned just eight days after they moved in.
   ``Those people just don't want me to live there,'' said Rosa
Toussaint, 29.
   Ms. Toussaint's assessment was confirmed by some residents of
the neighborhood, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in today's
editions. Several said the real estate company never should have
shown her a house in an all-white neighborhood and should have
warned her that she would not be welcomed there, the newspaper said.
   ``Blacks start moving in and property values go down and white
people start running,'' Frank Sintic said Tuesday. ``They shouldn't
run, in my opinion, but they do and Realtors end up making
fortunes.''
   Ms. Toussaint said she moved to Philadelphia after being
honorably discharged from the Army. She works for a nonprofit
agency that monitors abused and neglected children.
   She said the problems began May 13, the day she moved into the
rowhouse.
   She said she heard someone make a racist comment when she was
moving in, but ignored it. Two days later, she found her garbage
can overturned and a fish skeleton on her doorstep.
   Several days later, she said, rocks were thrown through two
windows.
   ``At that moment, I knew I wasn't staying there and I would not
be going back,'' Toussaint said. ``It could be fire next time.''
   Neighborhood pizza shop owner Sandy Borschell blamed Brunner
Real Estate Inc., which handled the sale of the $27,250 rowhouse.
   ``They made that woman a victim of society,'' he said.
   Bob Coyle of Brunner said the company did exactly what laws
dictate.
   ``The woman came in here and wanted to buy a house and we sold
her a house. We did not discriminate,'' he said.
   ``I don't care what the neighbors say,'' he added. ``They're a
bunch of bigots, anyhow.''
   Ms. Toussaint reported the events to the Police Department's
Conflict Prevention and Resolution Unit and to the city's
Commission on Human Relations.
   Toussaint, who is staying with friends, said she plans to stay
in Philadelphia.

<TEXT>
   A bill to restrict the use of untraceable license
plates, originally intended for undercover police officers, has
been introduced after status-conscious politicians began using the
ever-so-secret tags.
   The issue came to light when state literacy chief Gerard D'Amico
acknowledged and apologized in early May for running up $900 in
parking tickets on his state car, which was outfitted with
confidential plates that even the Registry of Motor Vehicles
couldn't track.
   D'Amico chalked up the tickets to ``carelessness and
stupidity,'' paid the tickets, turned in his state car and said he
hoped the incident wouldn't hurt his bid for lieutenant governor in
1990.
   The confidential plates look just like those issued to any other
Massachusetts driver. The bill to restrict their use to law
enforcement officers was introduced Tuesday by state Rep. Peter
Torkildsen.
   Since Administration and Finance Secretary Edward Lashman issued
an internal memorandum April 5 asking all agencies to detail and
justify their confidential plates, three cabinet secretaries have
turned in their secret tags.
   Lashman's agency has given 35 administrative officials
permission to retain the plates; 769 plates have been issued to law
enforcement officials or other investigatory officers.
   The administration believes Torkildsen's legislation should
allow exceptions for officials who receive death threats and for
investigatory units that are not strictly law enforcement, such as
Alcohol Beverage Control Commission investigators.
   For example, Revenue Commissioner Stephen Kidder has one of the
confidential plates because of the frequent threats he gets as the
state's chief tax collector.

<TEXT>
   Soviet bloc allies at East-West
disarmament talks in Vienna are praising President Bush's proposals
for big cuts in American and Soviet forces in Europe, media reports
said today.
   ``We were pleasantly surprised by the details of President
Bush's initiative,'' Hungary's ambassador to Austria, David
Meiszter, told a plenary session. His comments were reported by
Hungary's official MTI news agency.
   ``If his proposals come up for discussion at the conference
here, these will be, in our opinion, the most important Western
initiatives on arms reduction since the signing of the INF
agreement,'' Meiszter told delegates Tuesday, likening the
initiative to the 1987 treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear
missiles.
   The talks on Conventional Forces in Europe, which started here
in March, aim to reduce the element of a surprise attack by
establishing a secure and stable balance of conventional forces
from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains.
   ``In compliance with President Bush's proposals, the way is open
for a comprehensive agreement on the reduction of the most
destabilizing military units,'' MTI quoted Meiszter as saying.
   Bush seized the initiative in East-West relations Monday by
proposing a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops in Europe and a
ceiling of 275,000 soldiers on each side, requiring the Soviets to
demobilize 325,000 troops on the continent.
   The Warsaw Pact on Tuesday proposed limits for conventional
armaments in the Central European zone where most deadly weaponry
is massed on the continent.
   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst presented reporters
with proposals to cut back on six types of weapons by 1996-97 and
limit each side to: 570,000 troops, 420 tactical aircraft, 800
combat helicopters, 8,700 tanks, 7,600 artillery pieces and 14,500
armored troop carriers.
   Countries included in the proposal are Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary and Poland from the East and, from the Western
NATO alliance, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
West Germany.
   Speaking for the Warsaw Pact, Ernst chided the West for refusing
to include strike aircraft, combat helicopters and manpower in the
first agreement on conventional forces.
   NATO, saying it wants results soon, proposes first reducing
three kinds of weapons.
   Bush announced limits on tanks, armored troop carrriers and
artillery pieces. However, he said the West is willing to include
all land-based combat aircraft and helicopters.

   In fact, it's already begun to part. The frontier of barbed wire
and minefields between Hungary and Austria is being removed, foot
by foot, mile by mile. Just as the barriers are coming down in
Hungary, so must they fall throughout all of Eastern Europe. Let
Berlin be next. Let Berlin be next.
   Nowhere is the division between East and West seen more clearly
than in Berlin. There the brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor,
brother from brother. And that wall stands as a monument to the
failure of communism. It must come down.
   Now, ``glasnost'' may be a Russian word, but ``openness'' is a
Western concept. West Berlin has always enjoyed the openness of a
free city, and our proposal would make all Berlin a center of
commerce between East and West, a place of cooperation, not a point
of confrontation. And we rededicate ourselves to the 1987 allied
initiative to strengthen freedom and security in that divided city.
   This, then, is my second proposal: Bring glasnost to East Berlin.
   My generation remembers a Europe ravaged by war. And, of course,
Europe has long since rebuilt its proud cities and restored its
majestic cathedrals. But what a tragedy it would be if your
continent was again spoiled, this time by a more subtle and
insidious danger that the chancellor referred to, that of poisoned
rivers, acid rain. America's faced an environmental tragedy in
Alaska. Countries from France to Finland suffered after Chernobyl.
West Germany is struggling to save the Black Forest today. And
throughout, we have all learned a terrible lesson: Environmental
destruction respects no borders.
   So my third proposal is to work together on these environmental
problems, with the United States and Western Europe extending a
hand to the East. Since much remains to be done in both East and
West, we ask Eastern Europe to join us in this common struggle.
   We can offer technical training and assistance in drafting laws
and regulations and new technologies for tackling these awesome
problems. And I invite the environmentalists and engineers of the
East to visit the West, to share knowledge, so we can succeed in
this great cause.
   My fourth proposal, actually a set of proposals, concerns a less
militarized Europe, the most heavily armed continent in the world.
Nowhere is this more important than in the two Germanys.
   And that's why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a
special significance for the German people. To those who are
impatient with our measured pace in arms reduction, I respectfully
suggest that history teaches us a lesson, that unity and strength
are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms control. We've always
believed that a strong Western defense is the best road to peace.
And 40 years of experience have proven us right.
   But we've done more than just keep the peace. By standing
together, we have convinced the Soviets that their arms buildup has
been costly and pointless. Let us not give them incentives to
return to the policies of the past. Let us give them every reason
to abandon the arms race for the sake of the human race.
   In this era of both negotiation and armed camps, America
understands that West Germany bears a special burden. Of course, in
this nuclear age, every nation is on the front line. But not all
free nations are called to endure the tension of regular military
activity, or the constant presence of foreign military forces.
   We are sensitive to these special conditions that this needed
presence imposes. To significantly ease the burden of armed camps
in Europe, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of solid,
verifiable agreements between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   On Monday, with my NATO colleagues in Brussels, I shared my
great hope for the future of conventional negotiations in Europe. I
shared with them a proposal for achieving significant reductions in
the near future. And as you know, the Warsaw Pact has now accepted
major elements of our Western approach to the new conventional arms
negotiations in Vienna.
   The Eastern Bloc acknowledges that a substantial imbalance
exists between the conventional forces of the two alliances, and
they've moved closer to NATO's position by accepting most elements
of our initial conventional arms proposal. These encouraging steps
have produced the opportunity for creative and decisive action, and
we shall not let that opportunity pass.

   The Cuban immigrant who allegedly tried to hijack
an American Airlines jet to Cuba has offered to plead guilty to all
charges in exchange for deportation to his homeland.
   Pedro Rene Comas Banos, 38, went before U.S. Magistrate Linnea
Johnson to face air piracy charges Tuesday and, speaking through an
interpreter, surprised the court with an impromptu plea bargaining
gambit.
   ``If I plead guilty to all the charges, will you do me the favor
of deporting me to Cuba?'' he asked.
   A psychiatric examination of Comas was ordered on the motion of
a public defender appointed to represent him.
   Comas, who boarded American Flight 1098 in Los Angeles,
allegedly handed a threatening note to a flight attendant Saturday
saying he wanted to go to Cuba. The pilot of the flight, which was
on its Dallas to Miami leg, landed at Miami after telling Comas the
plane didn't have enough fuel to reach Havana.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Seeks Legal Reform in Light of Linares Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State law needs to catch up with life-support
technology and help avoid another case like that of Rudy Linares, a
distraught father who disconnected his comatose son's respirator at
gunpoint, a prosecutor says.
   ``The Linares case is now closed. But the issues raised by that
affair are very much alive,'' Cook County State's Attorney Cecil
Partee said Tuesday as he announced formation of a 43-member task
force to recommend legal changes to the Illinois Legislature.
   Legal, medical and religious experts are all represented on the
panel, which should help produce a law that more clearly defines
roles of patients, family members and doctors in life-and-death
decisions, Partee said.
   Linares, 23, disconnected the life support system for his
15-month-old son, Samuel, at a Chicago hospital on April 26. He
held the baby in his arms until Samuel was dead while holding
hospital personnel at bay at gunpoint.
   The boy had been in a coma, considered irreversible by doctors,
since choking on a balloon nine months earlier. The hospital had
refused family requests to withdraw life support, saying the child
was not brain dead.
   Partee's office charged Linares with murder, but a grand jury
refused to indict him.
   Partee said the task force will seek legal answers to such
questions as when death occurs, under what circumstances
life-support equipment can be removed, who decides on such removal,
and what procedures to follow before life support is withdrawn.
   Two members of the panel who appeared at a news conference with
Partee, former U.S. District Judge George Leighton and Chicago
lawyer James Serritella, whose firm represents the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Chicago, said they do not believe a new law should
require involving a judge in every case.
   ``These things are fast-moving,'' Leighton said. ``Imagine the
case of a parent of a child in a life-support system and some
hysterical situation arises. You mean you have to wait until Monday
when the court convenes to do something about it?
   ``These are the practical and sometimes philosophical questions
involved.''
   Partee said while some laws concerning life-support do exist,
interpretations in Illinois and throughout the country vary widely.
   The Linares case ended two weeks ago when the young father
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge and was sentenced to
conditional discharge and counseling, if needed. No jail time was
ordered.
   The Cook County medical examiner, who had said he could not
determine the cause of death, ruled Samuel's death accidental after
the grand jury decision.
   Linares, a house painter, has since said he saw no alternative
to his action because his son's continuing ordeal was ``just
tearing apart the whole family.''

<HEAD>Woman Admits To Letterman Break-ins And Is Freed From Mental Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who has claimed to be the wife of
NBC talk show host David Letterman and repeatedly has broken into
his house has pleaded guilty and agreed to stay away from him.
   Margaret Ray, 37, pleaded guilty Tuesday to using Letterman's
car without his permission and to two counts of first-degree
criminal trespass.
   A judge then ordered Ray released from a state mental hospital,
where she had been confined since a judge found her not competent
to stand trial in April.
   As part of a plea bargain arrangement, Norwalk Superior Court
Judge William F. Hickey Jr. sentenced Ray to a one-year suspended
sentence and three years probation.
   As a condition of probation, Ray must stay away from Letterman
and continue to undergo psychiatric treatment, Assistant State's
Attorney Robert G. Hall Jr. said. He said he believes Ray is
returning home to Crawford, Colo.
   The other charges against Ray were dropped, Hall said. She had
been charged with two counts of third-degree burglary, two counts
of sixth-degree larceny, two counts of first-degree criminal
trespass, possession of marijuana and possession of drug
paraphernalia in connection with break-ins at Letterman's New
Canaan home on Feb. 24 and 28.
   Last June, Ray was arrested when she tried to pass herself off
as Letterman's wife after she was stopped while driving Letterman's
1988 Porsche.
   Police said they later discovered that someone had broken into
Letterman's home in the exclusive suburb 40 miles north of New York
City. Police said it appeared someone had been living there for
several days while Letterman was out of town.

<TEXT>
   The family of hostage Terry Waite, who turned 50
today, said it was marking his birthday in quiet prayer for the
Church of England envoy.
   ``Terry will obviously be even more in our thoughts today,''
said his cousin, John Waite. ``I know hundreds of cards will be
arriving, as they always do at times like these, from all over the
world.''
   Waite, the archbishop of Canterbury's personal envoy,
disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987, in Beirut, where he had been trying
to secure the release of foreign hostages. No group has claimed to
hold him, but he is widely believed to be in Shiite Moslem hands.
   ``As we go through our daily routines today, we will all be
saying a prayer for Terry wherever he happens to be,'' John Waite
said.
   A spokesman for Archbishop Robert Runcie said: ``The archbishop
will be talking during the day with his (Waite's) brother and wife,
but he is remembered every day in our prayers.'' The spokesman was
not named according to British custom.
   Waite's other brother, David, said the family believes Waite
still is alive.
   ``Our faith takes the pressure out and we can relax in the
knowledge that at the right time, Terry will be released,'' he said.
   Terry Waite and his wife, Frances, have three daughters and one
son.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held by
kidnappers in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was taken
captive March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says Gorbachev Could Become New Dictator, Reforms Have Failed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Latvian deputy urging sovereign republics,
Gorbachev in audience, vice president's reaction and further criticisms
of Gorbachev. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin charged today that the Soviet
people are worse off now than they were before Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms, and he said the president has accumulated so
much power there is danger of a dictatorship.
   The former Moscow party boss proposed radical changes that would
take control of Soviet society away from the 20-million-member
Communist Party and make the party subservient to the newly elected
Congress of People's Deputies, on which Yeltsin serves.
   His proposals also would require the president to submit to an
annual nationwide referendum on his performance.
   In another challenge to traditional Soviet power, the president
of the Latvian republic, Anatoly V. Gorbunov, proposed making the
Soviet Union's 15 republics sovereign states that could decide what
functions to give the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev, sitting erect on the dais at Yeltsin's back, kept a
stoic face throughout the speech, scanning the Congress hall for
the deputies' reaction.
   Gorbunov _ like Yeltsin a Gorbachev protege _ said the republics
should be given power over their own resources and ``full state
authority.''
   Latvia's sister Baltic state, Estonia, declared itself sovereign
last fall, with the right to overturn Soviet laws on its territory.
The third Baltic state, Lituania, followed Estonia's lead two weeks
ago.
   ``The promised program and the promises of the past four years
have not been met,'' Yeltsin said in his first nationally televised
speech as a parliamentarian. ``People live worse ... the leadership
knows that.''
   He said he held Gorbachev responsible.
   Yeltsin said the Soviet leader had been given ``extraordinary
powers'' in the political overhaul that created the Congress, and
he suggested Gorbachev might be tempted, as past Kremlin chiefs
have, to abuse his power.
   Gorbachev, obviously sensitive to such charges, promised
Congress before he was elected last week that he never would take
advantage of the increased power of the presidency.
   But Yeltsin warned, ``We can again be ... under a new
totalitarian regime, under a new dictatorship.''
   Yeltsin, fired from his job as Moscow party chief in 1987 for
criticizing the pace of Gorbachev's reforms, called on Congress to
abolish ``all unlawlful privileges for the Nomenklatura _ yes, and
in general, strike this word from our lexicon.''
   ``Nomenklatura'' refers to the party and government elite, who
receive special privileges as a result of their positions or those
of their families.
   He also proposed making medicines and mass transit free for
invalids and tens of millions of poor Soviets.
   His speech came on the sixth day of the new Congress' inaugural
session. The 17-minute speech was occasionally interrupted by not
particularly enthusiastic applause.
   Members of the party's ruling Politburo were among those who did
not clap.
   On Thursday, the Congress elected Gorbachev, who is also the
Communist Party chief, to a five-year term as president.
   Yeltsin proposed that Gorbachev be subject to a nationwide vote
of confidence each year.
   He also called for changes in the party's policy-making Central
Committee, on which he serves, saying some occupants have not done
their job.
   Towering over the rostrum at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses,
Yeltsin proposed a law to regulate the functions of the Communist
Party, which has held a legal monopoly on power for more than 70
years.
   Power ``by right should belong to the people, in the form of the
organ it elects _ that is, the Congress,'' Yeltsin said.
   Legal limits on the party's prerogatives would be a
revolutionary development in Soviet politics, where for decades
party officials have dominated the apparatus of government and
turned legislative organs at all levels into docile rubber-stamp
bodies.
   Gorbachev has said his reforms are designed to separate the
government and party bureaucracies, get the party out of day-to-day
public affairs and let the popularly elected Congress and its
standing legislature set policy and law.
   Yeltsin's proposal would go considerably further by giving
popularly elected lawmakers such as himself the power to limit the
party's role.
   Yeltsin won more votes than any other deputy elected to the
Congress, with almost 90 percent of Moscow voters casting ballots
for him in March.
   His fellow deputies initially denied him a seat in elections for
the smaller, full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. But Yeltsin
was granted a seat Monday after another legislator gave up his seat
on condition Yeltsin could fill it.
   After Yeltsin's speech, Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov, elected
Monday with Gorbachev's backing, said: ``I think the party's
position in our country is just fine.''
   But Revas Tabukashvili, a deputy from Soviet Georgia, said the
power-transfer proposal might eventually succeed, and he believed
Gorbachev would support it.
   Moscow deputy Yuri Vlasov also criticized Gorbachev, saying he
found it hard to believe the president's statement Tuesday that he
knew nothing about a deadly clash between soldiers and
pro-independence protesters in Georgia until the day after it
happened.
   The clash in April resulted in 19 deaths.
   ``What kind of head of state is he, if he doesn't know when the
troops start to act?'' Vlasov asked.

   A 17-year-old boy opened fire inside a
crowded bank and was shot down by the money courier he was trying
to rob, police said.
   Five customers were struck by flying debris or shattered glass
during the shoot-out Tuesday morning at a Wells Fargo Bank branch,
police said, but none of their injuries was life-threatening.
   The critically wounded teen-ager and Miguel Sumano, 30, a
Federal Armored Express Inc. guard, were hospitalized, said police
officer Roger Mora.
   The shoot-out was the latest in a rash of armored car holdups in
which three couriers have been killed in the last year in Southern
California.
   When Sumano arrived at the bank to make a delivery, Mora said,
he was shot twice. Sumano and the teen-ager then fired additional
shots at each other; the teen-ager crashed against a glass door and
fell through it, Mora said.
   Sumano ``sat on him until help arrived,'' said Lt. Bob Ruchhoft.
   The teen-ager underwent surgery and was in critical condition at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. He
sustained heart and liver damage from a bullet that entered his
right side, Wise said.
   The teen-ager was not booked because of his wounds, Mora said.
   Two alleged accomplices were seen leaving the area in a gray or
blue car, Mora added.
   Sumano said his bullet-proof vest saved him; he was in good
condition at Midway Hospital Medical Center, said spokeswoman Mary
Miller.

   About 4,000 farmers, workers and students burned
China's best-known dissident in effigy today in the first
government-sponsored rally since the pro-democracy student movement
began six weeks ago.
   The rally in Huangcun, 20 miles south of Beijing, came as
Communist authorities pressed ahead with tactics aimed at
intimidating and discrediting the 10,000 students occupying central
Tiananmen Square.
   Several people said officials forced them to participate in the
40-minute rally in support of Premier Li Peng's hard-line policies.
   Also today, about 3,000 pro-democracy students marched from
Tiananmen Square to city police headquarters, where they held a
sit-in to protest the arrests of three labor leaders.
   They also demanded the resignations of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Li, who imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 and
ordered a crackdown on workers pressing for a freer China.
   Zhao Pinglu, head of the independent trade union to which the
workers belonged, said they were released late this afternoon after
being questioned for a day about the new union's activities.
   China's communist government bans all but the official All China
Federation of Trade Unions.
   ``Down with kidnapping!'' the students shouted. It was the
second straight day of protests in front of the police office.
   At the government-sponsored rally, demonstrators marched to an
outdoor stadium carying banners reading: ``We support Li Peng'' and
``We oppose the small group causing turmoil.''
   The event lacked enthusiasm of the demonstrations in Beijing,
where hundreds of thousands of people have marched to demand
democratic reforms and an end to official corruption.
   Rally leaders burned an effigy of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, an
outspoken proponent of democracy, but they failed to stir the crowd.
   Few joined leaders in shouting slogans such as ``Long live the
Communist Party!'' and ``Down with Fang Lizhi!'' Students responded
to the slogans with giggles.
   ``They told me to come, so I've come,'' said one 27-year-old
peasant in the crowd.
   ``To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an
18-year-old high school student. Some participants said they did
not understand the purpose of the demonstration.
   The Beijing Foreign Affairs Office informed foreign journalists
of the march and of several others in suburban sections of the
capital.
   Martial law regulations, which have been widely ignored, forbid
foreign reporters from covering student demonstrations.
   At Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic center of political power,
about 10,000 die-hard student protesters entered the 18th day of a
sit-in, resisting government demands they disperse.
   ``We are now basically waiting for the government to take the
initiative,'' student leader Mo Bin said. ``Things are pretty calm
with us. It's the government who's nervous.''
   More than a dozen military motorcycle convoys followed by jeeps
sped down the main arteries of the capital, the latest warning that
government tolerance was nearing an end.
   A military source said 200,000 troops surrounding Beijing have
been told to ``prepare for winter,'' meaning hardliners are digging
in for a long battle with Communist Party moderates who sympathize
with some goals of the students.
   Wan Li, a reformer and head of the National People's Congress,
or parliament, returned to Beijing today a week after reportedly
being stopped in Shanghai on his way back from a trip to the United
States.
   Chinese sources said Wan, who made statements in support of the
students while in the United States, was put under house arrest in
Shanghai. But after several days there he was quoted as giving full
backing to the government.
   The government said Wan stopped in Shanghai for medical
treatment. He was shown on the television news being helped off the
airplane by a flight attendant, but otherwise he looked healthy.
   A government propaganda campaign against the students continued
to center on a replica of the Statue of Liberty, called the
``Goddess of Democracy,'' unveiled on Tiananmen Square on Tuesday.
The statue faces the portrait of communist Chinese founder Mao
Tse-tung.
   The Beijing Daily, a conservative party paper, was filled with
articles and letters incensed about the 33-foot statue.
   ``We believe our sincere patriotic enthusiasm has been greatly
mocked, and our good image tarnished,'' said a letter from five
unidentified Beijing University students.
   State Radio Beijing gave prominent play to divisions in the
student movement in an interview with Li Lu, a Beijing student
leader who accused non-Beijing students of ``power grabbing.''

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the First Amendment's
protection of free speech for U.S. citizens extends to
international libel cases, a ruling that could have broad
implications for American speakers and authors.
   Ruling in a $100 million lawsuit brought by former Indian Prime
Minister Morarji Desai, U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle said
Tuesday that it must be proven that journalist and author Seymour
Hersh intentionally distributed a libelous book in India.
   Desai's lawsuit contends the former prime minister was defamed
in Hersh's book, ``The Price of Power; Kissinger in the Nixon White
House,'' which said Desai sold state secrets to the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   Attorneys for 94-year-old Desai sought to recover damages based
on the lesser standard of negligence, rather than the ``actual
malice'' standard required under U.S. law in libel cases that
involve public figures.
   But Norgle said U.S. legal standards will be applied to the case
since Desai has acknowledged being a ``public figure.'' The judge
added in a written opinion that to apply ``Indian defamation law or
any other foreign defamation law at odds with the First Amendment
could have a tremendous chilling effect.''
   Legal experts say Norgle's ruling is the first of its kind and
signals protections for U.S. authors, speechmakers and publishers
whose domestically produced works are later published or
distributed abroad.
   Trial is set for Sept. 13. The 6-year-old lawsuit was filed in
Chicago under the principle of filing defamation actions in the
hometown of the defendant. Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist, was born in Chicago.

   Riot police swinging truncheons today
arrested hundreds of students who tried to march to Seoul's
Catholic cathedral in support of anti-government hunger strikers.
   About 5,000 riot troopers in helmets and combat fatigues stopped
about 1,000 students a few blocks from Myongdong Cathedral in the
city center. Police charged into the students several times and
dragged away struggling protesters in a confrontation that lasted
about four hours.
   Some students tried to ram through police lines to reach the
cathedral, but most demonstrated peacefully.
   Police said at least 500 students were arrested. Riot troopers
kicked and beat some protesters who were hauled away and police
said there were injuries among both troopers and students, but said
they had no figures.
   The students marched to the cathedral after 4,000 others took
part earlier in rallies at 13 Seoul colleges. They called for the
resignation of President Roh Tae-woo and protested the death of
dissident student Lee Chol-kyu, whom they claim was killed and
tortured by police.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Bring back Lee Chol-kyu!''
students shouted.
   The campus protests were peaceful except at Sogang University,
where about 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks.
At least six people were hurt, police said.
   Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in
the southern city of Kwangju. Lee's body was found in a reservoir
near that city May 10.
   A government report concluded Lee slipped and fell into the
reservoir after fleeing a police roadblock. The report said there
was no evidence Lee was tortured or that police were involved in
his death.
   Student leaders said hundreds of students today joined the
hunger protest at the cathedral demanding the government admit
police killed Lee. About 300 students began the hunger strike last
Thursday, but their number dwindled to 60 by Tuesday. Student
leaders said about 500 students were now taking part in the hunger
strike, but there was no way to confirm the figure.
   Doctors aiding the students said eight hunger strikers were
hospitalized after collapsing and that scores gave up fasting
because of weakness.
   Riot police blocked the hunger strikers and about 300 protesters
when they tried to march from the cathedral in a candlelight
parade. Lines of police stopped the march, but there was no
violence.
   Some radical student groups have called for peaceful protests
after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus
demonstration. The deaths outraged public opinion in South Korea.
The South Korean radicals lack broad public support because of
their violent tactics and extreme views.
   Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics
as those used by pro-democracy Chinese students in Beijing.
   In a related development, news reports today said South Korea
will import spray guns that shoot tear gas mixed with water to
replace controversial rifles that shoot tear gas canisters. About
230 guns will be imported from Israel to combat the violent
protests, according to the daily Chosun Ilbo.
   Police will also import water cannons from Austria, the
newspaper said. Police refused comment on the reports.
   There has been public outcry against police for using the rifles
and armored vans carrying multiple tear gas launchers. The straight
tear gas has caused injuries and some deaths.

   About 250 protesters rallied in this
Rhine river city today to demonstrate against U.S. President George
Bush's visit, and at least one person was arrested.
   The demonstrators' main objection was to U.S. policy in Central
America.
   Protesters rallied about four blocks away from the
Rheingoldhalle, where Bush delivered a speech summing up a two-day
NATO meeting and calling for an end to the political division of
Europe.
   Protesters carried banners reading: ``Bush Go Home,'' ``Bush Is
Not Welcome Here,'' and ``Bush: Hands Off Nicaragua.''
   Police sealed off traffic across the city's main bridge spanning
the Rhine, and helicopters circled over the hall where the
president was speaking. The helicopters drowned out protesters'
shouts of ``Police bulls!'' and ``German police state!''
   At one point, about 200 demonstrators broke away from the rally
and tried to march toward the Rheingoldhalle. A scuffle broke out
as police moved to block protesters, and at least one man was
handcuffed and led away by helmeted officers.
   The demonstration ended after about an hour.

   A U.S. citizen working for the magazine
Soldier of Fortune died today of gunshot and shrapnel wounds after
he was caught in fighting on Burma's border with Thailand, police
sources said.
   Lance Eugene Motley, 32, was brought to Mae Sot hospital Tuesday
night and died this morning, medical staff at the hospital said.
His hometown was not known immediately.
   Police said Motley apparently crossed into Burma three days ago
with Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo Ra, which has
been besieged by Burmese troops since May 18.
   Fighting has been raging in jungle areas of this border region
since Burmese troops launched an intensive offensive last October
against rebels fighting for autonomy from the central government.
   Free-lance journalist Alan Dawson, who is based in Bangkok, said
he met Motley after the American arrived in Thailand three weeks
ago. He said Motley told him he was a correspondent for Soldier of
Fortune and had worked in the past in Central America.
   Dawson said Motley planned to base himself in Bangkok to cover
Southeast Asia for the monthly magazine, which is based in Colorado
and specializes in combat and weaponry.
   ``He had never been out of the American hemisphere and was very
eager to see what was happening in this part of the world,'' Dawson
said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Neil Klopfenstein said only that an
American citizen died this morning ``after an incident on the
Thai-Burma border.'' He refused to release details.
   The medical sources, who asked not to be named, said Motley was
brought to the hospital with gunshot and shrapnel wounds to the
face and body.

   Rep. Robert Davis says his hiring of his
girlfriend for a $28,000 a year job on the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries Committee is ethically sound.
   Davis, 56, R-Mich., acknowledged Tuesday he has been living with
the 28-year-old staffer, Brook Ball, since earlier this year. Miss
Ball was hired Jan. 1 on Davis' recommendation and he moved into
her Virginia apartment in late January or early February, shortly
after separating from his wife, Marty Davis.
   ``We checked with the ethics committee before we hired her to
make sure there was nothing wrong with doing it,'' Davis said.
``The answer was very clearly there is nothing wrong with it.''
   Disclosure of the relationship between Davis and Miss Ball
prompted a flurry of accusations between the congressman and his
wife of 12 years. The congressman has filed for divorce, and he and
Mrs. Davis have been sparring in court over how much support he
should be required to pay.
   Davis accused his estranged wife of leaking the information to
reporters in an effort to get more alimony in the divorce
proceedings.
   ``She has threatened me on numerous occasions, ... saying, `if I
don't get what I want in the way of alimony, I'm going to go public
with it.'''
   Mrs. Davis, however, denied she was the source of the
information and said she had never threatened the congressman or
his staff.
   ``All I did was just warn them to try to keep him in check
because he's going to hurt himself,'' she said. ``I asked what can
be done to stop this.''
   Davis presented the affair against the backdrop of a stormy
marriage, with both parties dating while separated.
   Mrs. Davis, however, said word of the affair caught her by
surprise.
   ``I had no idea,'' she said. ``He traveled so much, I didn't
know what he was doing.''
   ``Last spring I got calls from mutual friends asking me if I was
OK,'' Mrs. Davis said. ``I couldn't figure out why I was getting
these phone calls.''
   Miss Ball and the congressman first dated in 1987 and had
continued their relationship off and on until he began living in
her apartment, Davis said. Miss Ball would not talk to reporters.
   Davis made the information public after learning a newspaper
planned a story on the affair, aides said.
   ``Brook has been up to my district, been with me down here. It
is no secret,'' Davis said. ``I have not tried to make it a
secret.''
   Davis said he escorted Miss Ball to an inaugural ball in January.
   Miss Ball, who works for the committee's oversight and
investigations subcommittee, reviews testimony and prepares
questions and statements for Davis, said George Pence, the
committee's Republican staff director. He said she has done
excellent work.
   Mrs. Davis, in the divorce proceedings, told a judge she needed
$4,000 a month in support payments for herself and the couple's
5-year-old daughter. Davis has he can't afford to pay that much
until $112,000 in joint debt has been paid.

   An estimated 1 million people linked hands
in the rain today to support the student-led democracy movement in
China, organizers said.
   They said the human chain, from Keelung in the north to
Kaohsiung in the south, stretched about 240 miles over highways and
city streets and was broken only at intersections to allow traffic
to pass.
   Participants, most of them students on their lunch break, sang
patriotic songs. In some cities they heard speeches during the
30-minute demonstration.
   ``Students on mainland China are facing a turning point in
history, but they are not alone in shouldering their duties because
we are firmly behind them,'' Ko Chien-wei, a student leader at
National Chengchi University, told a rally at Taipei's Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Park.
   Chiang, who died in 1975, was the Nationalist president who led
the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949 after they were defeated in a
civil war on the mainland by communist troops.
   About 3,000 officials and students attended the rally in Taipei.
   Before today's demonstration, only several small rallies had
been held in Taiwan to support the Chinese democracy movement. The
lukewarm public response embarrassed the Taiwanese government,
which continues to claim it is the legitimate ruler of all China.

   Michigan's Supreme Court today refused a
speeded-up ruling on the constitutionality of a voter-approved ban
on state-funded abortions for the poor.
   The high court declined to bypass the Michigan Court of Appeals
and take up the issue first, saying it was unconvinced the question
needed to be handled so quickly.
   The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had
appealed directly to the Supreme Court a decision by Wayne County
Circuit Judge John H. Hausner upholding the ban, which was approved
by the voters in November.
   The ACLU acted on behalf of a 15-year-old girl from Detroit who
became pregnant as a result of a gang rape. The girl's family had
challenged the cutoff of about $6 million a year for some 18,000
Medicaid abortions.
   The girl obtained an abortion privately after Hausner upheld the
ban on use of state money.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the May 26
   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on high school dropouts:
   West Virginia, not generally considered to be a state at the
forefront of bold, educational experiments, has worked a minor
miracle: It's come up with a way to cut its high school dropout
rate by almost a third.
   The state has cut its annual dropout figure from 5,000 to 3,400
by threatening dropouts with loss of the most valuable commodity in
their young lives: their driver's license.
   Under a law enacted last year, a student who drops out at 16
loses his license and doesn't become eligible to get it again until
18. Students with special situations have the right to appeal the
decision, but the state has not granted many exemptions. ...
   Of course, its approach to cutting the dropout rate would not
work in every community or with every student. Many low-income and
urban students don't drive, so threatening them with loss of their
license wouldn't mean much. ...
   But for many teen-agers, the thought of losing their driver's
license just might be enough to convince them to hang in there
another year or two and finish high school. With an estimated one
out of four students failing to graduate in the United States,
here's a new idea with a real impact.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on overweight Americans:
   Americans are changing the way they manage their own bodies, but
they are still getting fatter every year.
   At a time when the public has more information than ever before
about health and fitness, about what foods are healthful ..., the
increase in the percentage of overweight Americans is alarming and
disappointing.
   Polster Louis Harris pointed out that two-thirds of Americans
weigh more than their height and body type justify. And two-thirds
... said they don't exercise strenuously.
   Junk food continues its popularity; and exercise, while gaining
in visibility, has not worked its way into the daily routines of
enough Americans.
   It's time for a federal initiative, similar to President
Kennedy's President's Council on Physical Fitness, something to
inspire all of us to keep fit and stay healthy.

   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on the safety of older
planes:
   Three cheers for the Federal Aviation Administration, which has
taken an important step toward making flying safer.
   Until now, FAA policy has been to regularly inspect airliners,
looking for signs of cracks, corrosion or metal fatigue. When
problems were found, parts were ordered replaced.
   Last year's Aloha Airlines accident tragically illustrated the
inadequacy of that policy. The aircraft involved, an older Boeing
737, passed its inspection. But later, in flight over the Pacific,
the top third of the aircraft peeled away. A flight attendant died
when she was sucked out of the plane and 61 of the 94 other people
on board were injured before the pilots safely landed the aircraft
on the island of Maui.
   Since the Aloha incident, the FAA has re-examined its safety
policies for older aircraft and it's now decided to order many
parts replaced at a certain age, regardless of their condition. ...
   The FAA says the new policy will cost the airlines more than
$140 million over the next few years. But that will be a cheap
price to pay if it makes the skylanes safer.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Rep. Newt Gingrich:
   If you wondered what happened to Evel Knievel, he's alive and

Gingrich.
   Knievel, of course, was the accident-prone daredevil who thought
he could defy gravity over the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle.
   Rep. Gingrich, fast-talking, impulsive Republican from Georgia,
has the equally madcap idea he can fly over the congressional
ethics carnage without a scratch.
   I'd say odds are 2 to 1 Gingrich winds up in the political
version of an emergency ward.
   Gingrich's crash landing would be applauded by at least 200
House Democrats. Expect no get-well cards. ...
   Democrats can't forget that Gingrich relentlessly pursued (House
Speaker Jim) Wright, kicking him for a ``Mussolini-like ego'' while
Wright was down. So, they're combing Gingrich's past, photostating
copies of a 1984 Mother Jones magazine piece on his messy divorce.
   And the nastiness won't stop with Neutron Newt.
   These guys make the Hatfields and McCoys look like a class act.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on James Baker's Middle East
speech:
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III ... had a remarkably
no-nonsense warning (for Israel): Give up the dream of annexing the
occupied West Bank and Gaza strip, and ``reach out to Palestinians
as neighbors who deserve political rights.''
   For Palestinians and the Arab world, Baker had a plea to let
Israel live in peace and security, and to respond constructively to
Israeli proposals for elections in the occupied territories.
   To some friends of Israel, this good-neighbor policy sounds
naive and dangerous.
   Yet Israel cannot afford a conflict with Palestinians in the
occupied territories that lasts forever. ...
   The struggle is dividing Israel, diverting resource from other
problems, and souring world opinion.
   Criticism of Israel, and the kind of balance Baker showed in his
speech, do not mean any lessening of America's commitment to Israel.
   What it does mean is a change from the style of the Reagan
years, when a speech as bluntly critical as Baker's would have been
out of the question.

   The Fresno (Calif.) Bee on Rep. Tony Coelho's surprise
resignation:
   Once the shock wore off, the decision of Rep. Tony Coelho
(D-Calif.), to resign from Congress six months into his sixth term
made sense.
   There are still unanswered questions as to timing and motives,
but we have his statement that he would not put his party, his
colleagues and his family through a continuing barrage of questions
about his ethics. ...
   As the third-ranking Democrat in the House, he was certain to be
Republican target No. 1 after the expected resignation of Speaker
Jim Wright.
   But what Coelho called the predictable ``turmoil'' was only part
of it. For all of his fierce attachment to the political life, he
is not a time server.
   He is both ambitious and fatalistic; when he saw a lid possibly
coming down on his chances to move up in the House hierarchy _ and
even a prospect that he might have to fight for his present
position as Democratic ``whip'' _ he had no yen to hang on. ...
   We do not share Coelho's apparent conviction that he's being
besieged simply because of an overheated climate of ethical
scrutiny. His problem with an investment in high-yield, high-risk
bonds, in which he received financial help from a savings and loan
executive, can't just be ascribed to a ``mistake'' or a simple
failure to accurately report details of the transaction.
   A reporting glitch aside, the deal itself was unsettling. ...
   Putting aside the circumstances of his leave-taking, his
effectiveness as a representative is beyond challenge.

   The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, on House Speaker Jim Wright:
   With his power as speaker of the House of Representatives fast
eroding, Jim Wright is sensibly weighing resignation from his
leadership role. ...
   Although the House Ethics Committee has not yet rendered a
verdict on the 69 allegations of ethical misconduct against Wright,
the speaker belatedly has recognized his futile position.
   Holding any of the top offices within the hierarchy of Congress
requires not just electoral longevity (awarded by the voters back
home) but institutional fealty (awarded by the membership on
Capitol Hill).
   Now that Wright's years-long pattern of shady scheming has been
revealed, the reputation of the entire House has been sullied by
implication. Wright has sacrificed the political prerequisite of
leadership in Congress: its majority's allegiance. ...
   Painful as it has been, the Wright episode will have served a
useful purpose if it prompts Congress _ out of fear if not out of
self-discipline _ to uphold higher standards of conduct.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on health care for the aging:
   A new report from the U.S. House Committee on Aging offers a
sobering view of the nation's already embattled health-care system.
   According to the report, two trends are currently at work in
America today that will collide early in the 21st century: The
population is aging, and the percentage of care-givers is dropping.
   If doesn't take a demographer to realize that if these trends
continue unabated, there simply will not be enough nurses and home
health care workers. One piece of the equation is unchangeable _
the elderly will make up a larger and larger share of the
population.
   Thanks, in large part, to the demographic glitch caused by the
baby-boom generation, the number of senior citizens will swell from
the current 29.1 million (11.8 percent of the population) to 54.5
million (17.7 percent of the population) by 2020.
   And the elderly typically suffer from more chronic illness, need
more at-home care and spend more days in the hospital than the
overall population.
   Meanwhile, nursing shortages in hospitals nationwide have more
than doubled in the last five years. More than half of all home
health-care agencies report difficulties in finding and recruiting
health-care professionals. And the shortfall is predicted to
continue.
   The statistics warn of a health-care crisis. Fortunately,
though, it can be averted _ through proper planning.

   The message hasn't yet been understood by the politicians and
the bureaucrats who have been charged with protecting the
environment. Public support for cleanups has been greatly

   The survey, undertaken by Media General and The Associated

happening and not unconcerned. ...
   It is no suprise that the people polled were aware of what's

   Temporarily, at least, the air has gone out of the balloons in
Beijing and Moscow. China's leaders outwaited student demonstrators
and Soviet conservatives outvoted reformers.
   Disappointment runs deep in both capitals, but last week the
world got a glimpse of the future and it looked encouraging.
   Young Chinese, well-educated and more worldly wise than their
parents, are demanding that their lives have meaning. In a nation
which has place almost no value on the individual, this is radical
behavior. ...
   It appears that the entrenched party members in both China and
the Soviet Union are safe for now. Still, the power of 1 million
demonstrators in Beijing and the outspoken opposition in Moscow to
the status quo had its effect.
   Fear remains, but now it is mostly in high places.

   Someone needs to take Energy Secretary James Watkins aside and
explain the problems that arise when the fox guards the hen house.
   Billed by a DOE spokesman as a move to improve ``line management
efficiency,'' Watkins has ordered that the same assistant who is
responsible for nuclear weapons production should now assume
responsibility for safety at the nation's 16 weapons plants.
   He has also eliminated any safety oversight and monitoring at
the plants by another office within his department.
   Production schedules and proper safety procedures are both
important components in the weapons production program, but the two
functions are diametrically opposed, and each should be overseen by
someone without a built-in conflict of interest.

   The Atlanta Journal on air pollution:
   During the past two decades of environmental cleanup, industry
has been viewed as part of the problem rather than part of the
cure. Legislation proposed by the Bush administration would change
that, offering the business sector reason to become an ally instead
of an adversary.
   The Bush plan focuses on setting sulfur emissions limits and
then allowing polluters to choose the most cost-effective way to
comply.
   The strategy offers welcome innovation to resolving an enduring
problem whose most accessible solutions have been undertaken
already.
   The nation has made remarkable progress in reducing air
pollution using regulation as a stick to coerce compliance, but
we've gone about as far as we can go by traditional methods. Now,
it's time to offer a carrot to stimulate efforts toward going the
rest of the distance.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on gas guzzling cars:
   Sometime within the past decade, America's idea of auto fuel
conservation took a wide detour.
   Automobile dealerships in the late 1970s and early 1980s pushed
small, economy-sized vehicles that offered high gasoline mileage.
As gas prices decreased, however, Americans traded their economy
cars for new models that offered greater comfort and increased
performance, yet demanded more fuel.
   Already, there's pressure aplenty to increase auto fuel
efficiency. ...
   These suggestions play into concerns of U.S. foreign
policymakers who fear the growing U.S. dependence on cheap foreign
oil leaves Americans vulnerable to another energy crisis. ...
   If the United States is to take a leadership role in efforts to
slow the greenhouse effect, strengthening U.S. auto efficiency
standards would demonstrate that commitment.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on ending unfair trade:
   No one who understands the benefits of an open world trading
system can be pleased by President Bush's designation last week of
Japan, India and Brazil as unfair trading nations, but he had no
good alternative to that risky action.
   Bush acted under a stiff provision of the 1988 trade law, which
requires him to name nations that maintain barriers to U.S.
exports. If negotiations do not remove the barriers, the president
is authorized to retaliate.
   If Bush had not moved against Japan, which richly deserves to be
called an unfair trader, Congress would have exploded with fury and
might well have passed protectionist legislation that would have
done even more harm.
   Japan, which ran a $55 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year, was the main target. But Bush did not want to
cite it alone, fearing an irrational reaction by Tokyo, so Brazil
and India, less flagrant offenders, were added as cover.
   Japan has to change. It cannot expect to sell cars and consumer
electronics to Americans and refuse to buy what they make best.
   One hopes Americans will have the patience and Japanese will
develop the maturity to prevent a tit-for-tat trade war that will
harm everybody.

   In his persistent threat to veto a higher increase in the

   Such a pitched battle may have enhanced his public image when he

minimum wage that has not risen beyond $3.35 an hour since 1981.

   The Indianapolis News on incentives to get the Super Bowl:
   The Super Bowl isn't coming to Indianapolis in 1992. It will go
instead to Minneapolis. Maybe that's a shame, but all the same it's
hard not to breathe a sigh of relief.
   Indianapolis, after all, had offered to fork over about $3.5
million worth of incentives to the NFL. More than $1 million of
that would have come directly from the pockets of taxpayers.
   Yes, the Super Bowl is a prestigious event, and yes, bringing it
to Indianapolis would probably have enhanced the reputation of the
city.
   But you've got to wonder where they come up with these
``economic impact'' statements. Word from city officials was that
the Super Bowl would have an ``economic impact'' of $100 million on
whatever city was chosen.
   What does that mean? Where do such figures come from? ...
   Indianapolis would do well in the future to avoid such giant
offers of tax money to lure events like the Super Bowl here.
   This proud city may be eager for the action that major sports
events bring, but it also has other, more important priorities for
the people's precious tax money.

<HEAD>Court Appointee Recommends Curbing Open Admissions in Louisiana</HEAD>

   An official appointed to draft an
integration plan for Louisiana's public colleges recommended
eliminating most open-admissions policies and putting all 17
schools under a single governing board.
   No universities would be closed or merged under the proposal
issued Tuesday by Paul Verkuil.
   Verkuil, appointed by a federal panel to come up with a
desegregation plan for the 145,000-student system, changed few
details from a preliminary proposal issued April 18, said John
Kennedy, legal aide to Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   The court will have the final say on the plan.
   The 17-member board would be appointed by the governor and
approved by the Senate and would govern all public higher education
in Louisiana, replacing four boards that run the 13 four-year
institutions and four two-year schools.
   Verkuil said the board would be responsible for ``insuring that
progress toward eliminating Louisiana's racially dual education
system is achieved.''
   Verkuil was appointed after the court ruled last year that a
1981 desegregation agreement between the state and the U.S. Justice
Department had failed. The plan had called for spending millions of
dollars to improve predominantly black Southern and Grambling State
universities.
   The dispute began 15 years ago when the Justice Department
accused the state of running a dual system of higher education for
blacks and whites.
   Under the plan recommended by Verkuil, president of William and
Mary College in Virginia, Louisiana State University would become
the state's flagship institution with the toughest admission
standards.
   A second and third tier of four-year schools with less stringent
standards would be set up, while two-year community colleges would
continue to offer open admissions and would be responsible for most
remedial courses.
   The more stringent admissions policies are part of the plan's
larger goal of improving the quality of higher education in
Louisiana.
   Currently, all Louisiana colleges admit all graduates of
Louisiana high schools. Fifty-four percent of entering freshmen
must take remedial courses.
   Kennedy said he did not know if the judges would hear further
comment from the parties in the case _ including Southern
University, the U.S. Justice Department and the Grmbling alumni _
before deciding whether to approve the plan.
   Kennedy said Roemer, who had pushed for a single board, was
pleased by Verkuil's recommendation. ``The single board is the
linchpin of this whole thing,'' he said.
   State Sen. William Jefferson, an attorney for Southern, said he
had not seen the recommendation and declined to comment.
   Other parties were not available for immediate comment. Black
leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to the needs
of Southern University and Grambling.
   Some proposals for eliminating racial disparities in the state
system included closing some predominantly black institutions.

   Journalists marched in protest in four cities
and opposition parties demanded a new investigation on the fifth
anniversary of the assassination of a nationally acclaimed
reporter, Manuel Buendia.
   The anniversary Tuesday also marked the end of the statute of
limitations in the case, meaning his killers probably never will be
prosecuted.
   As the anniversary neared, there was pressure to find and judge
those who killed the tough investigative reporter. But it passed
without arrests.
   Buendia, who wrote a column called ``Private Network'' for the
Mexico City daily Excelsior, was gunned down on a street in the
capital's Zona Rosa section on May 30, 1984.
   Buendia's subjects ranged from senior politicians and corrupt
cops and union bosses to the CIA.
   The government news agency Notimex on Tuesday reported
journalists in the central city of Tepic, Nayarit and the southern
port city of Veracruz, marched to demand justice for their slain
colleague.
   In Mexico City, the Democratic Journalists' Union held a similar
demonstration, the agency reported.
   It quoted members of the Mexico City group as saying some 30
Mexican journalists have been killed in the five years since
Buendia's death.
   Special Prosecutor Miguel Angel Garcia Dominguez last week was
quoting as saying investigators have narrowed down their list of
suspects in Buendia's killing to 31 after taking statements from
more than 250 people.

   The father of a 17-year-old school
dropout whose driver's license was revoked under a new law aimed at
curbing dropouts and truancy says he plans to give the law its
first court test.
   The 1988 law, the only such statute in the nation, has drawn
both criticism and praise from educators, parents and politicians.
   Michael Means, of Charleston, lost his license Tuesday under the
law that requires school-age young people who want to drive to stay
in school.
   Means, who dropped out of Roosevelt Junior High School a year
ago when he was in ninth grade, is married. He was an attendant at
a gas station but had to quit when he lost his driver's license.
   ``There were supposed to be exceptions to this law,'' Means'
father, William, said today. ``My son is married, he's an expectant
father with the baby due in September. They have a house ...,
trying to make it on their own.
   ``With the decision, I see no way for him to gain employment and
support his family. If this isn't an exception, I don't know what
is.''
   Under the law passed in the summer of 1988, students under age
18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days or have 15 unexcused
absences must give up their driving privileges. County school
systems notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of students who
have dropped out.
   A school superintendent can waive the law if a student's
withdrawal from school is beyond the student's control.
   DMV lawyer Tom Madden said if Means follows through with the
suit, it will be the law's first court test.
   Means misplaced his license and requested a new one. But the DMV
refused to issue a new license without the consent of the Kanawha
County Board of Education, which refused his request.
   Michael Means could not be reached for comment; his father said
he has no telephone.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from Boris N. Yeltsin's speech
Wednesday to the Congress of People's Deputies, as translated by
The Associated Press:
   On devolution of power:
   At the Congress, the most important question is being decided on
which the future of our society depends: the question of power,
which by rights must belong to the people in the form of the organ
it elects _ that is, the Congress of People's Deputies. The Central
Committee plenum just before the Congress opened did not support my
suggestion to transfer power somehow at this very first Congress
from the party to the Soviets (local parliaments). The plenum
decided to recommend for leading posts the same people who have not
managed to get the society out of crises in politics, the economy,
finances, the standard of living.
   On limited powers of the Congress:
   The Congress, which had to take into its hands the power for
perestroika and the transformation of society, has ended up as
hostage to laws and decisions taken by the previous Supreme Soviet,
formed back in the times of stagnation.
   Important questions of state power and administration, which
logically ... should have been reviewed by the Congress were
decided in advance, and it is proposed that we vote in favor of
these laws.
   In these conditions, there is a danger of the Supreme Soviet and
its presidium turning into an apparatus, or, let's say, half an
apparatus, under the president.
   The state of the nation:
   The situation in the country is extremely alarming.
Anti-perestroika forces have become active and are consolidating,
the shadow economy is growing, corruption and crime are on the
rise, the moral standards of society are becoming diluted, the
problems of youth are getting sharper ... the principles of social
justice and social equality are not being realized, the number of
poor people is growing, the Soviet people's belief in the real
results of perestroika is falling, the contradictions in ethnic
problems are getting sharper ... the decisions on the food problem
are being delayed.
   The disorganization of the internal market, inflation, queues,
ration coupons, the threat of a financial collapse has become real.
The command-administrative system has not been broken. Power still
belongs to the party apparatus and the bureaucracy.
   The vast system of power is profitable only for this apparatus.
   The promised program and the promises of the last four years
have not been fulfilled. People live worse. Such political
evaluations of the current moment and some of the self-criticism in
the speech of Comrade Gorbachev do not remove him, in my opinion,
from responsibility for all of that.
   On troops attacking protesters in Tbilisi:
   A year after the party conference supporting the course for
democratization, we have hit out at meetings and demonstrations
with one decree, at glasnost with a second. With a third we
approved the use of special forces against our own people.
   Exactly in this atmosphere of creating extraordinary bans by
law, and especially recently, such crimes as in Tbilisi became
possible. I was there and I am convinced that it was a crime, a
crime against our own people.
   In order to calm people down a bit, it is necessary to say at
the Congress who in the center took the decision, since the
leadership knows this.
   On glasnost:
   To guarantee broader democratization and glasnost, let's not
hamper their development, as is already happening. In fact, a law
on the press should be adopted, and the mass media should not ...
be organs of the party. They should become more and more
independent.
   On priorities:
   First of all, it is necessary to consider at the Congress of
People's Deputies the tasks and goals of the society, and taking
them into account to form a commission to work on a draft of a new
constitution. I consider it one of the tasks to decisively
decentralize power and economy, to dismantle the
command-administrative system, which is the source of the menace
that we would return to the past.
   On social justice and the privileged ``nomenklatura:''
   Without delay, laws on pensions, on poverty, on ecology and on
forms of property should be adopted. In the existing circumstances,
the Congress should first of all adopt state programs on how to
take the country out of crisis. The program should be a program of
urgent measures. For more than 70 years we have not managed to
solve the question of social justice. There's every reason to speak
of an elite existing in our society, which is building socialism.
Why are there tens of millions of people in this country who live
below all possible levels of poverty while others bask in luxury?
The defense of the less well-to-do and the defenseless layers of
society should be made a principle of socialist justice.
   To begin with, taking into account the deficit, maybe we should
cancel all unlawful principles for the ``nomenklatura'' and in
general remove from our lexicon this word, ``nomenklatura.'' This
would raise the moral level of our society. It is necessary to fix
a minimum standard of living, and already at this Congress we
should decide at least one concrete social issue, otherwise people
won't understand us. For example, we should create a free supply of
medicines, free public transport for the disabled and those below
the poverty line, to solve the pension question, at least in part.
I hand over to the presidium (of the Congress) a legislative
initiative drafted and signed by a large group of deputies.
   Before we solve all issues of medical care, it is necessary to
transform the Fourth Medical Department (the special department
that provides medical care for the elite) into a department caring
for mothers and their children. This should be done for the sake of
our future, in order not to have a situation where infant mortality
is twice that of any civilized country.
   About President Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   I cannot help voicing here one of my concerns. The Congress,
constitution and the party entrusted the head of state with
extremely broad authority. Here we can perceive a troubling
tendency. Against the background of a deteriorating economy and the
sharpening of social issues, we see an increase of personal
influence and personal power in the hands of the head of state.
This can lead to the temptation to solve our complex problems with
force, and we can again find ourselves in the sway of a new
authoritarian regime, a new dictatorship, without noticing it.
   Moreover, for 70 years, we have not accumulated experience,
either through the party, parliament, or people, of controlling the
activity of the head of state. I think within the limits of
building a state based on law, the present Congress should create
certain collective mechanisms. As one of the elements of such a
mechanism, I suggest adopting a law on an annual referendum on
people's confidence in the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the
USSR (the president).

   A former federal judge, a former Wall Street
prosecutor and a labor lawyer were appointed today to oversee
operations of the Teamsters union as part of the settlement of
civil racketeering charges against the 1.6 million-member union.
   The three are: Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge and
U.S. attorney in New Jersey; Charles M. Carberry, former head of
the commodities and securities fraud unit of the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan; and Michael H. Holland, a Chicago lawyer and
former general counsel to the United Mine Workers of America.
   Lacey, the administrative officer, and Holland, who will oversee
union elections, were sworn in today by U.S. District Judge David
N. Edelstein, who approved the out-of-court settlement in March.
   Carberry, who will investigate alleged corruption, will be sworn
in later, said the judge.
   The three will have the authority to investigate and arbitrate
alleged corruption and oversee elections until late 1992.
   Describing the three watchdogs, Edelstein said: ``Their ability,
dedication and integrity cannot be questioned.''
   The three posts were created as part of a settlement of the
government's civil lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen, the nation's largest trade
union.
   The law suit, filed under the civil aspects of the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act, charged that the top
leadership of the union was dominated by organized crime.
   The agreement, reached just hours before the case was to go to
trial, also called for the direct election of international
officers by the rank and file.
   In exchange, Teamsters leaders, whom the government sought to
oust, were allowed to remain in office.

<TEXT>
   Congress today increased benefits
for workers and retirees and allotted money for a food distribution
plan in an effort to end looting and riots that have killed 11
people.
   The Senate and House of Deputies, in an all-night session, also
ratified a 30-day state of siege declared Monday by President Raul
Alfonsin.
   President-elect Carlos Menem flew to Buenos Aires from his home
in the western provincial capital of La Rioja and met with Alfonsin
to discuss the crisis and the possibility of an early transfer of
power.
   Officials described major cities as mostly calm this morning
following rioting and sacking of stores Tuesday in several Buenos
Aires suburbs and the city of Rosario, the nation's third-largest.
Rioting also occurred in the cities of Mendoza, La Plata and
Tucuman.
   Shops and offices opened today in Buenos Aires.
   The food riots have increased pressure on Alfonsin to step down
before his six-year term ends Dec. 10, and the country's largest
labor coalition and most influential business group on Tuesday
asked Menem to take office early.
   The economic crisis has been caused by Argentina's $59 billion
foreign debt, a national budget deficit worsened by inefficient
state companies and months of inflation that could top 70 percent
for May.
   The inflation has led to layoffs, food and supply shortages and
declining real wages that have left retirees living on the
equivalent of $25 a month.
   ``The country is dying of hunger. Factories are closing. People
are unemployed,'' Adolfo Perez Esquivel, head of the human rights
group Peace and Justice Service and the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, said in an interview.
   Under Congress' action today, the minimum pension for retirees
will rise to about $36 and the minimum for widows to about $33. The
lawmakers raised the benefits at the insistence of Menem's
labor-based Peronist Party.
   They also allotted an unspecified amout of money to pay for
distribution of food and medicine.
   Civil liberties were suspended under the state of siege declared
Monday, but looting of groceries continued.
   ``Unfortunately, this government has lost its credibility,''
Saul Ubaldini, head of the 4 million-member General Labor
Confederation, said Tuesday.
   Confederation officials said an early transition is ``the only
possible solution.'' Gilberto Montagna, president of the Argentine
Industrial Union business group, also called on Alfonsin to step
down early.
   After the governing Radical Civic Union was defeated in national
elections on May 14, Alfonsin offered to resign but could not agree
with Menem on terms of the transition.
   Asked Tuesday whether he favored an early transition, Menem
said: ``That would not be opportune in these grave moments the
country is going through.''
   Alfonsin's election in 1983 ended nearly eight years of military
dictatorship.
   The government has blamed ultra-leftist groups for the riots,
but has offered little proof. Vice President Victor Martinez blamed
``groups that do not want to see the current government end its
term and another constitutional government begin.''
   The latest deaths occurred Tuesday in the Buenos Aires suburbs
of San Miguel and Quilmes during a riot in which looters broke
windows and emptied shelves in furniture stores, bars, sports and
shoe stores.
   Looters loading food onto trucks threw stones at police, who
retaliated by firing rubber bullets, killing four, local news
agencies said. A bus driver who tried to prevent the theft of his
bus was shot and killed.
   A sixth person was killed in suburban Moreno but the
circumstances were not clear, the independent news agency Diarios y
Noticias reported.
   Rosario, a meat-packing city of 1 million, has been worst hit by
the unrest.
   On Tuesday, armed bands reportedly drove through its deserted
streets after dark, shot at police stations and looted homes and
stores.
   ``They left practically nothing standing,'' Mayor Santos Mauro
of the suburban town of Villa Gobernador Galvez said. ``They
overwhelmed everything _ supermarkets, shops, shoe stores.''
   In Rosario, 186 miles north of the capital, four people were
shot and killed on Monday and an elderly women died of a heart
attack during looting. Schools remained closed Tuesday and most
businesses did not open.
   In all, several hundred stores and shops in more than a dozen
cities have been sacked the past week. More than 1,500 people have
been arrested, two-thirds of them in Rosario.
   On Tuesday, officials in the provinces scrambled to set up free
food programs and the national minimum wage was more than doubled
to the equivalent of about $57 a month.
   In Santa Fe, the province that includes Rosario, the legislature
unanimously approved a disaster law that allows private property
and merchandise to be confiscated so food and medicine can be given
to the needy.

   Jimmy Connors battled in the sun for almost 4{
hours but ran out of stamina and was beaten 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 by
fellow American Jay Berger in the second round of the men's singles
at the French Open today.
   The tenacious Connors, the No.9 seed and possibly making his
last appearance at the French Open at age 36, was cheered on by a
packed, excited Center Court crowd. He tried everything he knew to
fight off Berger and stay in the one Grand Slam event he never has
won.
   But Berger, the world's 28th-ranked player enjoying a season
that has reaped victories over Boris Becker and Mats Wilander, used
his superior fitness to wear down the street-fighting Connors after
4 hours, 26 minutes of energy-sapping baseline tennis.
   ``I practiced with Jimmy and got to know him really well. I
respected him more than other player in the game,'' Berger said.
``This is just a great win for me after losing three times to him.
It was such a battle. I'm so drained right now I can barely talk.''
   Connors said he nothing to be ashamed of after putting on a
typically never-say-die performance.
   ``All I can do is go out and fight till death. It was not
exactly like a walk in the park. I could have played a fifth set.
My mouthpiece wasn't knocked out,'' he said.
   Connors began in typical fashion, rallying from a 4-1 deficit to
win five straight games and take the opening set.
   But once Berger had squared the match, the veteran Connors had a
fight on his hands against an opponent 14 years younger. Berger
broke him to take a 6-5 lead in the third set and Connors' task

<HEAD>Earl of Enniskillen Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sixth Earl of Enniskillen, a longtime resident
of Kenya and a former legislator there, has died in Scotland at the
age of 70.
   He died Tuesday after a short illness at a hospital in Perth,
near his home in Amulree, according to family friend, Hamish
Carlton.
   Born David Lowry Cole in Kenya and educated at Eton and at
Cambridge University, he earned a degree in agriculture and was a
farmer in Kenya and in Northern Ireland before retiring to Scotland.
   Cole was a captain in the Irish Guards during World War II, and
served in British colonial Kenya during the 1953-55 emergency
caused by an uprising of the Mau Mau, a Kikuyu tribal secret
society, against the government, European settlers and Kikuyu who
remained loyal to the administration.
   Cole owned a 100,000-acre ranch near Mount Kenya and was a
member of the Kenya National Farmers Union and vice chairman of the
Kenya Stockowners Council.
   He became provincial commandant of the Kenya Police Service and
was made a Member of the Order of British Empire by Queen Elizabeth
II in 1955.
   From 1961 to 1963, Cole was a member of the Kenya Legislative
Council, the legislature of the colony and protectorate of Kenya
before it achieved independence in December 1963.
   Lord Cole succeeded his uncle, the fifth earl, in 1963 and moved
to Northern Ireland, where the seat of the earldom is in
Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. There he was a captain in the Ulster
Defense Regiment, the British province's locally raised security
force.
   Survivors include his son and heir, Andrew, Viscount Cole, who
lives in Nairobi, and his daughter, Lady Linda Muir, who lives in
Scotland. They are the children of his first marriage, to the late
Sonia Syers. His second wife, American-born Nancy Henderson
MacLennan, also survives.

   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York
Post, was appointed today as the newspaper's new editor.
   Nachman succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved on Tuesday of
her duties as editor by the tabloid's owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow.
   Ms. Amsterdam, former editor of the magazine Manhattan, inc.,
was the paper's editor for 50 weeks.
   Before Nachman joined the Post, he had worked as general manager
for the NBC-owned television station in Washington and news
director at WNBC-TV in New York.
   His appointment was announced in the paper's newsroom.
   Kalikow's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said no specific
incident precipitated the change. ``It's been under consideration
for a while, and Kalikow felt he needed someone new to take the
Post to the next level,'' he said.
   It had been reported that there was friction between the editor
and publisher over a decision to cut back the size of the tabloid's
Sunday edition, which has lost millions since it was introduced in
March.
   In a statement issued by Rubenstein, Kalikow said he was pleased
with the progress the Post had made under Ms. Amsterdam. She ``has
worked hard and intelligently and she leaves the Post with many
achievements. She will always have my respect and high regard,'' he
said.
   In the same statement, Ms. Amsterdam was quoted as saying that
she departs ``with great sadness. The paper came a long way,
achieving new energy and respectability.''
   Rubenstein said Ms. Amsterdam had not decided what she would do
next.

   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, chosen Wednesday by
governing party leaders to be the next prime minister and lead the
government from unprecedented crisis, is seen as an experienced but
weak politician.
   Uno was the second choice of the Liberal Democratic Party to
succeed Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Party leaders tried to
persuade the party's Executive Council chairman, Masayoshi Ito, 75,
to take the job, but he refused, citing poor health and
dissatisfaction with the party's handling of reforms.
   Few leaders within the scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party
sang the praises of the 66-year-old Uno, and many put forward
last-minute alternatives to his nomination, such as collective
rather than individual leadership.
   Many fear he cannot win back public confidence in the
government, shaken by an influence-peddling scandal that forced
Takeshita to step down and led to charges against 17 politicians,
bureaucrats and businessmen.
   Analysts speculated that party bosses, who are too tainted by
the financial scandal to take the post now, settled on Uno as an
interim leader who will allow them to exert influence and not upset
their future aspirations.
   Even the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper, described Uno, who has been foreign minister since 1987,
as only ``a reasonable choice.''
   ``Some party leaders would have preferred that the successor to
Prime Minister Takeshita come from the junior ranks in order to
revitalize the party. But Uno was chosen to maintain party
harmony,'' Yomiuri said in an editorial.
   Former prime ministers Zenko Suzuki and Takeo Fukuda suggested a
group leadership and expressed fears Uno may be too weak to steer
the conservative party to victory in parliamentary elections this
summer.
   Support for the Liberal Democrats has fallen to the lowest
levels ever, largely because of the scandal in which the Recruit
Co., a publishing conglomerate, allegedly won government favors by
handing out millions of dollars in political donations and
underpriced stock.
   Though Uno is untainted by the scandal, he is closely allied
with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, under whose 1982-87
tenure the influence-peddling allegedly occurred.
   The proximity of the two has damaged Uno's reputation, and it
almost cost him the party nomination, analysts say. On Sunday,
Nakasone resigned from the party, partly to relieve pressure on Uno.
   But supporters say Uno's high-ranking Cabinet posts in a country
striving for a stronger international role have made him a familiar
figure to the Japanese public, and that in itself will bring votes
to the party.
   Uno has headed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
the Defense Agency and the Science and Technology Agency. He is a
10-term member of the lower house of Parliament from Shiga
prefecture in western Japan.
   Born Aug. 27, 1922, into a wealthy family in Shiga, Uno fought
in World War II and served on the Asian mainland before being taken
prisoner by Soviet troops in northern Korea. He and his wife,
Chiyo, have two children, a son and daughter.

   Our proposal has several key initiatives. I propose that we lock
the Eastern agreement to Western-proposed ceilings on tanks and
armored troop carriers. We should also seek an agreement on common
numerical ceilings for artillery, the range between NATO's and that
of the Warsaw Pact, provided these definitional problems can be
solved. And the weapons we remove must be destroyed.
   We should expand our current offer to include all land-based
combat aircraft and helicopters by proposing that both sides reduce
in these categories to a level 15 percent below the current NATO
totals.
   Given the Warsaw Pact's advantage in numbers, the pact would
have to make far deeper reductions than NATO to establish parity at
those lower levels. Again, the weapons we remove must be destroyed.
   I propose a 20-percent cut in combat manpower in U.S.-stationed
forces, and a resulting ceiling on U.S. and Soviet ground and air
forces stationed outside of national territory in the
Atlantic-to-the-Urals zone at approximately 275,000 each. This
reduction to parity, a fair and balanced level of strength, would
compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong Red Army in
Eastern Europe by 325,000. And these withdrawn forces must be
demobilized.
   Finally, I call on (Soviet) President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev to
accelerate the timetable for reaching these agreements. There is no
reason why the five-to six-year timetable, as suggested by Moscow,
is necessary.
   I propose a much more ambitious schedule. And we should aim to
reach an agreement within six months to a year and accomplish
reductions by 1992, or 1993 at the latest.
   In addition to my conventional arms proposals, I believe that we
ought to strive to improve the openness with which we and the
Soviets conduct our military activities, and therefore I want to
reiterate my support for greater transparency. I renew my proposal
that the Soviet Union and its allies open their skies to reciprocal
unarmed aerial surveillance flights, conducted on short notice to
watch military activity.
   Satellites are a very important way to verify arms control
agreements, but they do not provide constant coverage of the Soviet
Union. An open skies policy would move both sides closer to a total
continuity of coverage, while symbolizing greater openness between
East and West.
   These are my proposals to achieve a less militarized Europe.
   A short time ago, they would have been considered too
revolutionary to consider, and yet today, we may well be on the
verge of a more ambitious agreement than Europe, than anyone
considered possible. But we're also by challenged developments
outside of NATO's traditional areas of concern.
   Every Western nation still faces the global proliferation of
lethal technologies, including ballistic missiles and chemical
weapons. We must collectively control the spread of these growing
threats. So we should begin as soon as possible with a worldwide
ban on chemical weapons.
   Growing political freedom in the East, a Berlin without
barriers, a cleaner environment, a less militarized Europe, each is
a noble goal. And, taken together, they are the foundation of our
larger vision, a Europe that is free and at peace with itself.
   So let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their
legitimate security interests. Our goal is to convince them, step
by step, that their definition of security is obsolete, that their
deepest fears are unfounded.
   When Western Europe takes its giant step in 1992, it will
institutionalize what's been true for years _ borders open to
people, commerce and ideas; no shadow of suspicion, no sinister
fear is passed between you. The very prospect of war within the
West is unthinkable to our citizens.
   But such a peaceful integration of nations into a world
community does not mean that any nation must relinquish its
culture, much less its sovereignty.
   This process of integration, a subtle weaving of shared
interests, which is so nearly complete in Western Europe, has now
finally begun in the East. We want to help the nations of Eastern
Europe realize what we, the nations of Western Europe, learned long
ago: the foundation of lasting security comes not from tanks,
troops, or barbed wire, it is built on shared values and agreements
that link free peoples.
   The nations of Eastern Europe are rediscovering the glories of
their national heritage, so let the colors and hues of national
culture return to these gray societies of the East. Let Europe
forego a peace of tension for a peace of trust, one in which the
peoples of the East and West can rejoice, a continent that is
diverse, yet whole.
   Forty years of cold war have tested Western resolve and the
strength of our values. NATO's first mission is now nearly
complete. But if we are to fulfill our vision, our European vision,
the challenges of the next 40 years will ask no less of us.
   Together, we shall answer the call. The world has waited long
enough.

   Israeli troops today shot and killed three
guerrillas on the border with Lebanon, the army command said. It
was the third attempted infiltration in four days.
   Also today, police in Lebanon said Israeli warplanes attacked
targets on the outskirts of the southern city of Sidon in the fifth
such attack this year. There were no details on casualties.
   Soldiers shot and killed a 20-year-old Palestinian in a clash in
the Gaza town of Khan Yunis and wounded eight other Palestinians in
clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab doctors said.
   And Israeli news reports said police had detained six Jewish
settlers suspected of killing a 13-year-old Arab girl during a
rampage through a West Bank village.
   The army said two Palestinians from Gaza died of wounds suffered
in earlier clashes. It was checking the Arab reports of today's
casualties in the occupied territories.
   The border incident occurred near the Lebanese village of Hula,
about a mile west of the Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona, said a
military spokesman.
   He said troops spotted the three guerrillas, opened fire and
killed them immediately. The spokesman, who cannot be identified
according to army regulations, said the Israelis suffered no
casualties.
   Security sources said the area has been the site of increased
troop activity in recent days, and reporters observed flares there.
   On Tuesday, a guerrilla was shot to death in southern Lebanon
after being spotted by Israeli troops and their south Lebanese
militia allies east of the Lebanese town of Marjayoun.
   Troops also killed two guerrillas Sunday after several rockets
were fired into the Israeli border town of Metulla. Two more
guerillas were captured and two escaped, the army said.
   Sunday's raid was claimed by George Habash's Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the late Talaat Yacoub's
Damascus-based Palestine Liberation Front.
   Arab doctors did not identify the Palestinian reported shot and
killed today. The other two Palestinians who died of wounds
suffered earlier 14 were identified by Arab news reports as Ahmed
Ibrahim Nawas, 18, who was shot Tuesday, and Mohammed Ali Al
Farajani, 15, wounded May 14. Both were shot in the head.
   The deaths raised to 502 the number of Palestinians killed in
the nearly 18-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-two Israelis have also been killed.
   
   The army, meanwhile, has started using a new bullet against
Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied lands to help reduce
fatalities caused by plastic bullets, the Israeli daily Maariv
reported.
   The newspaper said the so-called ``stun'' bullet is designed not
to penetrate the body, but it quoted unidentified army commanders
as saying the bullet can kill if fired improperly. It said two
deaths have been attributed to the new bullet.
   The newspaper did not provide further details. An army spokesman
declined immediate comment.
   According to army figures, 77 Palestinians have been killed by
plastic bullets since they were introduced 10 months ago, in some
cases because the bullets were fired contrary to regulations.
   Also today, Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed
a general strike ordered by Moslem fundamentalists to protest what
they called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's ``curse against the
prophet Mohammed.''
   The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which Shamir
warned Israel must not make territorial concessions to the
Palestinians because ``someone might try to cheat us, to lie to
us.''
   ``Someone might say, `Let's cheat the Israelis just like
Mohammed did. (The Palestinians) always bring these examples of how
Mohammed used all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,''
Shamir told the Jerusalem Post in an interview published earlier
this month.
   Police, meanwhile, detained six Jewish settlers accused of
killing a Palestinian girl and wounding two others in a rampage
Monday in the West Bank village of Kifil Harith.
   The suspects were identified as seminarians at Joseph's Tomb
Yeshiva in Nablus, 12 miles away.
   The Hadashot daily said the six would be brought before a judge
and charged within a few days.

<HEAD>Health Chief Urges Women Not to Smoke</HEAD>

   The World Health Organization marked its second
No-Tobacco Day on Wednesday, and its leader said he was alarmed at
the rising number of women smokers worldwide.
   Some countries also marked the day, during which smokers were
urged to give up cigarettes and chewing tobacco for 24 hours. The
theme of this year's event was ``The Female Smoker, at Added Risk.''
   Anti-smokers in Bangladesh announced the results of a smoking
survey and Soviet scientists appealed to women to quit smoking.
Delegates to the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow agreed to
an appeal by one deputy to refrain from smoking inside the Palace
of Congresses for the day.
   Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO director-general, said smoking posed
greater health risks to women than to men, and urged women not to
seek a ``false expression of liberty'' through cigarettes.
   Women who take birth-control pills face increased risks of heart
disease and strokes, and pregnant women endanger the lives of their
children, he said at a news conference in Geneva.
   The death rate of women from lung cancer has risen by at least
200 percent since the 1950s, and more than 500,000 women die each
year as a result of smoking, according to WHO figures.
   The number of women who smoke increased markedly and became a
concern after World War II.
   ``It is deplorable that while tobacco consumption by men is
clearly decreasing in certain countries, women are becoming the
principle target of tobacco advertising,'' Nakajima said.
   ``Women are smoking more in a false expression of liberty,
equality and intellectual prestige. Unfortunately, advertising is
stimulating this tendency,'' he said.
   The U.N. agency singled out for particular criticism cigarette
brands aimed exclusively at women and promoted by images and words
that imply glamour such as ``ultra-slim'' or ``slender.''
   But Nakajima ruled out an international agreement to regulate
tobacco marketing similar to the one already adopted by the agency
for baby formula.
   He said such an agreement would be ``almost impossible'' because
of opposition by many of WHO's 166 members, including Third World
countries dependent on tobacco exports and industrialized countries
that receive high tax revenues from tobacco.
   Nakajima said he was concerned about the trend in the Third
World, where smoking is on the increase, especially among educated
women.
   In a WHO survey of 40 countries, the 10 with the highest female
smoking rates were in the Third World.
   At the top of the list was Papua New Guinea, where 80 percent of
adult women smoke, followed by Swaziland in southern Africa with 72
percent, according to the survey.
   In Bangladesh, an anti-smoking group announced the results of a
survey conducted in April that showed that about 5 million women in
the country chew or smoke tobacco. About 25 million people in the
nation of 110 million smoke, according to the group, Adhunik, which
means ``modern'' in the Bengali language.
   Denmark, where 39 percent of the women smoke, topped the list of
industrialized countries in WHO's survey, followed by the
Netherlands with 33 percent. The United States, where 24 percent of
the women smoke, ranked 16th out of 25 industrialized countries.
   WHO has called on doctors to help patients break the habit,
especially by setting an example themselves.
   The agency estimates that 10 percent of U.S. male doctors smoke;
an estimated 42 percent smoke in the Soviet Union, 65 percent in
the Netherlands and 70 percent in Poland.
   The agency did not include female doctors in its figures.
   WHO estimates that about 2.5 million people die each year as a
result of smoking.

   Police officers made an exploratory dive into
the Great Miami River today, a day after the body of the first
victim of a bridge collapse was found snagged downriver in debris.
   The officers were preparing for a search of the river Thursday,
the first to be made since last week when storms caused a temporary
bridge to collapse, dropping at least two vehicles into the water.
   Three other victims are missing, authorities believe. The body
of a woman was found about five miles from the bridge.
   The river's flow is still swift and hazardous to divers,
Whitewater Township Fire Chief Bill Darby said. However, the water
level has dropped to about 10 feet, down from the 23-foot level
when the bridge collapsed at rush hour Friday evening.
   Meanwhile, the firm that designed the bridge raised questions
about its stability before it was built because the contractor was
allowed to alter the plans, a newspaper reported today.
   Elmer Obermeyer Jr., managing partner of the Cincinnati design
firm of Graham Obermeyer and Partners, told The Cincinnati Enquirer
his firm questioned the altered design at a meeting and in a letter
to Hamilton County Engineer Donald Schramm's office last year.
   ``Our design was heavier and had longer spans ... but nobody
really envisioned that (the collapse) would happen,'' Obermeyer
said.
   Schramm said he was aware of Obermeyer's concerns about the
alternative design, which cut the cost and time needed to build the
temporary span, but said the plans met the state Department of
Transportation's standards.
   Recovery teams used sonar Tuesday to detect what appeared to be
two vehicles on the river bottom near the bridge. The currents
remained too strong to allow divers into the water, and officials
said they probably won't send divers in before Thursday.
   Authorities didn't release the identity of the woman whose body
was found, but they said she met the description of a missing
person.
   Before the body was found, police had received reports from
relatives of four people missing, according to Frank Weikel, a
spokesman for the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department.
   The temporary bridge opened Dec. 15 to carry traffic while a
94-year-old bridge is rebuilt a few feet away. Officials said the
strong currents in the river, which crested seven feet above flood
stage over the weekend, and the pounding from debris probably
caused the collapse.

   The United States today asked
Switzerland to extradite financier Adnan Khashoggi to face
racketeering and other charges related to alleged thefts from the
Philippine government by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.
   The Swiss Federal Police Office received the 243-page
extradition request today and was studying it, a Justice Ministry
statement said.
   Khashoggi, 54, a Saudi financier and arms dealer, has been
imprisoned in Bern since he was arrested April 18 at the request of
the U.S. Embassy.
   U.S. indictments charge Khashoggi, a jet-setter once reputed to
be among the world's richest men, with helping former Philippines
President Marcos and his wife, Imelda, hide the purchase of more
than $100 million dollars in real estate and art allegedly acquired
with money stolen from the Philippine Treasury.
   Khashoggi, a friend of Marcos, is accused of posing as owner of
the assets.
   There was no comment from Khashoggi's Swiss lawyer, Ralph
Zloczower, on the extradition request. A woman identifying herself
as his secretary answered the phone at the lawyer's office and said
he had no statement.
   Khashoggi's attorneys said after his arrest that they would
fight extradition.
   The charges cited in the U.S. extradition request were not
detailed by the Justice Ministry. They must be criminal offenses
under Swiss law for Bern to consider extradition.
   Assuming Swiss authorities do not dismiss the request, Khashoggi
will be granted a hearing, the statement said.
   If Switzerland grants extradition, Khashoggi can appeal the
decision to the Swiss supreme court, the Federal Tribunal.
   He could be extradited ``within five to 10 days'' if he does not
appeal, the ministry said.
   Khashoggi, known for big deals and an alleged central role in
the Iran-Contra affair, is charged in the United States with
racketeering, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. He could face
up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
   The indictments alleging cover-up of the Marcos-controlled
assets name the Marcoses, Khashoggi, five other people and a
California bank.
   A U.S. note that touched off Khashoggi's arrest at a Bern hotel
cited four buildings in Manhattan and a collection of paintings
that disappeared from a Manila museum.
   Khashoggi allegedly bought them for Marcos as part of
``obfuscation maneuvers'' during the ex-president's 20-year rule in
the Philippines, Swiss officials said.
   The Philippine government claims that after the Marcoses went
into exile in Hawaii in 1986, their agents and Khashoggi carted
away 25 paintings from New York properties owned by the Marcoses.
The action allegedly came after a California federal judge froze
the Marcoses' property.
   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.
   He was indicted in the Marcos case in October in New York.
   A U.S. district issued an arrest warrant for Khashoggi on March
24, according to the Swiss.
   Khashoggi became known for a flamboyant lifestyle and business
talent before reportedly hitting financial straits in recent years.
   He figured in several kickback scandals where U.S. aircraft
manufacturers paid him for arranging billion-dollar defense
contracts. He reputedly was the main financier and broker in the
Iran-Contra affair, where proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to
Iran were funneled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's government.
   Under a U.S.-Swiss treaty, U.S. authorities had 60 days after
Khashoggi's arrest to file a full extradition request to elaborate
on charges cited in the embassy's initial note.

   The government towed a boatload of 168
Vietnamese refugees to a remote island Wednesday in the second such
initiative aimed at discouraging new arrivals to the British colony.
   The latest refugees joined 109 Vietnamese who on Tuesday were
taken to Tai A Chau, an island 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong. The
government said all usual refugee facilities were filled by the
2,300 boat people who flooded Hong Kong in the last three days.
   The refugees were told not to leave their boats, according to a
police spokesman.
   Marine police were to provide the Vietnamese with food, water
and security until the government can find a place for them, the
spokesman said. He said he did not know how long that might take.
   Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong received hundreds of
thousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forces
defeated the U.S.-backed governments in South Vietnam and Cambodia
in April 1975. Thousands of Vietnamese still flee their homeland.
   A year ago, Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats all
Indochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation
unless they can prove they fled political persecution.
   Despite the policy, however, the influx continues. Since June
1988, more than 20,000 boat people arrived in Hong Kong and only
1,600 have been screened, according to a government statement. The
number of boat people in the British colony is 23,593, the
statement said.
   Vietnam has agreed to attend an international conference on
Indochinese refugees that is to be held in Geneva June 13-14.

   Seventeen spellers, stumbling over such
familiar words as ``veneer'' and ``nasturtium'' as well as less
familiar ones including ``seriatim'' and ``inumbrate,'' were
eliminated today in the first round of the 62nd National Spelling
Bee.
   The youngest competitor, 9-year-old Lisa Ishimaru of Sacramento,
Calif., survived, correctly spelling ``mountebank,'' a word for a
clownish person.
   Malinda Shepherd, 10, of Burnsville, N.C., was the first to go,
tripped up by ``seriatim,'' which means arranged one after another
in order. She spelled it ``seriatum.''
   The other five 10-year-olds in the competition, which is open to
scholars as old as 15, advanced to the second round.
   Robert A. Getz, 13, of Lawrence, Kan., had trouble with
``nasturtium,'' spelling it ``nasturtia.''
   Katherine T. Strohmaier, 12, of Lewiston, Idaho, misspelled
``veneer'' as ``vaneer.''
   ``Inumbrate,'' meaning to throw into shadow, tripped up Ana M.
Gordan, 13, of Manchester, N.H., who spelled it with a double ``n.''
   Others eliminated, and the words they missed, were Christopher
J. Simpson, 12, Whitman, Mass., sluice; Travis J. Blow, 14,
Wyalusing, Pa., macadam; Jenny L. Boehm, 11, Oreana, Ill.,
supervene; Casey R. Cornwell, 12, Henderson, Nev., paunchiness;
Kelsey J. Rinella, 13, Clifton Park, N.Y., legibility; Jason T.
Orendorff, 11, Bartlett, Tenn., palmyra; Michelle L. Santos, 12,
Moore, Okla., sonable; Lacretia Rouse, 14, Wilson, N.C.,
secularism; Amanda J. Robbins, 11, Asheboro, N.C., prenuptial;
Angela F. Greaves, 13, Lafayette, La., vacillant; Donna S. Evans,
13, Camden, W.Va., lunule; Aneka A. Walker, 14, Plainfield, N.J.,
tyrannize; and Hanna Yoon, 12, Elk Grove Village, Ill., blas, a
word for a supposed emanation from the stars.
   The two-day competition, which carries $16,350 in prize money,
has attracted 120 girls and 102 boys who survived elimination
contests around the country and in American outposts abroad.
   Last year there were 200 spellers, including the youngest in the
history of the event, Iris Liu, a third-grader from Muncie, Ind.,
who was just short of her 9th birthday. She was eliminated the
first day, stumbling on ``waywiser,'' an instrument used to measure
distances.
   In addition to the six 10-year-olds, there are 24 contestants
who are 11, 45 who are 12, 89 who are 13, 55 who are 14 and two who
are 15. Competition is limited to those who are not yet 16 and have
not passed beyond the eighth grade.
   Contest officials estimated that nearly 9 million students
participated at the local level in contests sponsored by Scripps
Howard newspapers in 13 cities and by 205 other daily, weekly and
Sunday newspapers.
   ``Spellers may not have books, papers, study sheets, word lists,
pens, pencils or other objects that might be construed as a help,''
the youngsters were warned in a schedule handed out in advance.
   They arrived in Washington for registration on Sunday and spent
Monday visiting Gunston Hall, the Virginia home of Bill of Rights
framer George Mason.
   On Tuesday, they toured Washington monuments and public
buildings and took a ride to the National Aquarium in Baltimore.
   Prizes will be presented Friday night at a banquet with a joint
armed forces color guard. First prize includes a cash award of
$1,500. Other prizes are $1,000 for second, $750 for third, $500
for fourth, $400 for fifth, $300 for sixth, $200 for seventh
through 10th, $100 for 11th through 20th, and 202 prizes of $50
each.
   Seven of the contestants are making their third appearance in
the national competition. Among them is Robert Pryor, 11, of
Washington, who had such a nervous stomach last year that he had to
be helped to the microphone on his first appearance. On his second
appearance, he misspelled ``fidgetiness.''
   There have been 64 National Spelling Bee champions, since
co-champions were declared in three years. Of the winners, 35 were
girls and 29 boys. Last year 102 girls and 98 boys competed.
   The first such event was held in 1925 with nine contestants,
under sponsorship of the Louisville Courier-Journal. The Scripps
Howard Newspapers took over the program in 1941. The program was
suspended for three years during World War II.
   In 1988, Rageshree Ramachandran, 13, of Fair Oaks, Calif., won
by correctly spelling ``elegiacal,'' a type of rhymed couplet or a
poem written in such couplets.
   In 1987, Stephanie Petit, 13, of Bethel Park, Pa., won by
spelling ``staphylococci,'' or bacteria infecting the skin and
mucous membranes.
   All but the last round are on a miss-and-out basis. On the final
round, the champion must correct the word missed by the runner-up
and then correctly spell another word.

   Riot police wielding truncheons
arrested more than 600 radical students who tried to march to the
Roman Catholic cathedral on Wednesday to support anti-government
hunger strikers.
   About 5,000 troopers stopped 1,000 students a few blocks from
Myongdong Cathedral in the city center. Police charged into the
column of protesters several times, dragging away struggling
students in a confrontation that lasted four hours.
   Although most protesters were peaceful, some tried to ram
through police lines to reach the cathedral, where at least 60
students are staging a hunger strike.
   Some riot police kicked and beat screaming demonstrators as they
were hauled away. Police said there were injuries among the
troopers and students but said they had no figures.
   Earlier, 4,000 students took part in rallies at 13 Seoul
colleges calling for the resignation of President Roh Tae-woo.
   They also want the government to admit responsibility in the
death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu, who they say was tortured
and killed by police. A government report said Lee died when he
slipped into a reservoir while fleeing troopers and there was no
evidence of police torture.
   The students shouted ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Bring back
Lee Chol-kyu!''
   The campus protests were peaceful, except at Sogang University,
where 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks. At
least six officers and students were hurt, police said.
   Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in
southern Kwangju, near where Lee's body was found in a reservoir on
May 10.
   About 300 students began the hunger strike May 25 to demand the
government admit that police killed Lee, but their number had
dwindled to about 60 on Tuesday. Student leaders said Wednesday
more students joined the strike and 500 were participating, but
there was no way to check that figure.
   Doctors said eight fasters were hospitalized after collapsing
and scores began eating because of weakness.
   On Wednesday night, riot police blocked the hunger strikers and
about 300 protesters when they tried to march out of the cathedral
for a candlelight parade. Lines of police stopped the march, but
there was no violence.
   Some radical students have called for peaceful protests after
six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus demonstration. The
deaths outraged public opinion in South Korea. The radicals lack
public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views.
   Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics
as those used by Chinese students in the pro-democracy protest in
Beijing.
   South Korea's largest dissident group, the United National
Democratic Movement, Wednesday announced plans to become a
full-fledged political party.
   The movement _ about 200 minor dissident groups with an
estimated total membership of 400,000 _ has led many violent
demonstrations against the government, which it labels as
dictatorial.
   It has weakened considerably in recent months after most of its
leaders, including co-chairman Lee Bu-young, were either arrested
or driven underground by police.

   Stolen art works could pour into the United
States if a U.S. art dealer wins a lawsuit over four sixth century
Christian mosaics, an attorney for the Cypriot government said.
   ``If all it takes to bring stolen art into this country is an
empty head and a round-trip ticket to Switzerland, the flood gates
are open,'' Thomas R. Kline said Tuesday, the first day of a
lawsuit in federal court pitting a suburban art dealer against
Cyprus and its Greek Orthodox Church.
   Kline said art dealer Peg Goldberg had tried to claim that her
inexperience in the international art trade legitimized her
purchase of the stolen mosaics, which once graced the walls of a
church in the northern village of Lythrankomi.
   ``This is a case about a woman who fell in love with a work of
art,'' said Joe C. Emerson, Goldberg's attorney. He added that his
client had sought to determine if the mosaics were stolen before
purchasing them.
   Analysts have said the case could set a precedent governing
international trade in national art treasures.
   The mosaics are the work of an unknown artist and depict Jesus
as a boy, the apostles Matthew and James, and an archangel.
   Goldberg paid $1.2 million for the mosaics in July 1988 to Aydin
Dikmen, a Turk living in West Germany.
   Emerson said the Cypriot government knew in 1982 that Dikmen had
been linked to art thefts from northern Cyprus, which is under
Turkish control, and could have pursued him earlier to recover the
mosaics.
   Athanasis Papageorghiou, acting director of Cypriot antiquities,
testified Tuesday that he knew of Dikmen through news reports but
had no way of stopping him.
   During testimony today, Papageorghiou reviewed a list of 28
people his department had notified about the missing mosaics in
1980. The 28, from around the world, ``were specialists in
Byzantine art and in all probability they could be contacted if
something was for sale,'' he said.
   Asked about efforts the Cypriot government had made to recover
the mosaics, Papageorghiou said he was told government officials
had not contacted Interpol because they needed the name and
location of the smuggler.
   Papageorghiou said the removal of the mosaics was part of a
widespread pattern of looting in churches in northern Cyprus, which
since 1975 has been controlled by the self-designated Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus.
   ``Many churches are looted, museums are looted, private
collections are looted. We have suffered much,'' Papageorghiou said.
   He testified that the government was informed the mosaics were
missing in November 1979 and had notified the United Nations,
museums and other organizations.
   Judge James E. Noland ruled that the Turkish Cypriots could not
intervene in the case because their government was not recognized
by the United States.
   The case could rest on whether Cyprus diligently sought the
return of the mosaics, and whether or not Goldberg showed good
faith in trying to determine if the works were stolen.
   Also important was whether the sale would be governed by Swiss
law or more stringent Indiana laws regarding stolen property.
   Kline said evidence would show the sale was finalized in West
Germany. He said Indiana law should apply because four Indiana
residents stand to profit from the sale of the mosaics, an Indiana
bank authorized the loan for the sale, and the mosaics were in
Switzerland only a few days en route to their final destination.
   Goldberg has said she checked a stolen art registry in New York,
UNESCO officials in Switzerland and customs officials in the United
States, Turkey, Switzerland and Turkish Cyprus before buying the
mosaics.
   ``She does not recall the name of a single official to whom she
spoke,'' Kline said. ``She never called Cyprus or the Church of
Cyprus. Miss Goldberg does appear to be in quite a hurry in this
transaction.''

   The State Department today ordered the
explusion of two Nicaraguan diplomats in retaliation for the ouster
of two U.S. envoys from Managua last week.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy was informed that the presence of Roberto
Vargas and William Vigil, both minister counselors, ``was no longer
acceptable to the government of the United States,'' department
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   They were given 72 hours to leave the country.
   Last Thursday, the Sandinista government expelled Joel Cassman,
economics officer at the U.S. Embassy in Managua, and Kathleen
Barmon, a regional labor attache from the embassy in Honduras who
was on a visit to Managua. They were accused of inciting Nicaraguan
school teachers to join a wildcat strike.
   Boucher said the State Department waited six days before
expelling the two Nicaraguans in hopes that the Sandinista
government would reverse ``its unwarranted, unjustified expulsion''
of the two Americans.
   He said the Nicaraguan government chose not to reconsider its
decision, and the State Department reciprocated by expelling Vargas
and Vigil.
   Nicaraguan Embassy spokeswoman Cecilia Lopez said the two envoys
had arrived in Washington just 10 days ago. She had no further
comment.

<HEAD>Summit Successes Shore Up Kohl, Reassure Germans of U.S. Friendship</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NATO allies have patched up an
unsettling quarrel over short-range missiles and President Bush has
come to West Germany and declared U.S. friendship with the Germans.
   The two events have lifted Chancellor Helmut Kohl out of the
political doldrums and given West Germans a feeling of pride and
emerging prominence. And in two weeks, Kohl will be welcoming
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union for a summit.
   It is a dramatic change.
   Only a few days ago West Germans were in a quandary about the
corner they'd painted themselves into: challenging NATO policy and
the United States by insisting on negotiations to remove
short-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
   But the NATO summit in Brussels produced an compromise agreement
and allowed Bush and Kohl to conduct their two-day summit like best
friends.
   ``The relationship between the United States and the Federal
Republic of Germany has never been better,'' Bush said repeatedly
during his visit.
   The leaders referred often to the first years after World War
II, stoking the emotional embers still burning in many older West
Germans who recall the American role in rebuilding their nation
after the fall of Hitler's Third Reich.
   The nostalgic theme struck the chord it intended, compounding
West Germans' satisfaction over the Brussels success with a
reassurance that the Americans are still on their side.
   Bush's visit was a time of celebration for West Germans, who are
at once pleased to have made their point with NATO partners and
relieved that it didn't cost them any standing with the alliance.
   While many West Germans are opposed to nuclear weapons in their
country, they are fearful of isolation and vulnerability should
they stray too far from their traditional allies.
   ``No nukes, no troops,'' is the warning one senior U.S. official
says he has delivered to West German authorities. It raised the
possibility that if the battlefield nuclear weapons are removed the
thousands of American and British soldiers in West Germany would
soon follow.
   The NATO compromise seemed to blow away the concern, and it was
all smiles at the high-profile presidential visit.
   Larger than expected crowds of well-wishers turned out to greet
Bush and his wife, Barbara, at their public appearances, carried
live on nationwide television. The president's announcement that
West Germans would no longer need visas to visit the United States
drew thunderous cheers.
   ``A Gift From Bush for All Germans,'' the Bild newspaper gushed
in a banner headline, referring to the visa announcement. It
forecast a rosy arms control future, declaring ``Now Peace is
Really Taking Off.''
   West Germans, who often seem insecure about their standing in
the world, appeared to be relishing the international prestige
bestowed on them by Bush's visit and their role in resolving the
NATO dispute.
   Kohl expressed satisfaction with the accord on NATO defense
strategy that put off for at least two years a controversial
project to upgrade the nuclear weapons. Bush took care to share the
limelight _ declaring the compromise a victory for the NATO
alliance, not for any single point of view.
   The chancellor has pointed out repeatedly since the Brussels
accord that he will soon be talking over the new alliance position
with Gorbachev.
   The Kremlin leader arrives in Bonn on June 12 for a four-day
visit that West German officials look forward to as a chance to
keep the disarmament momentum going.
   The chancellor said in a speech in Mainz during Bush's visit
that West Germans ``see a historic chance to overcome the tensions
between East and West.''
   But making clear which side of the European divide West Germany
stands on, Kohl assured Bush, ``We will never allow our commitment
to the alliance to waver. Our future does not lie somewhere in no
man's land between East and West. Our future lies in the community
of free peoples.''
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic party has recently
suffered in opinion polls and regional elections because of a
general drift to the left among voters. His popularity sunk to a
dangerous low during the missile dispute, when he appeared to take
the stand against NATO in response to public pressure.
   Some U.S. officials said privately during the Bonn summit that
the compromise reached in Brussels was engineered by the Americans
to rescue Kohl from his political woes.
   Should Kohl lose power during the federal elections in December
1990, the U.S. government would likely be confronted with a
coalition of liberals more skeptical of American and NATO policies.
   Kohl seemed to acknowledge the Brussels outcome as a gift,
thanking Bush for making it possible.
   An unusually ebullient Kohl described Bush to the press as ``a
proven friend who has always stood ready to help me in difficult
times.''
   Asked by reporters whether the Brussels compromise would improve
his re-election chances, the chancellor who usually bristles at
such questions beamed and declared confidently: ``I am completely
certain as to the results of the elections in 1990.''

   President Bush today challenged the
Soviet Union to bury the Cold War by ending the division of Europe,
starting by tearing down the Berlin Wall. ``Let Europe be whole and
free,'' he declared.
   In a major speech clearly aimed at Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the president said popular demands for democratic
reforms are sweeping through the communist world, forcing a
re-examination of Cold War fears and security precautions.
   ``The Cold War,'' he said, ``began with the division of Europe.
It can only end when Europe is whole.''
   Triumphant after his debut at the NATO summit in Brussels,
Belgium, the president spoke in the Rhine River city of Mainz
before an audience in the Rheingoldhalle theater. Four blocks away,
about 250 demonstrators protested Bush's visit under a heavy police
guard.
   The protesters waved banners and placards reading ``Bush Go
Home,'' ``Bush Is Not Welcome Here'' and ``Bush _ Hands Off
Nicaragua.'' The main bridge spanning the Rhine River was sealed
off, and helicopters circled the hall where Bush spoke.
   In the capital of Bonn, boats crammed with security agents in
diving gear watched over the nearby Rhine when Bush made a farewell
visit to U.S. ambassador Vernon Walters. ``Youth are the world, and
I hope what happened within NATO guarantees the future,'' the
president told several hundred flag-waving Americans and West
Germans who massed on the ambassador's lawn.
   It was his first and only major address during a week-long trip
to Italy, Belgium, Germany and Britain. After today's speech and a
cruise down the Rhine River, Bush flew to London for talks with
Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher, who greeted him at Heathrow
Airport as a band played marching tunes.
   Bush's NATO proposals for cutbacks in conventional East-West
troop levels and armaments drew another positive response from
Soviet officials today. Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet
foreign ministry, said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that
``we ask for a timeout to study it, but the initial reaction is
positive.''
   The central theme of the Mainz speech was a call for freedom and
democracy for all of Europe.
   ``The world has waited long enough,'' said Bush, who plans to
visit Poland and Hungary in July. ``The time is right. Let Europe
be whole and free.
   ``In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way,''
Bush said.
   ``Look at Poland, where Solidarity and the Catholic Church have
won legal status. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet
status quo on the defensive.
   ``In the West, we have succeeded because we have been faithful
to our values and our vision. But, on the other side of the rusting
Iron Curtain, their vision failed.''
   He said that nowhere is the division between East and West more
obvious than in Berlin, where Communist authorities erected a wall
of concrete and barbed wire in 1961 in an effort to halt the flow
of refugees to the West.
   ``There, a brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor and brother
from brother,'' Bush said. ``That wall stands as a monument to the
failure of communism. It must come down.''
   He issued that challenge as part of a series of proposals ``to
heal Europe's tragic division, to help Europe become whole and
free.''
   Bush said Berlin should become a center of commerce and
cooperation instead of confrontation.
   ``Bring glasnost to East Berlin,'' he declared.
   Bush said the West and East should cooperate to foster free
elections in Eastern Europe, and he offered Western technical
training and other steps to help the East cope with environmental
problems that threaten both sides.
   Recalling the measures he proposed at the NATO summit for cuts
in U.S. and Soviet combat troops in Europe, Bush reiterated his
call for the Soviet Union and its allies to open their skies to
reciprocal, unarmed aerial surveillance flights to monitor military
activities.
   He also called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons.
   Summing up, Bush said, ``Growing political freedom in the East,
a Berlin without barriers, a cleaner environment, a less
millitarized Europe _ each is a noble goal.
   ``Taken together, they are the foundation of our larger vision,
a Europe that is free and at peace with itself,'' he said.
   ``Let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their
legitimate security interests,'' the president said. `` Our goal is
to convince them, step by step, that their definition of security
is obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded.''
   Bush said the very concept of a divided Europe was ``under siege
_ not by armies but by the spread of ideas'' that began in Mainz,
the birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of the printing
press.
   Bush said the power of democracy was ``sweeping across Eurasia.
This one idea is why the communist world, from Budapest to Beijing,
is in ferment.''
   Bush told leaders of the Eastern bloc they were ``unleashing a
force they will find difficult to channel or control: the hunger
for liberty of oppressed peoples who have tasted freedom.''
   Bush arrived in Bonn on Tuesday after the two-day summit in
Brussels, and conferred today with West German leaders before the
Rhine River cruise.
   An upbeat Bush called the summit meeting ``a double hit''
because it produced a united allied front on short-range nuclear
weapons and favorable reaction to his proposal for cuts in U.S. and
Soviet combat troop strength in Europe to 275,000 on each side.
   At a post-summit news conference, Bush noted that the Soviet
Union has a more than 3-1 advantage in short-range tactical nuclear
missiles over NATO forces.
   ``Why don't they just unilaterally reduce to equal numbers?''
Bush said. ``Now, there'd be a good challenge.''
   The communique winding up the 40th anniversary NATO summit
contained a compromise specifying that only a ``partial reduction''
in battlefield nuclear weapons would be pursued with the East.
   That limited step was a setback for West Germany, which had
sought early U.S.-Soviet negotiations with the possible aim of
eliminating the missiles both in NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact.
   Despite the tilt toward the U.S. position, the Germans did not
leave the summit empty-handed. On a related issue, Bush and Mrs.
Thatcher agreed to Bonn's demand for a delay in modernization of
the U.S.-built Lance missile launchers, which are deployed mostly
in West Germany.
   In a televised interview, Bush said he was encouraged overall by
initial Soviet reaction to NATO's stand on short-range missiles.
   Bush dismised a complaint from Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov in Moscow that NATO's communique links
negotiations on nuclear weapons to reductions in conventional
forces.
   ``The West will not let Mr. Gorbachev dictate the terms of any
discussion,'' Bush said. ``I would encourage the Soviets in a
spirit of good will to come forward and talk and not try to dictate
some terms through a spokesman.''

   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno agreed Wednesday to
become Japan's next prime minister, at the behest of a governing
party crippled by scandal and divided by the choice.
   The Liberal Democrats turned to Uno, 66, after elder statesman
Masayoshi Ito refused the job.
   Uno was attending a meeting in Paris and agreed by telephone,
apparently with some reluctance, to become head of the party and to
replace Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary-general of the party,
appeared at a news conference and quoted Uno as saying: ``I am not
confident I can handle the job when the party is facing such a
difficult time, but now that the party is in an unprecedented
crisis I will commit myself for the party.''
   Hashimoto said party leaders decided Uno was ``currently the
most suited candidate as successor'' to Takeshita. The prime
minister is resigning to take responsibility for the Recruit
influence-buying scandal, which stained the top ranks of politics,
business and the bureaucracy.
   Opposition within the party indicated Uno may have a difficult
time even if gets the expected approval from Parliament, where the
Liberal Democrats have a large majority.
   Some oppose the foreign minister because he is a senior member
of the party faction of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,
during whose tenure in 1982-87 the scandal developed.
   ``I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest
office, which only one person can assume, to a sort of managing
director of the Nakasone company,'' former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda told reporters. ``I am totally amazed.''
   Fukuda, 84, had lobbied against Uno. His own name was one of
many mentioned as possible candidates during the long search.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist
Party, the largest opposition group, said: ``The Recruit scandal
involved corruption during Yasuhiro Nakasone's administration. It
is ... a violent act to appoint one of Nakasone's aides as the next
prime minister.''
   Business leaders welcomed the choice, noting that Uno has gained
international experience as foreign minister since November 1987
and has not been touched by the scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats need someone with a clean image to boost
their popularity before elections this summer for half of
Parliament's upper house. It has taken more than a month to find
such a person after Takeshita announced April 25 that he would
resign.
   Ito, the 75-year-old chairman of the party executive council,
was a popular first choice, but turned the job down May 13 on
grounds of poor health and dissatisfaction with how the party was
handling political reform.
   Once Ito had refused, the search was complicated by the fact
that so many party leaders had received political donations or
profitable stock deals from Recruit Co., an information and
publishing conglomerate accused of buying favors and influence.
   Uno's name emerged last weekend as the choice of Takeshita, then
the collective leadership became involved.
   Hashimoto said the decision was reached in meetings Wednesday
involving himself; Takeshita; Ito; Michio Watanabe, chairman of the
party policy committee, and Ichiro Yamanouchi, party leader in the
upper house.
   He said it was endorsed by the party secretary-general, Shintaro
Abe, who is hospitalized after gall bladder surgery.
   Resistance to Uno appeared to be spreading Wednesday.
   A group of 48 younger party members said the leaders, rather
than choosing a new prime minister, should take responsibility for
the scandal by resigning their party posts.
   Kyodo News Service said the group planned to put up its own
candidate for the party leadership.
   Former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and Toshio Komoto, head of
the party's fifth-largest faction, said the public might not accept
Uno because of his ties to Nakasone.
   Nakasone resigned from the party because of the Recruit scandal,
but he has retained his seat in Parliament and analysts expect his
influence to continue.
   Fukuda and Suzuki had argued for separation of the jobs of party
chief and prime minister.

<TEXT>
   A team of scientists is going on a
Mount McKinley expedition to determine among other things: How high
is high?
   The team from the School of Engineering at the University of
Alaska-Anchorage will carry sophisticated measuring equipment up
North America's tallest peak.
   With the help of a satellite, the equipment will try to
re-measure the height of Alaska's most popular attraction,
currently recorded at 20,320 feet.
   But all that is of secondary interest to the scientists.
   Ron Cothren, an assistant professor of engineering, said the
team actually wants to measure the mountain's gravitational
attraction.
   ``What difference does it make if the mountain is a foot or two
higher?'' Cothran said Monday. ``What this will really do is give
us a feel for the effect of the mountain's mass. Right now, we have
no idea what kind of attraction McKinley has.''
   The experiment is being conducted with the National Geodetic
Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey. Equipment will be installed
and left at the mountain's 18,000 foot level, Cothren said.
   The team is to go Thursday to the climbers' base camp and leave
from there when weather permits.
   The experiment probably won't make the mountain officially
taller or shorter _ certainly no more than 100 feet each way,
Cothren said.
   Mount Rainier in Washington state was re-measured with the
satellite technique recently and was found to be 1{ feet taller
than its official measurement.

<HEAD>Disney Studios Show Anti-Nazi Films for the First Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Studios screened six rare
anti-Nazi films made in 1942 and 1943 for the first time in more
than 40 years during an international animated film festival
Wednesday.
   The six clips, starring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and other
Disney characters, have been carefully preserved and locked up at
the Disney studios since the war.
   The 1943 clip ``Victory Through Air Power,'' based on a book by
Maj. Alexander de Seversky, depicts the importance of strategic air
bombing to Allied victory.
   Another cartoon shows Donald Duck dreaming he is condemned to
live in Nazi Germany. And in ``Donald Gets Drafted,'' the famous
duck and his friend, Pete, join the U.S. Army.
   The clips will be shown again at a retrospective exhibition in
London in November before they are returned to the studios for
safekeeping.
   Disney is aware of the extremely nationalistic content of the
clips and their use of stereotypes.
   ``It is absolutely acceptable to present these films from the
war period to professionals, to people able to appreciate this type
of animation in its context, but it wouldn't be right to reproduce
them on cassettes or to edit them for the public,'' Disney Studios
Senior Vice President Peter Schneider told The Associated Press.
   ``That would not reflect the spirit of Disney today,'' he added.
``Walt Disney has always had a progressive image, and one must
situate these clips in their right context, which is during a
special wartime period,'' he said.
   Only a thousand or people will be able to see the one-time
screening of the six cartoons. The festival officials received more
than 3,000 requests, mostly from professionals, to attend the event.
   According to Jean Lux Xibera, director of the Annecy festival,
the presence of Disney films in such an event is an event in
itself. ``Except for retrospectives, Disney has never accepted,''
he said.
   Schneider said the studio's presence at the invitation of the
organizers is part of a new policy, and it would participate in
other similar festivals.
   The Animated Film festival ends Thursday. This year, 215 films
were selected out of more than 900 for the competition.

   Israeli warplanes today bombed Palestinian
and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases on the outskirts of this southern
port city.
   Police said a two-story command post used by three radical
guerrilla factions was demolished in one of two raids today.
   At least five guerrillas were missing in the rubble and presumed
killed, police said. At least three other guerrillas were wounded,
they said.
   A statement by the Isrrael Army command said the fighters hit
``two terrorist targets'' east of Sidon.
   The statement said ``the targets were headquarters and
ammunition dumps of Hezbollah and Abu Nidal.'' It said plans for
three recent guerrilla infilatrations into Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone in south Lebanon were made at the targeted sites.
   Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group active in
Lebanon, and the Abu Nidal faction is a non-PLO guerrilla group
with support from Syria and Libya.
   Lebanese police said the Israeli jets roared in at 7 a.m.
   By police count, six people have been killed and 45 wounded in
Israel's four previous raids into Lebanon this year.

<HEAD>Thousands of Soviets Travel to Hungary to Stock Up on Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Soviets have taken
advantage of relaxed travel restrictions to come Hungary to buy
goods that are unavailable at home, the Hungarian news agency
reported Wednesday.
   Four new border stations were opened on the Hungarian-Soviet
border March 1, and most restrictions on travel for people living
in the border area were lifted.
   Hungary has introduced some of the most liberal travel laws in
Eastern Europe, allowing its citizens to travel as often as they
can afford to. Other East bloc countries still restrict travel of
their citizens to other Soviet bloc countries.
   According to the state news agency MTI, authorities expected no
more than 350,000 people to cross the Soviet-Hungarian border
before the end of the year. In the first three months, however, 1.5
million people have crossed the border, MTI said. Customs officials
processed 98,000 passports on a single day recently, 90 percent of
which were Soviet, MTI said.
   Shops in the border area have insufficient stocks of items in
high demand among Soviet tourists: toothpaste, soap, deodorant,
margarine and brandy, it said.
   The news agency compared the onslaught of Soviet shopping
tourists to the ``invasion'' of Austria in recent months by
Hungarian shoppers stocking up on electronic items and household
appliances. Nearly 1 million Hungarians traveled to Austria in the
week preceding the introduction of new customs regulations in April.
   There are too few currency exchange offices and gas stations in
the Soviet-Hungarian border area, MTI said. Makeshift markets have
appeared in parking lots near the border where money can be
exchanged on the black market and some goods are sold from car
trunks, the news agency said.
   Officials are to meet this week to discuss the opening of more
border-crossing stations, MTI said.

   People at high risk of catching AIDS may silently
harbor the AIDS virus inside their bodies for years while appearing
on standard blood tests to be free of infection, research has found.
   The study found that one-quarter of a group of homosexual men
who engaged in risky sex were infected but produced no telltale
antibodies that ordinarily are the hallmark of AIDS virus exposure.
   Health officials check for these antibodies, produced by the
body in reaction to an infection, to make sure that blood
transfusions and organs for transplants are free of the lethal
virus.
   Dr. William A. Haseltine of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston, an AIDS expert familiar with the research, cautioned that
the discovery ``raises the sobering possibility'' that people with
silent infections may pass on the virus through blood and organ
donations.
   However, Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky of Northwestern University, a
co-author of the study, said that even if they can transmit the
virus, he believes the blood supply is safe because people at high
risk of AIDS have already voluntarily stopped donating blood.
   Antibody screening of large population groups also is used to
gauge how many people are infected with HIV, the AIDS virus and the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that between 1 million
and 1.5 million Americans carry the virus.
   But the latest research ``means that the infection could be
considerably more widespread than we anticipated,'' Haseltine said
in an interview.
   The new work found that HIV can permanently insert itself into
the genes of blood cells but stay hidden so the body never attacks
it with antibodies. People may make no AIDS antibodies for three
years _ and perhaps much longer _ after they become infected.
   ``The prevalence of this is not known, but it certainly says
there's a possibility of a silent reservoir of HIV infection,''
said Wolinsky.
   The research was directed by Dr. David T. Imagawa of the
University of California at Los Angeles and published in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on 1,637 homosexual
men in Los Angeles who were enrolled in the study in 1984 and 1985.
   Among them were 133 men who had no AIDS antibodies but continued
to engage in risky anal sex. In test tubes, their white blood cells
were stimulated to grow. This released any AIDS virus hidden inside
the cells so it could be detected.
   They found that 31 of the 133 had silent AIDS infections. While
four of these men eventually began to produce AIDS antibodies, the
rest did not for followup periods ranging up to three years.
   While the study raises concern about the effectiveness of
current screening tests, there is also a bright side to the finding.
   ``The good news is that at least some fraction of people, when
exposed, seem to control the infection,'' said Haseltine. ``We
would guess that as long as it stays in that controlled state,
people are going to stay healthy. It gives us a new target to shoot
for in terms of therapy.''
   How long this quiet state of infection may last is unclear,
although Haseltine speculated that it might be life long for some
people.
   The report may also help answer one of the mysteries of the AIDS
epidemic _ why about half of the long-time sex partners of infected
homosexual men do not appear to catch the virus. Haseltine said the
new work suggests that a substantial number of these people may
harbor silent infections.

   Transportation officials are considering
opening up a road that would give new meaning to the term car pool.
   The concrete-lined Los Angeles River, dry 300 days a year, would
make a perfect alternate freeway route and speed the flow of
traffic, transportation planners said.
   Officials have recommended that the county's Transportation
Commission authorize spending $100,000 to study the matter and
formally consider the idea at a June 28 meeting.
   Jean Granucci, spokeswoman for the county Public Works
Department, said the ``river road'' idea has been sloshing around
for some time, but studies had revealed that use of the channel as
a road was not economical.
   The plan was brought back a few months ago by Assemblyman
Richard Katz, who approached transportation planners with his idea.
   The river wanders across the San Fernando Valley before turning
south at Griffith Park, passing east of downtown and heading
straight to the harbor.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the progressive Baltic
republics challenged the Kremlin's traditional notion of tight
central control Wednesday by pressing the new parliament to endorse
their campaign for sovereignty.
   The most radical demand to the Congress of People's Deputies
came from Anatoly Gorbunov, the president of Latvia, who said the
Soviet Constitution should be changed to ensure that the 15
republics _ not the central government _ hold the major powers.
   ``Only a republic can delegate power to the union because the
republics created the union,'' said Gorbunov, a reform-minded
protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Latvian leader proposed recognizing the 15 republics to be
sovereign states with the power to control their own resources,
make their own laws, and conclude a new agreement of union.
   The two other Baltic republics, Estonia and Lithuania, already
have defied Moscow by declaring themselves sovereign with the right
to overturn Soviet laws.
   Gorbunov said a revision of the power structure is needed ``to
eradicate the roots of ethnic tension.''
   ``The U.S.S.R. is a union, a multinational state, formed on the
basis of agreement by equal republics, with self-determination of
nations,'' he said.
   The three Baltic nations were incorporated into the Soviet Union
in 1940 under a secret protocol between Nazi Germany and the
Kremlin, and some residents and local officials have called for the
renunciation of the agreement.
   In a speech, Lithuanian party chief Algirdas Brazauskas demanded
the Kremlin reveal the ``historical truth'' about the pact. He also
complained that Moscow bureaucrats are preventing the Baltic
republics from carrying out plans for economic independence.
   The highest-level comment on Gorbunov's radical proposals came
from Anatoly Lukyanov, elected Monday as vice president. He said
the proposals may go too far in distancing the republics from the
central government.
   ``There should be a melting of centralism, republican
self-management and local management,'' Lukyanov said in an
interview.
   Estonia's premier, Indrek Toome, stressed economic independence
in his speech to the 2,250 deputies, not mentioning his republic's
demand for veto power over laws passed in central bodies. He said
some people were trying to distort the Baltics' demands.
   ``What I mentioned does not mean the desire to somehow separate
from the all-union problems, although some people try to attach
this to us. Such an accusation is not serious because the closed
economiy is doomed. On the contrary, integration between the
republics and regions must deepen,'' Toome said.

<HEAD>Couple Arrested After Allegedly Using Young Daughter to Panhandle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple accused of sending their 3-year-old
daughter into moving traffic to panhandle money from motorists have
been charged with endangering a child.
   Carol Jean Drew, 33, and Mark C. Drew, 36, were charged Tuesday
with the Class A misdemeanor, and bond was set at $500 each, said
Sgt. William Staney.
   Police said the couple and their three children have been seen
at several busy intersections carrying signs seeking work, money
and shelter.
   Using children to solicit money is not, in itself, illegal,
Staney said. But the couple was charged with endangering a child
after witnesses reportedly told police they saw the pair send the
girl into traffic Monday.
   ``A 3-year-old's not that stable, and she's also very short, so
there's a good chance of her not being seen by some of the drivers.
It was very, very dangerous,'' Staney said.
   The girl was carrying a placard that read, ``Two-year-old _
cannot feed _ homeless _ please help,'' police said.
   The girl's parents were arrested Monday and her two brothers,
ages 10 and 12, were found alone at the family's apartment. All
three children were put in the custody of the Harris County
Children's Protective Services.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of special education youngsters did what
Macho Man Randy Savage, King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd could
not _ they brought tears to the eyes of champion professional
wrestler Hulk Hogan.
   Hogan, chosen the favorite hero of 100 children with speech,
hearing or other learning disabilities at two public schools,
watched while the youngsters sang songs and showered him with
praise.
   ``He's a hero to us and everybody loves him like a father,''
13-year-old Quincy Brown said after the hour of skits in a
Manhattan school auditorium.
   While Hogan sat in red and black tights by the stage, his eyes
became misty. He raised a hand to one eye and later confirmed it
wasn't allergies or dust in the eye.
   ``I about started crying here,'' he told the youngsters, in
grades one through six.
   The children picked Hogan as their favorite hero in April and
wrote letters asking him to visit.
   Shelley Cohen, principal of Public School 158, said the children
were awestruck. ``I've never seen them work so hard, learn as
quickly and be so intent to impress.
   ``That's awesome power for one man to wield. If the sports
heroes can remain true to their message, they can really make a
difference.''
   For the special education children, ``following directions is a
problem, learning a sentence is a problem,'' said teacher Marcia
Golden.
   Teacher Ruth Herzel said the youngsters seem to know
instinctively who really cares about them.
   ``I think they felt he was a person they could trust, who would
not let them down. I don't think he'll prove us wrong,'' she said.
   Hogan warned the students not to take drugs and to stay in
school.
   ``The toughest fight of all is real life,'' he said. ``It's the
adults who sometimes have a hard time with it.''
   He was cheered not only by boys.
   ``I like him too,'' said 9-year-old Monique Burton.
   ``Hulk Hogan does other things besides fighting,'' Quincy Brown
said from the stage. ``He tells kids to stay in school and don't
fight with each other and most of all he says `Don't use drugs.'
   ``Hulk Hogan is a hero to all kids. He's not a hero like
Superman. Hulk Hogan is a very special hero. He's real.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Richard Arrington asked on
Wednesday that a special state prosecutor be appointed to determine
whether federal agents illegally tried to frame him and other black
Birmingham officials.
   ``I have an obligation to try to remove any cloud of suspicion
over this office,'' Arrington said at a news conference.
   The mayor says a developer, Robert Moussalem of suburban
Trussville, told him FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents were
trying to entrap Arrington in a phony land deal.
   Moussalem, who has been charged with bribery, says agents were
after Arrington and other black officials from Alabama's largest
city, including City Council President William Bell, Councilman
Jeff Germany and state Rep. John Rogers. Arrington became
Birmingham's first black mayor in 1980 and is in his third term.
   The mayor released a letter in which he asked Attorney General
Don Siegelman to appoint H. Lewis Gillis of Montgomery, a former
prosecutor, as a special assistant attorney general to look into
the accusations.
   ``This investigation will focus on whether certain persons
engaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy, attempted bribery
and-or obstruction'' of the city's governmental operations, the
letter said.
   Arrington said the city would pay Gillis' expenses but that his
investigation would be independent.
   Requests for the appointment of a particular prosecutor are not
that unusual, said Joy Patterson, a spokeswoman for Siegelman,
adding that the attorney general was not immediately available to
comment.
   U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson has said that Moussalem's
allegations are too absurd to merit comment.
   Arrington's special counsel, Donald Watkins, said Donaldson and
the Justice Department ``have a conflict of interest in this. It
would be a conflict to prosecute Moussalem and use him as a
material witness in another matter.''
   A federal grand jury indicted Moussalem on May 1 on charges that
he tried to bribe undercover agents to call off tax audits and
investigations.
   Arrington released a copy of a Nov. 23 letter from Donaldson to
Moussalem that offered favorable consideration of his criminal
charges in exchange for his cooperation and immunity for any acts
he committed under federal direction.
   ``Unfortunately a number of black elected officials have been
put under a cloud without criminal charges against them,'' Watkins
said. ``We just want to get to the bottom of it and find out what
is going on.''
   He also said that ``there appears to be a concerted effort to
discredit and taint through innuendo certain black officials.''
   Watkins said that ``we want to find out the truth, no matter who
may be affected. Somebody is lying and we need to find out who's
lying.''

   A man accused of leaving his infant son
unattended in a car for two hours has been charged with negligent
homicide in the boy's death.
   Mark Russell Ross, 26, pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor
charge Tuesday and was scheduled for trial Aug. 10.
   Five-month-old Mathew Ross died May 18 of suffocation, the state
medical examiner's office said.
   The child's safety seat tipped over, leaving a strap restricting
his breathing at a time when the temperature was 74 degrees and the
humidity 78 percent, said police Sgt. Bob Hicks.
   According to Hicks, Ross told officers he had left the windows
down on one side when he went into his parents' house, and that the
boy was sleeping when he returned to the car a short time later.
The father told police he found the boy dead the third time he
checked on him.

<HEAD>Time Magazine Apologizes for Ad Featuring Nazi Insignia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time magazine published a full-page apology
Wednesday for an advertisement in its British edition that featured
faded red swastikas and the slogan: ``Poor use of color can ruin
your presentation.''
   The magazine blamed it on ``a lapse,'' while the advertiser and
the ad agency admitted bad judgment and regretted any offense.
   The full-page ad in last week's edition was placed by The
Presentation Co., a London firm that offers expertise in image
enhancement through graphics.
   It showed the kind of microphoned podium used by Nazi leaders to
address crowds, with two large swastikas in the background.
   ``Using inappropriate colors can completely take the edge off an
aggressive presentation,'' the ad said in part, offering to show
``How special effects can excite a flagging audience'' and ``How
symbols can be used to explain ideas.''
   ``We can't promise to get your name in the history books, but it
should find its way into a client's notebook,'' the ad said.
   Miles Johnson, a director of The Presentation Co., said it was
``obviously a terrible error of judgment on behalf of us and our
advertising agency. We wrongly weren't aware of the distress that
it would cause a lot of people.''
   The ad gave the company's telephone number, and Johnson told The
Associated Press he received complaining calls, ``enough for us to
feel that it was offending far too many people.''
   Derek Carstens, of Tilbey and Leeves, the agency that wrote the
ad, said: ``We thought the humor would in fact ridicule the topic.
... The intention was not to offend anybody and insofar we have
offended a section of the community, we are sorry. It was an error
of judgment.'' He said the company received about 14 complaints.
   The ad appeared only in Time International's British edition,
which sells 66,000 copies. The apology, signed ``Time, the weekly
newsmagazine,'' said: ``It understandably offended many readers.
Time maintains strict procedures for acceptance of advertising
materials, but, regrettably, our system failed to prevent the
appearance of the advertisement. We apologize for the lapse.''
   Anita Blandford, in charge of Time's British sales, said the ad
``kind of slipped through the system.'' It arrived late and went
straight to the printer in Holland, she said.
   Like all Time International material, the ad was sent to New
York headquarters for approval, but the reproduction ``didn't
clearly show up the nature of the ad,'' she said.
   In New York, Brian Brown, a spokesman for Time magazine,
confirmed Ms. Blandford's account of what happened. ``The fax had
failed us,'' he said.
   He said once the ``embarrassing'' mistake was discovered, the
company rushed to put an apology in print, and had in fact delayed
the press run so that it might run in the next issue.

<TEXT>
   Syrian shells exploded sporadically
around Christian ports Wednesday, and newspapers reported
beleaguered Christian Gen. Michel Aoun is willing to negotiate with
Arab League mediators.
   An-Nahar, an independent daily, also quoted a right-wing
Christian militia spokesman as threatening to seek non-Arab help if
the Arab League fails to convince Syria to withdraw its 40,000
troops from Lebanon by November.
   Beirut residents, wearied by the continued shelling and lacking
clear directives from the league, are wondering whether they should
relax or brace for another devastating confrontation.
   ``This is no war and no peace. Are they going to fight a
full-scale war again? No one has an answer,'' said Bahjat Daowe, a
bank clerk in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``Like many others, I don't know what to do. Shall I bring my
family back to Beirut or not? I really don't know.''
   About 750,000 Christians and Moslems evacuated the capital and
surrounding mountains during two months of shelling duels that
started March 8 and killed at least 360 people.
   The uncertainty is reflected in a statement of the syndicate of
non-government schools, which said it is ``considering reopening
schools soon.'' It set no date to reopen the schools closed March
14.
   Syrian gunners kept shelling Jounieh and Byblos ports north of
Beirut on Wednesday, violating a cease-fire called by heads of
state from the 22-nation Arab League.
   Police said 20 howitzer shells exploded around the ports before
dawn. No casualties were reported.
   The barrage is a daily routine by Syrian gunners tying to
prevent boats delivering ammunition to Aoun.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said Aoun's gunners did not return the Syrian fire.
   An-Nahar newspaper said Aoun is ``fully prepared'' to cooperate
with a three-member committee named by the Arab League last week
after its summit failed to compromise on a Lebanese peace formula.
   The committee _ King Hassan II of Morocco, Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid _ has six months to
produce a settlement to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   Aoun has welcomed the Arab effort, but An-Nahar quoted an
unidentified spokesman for the Lebanese Forces Christian militia as
saying the summit's outcome was ``a big disappointment for us
because it did not call openly for a Syrian pullout.''
   Arab leaders reportedly want a Syrian withdrawal, but Syria
refused to compromise.
   The Christian militia supports Aoun's ``war of liberation'' to
drive the 40,000 Syrian troops out of Lebanon.
   An-Nahar quoted the militia spokesman as threatening to seek
non-Arab help to force a withdrawal if the committee fails.
   An-Nahar and the leftist daily As-Safir reported that foreign
ministers of Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Morocco met in Rabat,
Morocco, on Tuesday. As-Safir said they discussed establishing a
security committee to supervise implementation of the cease-fire
and monitor ports.
   The present violence broke out after Aoun ordered a blockade of
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias that deflect about $100
million in customs duties from government coffers.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militia reacted by shelling the
Christian enclave with Syrian help.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner: Some Bodies Show `Subtle' Strangulation Signs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A re-examination of the bodies of 19 young women
found dead under similar circumstances since 1986 revealed subtle
evidence suggesting some victims were strangled or suffocated, the
medical examiner said Wednesday.
   Most of the victims were cocaine addicts with a history of
prostitution. All but one were black. Their remains were found in
fields and alleys in a narrow area of Miami and neighboring Dade
County, usually in positions indicating recent sexual activity.
   Police have looked at theories ranging from a serial killer to a
previously unknown toxic cocaine reaction to explain the deaths.
Few of the victims showed signs of injury.
   Many of the remains were too badly decomposed to re-examine
thoroughly, but seven bodies showed ``scanty or subtle evidence not
inconsistent with carefully applied neck pressure,'' Dade County
Medical Examiner Dr. Joseph Davis said in a report.
   ``It is my considered opinion that the repetitive pattern of
body position, location and scene circumstances constitute a
reasonable conclusion as to manner of death _ homicide,'' he
concluded.
   The medical examiner said Dr. Richard Souviron _ a specialist in
forensic odontology who helped convict serial killer Ted Bundy by
matching bite marks on his victims _ found ``minute changes to
indicate mild or moderate pressure to the mouth.''
   Debilitated by drug use, the victims could quickly lose
consciousness without putting up much of a struggle, Davis said.
   John Farrell, chief of the Metro-Dade's Police detective
division, said police have the treated the deaths all along as
potential murders.
   ``There's a lot of this we don't understand and we don't have
the answers,'' Farrell said. ``Davis is saying, `It's my feeling
this is homicide, and I'm the boss.'''
   The detective cautioned that the medical examiner, while
suggesting the women were murdered, ``is not saying that
absolutely.''
   He said police were still looking at the theory that a toxic
cocaine reaction, perhaps in conjunction with sex, caused the
deaths. Investigators have also questioned a rapist, now in jail,
with a history of choking his victims into unconsciousness.
   Farrell emphasized that the deaths were all associated with
``people in crack-house environments'' and said that whatever the
cause, there seemed to be little or no risk to the public.

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra trial of Richard Secord might
not take place until November or later, lawyers and a federal judge
said Wednesday.
   At a hearing, prosecutor Reid Weingarten suggested Nov. 13 as
``a possible trial date, with the court's permission.''
   Chief U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson cautioned that
such a date is ``predicated on no major ... problems'' pertaining
to the use at trial of material that is now classified by the
government.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, said ``there is some potential
for complications'' because the government may be reluctant to
declassify some of the material for use in the courtroom.
   Secord, enlisted by Oliver North to run arms to the Contras, is
accused in two indictments of conspiring, offering and paying
illegal gratuities to North and of covering up Secord's alleged
profits from the Iran-Contra affair.
   The government wants to consolidate the cases, but Secord says
the nine cover-up charges, brought April 7, should be dismissed.
They represent ``prosecutorial vindictiveness,'' Secord said in
court papers.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh wants to
combine them, saying ``proof of the two sets of charges will
entirely overlap.''
   The gratuities counts were brought on March 16, 1988, as part of
a larger indictment accusing Secord of conspiring with North to
defraud the U.S. government by diverting money to the Contras from
secret arms sales to Iran. Also charged with conspiracy and theft
were former national security adviser John Poindexter and Secord
business partner Albert Hakim.
   Due to national security concerns, the prosecution is expected
to abandon the conspiracy and theft counts against Secord.
   Presenting evidence of such charges would entail a significant
amount of now-classified material and for this reason identical
conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed in January against
North.
   ``Hoping to save what is left of the 1988 indictment,'' the
government seeks to combine the ``weak, remaining counts'' with the
new indictment in an ``unfair attempt to create an aura of
wrongdoing about General Secord,'' he said in court papers.

and ancient castles silhouetted atop rugged ridgelines.
   Of course, Bush did not get the standard tour. And for him, it
was free.
   The three-deck Stolzenfels, occasionally used for state dinners,
was redecorated with Persian carpets on indoor decks.
   It was staffed with white-gloved waiters carrying trays of
champagne, wine and beer and hovering over an elaborate buffet.
   With brilliant blue skies, warm weather and friendly crowds
waving from the shores, the trip was a picture-perfect windup to
Bush's 27-hour visit to West Germany.
   The president called it ``an unforgettable day on the Rhine.''
   To make sure the excursion received maximum television and photo
coverage, the White House chartered a second riverboat for
cameramen and photographers who followed Bush's boat. The photo
boat, with a capacity of 1,000 or more, carried only a handful of
people.
   About 300 guests were invited on Bush's boat from political
circles, the arts, social and industrial fields.
   Bush began the trip by receiving a case of local wines from
Petra Mayer, a queen of the wine-growing region.
   He rewarded her with a kiss on the cheek. At the urging of
photographers, and as his wife Barbara watched on, Bush kissed the
young lady again.
   And for good measure, he kissed her a third time. Mrs. Bush
raised her eyes in mock dismay.
   Bush has been ebullient in the wake of the NATO summit in
Brussels, where he won endorsement for his conventional-arms
proposal to the Soviet Union and helped defuse an alliance dispute
over short-range nuclear missiles.
   The two-hour river trip began at Oberwesel, a town which still
retains a medieval appearance and is dominated by the sight of the
1,000-year-old Schonburg Castle. It concluded at Koblenz, an
ancient city where the Moselle River flows into the Rhine.
   As the Stolzenfels plied the river, a male choir serenaded the
Bushes with the legend of the Loreley, the ``wondrous maiden''
whose siren song lured sailors to shipwreck and death.
   The waterway path through the Rhine's deeply-cut valley is one
of Germany's most popular tourist attractions, followed by millions
each year.
   The path is lined with picturesque castles and carefully tended
vineyards clinging to the hillsides.
   Tourists pay about $17 for a trip as long as Bush's, but they
don't get the same VIP attention.
   A cannon salute marked the beginning and end of Bush's ride.
   Two helicopters hovered high overhead throughout the trip and
four police boats doggedly trailed the ship.
   On both shores, a caravan of police cars and troop vehicles
drove slowly to keep pace with Bush's boat.
   At town after town, crowds of people turned out to wave to the
president.
   Concluding the trip at Koblenz, Bush went to the Deutsches Eck,
a world famous ``memorial of German unity'' where he signed the
town book. He said he hoped this week's NATO summit would be viewed
in the future as one of ``historic consequence.''
   From Germany, Bush flew to London for talks with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and a luncheon Thursday with Queen Elizabeth II.

   Chinese-American professionals are joining with
Chinese students in the United States in an effort to raise money
and channel it to protesters in Beijing by way of the black market
and other backdoor routes.
   A full-page ad bearing some 500 names, most of them professors
and other intellectuals, appeared in Tuesday's New York Times,
appealing for donations for the Ad Hoc Committee in Support of the
Chinese Democratic Movement.
   An organizer, Princeton University Professor Ying-Shih Yu, said
the money will go toward such things as setting up a network of
computers, fax machines and copiers and helping the student
protesters put out their own newspapers.
   ``I think they need all kinds of money for good causes, for
pushing the movement further,'' Yu said Tuesday in a telephone
interview from Princeton, N.J.
   He said more than 1,000 people, mostly intellectuals and
businessmen, have joined the fund drive that took out the $45,000
ad. ``This is mostly by American citizens, ethnic Chinese most of
them,'' he said.
   The professor said the campaign, organized at Princeton, expects
to raise about $200,000 and send it to China in cash and checks
with Chinese students and scholars returning to their homeland from
the United States.
   The money will go directly to the students to take advantage of
the black market exchange rate, which is nearly three times the
official rate, Yu said. Otherwise, the government will ``rob the
money out of the students' pockets.''
   ``The black market is not really so black. Everyone uses it.
It's kind of an open secret,'' he said.
   Students in Boston, New York, San Francisco and other cities
also have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the students and
others who have occupied Beijing's central Tiananmen Square for
nearly three weeks to press their demands for democracy. The United
States is host to an estimated 40,000 students from China.
   Yu said he knows of no one who has run afoul of the law in China
for taking money in for protesters. ``Most people have relatives in
the United States that send them money from time to time, and they
take it to the streets,'' he said.
   Other methods will include electronic transfers between
companies doing business in both the United States and China and
transactions carried out in Chinatown storefronts, said Yu, a
professor of history and East Asian studies.
   ``In the states I have guessed we have raised $150,000 from
overseas Chinese students,'' said activist Pei Minxin, a third-year
graduate student at Harvard.
   ``In the Boston area, several universities pooled their
resources together and we collected something like $37,000. Of that
amount about $11,000 has already channeled back in the form of cash
and equipment.''
   The rest will be sent when there is confirmation that the money
has been spent properly, he said Wednesday.
   ``Let's just say the money is being brought in, wired in,
transferred in _ all the ways business gets money into the country
is being copied by us,'' Pei said Wednesday. ``The government would
have to shut down all the international transactions in order to
stop money from being sent in. And that's impossible for them.''
   He said money is being taken in by tourists and other
``good-hearted people,'' none of whom are given large sums so as
not to arouse suspicion with bulging wallets. Pei also said he
knows of no one who has run afoul of Chinese authorities.
   ``They've got to catch people delivering money and even that is
very hard, because we can say he's paying off a debt, it's just a
relative's money,'' Pei said.
   Storefront transactions are routinely used by Chinese to send
gifts home, said Justin Yu, a reporter for the World Journal,
America's largest Chinese language newspaper.
   For example, a person leaves $100 with a storefront operator,
who then has a contact in China deliver the equivalent in Chinese
money out of his own pocket to the intended recipient, the reporter
said. In return, the contact has $100 on deposit outside the
country.
   ``It's illegal activity, but it's not secret in the Chinese
community,'' said Yu, president of the Chinese Language Press Club
in New York. ``Too many people are doing this kind of business. You
just can't stop it anymore.''
   Justin Yu said supporters of the students are also taking
advantage of U.S.-Chinese business links by putting down money for,
say, a fax machine, at an electronics company in America; the
merchandise is picked up at a connected store in China.

<TEXT>
   A new plan to integrate higher education
in Louisiana without closing or merging any colleges puts much of
the burden of success or failure on a single governing board,
officials said Wednesday.
   Replacing four boards with a single, powerful one was pushed by
Gov. Buddy Roemer over the objections of some black leaders who
felt it would be insensitive to needs of students at the state's
two mostly black universities.
   On Tuesday, a special master appointed by three federal judges
to find a way to settle a 15-year-old lawsuit against Louisiana by
the Justice Department submitted his final desegregation proposal
for court approval.
   Paul Verkuil, president of William and Mary College in Virginia,
called for giving the governor power to appoint a 17-member
governing board, subject to state Senate confirmation. Verkuil said
the board should include at least seven blacks, show a geographic
balance, represent all schools and include a student.
   Unlike the state's current Board of Regents, the board would not
share power with boards that oversee the mostly black Southern
University System, the mostly white Louisiana State University
System, and the smaller, regional schools.
   Larry Crain, president of the board overseeing regional
colleges, said it will be up to the unified governing board to
implement Verkuil's plan successfully.
   ``It all depends on how the new board approaches this. If they
follow what's been laid out here it can happen. The state is going
to have to take this very seriously to bring about integration,''
Crain said.
   Sen. William Jefferson, a New Orleans lawyer who represents
Southern University at Baton Rouge, one of the two mostly black
universities, said he had not received a copy of the plan.
   ``I do know the single board has nothing to do with
desegregation, and it seems to be the centerpiece of this plan,''
Jefferson said.
   Thomas Todd of Chicago, attorney for the other predominantly
black college, Grambling State, said he could not comment on the
plan until he received a copy.
   The plan would provide additional money to the mostly black
universities to develop programs more attractive to white students.
It also would establish admission standards to funnel
better-prepared students into selective universities and others
into a new community college system. Currently, any graduate of a
Louisiana high school can attend any state college.
   Jack Andonie, chairman of the LSU Board of Supervisors, said
these changes could advance desegregation somewhat, but ``until
they have some significant merging of some schools, there's not
going to be much integration.''
   The schools that need integrating have to be good and the costs
reasonable to attract students, he said.
   ``If they're not happy, they're simply not going to go to the
schools involved,'' Andonie said.
   ``I don't think this is a cosmetic plan,'' Roemer's attorney,
John Kennedy, said. ``I think you will look on the landscape of
higher education in five years and it will not be the same. The
changes will be fundamental _ quality and desegregation.''

<HEAD>Cancel Tax-Funded Caribbean Cruise for Offenders After Outcry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughoput with cruise canceled.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local politicians, apparently reacting
to public uproar, decided Wednesday not to send a group of teen-age
offenders on a six-month rehabilitation cruise to the Caribbean at
taxpayer expense.
   The social board in the suburb of Kista dropped plans to
participate in the cruise after it received a bomb threat.
   Social commissioner Ragnar Gotestam later announced on TV that
the project had to be canceled because at least two community
social boards had changed their mind about the $80,000 cruise on a
53-foot sailing craft to Saint Lucia and other Caribbean islands.
He said he hoped to pursue the project later.
   Eight teen-agers convicted of crimes such as assault, theft,
burglary and property damage were candidates for the training
cruise. At least three social workers would have accompanied them.
   The program also called for instruction in citizenship, and
authorites had given assurances there would be no chance to escape.
   Sweden's liberal penal system accents rehabilitation rather than
punishment, but it has come under increasing criticism recently as
too lenient.
   The daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet added its voice to those
critics of the cruise.
   ``How could the district social board in unison make a decision
so distant from reason and judgment and with such total lack of
contact with the way ordinary people think?'' it asked in an
editorial.
   Authorities argued the offenders were influenced by their family
background and rough neighborhoods, and that getting away would be
more helpful than harsh punishment.
   None of the eight is serving prison sentences, although they
must report regularly to the authorities. Their behavior was deemed
so bad that no halfway houses would accept them.
   ``These children need love and security,'' said Stockholm Social
Director Ulf Andersson, defending the Caribbean trip for the
youths, who under press regulations have not been identified.
   ``This is not a vacation, but a working trip,'' said Anders
Roxe, who would have escorted them. He told Swedish Radio that 400
convicts had gone through the training program in Swedish waters
and 200 are employed as officers at sea.
   ``People should be happy to get rid of them, and maybe to see
these people being reintegrated into a working life as new men
after six months,'' he said.
   Among the opponents of the cruise program are National Police
Chief Bjorn Eriksson and Youth Minister Margot Wallstrom. They
ridiculed the idea of sending the youths to an area where drugs
abound.
   Last year, a similar public furor forced authorities to scrap
plans to send a convicted criminal on a trip to the Egyptian
pyramids. The authorities had said it would help the convict, who
was about to be released, to readjust to society.
   Swedish prisons have a generous furlough program. After
completing one-third of their sentence, prisoners are eligible for
up to six 48-hour passes a year. The prison service reported 287
violations out of 8,951 furloughs granted in 1987.
   Prisons also have frequent conjugal visits for most inmates.
   The system came under scathing attack when Sweden's most
notorious spy, Stig Bergling, slipped away while on furlough in
1987 and apparently escaped with his wife to the Soviet Union.
   In another experiment, long-term prisoners can spend two-week
vacations relaxing with their families in an unguarded holiday
village in central Sweden, with skiing in winter, hiking in the
woods, or swimming in summer.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, beset by
investigations of alleged ethics violations, has decided to resign
his leadership post and planned to make an announcement to the
House today, sources said.
   ``He told me himself,'' said one House member, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   The lawmaker and other sources who said Wright would resign as
speaker did not say whether he also would give up his House seat.
   Spokesman Mark Johnson would say only that Wright planned to
deliver his speech in the House chamber, and the speech would last
more than half an hour.
   Wright worked alone in his office on the statement throughout
the afternoon, up until minutes before he was to deliver it.
   Wright's resignation has been expected since last week, when his
lawyers entered into several hours of negotiations with the ethics
committee in an attempt to win dismissal of some of the alleged
violations in exchange for the speaker's stepping down.
   Wright himself has consistently denied knowingly violating
ethics rules, but his political support among Democrats in the
House eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically
investigated his finances.
   One of the speaker's staunch defenders said Tuesday the pressure
on Wright to quit appeared overwhelming.
   ``I believe it's probably too late to change things in his
favor,'' said Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas. Although ``justice
would be served by following the game to the end,'' Wilson said, he
expected his friend to step down.
   The heat continued as CBS and The Washington Post, quoting
unidentified sources, said the Justice Department's public
integrity section was launching a ``preliminary criminal
investigation'' of Wright. Justice Department sources have
previously said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings
against Wright but had not decided on a probe of its own.
   Sources also told those two news organizations and The
Associated Press the FBI is looking into allegations of payroll
padding on the staff of Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania,
the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.
   Gray, currently vying to move up in the House leadership, said
after CBS broke the story Tuesday that it was an ``outrageous
lie.'' He said he was questioned by FBI agents Monday but assured
he was not the subject of an investigation.
   The Justice Department declined comment on the report.
   Not waiting for Wright's final decision, some of his own
lieutenants were scrambling to move up in the ranks. The pressure
on Wright and the power game were made all the more intense by the
announcement last weekend that Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the
House Democratic whip, would be resigning. Coelho's resignation
followed reports he earned nearly $7,000 from a junk bond
investment for which he never had to put up any of his own money.
   Wright was charged last month by the House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct with violating House rules in 69
instances.
   The most serious of those involve allegedly accepting improper
gifts _ including a no-work job for his wife _ from a developer
friend, and circumventing House rules on outside income through
bulk sales of his book ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   The speaker has repeatedly insisted that he broke no House rules
or any laws, and he has vowed to fight for the honor of his wife,
who he contends earned her pay.
   The ethics committee was scheduled to meet Thursday to consider
Wright's motion to dismiss those charges. ``I'm convinced our
motions are legally well grounded,'' he said Tuesday.
   Another factor adding pressure on Wright was a continuing ethics
committee probe into areas not covered by its original set of
charges.
   Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the senior Republican on the
committee, said in answer to a question Tuesday that it might
expand its investigation into Wright's investment in a gas well
drilling venture and a deal involving a nursing home company.
   ``It's possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those
two issues,'' Myers said,
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, is in line to succeed
Wright. Foley has no known opposition for the speakership.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., appeared to be the front runner to
replace Foley, D-Wash., if he moved up. Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., was
competing against Gephardt.
   The race to succeed Coelho as Majority Whip was more wide open.
Candidates included Gray, the chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus; Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee; and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
the Chief Deputy Whip. Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., a powerful
member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also was weighing his
support.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Up Strong 2.7 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With Economy Bjt ^By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
rose in April for the second straight month in the biggest increase
since December, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
   The strong 2.7 percent April gain followed a 0.7 percent hike in
March and 1.2 percent and 2 percent declines in January and
February. Orders had soared 4.7 percent in December.
   Total orders registered $239.4 billion on a seasonably adjusted
basis in April.
   Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York, compared the factory orders report
with the Index of Leading Economic Indicators which Commerce also
released on Wednesday.
   Factory orders were ``absolutely surprising,'' he said, while
the indicators showed a slower 0.8 percent increase after falling
for two months.
   ``It means,'' he said, ``the porridge is not too hot, not too
cold and it isn't just right. We're just vacillating between the
two, I think.''
   Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York
said the orders report ``means that in April the economy picked up
from a depressed level in March.
   ``And yet ... orders were not higher in April than in
December.'' Steinberg said. ``So although the industrial sector of
the economy is still advancing, it doesn't have anywhere the kind
of momentum it had in 1988.''
   Commerce said both durable and nondurable orders rose in April,
with durables up 3 percent to $129.2 billion. It said all major
industries expect fabricated metals participated in the increase.
   Electrical machinery orders were up 9.3 percent to $20 billion;
primary metals such as steel up 6 percent to $12.6 billion and
transportation equipment up 1.4 percent to $37.6 billion. The
highly volatile transportation segment was up 11 percent in March
and down 7.6 percent in February.
   Orders for non-durable goods jumped 2.4 percent to $110.2
billion, the department reported. Nearly half the increase was in
the petroleum refining industry.
   The overall increase would have been higher except for a 15.8
percent drop in defense orders which are subject to wide swings
depending on when big contracts are signed.
   Excluding defense, orders rose 3.6 percent after falling 0.3
percent in March and 2.7 percent in February.

<HEAD>North Says Judge Should Set Aside His Convictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North says a judge should set aside his
convictions in the Iran-Contra affair because the prosecution made
critical errors, including failure to show any principal figure
``intended to violate the law.''
   In court papers filed late Tuesday, North said the government
neglected to show that anyone intended to obstruct Congress when
North, in November 1986, assisted in assembling a false chronology
of an arms shipment to Iran.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction, but
``a fundamental requirement of any conviction for aiding and
abetting is that the jury first find a guilty principal,'' the
court papers said.
   The government ``did not demonstrate that any principal intended
to violate the law and to obstruct Congress in November 1986,''
North's lawyers said in their filing in U.S. District Court.
   Former national security adviser John Poindexter is charged with
obstruction and making false statements to Congress in connection
with the chronology. Poindexter is expected to go on trial later
this year.
   The false chronology said no one in the U.S. government knew
until January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to Iran contained
arms. Evidence presented at North's trial showed he and more than a
dozen U.S. officials received intelligence in 1985 detailing the
shipment's contents.
   North also was convicted of altering and destroying official
documents he wrote to national security adviser Robert McFarlane
detailing North's assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   North is scheduled for sentencing June 23.
   In the court papers, North said he should be acquitted because
testimony at the trial showed he wasn't the custodian of the
documents.
   North also was convicted of accepting a $13,800 home security
system from Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord. North, who
lives outside Washington in northern Virginia, said the charge
should have been brought in courts there, rather than in Washington.
   If the court refuses to acquit North, he should be granted a new
trial on the three charges for which he was convicted, he said.
   The former National Security Council aide said U.S. District
Court Judge Gerhard Gesell had given improper instructions to the
jury. Gesell, according to North's lawyers, placed too many
restrictions on North's defense, which was based on the assertion
that all of the actions for which he was charged with crimes were
authorized by his superiors.
   Gesell's instructions ``unconstitutionally limited the jury's
consideration'' of evidence in the case, said North.
   On Wednesday, Secord opposed a prosecution motion to consolidate
two sets of criminal charges against him in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Secord was indicted on March 16, 1988. Among the charges were
conspiring, offering and paying illegal gratuities to North.
   Enlisted by North to run arms to the Contras, Secord also was
indicted April 7 for covering up from Congress his alleged profits
from the Iran and Contra initiatives.
   The government wants to combine charges from the two
indictments, but Secord said in court papers that the latest
indictment reflects ``prosecutorial vindictiveness'' and fails to
state a criminal offense. Secord is seeking to dismiss the new
charges.

<TEXT>
   Sales of semiautomatic weapons boomed in
California as the June 1 deadline for the state's mandatory permit
application drew near, and gun dealers said the meaner-looking the
gun the better the sales.
   Customers bought ``anything that looks ugly, that looks like an
assault weapon ... anything that may look military,'' said Tony
Cucchiara, president of Trader Sports in San Leandro, the state's
largest retail gun dealer.
   Buyers of the weapons included collectors, investors,
``yuppies,'' and others who hoped to escape the more restrictive
buying process going into effect Thursday.
   Most of Cucchiara's customers were older men, and many shoppers
were ``buying the more expensive guns and buying more than one,
putting them away for investment purposes.''
   ``There are people buying these things as souvenirs, too,'' he
said Tuesday. ``Little old men and little old women are walking
into the store, saying they want to buy an AK-47.''
   People who bought an assault weapon before Thursday merely had
to get it registered.
   But beginning June 1, the sale of more than 50 kinds of
semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns is virtually
banned in California by a new law that includes a restrictive
permit process.
   The legislation, and the heightened interest in semiautomatic
weapons, was prompted by a January incident in which a man with an
AK-47, a Soviet-designed assault weapon, attacked a elementary
school playground in Stockton, killing five students and himself.
   Between June 1 and Jan. 1, buyers must submit an application for
a state permit _ similar to one required of movie studios for
machine guns _ that is ``very restrictive,'' said Lynn Montgomery,
an aide to state Assemblyman Mike Roos.
   Possession of a permit is required as of Jan. 1, when the law
banning sales of more than 50 specified semiautomatic rifles,
shotguns and handguns goes into effect.
   People who buy those guns between June 1 and Jan. 1 but are
denied permits must sell their guns to a dealer, a permit holder or
someone living outside the state, Montgomery said. Violators will
be subject to a maximum four-year prison term.
   A man who gave his name only as Barry at B&amp;B Sales in North
Hollywood said most weapons on the restricted list have already
``dried up.''
   Many gun dealers said they expected the last-minute surge of
interest in the weapons and compared the demand to bread and
gasoline shortages.
   ``The public reacts very uniformly,'' said Joe Ellithorpe,
president of Pony Express in Los Angeles. ``They run on anything
they can't get their hands on. That's not unusual. That's a public
nature item.''
   Shop owners said prices also were skyrocketing.
   Carmichael said that when the boom was starting, he got two
AR-15s, the civilian version of the military's M-16, from a
supplier for about $569 each.
   ``I called them back about three weeks later and asked them if
they had any more. They said they still had several AR-15s in stock
and wanted $1,975 wholesale,'' he said.
   Sales have been brisk ever since Gov. George Deukmejian said he
would sign the legislation, said Don Smith, manager at Arms &amp; Ammo
Supply in San Bruno. ``People are feeling a little more rushed. Now
we're selling about 60 to 70 a week. We've been selling 10 guns a
day for the last week.''
   At Fremont Discount Gun, a manager named Gary who declined to
give his last name, said cost distinguishes the gun collector from
others. ``Anyone who goes out and pays $3,000 for a SIG assault
rifle is not going to shoot it. It's like a fine work of art, like
buying a piece of sculpture.''
   Just north in Castro Valley, Combat Arms owner Richard Bash said
his customers have been white-collar professionals ranging from
attorneys to police officers. ``What I'm seeing is the professional
people buying while the buying's still good,'' he said.
   ``One wholesaler brought in 700 (AK-47s) in one day and sold all
of them,'' said George Alger, store gun buyer for Big R Country
West Guns in West Sacramento.
   Bash declined to give numbers on sales, but said he's selling
three times the usual number of semi-automatic weapons. Cucchiara
of Trader Sports said his shop used to sell two or three
semi-automatics each day, and is selling 30 to 40-a-day now.
   At H&amp;H Enterprises in Redwood City, a telephone recording told
Memorial Day weekend callers that the answering machine was on
because business was so good that no one had time to come to the
phone.

   About 2,000 American servicemen
and their families gave President Bush an enthusiastic sendoff from
Rhein Main Air Base on Wednesday, expressing hope that his
disarmament initiatives succeed.
   Bush flew by helicopter to the sprawling Air Force base just six
miles south of Frankfurt on the last stop of his West German visit
before leaving for London.
   The crowd gathered on the tarmac at the airbase cheered,
applauded and waved small American flags when the president arrived.
   First Sgt. Marcelles Sneed, 40, of Millington, Tenn., said he
had followed news of the president's trip closely.
   ``It's been impressive the stand he has taken with (Soviet
President Mikhail) Gorbachev,'' Sneed said. ``He's met the
challenge. I hope it works, but I don't know if I trust the
Russians.''
   Master Sgt. Carlton Bryan, of Cambridge, Md., commenting on
Bush's proposal to reduce U.S. troop strength in Europe, said: ``I
think a lot of people back home will be happy about that.''
   Debbie Barton, 30, of Monticello, Ill., waited for Bush's
arrival with her son Chris, 12, and 9-year-old daughter Amber.
   Mrs. Barton, who said she has been in West Germany for three
years with her husband, Capt. Ron Barton, said she was enthusiastic
about Bush's European trip.
   ``I have high hopes for what he's doing,'' Mrs. Barton said.
   Asked if she also hoped that Gorbachev would respond with
further disarmament initiatives, Mrs. Barton said: ``I think if
they can work together, then we won't be so scared of each other.''
   One of the happiest people was Jeanine Greenwood of Rapid City,
S.D., who waited more than two hours for Bush to arrive, and got to
shake the president's hand.
   What did she say to Bush? ``I said `God bless you' and he said
`Thank you, m'am.'''
   Counting servicemen and family members, about 10,000 Americans
are assigned to Rhein Main Air Base.

   Motorists who parked on a one-way street and
later found that the street direction had been changed _ and that
they had been ticketed for parking the wrong way _ can get their
tickets thrown out.
   The statement came in response to news stories about hapless
motorists who parked on one-way streets near the federal court
building April 19.
   Johnny Miller, a security officer for the federal appeals court,
said he saw parking officers writing tickets before workers even
finished changing the signs.
   Parking against the flow of traffic is a $15 offense in New
Orleans.
   ``Anyone who has already paid a ticket can request a refund from
the administrative hearing office,'' said Tuesday's news release
from Betty Jo Everett, director of the Streets Department.
   Those who haven't paid the ticket yet can have it dismissed by
contacting city officials, she said.

   ``Rambling With Gambling,'' a morning talk show
on which a Gambling named John has been host for 64 years, logged
its 20,000th live broadcast Wednesday on radio station WOR.
   ``And we're going to attempt to keep it going as long as we can,
because it's too much fun to give up,'' John R. Gambling told his
listeners.
   John R., 38, joined his father, John A., as co-host in 1985.
   John A., 59, had taken over the show in 1959 from his father,
John B.
   John B., who died in 1974, was a studio sound engineer who
started it all by chance in September 1925. The host of a morning
calisthenics program couldn't make it and ``Sparks'' Gambling was
pressed into service.
   Under John B., the program evolved from exercise to music and
entertainment.
   ``Then it changed to information and news and moves along pretty
sprightly,'' said John A.
   Among the show's numerous firsts on local air were newscasts,
school closing bulletins, airborne traffic reports and other
listener information services that have become staples of wake-up
radio.
   For show No. 20,000, John R. and John A. set up their studio in
the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of the RCA Building and served
breakfast to 200 fans who won their invitations in a contest.
   The Gamblings maintain that filling 4{ hours of air time five
mornings a week is a snap.
   ``There's usually not enough time,'' said John R. ``Today is a
perfect example. We have hours of tape that we never got to.''
   With lines of well wishers waiting to shake his hand, John R.
said he'd hang around for about an hour, ``then go back to the
studio and start preparing for tomorrow, for 20,001.''

   Venice Beach can remain the ``Skating Capital
of the World.''
   Armed with nearly 2,000 signatures and the support of
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, skating enthusiasts scored a victory in
their ongoing battle with authorities to keep roller skating and
skate boarding legal in Venice Beach.
   The City Council voted 9-1 Tuesday to begin a repeal of the
decade-old ban of the pastime along Ocean Front Walk in the beach
community.
   ``Skating, all right!'' said Harry Perry, a Venice street
musician who attended the council meeting with a guitar slung over
his shoulder, a white turban wrapped around his head, shin guards
and roller skates.
   ``We are the victors!'' he exclaimed.
   ``It's unfair to enforce a law no one was ever told about,'' Ms.
Galanter told her colleagues.
   Perry, who has been skating the boardwalk since 1976, said the
next battle is to give skaters access to bike paths.

<HEAD>US Seeks Extradition of Saudi Arms Dealer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Switzerland received the formal U.S. request
Wednesday for extradition of Adnan Khashoggi, the jailed Saudi
financier and arms dealer accused of helping Ferdinand and Imelda
Marcos plunder the Philippines.
   The American request, accompanied by 243 pages of evidence,
arrived six weeks after police arrested Khashoggi, 54, while he was
having breakfast at a luxury hotel in Bern. The U.S. Embassy had
asked that he be detained.
   A Justice Ministry statement said the Swiss federal police were
studying the extradition request. Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler
said it was too early to tell when a decision would be made.
   Lawyers for Khashoggi said a few days after his arrest April 18
that they would do everything possible to prevent extradition, but
have not taken legal steps to challenge his detention.
   Ralph Zloczower, Khashoggi's Swiss lawyer, was not available
Wednesday night. A secretary at his Bern office said he would have
no comment.
   If Switzerland decides the U.S. charges have legal foundation,
Khashoggi will be granted a hearing, the Justice Ministry said. An
extradition order can be appealed to the Federal Tribunal,
Switzerland's supreme court.
   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank
were indicted in October by a U.S. District Court in New York. The
indictment accuses the ousted president and his wife of stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real
estate and expensive art in New York.
   The U.S. government says Khashoggi posed as owner of some of the
assets as a cover, according to prosecutors.
   Khashoggi is charged in the indictment with racketeering,
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. Racketeering
alone carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
   Swiss authorities said a U.S. diplomatic note asking that
Khashoggi be arrested cited four buildings in Manhattan and a
collection of paintings that disappeared from a Manila museum.
   Pierre Schmid, deputy director of the Swiss federal police, has
said Khashoggi allegedly bought them for his friend Marcos as part
of ``obfuscation maneuvers.''
   Khashoggi is said to have been the main financier and middleman
of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret U.S. arms
sales to Iran where channeled to rebels fighting the leftist
Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union
destroyed a combined 1,269 nuclear missiles during the first year
of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the U.S. officials
said Wednesday.
   The two sides also have conducted a combined 340 inspections to
verify the missile destruction and ensure compliance with other
terms of the treaty.
   ``The past year has been marked by almost continual elimination
of missiles, launchers and related equipment as both sides seek to
implement the primary aim of the INF Treaty,'' Pentagon officials
said in a statement.
   ``Since the first Soviet SS-20 missile destruction at Kapustin
Yar in August, (U.S.) inspectors have witnessed the elimination of
945 Soviet missiles. Beginning with the Sept. 8 elimination at
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, Soviet
inspectors have been present for the destruction of 324 U.S. INF
missiles.''
   The treaty took effect on June 1, 1988, and calls for the
destruction of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles over a
three-year period. Those missiles have a range of roughly 300 miles
to 3,500 miles, and the agreement to destroy them marked the first
time the two superpowers had agreed to eliminate an entire class of
nuclear weapons.
   The agreement also marked the first time the United States and
Soviet Union ever agreed to on-site, or ``intrusive,'' inspections
to ensure compliance with an arms treaty.
   When the treaty took effect, the Soviets had 1,846 missiles in
the intermediate-range category, divided among six different types.
The United States had 846 missiles, divided between Pershing and
ground-launched cruise missiles.
   According to the yearend statistics, which were compiled by the
Defense Department's On-Site Inspection Agency, both sides
exercised their right to conduct 20 surprise inspections during the
first year, in addition to the normal inspections to witness
destruction of missiles and to verify the final closure of INF
missile facilities.
   The Soviets conducted 96 inspections during the year in Western
Europe and the United States, compared to 244 conducted by American
inspectors at Soviet sites.
   Both sides also succeeded during the first year in moving an
inspection team from the other country into permanent housing
facilities near missile plants. The treaty specifies that up to 30
inspectors may be located full-time outside the gates of a missile
production plant to guard against surreptious production of INF
missiles.
   In the case of the Soviets, they were provided housing
facilities in West Jordan, Utah, on April 17, near a Hercules plant
at Magna, Utah. American inspectors moved into permanent housing in
Votkinsk, near a missile plant, on April 10.

<TEXT>
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders failed
in nine months of talks to agree on reunifying the divided island
before a Thursday deadline, and the United Nations granted a
three-week extension.
   Officials said it was likely the U.N. Security Council would be
called in to mediate the deadlocked negotiations.
   Leaders of both communities are trying to establish a formula
for a two-state federation under which the Greek Cypriot majority
of 550,000 people would share power with the 120,000-member Turkish
Cypriot minority. The Greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong
federal government, while the Turkish side wants a looser
federation.
   The two sides reportedly also disagree over the withdrawal of
Turkish troops, and the right of 200,000 Greek Cypriots to return
to property they fled after the 1974 Turkish invasion.
   Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, president of the
breakaway state in north Cyprus that is recognized only by Turkey,
said he would intensify efforts for international recognition if
the talks break off.
   ``The talks prevented our recognition by friends. Once they are
broken off, there will be no obstacles to our recognition,''
Denktash said.
   Greek Cypriot leader George Vassiliou, president of the
internationally recognized government of Cyprus, blamed Turkish
intransigence for the lack of progress.
   ``We have submitted comprehensive proposals for the solution of
all aspects of the Cyprus problem,'' Vassiliou said Tuesday.
``World opinion agrees that our proposals are honorable, reasonable
and can lead to an agreement.''
   Vassiliou said he favors mediation by the Security Council,
while Denktash does not.
   In 1974, a coup by Greece's military junta failed on the island.
Turkey invaded the northern part of Cyprus, saying it was
protecting the minority Turkish Cypriot community and partitioned
the east Mediterranean island.
   In the wake of the invasion, 40,000 Turkish Cypriots also moved
north, taking over the homes and properties of the Greek Cypriot
refugees. Other property was given to an estimated 50,000 settlers
brought to Cyprus from the Turkish mainland.
   Denktash in 1975 proclaimed the northern part of the island an
independent Turkish state.
   The two sides are divided by a heavily fortified ``Green Line''
manned by 13,000 Greek Cypriot troops facing an estimated 30,000
Turkish army soldiers and 10,000 Turkish Cypriot soldiers.
   The buffer zone extending 112 miles across the island is
patrolled by a 2,100-member United Nations peacekeeping force.
   The two Cypriot leaders agreed on the Thursday deadline when
they embarked on their negotiations during a meeting with Perez de
Cuellar in Geneva in August.

<HEAD>Mother Who Reported Two Babies Abducted Is Indicted in 1986 Infant
Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who said masked gunmen abducted
her two baby girls nearly three years apart was indicted Wednesday
on charges of concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in the
1986 death of one daughter.
   The grand jury indictment charged Paula Sims of Alton with
concealing a homicide and three counts of obstructing justice in
the death of 13-day-old Loralei Sims.
   Investigators have said the disappearance and death in late
April of the Sims' second daughter, 6-week-old Heather, renewed
interest in the earlier case.
   No charges have been filed in Heather's death, which came after
Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, moved to neighboring Madison
County, where an investigation is under way.
   Jersey County State's Attorney Richard Ringhausen brought the
charges against Mrs. Sims in Loralei's death earlier this month,
then presented evidence and witnesses to the grand jury.
   Donald Groshong, attorney for the Simses, would not comment on
the indictment.
   Mrs. Sims remains free on a $10,000 cash bond and no court date
has been set.
   By asking a grand jury, rather than a judge in open court, to
bring the case to trial, Ringhausen was able to keep secret
information from the pending Madison County investigation, he said.
   In 1987, the couple claimed Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination and refused to testify before a Jersey County
grand jury that conducted an earlier investigation into Loralei's
death.
   That grand jury returned no indictments and the case remained
open.
   Robert Sims, 37, told police last month he suspected his
29-year-old wife may have killed both babies accidentally,
investigators have said.
   In each case, Mrs. Sims said a masked gunman took her baby girl
while her husband was at work.
   Loralei was reported abducted in June 1986. Her body was
discovered a week later in a wooded area about 150 yards from the
Simses' home.
   Heather was reported abducted on April 29. Her body was
discovered four days later in a trash can in West Alton, Mo.,
across the Mississippi River from Alton.
   A third Sims child, a 16-month-old boy, has been in the custody
of the Department of Children and Family Services since shortly
after Heather's disappearance.

<HEAD>Survey Says Israelis Favor Affirmative Action for Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most Israelis favor affirmative action for
women, tax breaks for child care, and a longer school day to allow
more mothers to work full time, according to preliminary results of
a survey conducted Wednesday.
   The informal survey, described by Israel Radio as the most
extensive done in Israel, was organized by Naamat, the women's
organization of the Histadrut Trade Union Federation.
   The goal was to demonstrate to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
government and the public that there is strong support for Naamat's
campaign for greater economic rights for women.
   While the level of education of Israeli women is comparable to
that in other developed countries, the women's movement has not won
the same support here as in the United States and Europe.
   Ethia Simcha, the prime minister's adviser on the status of
women, noted that 51 percent of all government workers are women,
but only 11 percent hold management jobs. Only 2 percent of all
government-run companies are headed by women, Ms. Simcha said.
   ``There is not enough consciousness about women's rights in this
country,'' said Naamat spokeswoman Carmel Eytan. ``One of the aims
of the poll is to raise public debate on these questions.''
   Ms. Eytan said more than 500,000 surveys were turned in, about
one-third of them by men.
   She said according to results based on about half the survey
responses:
   _ Ninety percent support extending the school day past 2 p.m. so
more mothers may work full time.
   _ Seventy-four percent approve of tax breaks for child care.
   _ Seventy-five percent support changes in the tax law that would
allow women to file separate returns.
   _ Only about two-thirds of the respondents support affirmative
actions programs for women.
   ``Most people against were men,'' she added.
   Israeli women and men lined up at about 2,000 sites set up in
banks, day care centers, supermarkets and on sidewalks across the
country to take part in the survey.
   At a busy intersection near a Tel Aviv shopping center,
organizers set up a cardboard box on the pavement. In a 15-minute
period, about 40 people dropped off questionnaires.
   ``I'm really surprised by the number of people voting. I don't
know what I'll do when our box is full,'' said a Naamat volunteer.
   Ms. Eytan said she hoped that several hundred thousand Israelis
over 18 would participate in the survey. Israel has a population of
4.2 million.

   An 8-month-old boy who was shot in the head by
Israeli soldiers lay unconscious in a hospital Wednesday, suffering
from severe brain damage and breathing through a respirator.
   The shooting highlighted the dispute between Palestinians who
say troops fire at demonstrators without regard for innocents, and
Israeli officials who say women and children are put in the front
lines to serve as shields and win publicity for the Palestinian
uprising.
   The army confirmed that the infant, Mohammed Hamdan Kassem, was
shot by troops in the West Bank refugee camp of Tulkarem on
Tuesday. It said the incident was under investigation.
   Arab reporters said clashes occurred at the camp on Tuesday
night following a march, and that several people were wounded.
   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted Palestinian sources as
saying Mohammed was struck when his mother, Samira Kassem,
participated in the march with the boy in her arms.
   Mrs. Kassem said she was carrying the child down an alley when
he was hit by a stray bullet. She said she did not see any clashes
at the time.
   ``I felt blood on his head. The soldiers were about 100 yards
away at the end of the street. I shouted `He was hit, he was hit,'
and then I ran away,'' she said.
   Mrs. Kassem, 23, was slumped on a bed outside her son's room at
Mukassed Hospital in Jerusalem. Inside, Mohammed lay unconscious,
the left side of his head covered by a bandage and the right side
of his body paralyzed.
   He kicked with his left foot as a nurse cleared his nasal
passage.
   ``He suffered severe brain damage. We removed a large portion of
contused brain tissue. If he survives, he will have all kinds of
disabilities,'' said Dr. Wahib Dajani, chief anesthesiologist in
the intensive care unit.
   He displayed the tip of a plastic bullet that pierced the
child's brain and was removed from his skull.
   Dajani said Mohammed was the youngest victim of the Palestinian
uprising to be treated at the hospital. He said the average age of
shooting victims has decreased in recent months, and that more and
more children and teen-agers were among the wounded.
   The shooting of Mohammed renewed the debate over the army's
firing practices during the nearly 18-month-old rebellion against
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The uprising has claimed 502 Palestinian lives. Twenty-two
Israelis also have been killed.
   The Palestinian-run Human Rights Information Center said 34 Arab
children under 5 have been killed by troops during the uprising,
including 29 who died from tear gas inhalation and three who were
shot to death.
   Palestinians and human rights activists argue that troops fire
wildly to break up protests, often hitting bystanders that include
young children.
   The wounding of Mohammed ``undoubtedly resulted from the army's
indiscriminate shooting,'' said Fayez Abu Rahme, a Palestinian
lawyer and PLO supporter from Gaza City.
   A senior army official blamed PLO activists for making ``cynical
use of children'' in demonstrations.
   ``By getting children killed, you get more publicity and that
keeps the uprising alive, which is what the inciters want. What
better way is there than to get a child killed every day?'' said
Col. Ranaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman.
   He said young children were ``used as shields'' also to protect
adult activists, especially when plastic bullets are fired at the
knees of demonstrators.
   ``The responsibility for the children being there is that of the
parents and the activists,'' he said.
   Gissin said that in some cases women and children were wounded
while walking near the scenes of clashes, but that the number of
such cases was ``minuscule when compared to the pattern of using
children on purpose.''
   Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian intellectual and
politican in Jerusalem, rejected the claim that children were used
as shields.
   ``There is no way someone is sending children to protect
himself. It is just propaganda coming from people who think they
have more human feelings than we do,'' he said.
   Under army regulations, soldiers are barred from firing plastic
bullets at children under age 16.
   Yossi Sarid, a liberal member of parliament, said that while
Palestinians had used children as propaganda instruments, the army
in many instances had disregarded standing orders on opening fire.
   ``This is the tragedy, that the children have to pay for the
blindness and stupidity of their elders,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Family Ties'' star Michael J. Fox and his
actress-wife, Tracy Pollan, became parents with the birth of a boy,
his publicist said Wednesday.
   Sam Michael Fox was born Tuesday afternoon, publicist Nancy
Ryder said. The exact time, location and birth weight weren't
disclosed.
   ``They are doing fine,'' Ms. Ryder said.
   Fox, 27, and Miss Pollan, 28, were married at an inn in
Arlington, Vt., in July 1988 with tight security guarding their
privacy from helicopter-borne photographers and reporters.
   Miss Pollan played the college-age artist girlfriend to Fox's
insufferably conservative Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties,'' for which
he won two Emmys. The high-rated TV series called it quits this
month after a seven-year run on NBC, but continues in reruns.
   Fox and Miss Pollan also starred in the film ``Bright Lights,
Big City.'' Fox rocketed to fame when he starred in the 1985 movie
``Back to the Future.'' He co-stars with Sean Penn in the upcoming
film ``Casualties of War.''
   Fox has been pestered by a woman accused of sending more than
5,000 letters threatening him, his wife and child with death.
   Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, has been charged with five counts of
making terrorist threats and faces Superior Court arraignment
Monday in Los Angeles. She was being held without bail.

   Leftist rebels paralyzed public
transportation Wednesday and said they would make this Central
American nation ungovernable on the eve of the inauguration of a
rightist president.
   Alfredo Cristiani of the right-wing Republican National
Alliance, also known as Arena, takes office Thursday in El
Salvador's first transfer of power from one elected president to
another.
   But Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels called on
the nation's 5.5 million citizens to boycott public transportation
for an indefinite period starting Wednesday. There was no urban or
inter-city bus service on the ban's first day, dispatchers said.
   Troops in the capital seized a large cache of weapons blonging
to the rebels who have waged a nine-year civil war against the
government, police said in a communique. The seizure netted more
than 350 Soviet-made rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite and more than
1.5 million bullets, police said.
   Cristiani, 41, a businessman and coffee grower, was elected on
March 19 in an election with the lowest voter turnout in a decade.
The low turnout was partly attributed to a rebel transport boycott,
and many said the rebel action cost the centrist candidate the
election.
   The transport ban has been a favorite tactic of rebels, who
threaten to shoot at or set fire to cars or buses found on the
roads. Five traffic bans were enforced last year.
   Wednesday's boycott paralyzed all collective and cargo
transporation nationwide.
   ``There is nothing. No buses have left and the terminal is
empty,'' said a dispatcher in one of San Salvador's bus terminals.
``We are 100 percent paralyzed. The companies are stopped because
nobody wants their equipment destroyed,'' the dispatcher said.
   Guerrillas have been bombing power lines and utility poles
nightly.
   The military has mounted a security operation for the election
that includes air and land surveillance patrols nationwide.
   According to the armed forces public information office, seven
guerrillas have died and eight government soldiers have been
injured in incidents around the country since Tuesday. The rebel
radio station, Venceremos, said guerrillas killed eight soldiers
and wounded 22, but did not list figures for its own fighters.
   Three Central American leaders are scheduled to be among 36
countries sending delegations to Thursday's inauguration. The
Foreign Ministry said the Central American presidents attending
would be Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, Jose Azcona of Honduras and
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, 63, who is dying of liver
cancer, will be the first elected Salvadoran president to hand
power to another elected civilian.
   Cristiani's first task in his five-year term will be to convince
the political opposition and international community that he is in
charge. Arena opponents and even some party regulars say that
Cristiani is a front for business interests. They also express
concern about his party's connection to right-wing death squads.
   Arena was founded in 1981 by a cashiered army major and alleged
death-squad leader, Roberto d'Aubisson, who still is considered the
party's leader. The party has been linked to death squads which are
blamed for up to half the 70,000 deaths in the civil war.
D'Aubisson and Arena deny any connection to the death squads.
   But the U.S. has decided to continue supporting the Salvadoran
government unless death squad activity, which has lessened in
recent years, resumes in full force. The United States pumps more
than $1 million daily into El Salvador in economic and military
aide.

Wednesday.
   With husband Danny Keough at her side, Lisa Marie Presley, 21,
delivered a 7-pound, 2-ounce girl in a natural childbirth at 8:15
p.m. Monday, said publicist Paul Bloch. The child hasn't been

   ``Both mother and child are in excellent health,'' Bloch said,
adding that actress Priscilla Beaulieu Presley, now a grandmother,

   A woman who claimed to be the wife of NBC
talk show host David Letterman and repeatedly broke into his house
has pleaded guilty to trepassing charges and agreed to stay away
from him.
   As part of a plea bargain arrangement, a Norwalk judge Tuesday
sentenced Margaret Ray, 37, to a one-year suspended sentence and
three years' probation.
   The judge ordered Ray released from a state mental hospital,
where she had been confined since April, after being found
incompetent to stand trial.
   As a condition of probation, Ray must stay away from Letterman
and continue to undergo psychiatric treatment, Assistant State's
Attorney Robert G. Hall Jr. said. He said he believes Ray is
returning home to Crawford, Colo.
   Ray was arrested in June 1988 when she tried to pass herself off
as Letterman's wife after she was stopped while driving his
Porsche. Police said they later discovered someone had broken into
Letterman's home and had been living there for several days while
Letterman was out of town.

   A private judge has been hired to consider a
settlement offer in the palimony lawsuit filed by actress Sondra
Locke against movie tough guy Clint Eastwood, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   Neither side has disclosed the name of the judge or where the
closed hearing will be held, but the Los Angeles Times said
attorneys for the stars were to go before the judge Wednesday.
   Miss Locke, who was Eastwood's companion for 13 years while
legally married to another man, offered a settlement that included
a Bel-Air home the couple shared; a Hollywood Hills house Eastwood
was said to have bought for Miss Locke and her husband, sculptor
Gordon Anderson; monthly payments of as much as $15,000 for the
next seven years, and a $250,000 one-time payment.
   Eastwood rejected the offer, but it will likely be discussed in
a hearing, the newspaper reported.
   Since the wait for trial in civil lawsuits filed in Los Angeles
County is routinely three to five years, many litigants are turning
to private arbitration or to rent-a-judge firms. The wait for a
judge is about a month and many disputes are settled in a matter of
hours. Also for those seeking to keep their trial proceedings
secret, the news media can be barred from rent-a-judge courtrooms
if both parties agree.

   When tennis pro Ivan Lendl isn't collecting Grand
Slam titles and trophies, he's busy collecting the works of an
artist of the Belle Epoque famous for posters and packaging.
   Taking time away from the French Open tennis tournament, the
world's No. 1-ranked player toured the Musee de la Publicite, where
more than 100 works by Alphonse Mucha from Lendl's personal
collection are on display through July 17.
   ``The drawings are beautiful, but the colors are fascinating,
especially the red,'' said Lendl.
   The show also features a glimpse of Lendl relaxing at home.
Every wall of his 15-room Connecticut mansion is decorated with a
Mucha poster, painting, calendar or package wrapping, even in the
bathrooms.
   Like Lendl, Mucha was born in Czechoslovakia. The graphic
artist, who died in 1939, is best known for distinctive designs of
sweet-faced girls with flowing tresses that graced objects from
cookie jars to perfume atomizers.

<HEAD>IMF Chief Calls on Banks to Share Debt Reduction Burden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial banks must do more soon to help
Third World countries reduce their debts, the head of the
International Monetary Fund said Wednesday in echoing comments of
the Bush administration.
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, in some of his toughest
comments on the subject, told a gathering of bankers in Paris that
``the time has come for the large internatinal banks to increase
their contribution'' to the debt reduction program unveiled by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   ``It is urgent to set the strategy in motion without delay,''
Camdessus said in a speech to the French Bankers Association. The
text of his remarks was released in Washington.
   The Brady plan encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion
of their loans to heavily indebted countries such as Mexico in
return for guarantees that the rest will be repaid.
   Those guarantees are to be furnished by the IMF and its sister
international lending agency, the World Bank.
   Camdessus said that lengthy negotiations between commerical
banks and the debtor countries over terms would jeopardize the
whole strategy, given the perilous economic conditions facing many
of the debtor countries.
   Camdessus' remarks echoed statments made last week by Treasury
Undersecretary David C. Mulford, who blamed the slow pace in
getting the debt reduction effort under way on foot-dragging by the
banks.
   If the banks fail to cooperate, Mulford said, they could face
the grim prospect that the debtor nations might decide to stop
paying on their loans. An impasse between the banks and debtor
nations could trigger a ``legislated or mandated solution to the
problem that may be very much more unpleasant'' for the banks,
Mulford warned.
   Commercial banks have complained that they can't accept major
reductions in principal and interest payments because they are not
being offered sufficient financial incentives to do so by the IMF
and the World Bank.
   But in his Paris speech, Camdessus said that the banks needed to
give up the ``illusion'' that delay in reaching agreement on debt
reduction proposals being made by the heavily indebted countries
will force an increase in the amount the IMF and other public
agencies are willing to contribute toward debt reduction.
   The IMF is ``not equipped to do more,'' Camdessus said, adding
that for the Brady approach to succeed it would need equal efforts
on the part of creditor and debtor countries, the commercial banks
and the international lending organizations such as the IMF.
   ``Each of the four partners must reconsider its methods and its
contribution to the common goal,'' he said. ``We shall not succeed
if any one of these parties chooses to skimp on its contribution or
hopes to obtain from any of the other three a reduction of its fair
share of the burden.''
   Major commercial banks are preparing for a meeting in Madrid on
June 7 where they hope to learn more details about what government
incentives they can expect if they agree to write off a portion of
the $1.2 trillion in Third World debt.
   The sessions will be attended by Brady, Camdessus and E. Gerald
Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What may be one of the best jobs on the East Coast
was uncovered recently when Boston Edison Co. sought a rate
increase: Budget documents revealed the chairman's chauffeur is
paid $60,000 a year.
   Not even Donald Trump's driver makes that much, and he's been
with the real estate tycoon for 10 years, an aide said Wednesday.
   The chauffeur's salary is among the $185,000 that the utility
spent last year to provide company officials with cars and
chauffeurs.
   News of the expenditures comes as the company seeks an $85
million rate increase, or about $50 more per year from its
customers.
   ``It's baffling how a company can cry poor and then take part in
such wasteful spending and fancy perks,'' said Joseph Kriesberg,
director of the Citizens for Safe Energy, which is fighting the
increase.
   ``For them to ask families, some of whom are struggling to make
ends meet, to fork over an extra $50 a year to keep people who are
making $300,000 salaries in expensive cars and drivers is just
inappropriate.''
   The $60,177 income earned by the chauffeur for Boston Edison
chairman and chief executive officer Stephen J. Sweeney is well
above the salaries of most limousine drivers, according to Boston
limousine companies.
   ``For a regular driver? That does seem a little high,'' said
Mario D'Angelo of Mystic Valley Limousines, where drivers are paid
between $6 and $7 an hour and make the rest of their money in tips.
   ``That's absurd,'' said Trump's executive assistant, Norma
Foerderer. ``If a driver made half that, it would be considered
good. I'd be willing to be a driver.'' Even Trump's chauffeur makes
less than $30,000, she said.
   Edison defended the expenditures as executive compensation and
said they were in line with industry standards. ``And the fact is,
this is the first rate increase for the company in five years,''
said spokesman Mike Monahan.
   Sweeney, who earns $307,500 per year, is furnished with a
$24,646 Cadillac as well as a driver, according to budget documents.
   Edison spokesman Mike Spataro said the $60,177 is both salary
and overtime, but he would not give a breakdown. He would not
identify the chauffeur.

   The United States is waiving visa requirements
for businessmen and tourists from France, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland, the State Department said Wednesday.
   During visits this week to Italy and West Germany, President
Bush announced similar visa waivers for those countries.
   The waiver plan is part of a pilot program mandated by Congress
which will last until 1990. It went into effect in 1988 with
waivers for non-immigrants from Great Britain and Japan.
   Boucher said the selection of countries was based on the large
number of visa applicants and the low rate of denials.
   He said France has decided to waive visa requirements for
visiting tourists and businessmen from the United States. It was
not clear which of the other countries participating in the program
require visas for Americans.

<TEXT>
   The newly appointed premier Wednesday
named three Cabinet ministers and fired four in a minor government
shake-up, the ruling Nationalist Party said.
   The new 25-member Cabinet will be sworn in Thursday, officials
said.
   Lee Huan on Tuesday replaced 75-year-old Yu Kuo-hwa as Taiwan's
premier. Yu, who was premier for five years, was criticized for his
cautious approach to the country's economic and political troubles.
He had been considered a political liability in upcoming
parliamentary elections.
   Lee made only minor changes in the Cabinet because he helped
groom many of the incumbent ministers as ruling party
secretary-general, officals said.
   Clement Chang, speaker of the Taipei City Council, was named
minister of communications. He replaces Kuo Nan-hung who was made a
minister without portfolio.
   The new premier also fired two ministers without portfolios, Kao
Yu-shu, and Shen Chun-shan, and named law professor Chang Chien-han
to fill one of the vacancies. The second post was not filled.
   Lee's Cabinet changes were unanimously approved by both
President Lee Teng-hui and by the Nationalist Party's policy-making
committee. The party also appointed James Soong, 47, to succeed Lee
as secretary-general.
   Lee, 72, was secretary-general of the Nationalist Party from
1987 until his appointment as premier. His reformist approach is
popular with the public, and party officials expect this to benefit
the Nationalists in December elections.
   Professor Chang Ling-chen, a political scientist at National
Taiwan University, said Lee can be expected to respond to public
demands for a clearcut policy toward mainland China, and tackle
Taiwan's worsening labor, pollution and economic problems.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war on mainland China, claim they are the legitimate rulers
of all China.
   They have rejected any official contacts with the Chinese
Communists, but two years ago adopted a more lenient policy that
has permitted Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade
through third countries.

   Nervous and bitter shop owners
cleaned debris from their looted businesses Wednesday and
complained the thieves included many of their customers.
   The owners of a supermarket in the capital's Moreno suburb
retaliated and killed two looters when they opened fire Wednesday
on a crowd trying to ransack their shop. The independent news
agency Diarios y Noticias reported the shootings and said police
have arrested the shop owners.
   ``It makes me mad,'' said the owner of ``Dorita'' neighborhood
grocery in San Miguel, a northwestern suburb of Buenos Aires.
   The looters ``took everything and a lot of them were former
customers of mine,'' added the shopkeeper, a Spanish immigrant who
refused to give his name.
   ``Someday I'll have to reopen my business, and if I complain too
much they may take reprisals against me,'' he said, looking at the
broken windows, bent metal shutters and empty shelves.
   Only a clock on the wall was left inside the shop.
   San Miguel, a largely middle-class neighborhood partially
surrounded by slum areas, was the scene of some of Tuesday night's
worst violence.
   Hundreds of rioters, many of them slum-dwellers, ran through the
streets battling outnumbered police, breaking windows and sacking
markets, shoe stores and sporting goods shops.
   Police and armed civilians filled the main streets Wednesday.
The civilians refused to speak to reporters but appeared to be
guards hired by shop owners.
   ``Give us food or we'll break everything,'' a poorly dressed
youth shouted outside a market guarded by three uniformed police
and two armed civilians. The owner peered nervously around the door.
   In the only violence reported in the suburb Wednesday, about 200
people looted a small main street butchery.
   ``They took everything, even the bones,'' said the owner, who
also refused to identify himself for fear of reprisals.
   ``First about 30 people came to the shop, and while we were
talking they pushed me aside and ran inside, followed by a lot
more,'' he said.
   He claimed to have seen agitators who told the looters ``to be
calm, that there was enough for everyone and if there wasn't
sufficient meat to go around they would go someplace else.''
   Cesar Melville, owner of a small market, pushed a broom across
the littered floor of his business, aided by seven employees.
   ``They took everything, my friend, even the cash register and a
broken chair,'' he said in an interview.
   ``I asked them to just take the food, but they grabbed clothing,
wine and coffee.
   ``It's a good thing my dog wasn't here, or they would have taken
him too.''
   More than 100 persons were milling near a street which links San
Miguel with neighboring Castelar, where rioting and looting also
occurred Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Senate Leader Calls For Waiver On US-Soviet Trade Limitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell called
on President Bush on Wednesday to waive for a year a provision
limiting U.S.-Soviet trade.
   Mitchell also said Bush should consider permitting Soviet entry
into international economic organizations under specified
conditions.
   ``We should clearly indicate that if the Soviet Union will play
by the rules, we will welcome it into the game,'' Mitchell said.
   The majority leader told the Senate that the president, by his
proposal this week for mutual cuts in U.S. and Soviet forces in
Europe, took a major step to address the apparently changed nature
of Soviet communism under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He called for a comprehensive American and NATO strategy to
``seize upon change within the Soviet Union in order to enhance
Western security.''
   ``Changing circumstances require clear direction and not just a
reactive or improvised course of action,'' Mitchell said.
   He said that a symbolic but important first step would be for
Bush to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment which was imposed in 1974
to prohibit U.S. trade concessions until Moscow permits free
immigration of Jews and other minority groups.
   The legislation was sponsored by the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio.
   Addressing himself to the president, Mitchell said: ``I urge him
to use his authority to waive Jackson-Vanik for a year, thereby
helping to normalize economic relations and expand the
possibilities for trade.''
   He noted that Soviet emigration is rising and that the Soviet
government is moving toward legal changes to institutionalize free
emigration.
   ``Now is an appropriate time for the United States to respond to
change we have sought for more than a decade,'' Mitchell said. ``We
can affirm and encourage further openness within the Soviet Union.''
   Mitchell said Bush should build on that step by stating plainly
that if the Soviet Union is able to decentralize its economy and
institute market mechanisms, ``then the United States would look
positively upon Soviet entry into Western economic organizations,''
including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
   Mitchell also said the administration should move quickly in
negotiations aimed at achieving deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms.
   ``It would be a great loss if we failed to capitalize on the
opportunity to reduce the far larger strategic arsenals and to
stabilize the nuclear balance,'' Mitchell said.

   The Department of Health and Human Services
gave a tepid reception Wednesday to bills aimed at helping to
alleviate the nursing shortage by allowing nurses from other
countries to remain in the United States after their visas expire.
   ``It is unclear to us how much benefit will be gained by the
various immigration proposals that are before this committee,'' Dr.
J. Jarrett Clinton told members of the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law.
Clinton is director of the department's bureau of health
professions.
   The subcommittee was hearing testimony on a bill introduced by
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that would create a new visa category
for foreign nurses whose visas are on the brink of expiring. The
subcommittee was also looking into portions of a broader bill
introduced by Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   Schumer said he was worried about thousands of Filipino nurses
in New York City hospitals. Many hold visas which allowed them to
stay in the country for five years. Last year, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service extended those visas for one more year but
Schumer's bill would create a new immigration category to enable
the nurses to become U.S. residents.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., subcommittee chairman, pressured
Clinton to outline the administration's policy on these nurses,
noting that the department sent a representative to the hearing
with great reluctance.
   ``We're not seeing the leadership we need,'' Morrison said. ``We
would like to know more about where HHS is going in the overall
planning and ... what role foreign nurses play in the long run, so
that our immigration policy can be integrated with other policies.''
   But Clinton downplayed the problem of foreign nurses, noting
that of some 1.6 million registered nurses working in the United
States, perhaps 16,000 are working under visas like those of the
New York City nurses.
   ``It looks to me like less than 1 percent, and we have to decide
whether it's worth the energy it takes,'' he said.
   James Puleo, assistant commissioner of adjudications and
nationality in the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said his
agency found the Schumer bill ``too generous in its requirements
for special immigrant status.''
   Stephen H. Cooper, vice president of the Hospital Association of
New York State, said Schumer's bill ``is important to American
nurses.''
   ``Without foreign nurses, our already over-extended nurses would
be unable to cope,'' he said in prepared remarks.

<HEAD>Israeli Warplanes Raid Targets in South Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes attacked south Lebanon
bases of Palestinian guerrillas and a pro-Iranian militia Wednesday
in response to increased guerrilla activity in the border area.
   Police said four jets fired six rockets at a cluster of
Palestinian bases east of Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon at 7 p.m.
   A two-story command post used by three radical guerrilla
factions was demolished, they said, and at least five guerrillas
were missing and presumed dead. Nine guerrillas were wounded, the
police reported.
   Six F-4 fighter-bombers fired eight rockets at bases of the
pro-Iranian Shiite militia Hezbollah in the Bekaa Valley of
southeast Lebanon at 7:15 p.m., according to the police report.
   A spokesman said Hezbollah's headquarters in Suhmor village east
of Mashgara was destroyed, along with a nearby ammunition dump and
a garage used to repair guerrilla vehicles.
   He said several Israeli helicopter gunships hovered over the
bases near Sidon more than two hours after the raid.
   ``They dropped parachute flares that lit the night sky as
guerrillas were searching with torchlights for the missing victims
under the rubble,'' he said. ``We don't know if the helicopters
also bombed.''
   The Israeli air raids were the fifth and sixth inside Lebanon
this year. By police count, six people were killed and 45 wounded
in the four previous attacks.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army command said the jets hit ``two
terrorist targets,'' east of Sidon and east of Mashgara in the
Bekaa.
   It described the targets as ``headquarters and ammunition dumps
of Hezbollah and Abu Nidal'' at which infiltrations were planned.
   Lebanese police said the bases east of Sidon belonged to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Fatah
Revolutionary Council led by terrorist Abu Nidal and the Palestine
Liberation Front.
   The three organizations have joint bases in hills facing
positions of the Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army militia in
Kfar Falous, six miles east of Sidon, the spokesman said. The
militia helps patrol the ``security zone'' Israel maintains on
Lebanese territory just north of its border.
   An Israeli army spokesman said earlier that Israeli troops shot
and killed three guerrillas near the Lebanese village of Hula,
about a mile from the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona.
   Two other encounters between Israeli soldiers and guerrillas
were reported in the area Sunday and Tuesday, ending a two-month
lull in attempted infiltrations of Israel from Lebanon.

   President Bush told cheering Germans
on Wednesday that the time is right to make Europe ``whole and
free'' and he called on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to open
up ``the rusting Iron Curtain.''
   The president did not directly endorse the reunification of
Germany, but he renewed a demand that the Berlin Wall be dismantled.
   ``The world has waited long enough,'' Bush declared. ``We seek
self-determination for all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe. We
will not relax. We must not waver.''
   The president flew to London for a private evening meeting with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after a day in West Germany
arranged for maximum publicity.
   The events included a colorful cruise on the Rhine River and a
visit to Ambassador Vernon Walters' home, where hundreds of
American children whose parents work in the country were assembled
to wave paper flags and cheer the president.
   But the centerpiece was clearly the speech in Mainz. Showing the
confidence that marked his performance earlier in the week at a
NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Bush challenged the Soviet Union
to dismantle the barbed wire-topped wall erected 28 years ago to
divide the old German capital.
   Throwing Gorbachev's use of the term ``glasnost,'' or openness,
back at the Soviet leader, he said Berlin should be ``a place of
cooperation, not a point of confrontation.''
   As he did during a visit to Bonn as vice president in June 1987,
Bush in Mainz called for expanded air access to Berlin and the
staging of more international meetings and sports events there.
   Bush said as minefields and barbed-wire fences are being removed
between Hungary and Austria, ``so must they fall through Eastern
Europe.''
   He added: ``Let Berlin be next.''
   The crowd assembled in a hall in this Rhineland city vigorously
applauded every reference to erasing the division of Europe that
followed the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
   He praised Germany as a cradle of democracy, made no reference
to the war or its atrocities and said:
   ``The passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The world
has waited long enough. The time is right. Let Europe be whole and
free.''
   In contrast, Bush gave the crowd at the ambassador's residence a
brief, campaign-style speech.
   ``I hope what happened in NATO guarantees the future,'' he said
of the decision taken by the 16 allied governments Tuesday to
challenge Gorbachev with a new proposal for reductions in troops,
tanks, artillery and combat aircraft.
   Bush has called for completion of a conventional forces
agreement within a year, but Secretary of State James A. Baker III
acknowledged on Wednesday that the timetable may be too optimistic.
   ``A lot is going to depend, quite frankly, on the Soviet
response,'' Baker said. ``The ball now is clearly in their court.''
   Warsaw Pact representatives at the Vienna arms reduction talks
were upbeat Wednesday about Bush's proposals. ``The way is open for
a comprehensive agreement on the most destabilizing military
units,'' said Hungarian ambassador David Meiszter.
   On Air Force One en route to London, Bush said he thought his
West German visit had gone well in part because of the
just-completed NATO agreement smoothing over U.S.-West German
differences on short-range nuclear weapons. He said he had arrived
``on an encouraging note.''
   Still, signs of the disagreement remained.
   In Mainz, Mayor Herman-Hartmut Weyel indirectly criticized Bush
for steering NATO into a proposal for reductions _ but not
elimination _ of the weapons, most of which are on German soil. The
mayor handed Walters a resolution adopted by the city council that
said ``we in Mainz know there is no escape for us if these weapons
are ever used.''
   About 250 demonstrators protested Bush's speech, waving placards
reading ``Bush Go Home'' and ``Bush Is Not Welcome Here.'' Police
sealed off the main bridge spanning the Rhine and helicopters
circled the hall where Bush spoke.
   In his speech, Bush said Europe is undergoing a second
Renaissance in which ``the forces of freedom are putting the Soviet
status quo on the defensive.''
   He said the West is succeeding while ``on the other side of the
rusting Iron Curtain their vision failed.''
   Although his stance toward the Soviets was combative, he also
offered an assurance that ``our goal is not to undermine their
legitimate security interests.''
   In mid-afternoon, trailed by television cameras and
photographers, Bush and his wife, Barbara, took a riverboat ride to
Koblenz where he was greeted by fireboats shooting streams of water
high into the air.
   At Oberwesel, local wine queen Ute Port, dressed as a medieval
damsel, presented Bush with a huge goblet of Rhine Riesling.
Confiding that the literal translation of her title of Weinhexe is
``wine witch,'' she said, ``The president's eyes opened wide when I
told him that.''

   A portrait of U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper
was unveiled Wednesday in the Legislature, where he began his
political career six decades ago, and the governor asked that a new
building be named in his memory.
   The Miami Beach Democrat, champion of the elderly and weaver of
the nation's social-welfare safety net died of cancer Tuesday at
age 88, the oldest member of Congress.
   The unveiling in the Florida Senate of the portrait awarded by
the Easter Seal Society was previously scheduled for Wednesday, and
Pepper was to have attended. The portrait will hang in the
Tallahassee-Leon Civic Center.
   ``He always wanted to serve,'' Senate Majority Leader Jack
Gordon, a Miami Beach Democrat, said at the unveiling. Gordon, who
has served in the Senate since 1972, is considered a potential
successor to his longtime friend.
   Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, said Pepper had
always been a friend to Miami's Cuban community and other refugee
groups.
   ``He did not worry about color; he did not worry about party; he
did not worry about creed,'' said Sen. Carrie Meek, a Miami
Democrat.
   Gov. Bob Martinez urged the Legislature to name the state's new
Department of Education building for Pepper.
   ``It would be fitting to name this important building in state
government after a man who, decade after decade, stood tall for the
interests of the people he served,'' said Martinez.
   Pepper's public service began with his election to the Florida
House in 1928 at age 28. He went to the U.S. Senate during the
administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was defeated
in 1950 but was elected to the U.S. House in 1962.
   Pepper was to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda for five
hours Thursday, a final honor previously granted to only 26
Americans.
   A spokeswoman for Pepper's office, Rochelle Jones, said a
viewing will be held in Florida's Old Capitol on Sunday and a
funeral will be at the First Baptist Church. Pepper will be buried
here next to his wife, Mildred.
   The governor said he will not set a date for a special election
to choose Pepper's successor until after the services.
   ``I think the focus ought to remain on Senator Pepper,'' said
Martinez.
   Republicans mentioned as possible candidates in the 18th
congressional district, where about half the voters are Hispanic,
include U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen; his wife, Ileana, and state
Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Alberto Gutman.
   Besides Gordon, the Democrat possibilities include Miami Beach
Mayor Alex Daoud, Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, Metro Dade
Commissioners Barbara Carey and Joseph Gersten and Miami
Commissioner Rosario Kennedy.

   The Pentagon notified Congress on Wednesday it
had approved the sale of aviation spare parts worth more than $100
million to Taiwan.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said spare parts for F-5, F-100, F-104, T-33, T-28 and C-130
aircraft would be sold to the Taiwanese government.
   The sale also includes various types of aviation radar and
navigation systems and is expected to total $108 million, the
Pentagon said.
   The U.S. Air Force will be responsible for overseeing the
transaction ``and the procurement of these items will be from the
many contractors providing similar items to the U.S. armed forces.''
   ``The sale of this equipment and support will not affect the
basic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon added.

   A line of 150 potential jurors on Wednesday
stretched out the front door of a courthouse where a former police
officer went on trial on charges he murdered his neighbor for
revenge.
   Robert McLaughlin, who was a policeman for 18 years in coastal
Hampton, surrendered last summer and admitted to the killing. But
during a pre-trial hearing this month, he said his wife, Susan,
pulled the trigger.
   She was convicted last month of being an accomplice to murder
and is serving a life sentence without parole.
   Prosecutors charge McLaughlin killed Robert Cushing, 63, a
prominent real estate agent and former teacher, with two shotgun
blasts on June 1, 1988. McLaughlin and his wife went to Cushing's
home to settle a grudge that dated to 1976 when Cushing accused
McLaughlin of brutality in making a traffic arrest, authorities
said.
   Because of publicity the case received, Superior Court Judge
Robert Temple brought in an unusual number of potential jurors. The
number present Wednesday was three times the number lawyers took a
week to interview in Susan McLaughlin's trial.
   Temple instructed the potential jurors for two hours about their
responsibilities if they are chosen to sit on the panel.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, standing on a
stage Wednesday with ads featuring beer-promoting dog Spuds
MacKenzie and Miller Lite beach parties, called for restrictions on
alcohol advertising to help curb drunken driving.
   Koop urged Congress to support the effort and also proposed much
tougher state blood-alcohol standards to determine when a driver is
legally drunk, increased taxes on all alcoholic beverages, and a
series of voluntary restraints from the industry and advertising
media.
   The recommendations, which arose from a conference Koop
organized in December to combat drunken driving, brought immediate
protests from distillers and the National Association of
Broadcasters. A spokesman for Anheuser-Busch said the proposals
would ``dramatically increase government intrusion into our lives''
without stopping alcohol abuse.
   Koop, in what he said would be his last news conference before
leaving office July 13, said he did not support bans on or
prohibition of alcohol advertising. But he did ask for some
advertising restrictions and bans on some promotional efforts
involving alcoholic products.
   He proposed that alcohol advertising be matched with pro-health
and safety messages, financed by the industry or by federal and
state government, if necessary. Tax deductions for alcohol
advertising promotions other than price and product advertising
should be eliminated, he said.
   Pointing to ads featuring Budweiser's well-known Spuds MacKenzie
and Miller Lite beer beach parties, Koop said, ``These practices
... tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to athletic, social
and sexual success.''
   Stephen Lambright, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch which produces
Budweiser, said the dog ads have been used extensively to promote
responsible drinking. He said the overall market for beer has been
flat for several years and denied that Budweiser aims its ads at
young people or tries to encourage people to drink who don't
already imbibe.
   Beer prices would double under Koop's proposals, Lambright said.
   F.A. Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council, said
the surgeon general's panel was trying to solve drunken driving by
eliminating drinking rather than working to make drunken driving
socially unacceptable.
   ``With this type of misguided mindset, it's impossible to
develop sound, effective solutions,'' said Meister, who represents
liquor marketers and manufacturers.
   National Association of Broadcasters President Edward O. Fritts
said, ``Despite all scientific evidence finding no link between
advertising and abuse, the surgeon general's report nonetheless
would place restrictions on the right to advertise alcoholic
beverages which are legal products.'' The organization represents
5,100 radio stations, 970 television stations and major networks.
   Fritts said broadcasters contribute $1 billion a year in air
time and community services against drug and alcohol abuse.
   Koop also recommended extending a law signed by former President
Reagan last year that for the first time required health warning
labels on alcoholic beverages. But he added that mainly he was
urging voluntary action on the part of advertisers.
   ``Please enlarge the warning labels required on bottles and cans
beginning this November,'' he said. ``Even a person my age should
be able to read the warning without using a magnifying glass.''
   The surgeon general urged an end to ``happy hours'' and other
price-cutting promotions at bars aimed at increasing consumption.
   ``These actions may not make people as happy as happy hours do,
but they will help keep them alive,'' Koop said.
   He also asked the industry to stop advertising on college
campuses and at public events attended by young people, to
eliminate sponsorship of athletic events, and to end the use of
celebrities who appeal to youth in alcohol advertising.
   Nearly 25,000 people died from alcohol-related vehicle crashes
last year, Koop said, with another 534,000 injured. About half of
all vehicle fatalities involve alcohol, according to the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Koop said states should reduce the level of blood-alcohol
content that determines drunken driving from its usual level of
0.10 percent to 0.04 percent by the year 2000. He said a level of 0
percent should be set for drivers under 21.
   Koop advocated legislation in each state that would allow the
confiscation of driver's licenses on the spot for those who fail to
pass blood alcohol tests.
   Excise taxes on alcoholic beverages should be increased, and
taxes on beer, wine and distilled spirits should be based on their
alcohol content, he said.
   He recommended that states consider a minimum 5-cent-a-drink tax
increase on alcoholic beverages.
   ``After all, who would quarrel with a `nickel a drink' user fee
that will generate billions of dollars to help save lives?'' he
asked.

   Police in helicopters fired guns and
tossed tear gas canisters at demonstrators Wednesday as the rioters
erected barricades and set government vehicles on fire.
   Independent reports said 19 people _ including two who died _
were brought to Ikeja General Hospital with gunshot wounds. There
was no official comment on the riots.
   The clashes were the most violent in the capital since students
began rioting a week ago to protest a government austerity plan and
school policies.
   Wednesday's demonstrations began when the government ordered two
Lagos universities and four technical schools closed to protect
life and property in the port city.
   Students took to the streets, and witnesses said market women
and unemployed youth helped them erect barricades around government
buildings to stop civil servants from going to work. Workers who
managed to enter the buildings later were chased away by the
rioters.
   By noon the streets of the sprawling city were full of rioters,
including schoolchildren and traders who closed their stores.
   Police tried to disperse the demonstrators, who chanted slogans
against President Ibrahim Babangida's economic policies and pelted
officers with stones. But when they were chased from the streets,
officers used helicopters to fire on the rioters.
   The state-run Daily Times newspaper said troops will guard all
strategic installations in the country against demonstrators.
   The protests began on May 24 at universities in the midwestern
city of Benin, about 160 miles east of Lagos and since have spread
to campuses nationwide.
   The government has closed 13 schools, and police have arrested
more than 200 students in Benin and Lagos alone, according to
newspaper reports. At least six people, including a police officer,
have been reported killed.
   The protesters oppose a government austerity program demanded by
Western creditors. The program has caused sharp rises in the price
of some basic foods and services.
   Some students also have demanded changes in Nigeria's university
system, including the abolition of tuition fees.
   The Daily Times quoted Col. Fred Chijuka, an army spokesman, as
saying that students alone were not responsible for the riots.
   ``The act cannot be the handiwork of students but hooligans in
the guise of students,'' he said.
   In Ibadan, north of Lagos, Oyo state police commissioner
Archibong Nkana said police were investigating the death of a
secondary school pupil who allegedly was shot to death during a
demonstration Monday at the University of Ibadan, the News Agency

   Nkana said the shot could not have been fired by any of his men
because they were not armed with guns, NAN said.

<HEAD>Bush Hits Sunny London; So Do Striking Subway Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is in London for a relaxed day of
talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and lunch with Queen
Elizabeth II, but Londoners face the chaos of another subway strike
Thursday.
   As the presidential motorcade whisks Bush to Buckingham Palace
and Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing Street residence, the capital is
likely to endure more than its usual share of traffic jams.
   The subway drivers are holding their fifth 24-hour walkout this
year, demanding an extra $101 a week for operating new driver-only
trains. Management is offering $47 plus 14 days' extra annual
vacation.
   Following in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan who came here in May
1988, Bush is to have talks with Mrs. Thatcher and then head to
Buckingham Palace for his royal lunch engagement.
   In contrast to the imposing palace, Downing Street is an
unostentatious cul de sac in the heart of London, too short to
accommodate a full presidential motorcade. No. 10 has been the home
of British prime ministers for 2{ centuries.
   While Bush is at Downing Street, his wife Barbara will be just
across the Thames River, visiting an adult education center in the
borough of Lambeth.
   Bush is winding up his European tour in a city which has just
enjoyed its warmest, driest May since records began 156 years ago.
   The London Weather Center said Wednesday that temperatures
averaged 61 degrees Fahrenheit, with a high of 84. London had 308
hours of sunshine, the brightest May since the 315 hours in 1909,
and just 0.03 inches of rain, an all-time low for the month.
   But it forecasts colder weather and showers Thursday.
   Bush will visit the U.S. Embassy in the afternoon, and may get
in a game of tennis before heading back to Downing Street for a
banquet given by Mrs. Thatcher. He flies home Friday morning.
   The president arrived at dusk Wednesday aboard Air Force One
from West Germany, and was greeted by Mrs. Thatcher and her husband
Denis on the tarmac at London's Heathrow Airport.
   Armed police guarded the airport and sniffer dogs were used to
check for explosives.
   After a red-carpet welcome with a military band playing the U.S.
national anthem, Bush boarded a U.S. military helicopter with an
easy wave and smile to the dignitaries.
   Mrs. Thatcher joined him on the 15-mile flight to Winfield
House, the Regent's Park official residence of U.S. Ambassador
Henry Catto.

<HEAD>State: Wants To Strengthen Cambodian Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration reaffirmed on
Wednesday that it wants to ``strengthen'' the non-communist
resistance in Cambodia, as it refused to deny a report that it will
seek congressional support for a covert program supplying weapons
to the guerrillas.
   There has been opposition on Capitol Hill to such a move, on the
grounds such support could fall into the hands of the Communist
Khmer Rouge.
   Led by Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge ran Cambodia from 1975 through
1978 and presided over the period in which 1 million Cambodians
died.
   State Department Richard Boucher, asked about the report
published in The New York Times, said the United States has an
assistance program for the non-communist groups that seeks ``an
acceptable, comprehensive and stable political solution'' in
Cambodia.
   ``We believe it is important to strengthen the Cambodian
non-communist resistance,'' Boucher said, adding the administration
believes this is important in light of Vietnam's announcement that
it intends to withdraw its forces from Cambodia at the end of
September.
   The spokesman said ``appropriate assistance'' would strengthen
the non-communist resistance and ``enhance its position and that of
Prince Sihanouk,'' who is trying to oust the Phnom Penh government
and its Vietnamese backers. The prince's forces are part of a
coalition of armed groups that includes the Khmer Rouge.
   Asked if that meant whether he could rule out military aid as a
way of strengthening the non-communist resistance, Boucher replied,
``I have nothing here that would rule it out, no.''
   Boucher said the administration was ``unalterably opposed'' to a
return to power by the Khmer Rouge.
   The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the covert aid
program would be used to strengthen Sihanouk's position in
negotiations with the Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge.
   The newspaper attributed the report to unidentified Bush
administration officials, but efforts to confirm the report were
unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Communist Party Reverses Official View on Leader of 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs of background</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership said
Wednesday that former Premier Imre Nagy, who led the failed 1956
anti-Soviet uprising, has become the symbol of reform and a
``significant figure'' in postwar history.
   The reversal of official policy on Nagy, who was executed in
1958, amounted to political rehabilitation.
   It comes just two weeks before his remains are to be reburied at
an officially sanctioned ceremony June 16 in the same spot where
his body and those of his associates were dumped in unmarked graves
31 years ago.
   ``Nagy is a significant figure of Hungarian post-1945 history,''
said a party statement read on Hungarian TV.
   He ``fought to stop Stalinism in Hungary and ... against foreign
intervention and against the counterrevolutionary actions taking
place during the uprising,'' it said.
   Until earlier this year, Nagy was said to not have taken steps
to combat the ``counterrevolutionaries'' involved in the 1956
uprising.
   In February, the party partially reassessed its view of the
revolt, admitting that it began as a popular uprising.
   The statement, drafted by a Central Committee panel headed by
Politburo reformer Rezsoe Nyers, further reassessed the uprising.
   ``During the 1956 events, in the midst of the contradictory
circumstances on both sides of the opposing forces, many fought
heroically and died for causes they believed to be just,'' it said.
   ``The tragedy was the fratricide itself, and all of the dead are
a loss to the nation,'' it said.
   Mass demonstrations began Oct. 23, 1956, for political reforms
and withdrawal of Soviet military forces. Soviet soldiers and tanks
rolled into Budapest on Nov. 4 to end the uprising.
   Official figures said 5,000-6,000 people were killed, but
Western estimates put the number at 32,000.
   At a meeting this week, the party Central Committee agreed that
Nagy was ``executed in the wake of a show trial and that his
sentence was a violation of the law,'' party spokesman Laszlo Major
told reporters Tuesday.
   Last week, official media said June 16 would be a day of
mourning in Hungary for Nagy and his ``fellow martyrs.''

   Israel's soldiers killed three guerrillas in
south Lebanon on Wednesday in the third such encounter this week,
and later its planes raided bases of Palestinian and pro-Iranian
forces blamed for infiltration attempts.
   Soldiers shot a Palestinian to death in the occupied Gaza Strip
and two others died of wounds suffered earlier, raising to 503 the
number of Palestinians killed since an uprising began in the
occupied lands nearly 18 months ago. Twenty-two Israelis have been
slain.
   Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in the Gaza Strip and two
in the occupied West Bank.
   Police detained six Jewish settlers suspected of killing a
13-year-old girl and wounding two other Palestinians in a raid
Monday on Kifil Harith village in the West Bank. They were
identified as students at the Joseph's Tomb Yeshiva in Nablus, 12
miles away.
   In Israel, a 4-year-old Arab boy was killed when he stepped on a
mine near the border with Syria on the Golan Heights, police said.
   Ehud Olmert, Cabinet minister for Arab affairs, said a new
policy in Ariel, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, that
requires Arab workers to wear tags saying ``alien worker'' was
``insensitive, unintelligent and immoral.''
   The policy, announced Tuesday, inspired comparison with the
Nazis forcing Jews to wear yellow stars of David. Ron Nachman,
mayor of Ariel, said all workers would wear the tags, not just
Arabs.
   A military spokesman said the border skirmish Wednesday occurred
near Hula, a Lebanese village about a mile from the Israeli town of
Kiryat Shmona, a military spokesman said.
   It was the third encounter in four days in the ``security zone''
Israel maintains just north of the border. Sources in the
Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army militia, which helps patrol
the zone, said the guerrillas were trying to attack a militia
position.
   The two clashes Sunday and Tuesday, described as infiltration
attempts, broke a lull of more than two months in guerrilla efforts
to enter Israel. A total of three guerrillas were killed.
   An army spokesman said troopers spotted the guerrillas
Wednesday, opened fire and killed them immediately. The spokesman,
who cannot be identified under army regulations, said there were no
Israeli casualties.
   Reporters in Kiryat Shmona were shown the bodies of the
guerrillas, in white plastic bags, and four AK-47 assault rifles
army officials said the men carried.
   On Wednesday evening, the army command said, Israeli jets raided
``two terrorist targets'' near Sidon and in the Bekaa Valley. It
described the targets as ``headquarters and ammunition dumps of
Hezbollah and Abu Nidal'' that were ``point of planning'' for the
infiltrations.
   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia, and the Abu
Nidal group is a non-PLO guerrilla faction supported by Syria and
Libya.
   Lebanese police said four jets made the raid on Palestinian
bases east of Sidon at about 7 p.m., and six struck Hezbollah bases
in the Bekaa about 15 minutes later.
   At least five guerrillas were missing and presumed dead from the
attack on the Palestinian forces and nine guerrillas were wounded,
the Lebanese police reported. They gave no casualties for the
attack on Hezbollah targets.
   Arab doctors identified the Palestinian killed Wednesday in the
Gaza Strip as 20-year-old Ahmed Abdul Rahman Abu Habab and said he
was shot in the chest in Khan Yunis. They said five Palestinians
were wounded.
   The two Palestinians who died of wounds suffered earlier were
identified in Arab news reports as Ahmed Ibrahim Nawas, 18, shot
Tuesday, and Mohammed Ali Farajani, 15, wounded May 14.
   Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed a general
strike Wednesday that was ordered by Moslem fundamentalists to
protest what they called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's ``curse
against the prophet Mohammed.''
   The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which Shamir
said Israel must not make territorial concessions to the
Palestinians because they ``might say, `Let's cheat the Israelis
just like Mohammed did.'''
   Palestinians ``always bring these examples of how Mohammed used
all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,'' Shamir told the
Jerusalem Post in the interview published earlier this month.

<HEAD>Police Reported Convinced Pan Am Bomb Was Planted at Frankfurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Wednesday that
Scottish police were convinced the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, was put on board
the plane at Frankfurt Airport.
   It also indicated detectives thought one passenger, a student,
checked in the suitcase containing the bomb for someone else,
perhaps innocently, and intimated that West German authorities were
hindering the investigation.
   ``The Scots now think they know whose baggage the bomb was in.
The case containing the bomb is now firmly believed to have been
loaded at Frankfurt Airport,'' the BBC said.
   Police refused to comment.
   But John Boyd, chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway who has
led the Lockerbie investigation, said the investigation was now at
a stage police had not envisioned when they started.
   ``That means that I am hopeful and optimistic for a reasonable
conclusion,'' said Boyd, who is moving to a new post as chief
investigator of constabulary for Scotland.
   John Prescott, transport spokesman for the opposition Labor
Party, urged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss the issue
with President Bush, who arrived in London Wednesday night at the
end of his European tour.
   ``If the German security authorities are hindering the inquiries
by the British and the Americans, then something must be done to
stop that,'' Prescott said.
   The Pan Am flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and
blew up over Lockerbie on Dec. 21 while bound from London to New
York, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   No arrests in the bombing have been announced. But on May 22 the
West German magazine Stern said an Arab bomb expert linked to the
sabotage was arrested in October with 15 other people in raids on
Palestinian homes that also netted explosives and weapons.
   Stern identified the man as Jordanian-born Marwan Khreesat. It
said he was released 15 days later because he worked for the West
German intelligence service, and then returned to Jordan.
   A spokesman for the service denied the man was a West German
agent.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for West Germany's chief
federal prosecutor's office, said May 22 that investigators could
not find enough evidence to keep Khreesat in custody, despite
suspicions about him.
   Stern said Khreesat was believed to make bombs for the radical
Arab group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.

<HEAD>James Claude Wright: No One `Can Take From Me My Inner Peace'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-House Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Years ago, before he was speaker of the House,
James Claude Wright wrote an ``affirmation'' to himself on three
pieces of scratch paper and vowed to carry it always. By now, the
words are surely faded, if not soiled.
   ``No person can take from me my inner peace, for I shall
quietly, calmly, gently, pleasantly hold onto it _ for it is mine,
a gift of God.''
   ``I shall be open to new things, new thoughts, new truths that I
can learn from other people. I have performed well in the past, and
I fully expect success in the future.
   ``I deserve to have happiness, career success, and economic
security. The Lord wants me to have them. Because I like and
respect myself, I am not adversely affected by the attitudes of
others. If they think they do not like me, it is because they do
not know me.''
   Now, Jim Wright of Texas, the second most powerful man in
government, most powerful in the Democratic Party, is leaving his
beloved Congress _ not just adversely affected, but laid bare by
others, foes and friends alike, whose shared farewell is a sigh of
relief.
   He brought himself down, perhaps, by failing to abide by that
pledge to learn ``new truths,'' namely those arising from profound
changes in political morality since he came to Congress in an era
of Texas bosses and cronies. Or, perhaps, his colleagues and the
nation failed to know him, to truly hear him out until it was far
too late to correct the damage to his credibility and reputation.
That can be argued for years.
   Eighteen months ago, Wright merely laughed when Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., began raising Cain over reports that the new
speaker had promoted bulk sales of his book, an unscintillating
compendium of speeches, to escape House limits on outside income.
Nor did Wright seem to perceive any basis for concern over the
subsequent allegation that he accepted gifts worth $145,000,
involving an essentially no-work job for his wife, from a Texas
developer friend.
   But his world had virtually crashed down upon him by the time he
rose on the floor of the House late Thursday in solemn defense of
his honor _ and especially that of wife Betty. And despite what he
portrayed as a thorough rebuttal of all the charges, he asked, in
tears, ``to give you back this job you gave to me, as a
propitiation for all of this season of bad will.
   ``I don't want to be a party to tearing up this institution,''
he said. ``I love it. ... I'm not a bitter man, I'm a lucky man.
God bless this institution. God bless the United States.''
   He quoted Horace Greeley: ``Fame is a vapor, popularity is an
accident, riches take wings, those who cheer today may curse
tomorrow. Only one thing endures: character.''
   Wright, as his ``affirmation'' suggested, did yearn for a secure
financial life, something he didn't have for much of his adulthood,
even as a senior member of the House. An abortive Senate campaign
in the 1960s, the breakup of his first marriage and the needs of
four children kept him seriously in debt.
   He fell deeply in love with Betty Hay, a longtime staff aide,
after he separated from his first wife, Mary Ethelyn, in 1970. But,
to Betty's consternation, he balked at remarrying because of that
debt. ``I thought I was doing the lady no favor,'' he said.
   She finally prevailed, in 1972. ``I had to talk him into it,''
she once recalled. ``I said, `We can get out of debt. We can make
it. And we did.'''
   To this day, Wright, 66, regularly writes romantic poetry to
her. Anyone who has seen them together, cooing like lovesick
teenagers, knows that his first loyalty is to her.
   His salary and investments have put his assets well into six
figures, but Wright does not live lavishly. He still drives an
aging Chevrolet around Washington and lives in the suburban McLean,
Va., house he bought in 1982 for $228,000, a modest figure by
Washington standards.
   What the scrappy, bushy-browed Wright truly burned for since
arriving in the House 34 years ago was the speakership, even if he
had no illusions about its grandeur. He once put it this way: ``I
had more raw power when I was mayor of Weatherford than I've had in
any job since.''
   There was the morning he was still in bed when an old woman
called to complain to the mayor about the wicked little boys
shooting BB guns at the songbirds in her yard. Barely had he hung
up, when another woman, on the opposite side of town, called to
complain about all the sparrows roosting in her eaves. Wright drove
to the first house, picked up the boys and transported them to the
second.
   ``Ever since, I have yearned for some set of problems amenable
to that kind of direct action,'' he said. ``You don't find those
opportunities in the U.S. Congress.''
   Perhaps. But he never quit trying to find them. Months before
his predecessor, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts,
stepped down as speaker in late 1986, Wright told his colleagues he
intended nothing less than to tip the balance between the
legislative and executive branches back in favor of Congress.
   To some extent, that has happened, as Ronald Reagan abandoned
one domestic initiative after another to Congress in his last two
years at the White House, focusing instead on foreign policy. And
even this year, embroiled as he was in his own difficulties, Wright
and his colleagues have assumed a more equal role with President
Bush in formulating consensus policies over the budget and other
key issues, including Latin America.
   But Republicans complained that within Congress itself, Wright
was even more partisan than his predecessor. ``With Tip, there was
warmth and affection,'' said former Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wy., now
secretary of defense. ``There are no such feelings for Jim Wright.''
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, former House Republican whip,
said the House was being run by ``Jim Wright and his goons.''
   Even though a 1981 poll by U.S. News &amp; World Report named Wright
as the most respected member of Congress, he has never lacked for
detractors, even among Democrats. They included Reps. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois and John Dingell of Michigan, both of whom
thought of challenging him for the speakership.
   Wright surely didn't rise to the leadership heights by the sheer
force of personality. Unlike O'Neill, he rarely unwound with his
colleagues in the cloakrooms or the capital's night spots, swapping
stories and good whiskey.
   Instead, he was a loner who, while invariably cordial, revealed
little of himself and family. O'Neill once said: ``You don't have
anecdotes about Jim. Maybe that's an anecdote.''
   He is a far greater master of the language than O'Neill, though
his oratory, usually begun with a calculated arch of his trademark
eyebrows, tends toward the tedious and never worked well on
television.
   Wright tells the story about how, a few years back, he was
growing more and more irritated with the progress of Dingell's
energy committee on a complicated bill:
   ``I was forever exhorting them, I'd get impatient and say, `Hey,
look, time's a-wastin'. This is an important problem and the United
States has got to have a solution to this thing. Here you are,
sitting around here pecking out and dissecting and extruding to the
mind the flaccid tissues of long-dead issues offensive to God and
mankind. Let's get on with it, boys.
   ``And finally, John Dingell said, `Now, Glorious Leader. You
have admonished us in approximately those same terms at least on
five occasions. I would suggest that if you're truly intent upon
expediting the proceedings, we should just designate that speech
you just made as speech No. 1, and whenever you feel impelled to
exhort us to greater efforts, just hold up one finger and we'll
know it's speech No. 1, and it will save us a lot of time.'''

   Despite Wright's pledge to hold onto inner peace, his temper is
legion. A former Golden Gloves boxer, he once threatened to punch
out Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., on the House floor. When Rep. Pete
Stark, D-Calif., cursed at him, Wright promptly invited him outside
to settle the issue.
   Wright's climb through the ranks was rooted, more than anything
else, in sheer, hard, political work. In the four years preceding
his election as speaker, he traveled to more than 250 congressional
districts, raising more than $1 million for candidates, collecting
chits.
   His own political history runs the Democratic gamut, first
parochial and populist, then increasingly liberal. He was one of a
few Southern congressmen who refused to sign a petition opposing
the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, but he voted
against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He evolved into a national
Democrat preaching fairness and help for the downtrodden, but
retaining a down-home interest in protecting banks and oil
operators. He favored a strong defense, but led the fight against
the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Craig Raupe, a former aide who died last October, once said
Wright was ``as complicated as Lyndon Johnson _ just not as mean.''
   Even Gingrich was once something of a fan. ``He makes everyone
feel part of the institution,'' the Georgia Republican said in
1986. ``I remember asking him once for floor time. He could have
finessed me ... instead he took 30 minutes and gave me 30 minutes.
Things like that, if he does it, draw 90 percent of the poison out
of this place.''
   Wright was born on Dec. 22, 1922, in Weatherford. He father ran
National Trades Day Inc., a profitable small business that
specialized in arranging promotional gimmicks like sack races and
pie-eating contests for local merchants. Young Jim was educated in
the public schools for Fort Worth and Dallas.
   ``My goal,'' he once said, ``was to be a football coach. But in
my junior year in high school, I injured my knee, and the coach
suggested that since I couldn't play football, what they really
needed was somebody to represent the school in debate. And since he
was also the world history teacher, I was forever trying to impress
him with how smart I was ... I got hooked.''
   At age 19, Wright dropped out of the University of Texas to
become a B-24 bomber pilot in the Pacific, where he won a
Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit. At age 23, he
ran unopposed for the state legislature; served as mayor of
Weatherford from 1951 to 1954; and, at age 32, was a member of
Congress.
   Now, 34 years later, this is his darkest hour. But he still has
the light of his life, Betty, to whom he wrote for their 14th
Christmas together:
   ``You're the dearest, truest part of every day I live
   ``The thought of you within my heart is all it takes to give
   ``me hope that I ... can work and learn and grow
   ``Yet grateful be, for I have more than any man I know.
   ``For it is true, in all I do
   ``It isn't I, it's `We,'
   ``In all of this, I do thank you
   ``For not giving up on me.''

   A black woman who says racial harassment
forced her and her two young children to abandon the first house
she ever owned said Wednesday she will not try to return to the
all-white neighborhood.
   ``They don't want me, I'm not going to fight,'' said Rosa
Toussaint. ``Those people just don't want me to live there.''
   Ms. Toussaint, 29, grew up in Puerto Rico, served in the Army
and works for a nonprofit agency that monitors abused and neglected
children. She said she and her children, ages 1 and 2, moved into
the home May 13 and left eight days later.
   ``I was naive when I came here. I just wanted to live in a nice
neighborhood,'' she said. ``I thought all that black and white
stuff was something from the '60s. I didn't meet it in Puerto Rico
or in the Army or even in Alabama.''
   She said she heard a racist comment the first day in the
neighborhood. Two days later, she said, she found her garbage can
overturned and a fish skeleton on her doorstep. Later, she said,
rocks were thrown through two windows.
   Some residents said Brunner Real Estate, which handled the sale
of the $27,250 row house, never should have shown her a house in an
all-white neighborhood and should have warned her that it was not
mixed.
   ``Blacks start moving in and property values go down and white
people start running,'' Frank Sintic said. ``They shouldn't run, in
my opinion, but they do and realtors end up making fortunes.''
   Pizza shop owner Sandy Borschell said the real estate company
``made that woman a victim of society.''
   Bob Coyle, who sold Ms. Toussaint the home, said the real estate
company did exactly what the law dictates. ``The woman came in here
and wanted to buy a house and we sold her a house,'' he said.
   City Commission on Human Relations spokesman Jack Fingerman said
he could not comment on the agency's investigation.
   Lt. Marshall Smith of the Police Department's Conflict
Prevention and Resolution Unit said his team's investigation will
be extremely difficult ``unless someone is willing to step forward
and tell us who did it.''
   ``Had she stayed there, maybe we could have done more,'' he
said. ``The incidents would have continued and we could have made
an arrest.''
   Smith said his unit investigated 175 such incidents in the city
last year and that reports of harassment have remained steady over
the past few years.
   Ms. Toussaint, who is staying with friends, said she plans to
stay in Philadelphia.
   ``First, I have to sell the house,'' she said. ``I want to move
where there are blacks and Hispanics in the neighborhood.''

   Words such as ``shimmery,'' ``carnivore,'' and
``hopperdozer'' flowed trippingly over the tongue Wednesday but
``blas,'' ``nasturtium'' and ``macadam'' proved too difficult as
the 62nd National Spelling Bee winnowed out the best from the just
very, very good.
   The record field of 222 local champions was cut by 71 in the
first three rounds. The 151 remaining will battle through more
difficult rounds on Thursday until there are just two vying for the
title. One will miss, one will succeed and the national champion
will be crowned.
   By the end of three rounds, 601 words had been spelled, a lot of
tears had been shed but there also were some very happy _ and,
often, lucky _ survivors.
   Thirteen-year-old Natalie Tarrant of San Antonio, Texas, almost
_ but not quite _ made it through ``machtpolitik,'' power politics.
But she spelled it with a ``c'' at the end.
   Nine-year-old Lisa Ishimaru, a fourth-grader from Sacramento,
Calif. _ the youngest contestant _ made it through all three rounds
with ``mountebank,'' ``blolly'' and ``reflorescence.'' Russell
Murdock, 13, of Raytown, Mo., survived ``empirical'' and
``ellipticity'' but failed on ``mignonette.''
   There was one small moment of drama when 11-year-old Susan
Bonner, a 6th grader from Fort Necessity (La.) High School spelled
``scordatura'' so softly that the judges had to replay a tape
recording that officials use for such situations.
   She waited nervously as the judges listened to the tape two or
three times. They finally decided she had misspelled the word by
using a ``t'' instead of a ``d.'' The word means tuning of an
instrument to produce a special effect.
   When 14-year-old Angela Martin of St. Petersburg, Fla., got the
word ``boulevardier,'' she asked several times to have the word
repeated and then said ``Oh, God, can I buy a vowel?'' _ a steal
from the game show ``Wheel of Fortune.''
   In this competition, however, there is no such help available.
   Ten-year-old Malinda Shepherd of Burnsville, N.C., one of the
youngest contestants, was the first to be eliminated, misspelling
``seriatim'' as ``seriatum.'' The word means ``in a series.''
   Malinda took advantage of contest rules that allow the speller
to ask for a definition of the word, then its use in a sentence,
and even what it is derived from. She took her loss bravely and
walked off the stage with a contest official's arm around her.
   The two-day competition, which carries $16,350 in prize money,
has attracted 120 girls and 102 boys who survived elimination
contests around the country and in American outposts abroad.
   Travis Blow, a 14-year-old from Sayre, Pa., foundered on
``macadam,'' spelling it ``mecadom.'' Robert Getz, 13, from
Lawrence, Kan., spelled ``nasturtia'' instead of ``nasturtium,''
and Hanna Yoon, 12, of Elk Grove Village, Ill, had ``blasse''
instead of ``blas.'' The word means ``to blow.''
   Christopher Simpson, 12, from Whitman, Mass., spelled ``sluice''
as ``sluece,'' and Jenny Boehm, 11, from Oreana, Ill., left the
final ``e'' off ``supervene.''
   ``Veneer,'' became ``vaneer'' from Katherine Strohmaier, 12, of
Lewiston, Idaho.
   In the competition at the start were six 10-year-olds, 24 who
are 11, 45 who are 12, 89 who are 13, 55 who are 14 and two who are
15. Competition is limited to those under 16 and not yet beyond the
eighth grade.
   Nearly 9 million students participated at the local level in
contests sponsored by Scripps Howard newspapers in 13 cities and by
205 other daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers.
   The winner will receive a cash award of $1,500. Other prizes are
$1,000 for second, $750 for third, $500 for fourth, $400 for fifth,
$300 for sixth, $200 for seventh through 10th, $100 for 11th
through 20th, and 202 prizes of $50 each.
   Seven of the contestants are making their third appearance in
the national competition; 30 are here for the second time.

<HEAD>Pentagon Stops Government Dealing With Borden Pending Criminal Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, citing an on-going
criminal case against former executives of Borden Inc., has
temporarily suspended the company's dairy division from doing any
business with the federal government.
   Borden was informed of the action in a notice dated May 25, the
Pentagon announced Wednesday, adding the suspension will remain in
place ``pending completion of legal proceedings.''
   ``The suspension is based upon adequate evidence to suspect that
the employees engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate
competition by rigging bids for the award and performance of
contracts to supply milk for school children in Florida,'' the
Pentagon said.
   Larry Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency, said
the criminal cases against the former Borden executives originated
in Florida and did not involve contracts to provide milk to federal
agencies.
   ``However, because of the nature of the allegations _ dividing
up territory for bid rigging, et cetera _ we just thought it was
prudent to protect the government's interests until we do know if
similar conduct occurred on our bids,'' Wilson said.
   The DLA spokesman said the Defense Department during the first
six months of fiscal 1989 spent $4.5 million buying Borden dairy
products for military commissaries.
   Wilson also said the Pentagon spent at least $700,000 a year in
the Tampa and Orlando areas of Florida. The Florida cases involved
former managers of Borden plants in Tampa and Orlando.
   Borden executives in New York declined immediate comment
Wednesday on the Pentagon's announcement or the effect of the
suspension on the business.
   Beyond the criminal cases, the state of Florida has recovered
$32 million from milk producers and distributors involved in what
has been described as a 10-year price-fixing scheme that resulted
in overcharges for nearly half the state's 67 school districts.
   Of that $32 million total, a settlement of $10.4 million was
paid by Borden Inc.
   The Pentagon's suspension was based on the indictments of three
former Borden executives: A. Lamar Garrett; Jack Parker Tribble
Sr., and Lenard O. Jackson.
   Each of the men were charged in U.S. District Court in Tampa
with rigging bids and violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   Under federal procurement regulations, the Department of Defense
has the authority to act as a so-called executive agent on behalf
of the entire government when dealing with instances of contracting
irregularities.

   The discovery of bogus exposive devices
that closed part of a coastal highway during Memorial Day weekend
was traced to a ``performance art'' show that went awry.
   The show Sunday night included an act in which realistic black
powder canisters were distributed among the 2,500 people who paid
$8 a ticket to see the performance, staged in a parking lot, said
officials of Survival Research Laboratories, producers of the show.
   Three objects that looked like bombs were found Monday along the
Great Highway near Ocean Beach, and two more were found in the
Marin County Headlands. Another canister was found Tuesday on the
beach, and three others near the lot where the late-night show was
staged.
   The palm-size canisters, with lettering reading ``High Explosive
_ { pound of TNT,'' actually were filled with plaster of Paris.
   ``But they looked like the real thing, like Army ordinance
canisters,'' said U.S. Park Service Police Sgt. Jerry McCarthy.
   As the park service and FBI began investigating, Survival
Research Laboratory officials said Tuesday night that the canisters
were among 100 to be used in the show.
   ``The fake bombs were supposed to have been hoisted in 30-gallon
trash bags by a big remote-controlled crane with an electromagnetic
plate attached to the bottom of the lift,'' said one production
company employee, who asked that his name be withheld.
   When the show ended, a number of people scrambled to pick up the
devices, putting them in their pockets, the employee said.
   Survivial Research Laboratories was created by a group of
engineers, welders and artists who stage machine demolition derbies.

   Prices farmers got for raw products rose 2.7
percent from April to May and averaged 13 percent more than a year
ago, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Increases in the prices of hogs, oranges, potatoes, broilers and
tomatoes were partially offset by lower prices for sweet corn,
eggs, lettuce and soybeans, said the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board in a preliminary report.
   But broiler, potato and tomato prices were at record levels.
Hogs also increased sharply from April.
   Demand for oranges was so strong that the average price was
higher than it has been since November 1987.
   Cattle prices continued close to April levels. Wheat and corn
prices were up slightly while soybeans were down from a month
earlier.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products was up 2.6 percent from April to May, and
4.6 percent above a year ago at this time.
   Compared with April, higher prices for hogs and broilers more
than offset lower prices for eggs and milk.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 3.6 percent from a month earlier and
24 percent above a year earlier.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in May averaged 151
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $70.10 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, steady with April. The average is for all types of
cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $42.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $36.30 in
April and $46.30 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.58 a bushel, up from $2.56 in April and $1.98 in
May 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $4.07 per bushel, compared with $4.03 in April and $2.97 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.53 per 100 pounds, down from $6.66 in April
and $7.97 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.15 per bushel, compared with $7.29 in April
and $6.98 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 57.7 cents per pound, compared to
59 in April and 58.3 cents a pound in May 1988.
   _Eggs were 54.3 cents per dozen, compared with 58.1 cents in
April and 33 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.30 in April
and $11.40 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 45.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
39 cents in April and 33.7 cents a year ago.

   Populist firebrand Boris N. Yeltsin urged the new
parliament Wednesday to take power and end 72 years of Communist
Party rule. He blamed the party and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for continuing economic decline.
   Yeltsin, a member of the party leadership, told fellow deputies
of the Congress of People's Deputies that the presidency is
accumulating too much power and could become a dictatorship.
   ``The Congress must take power into its own hands'' if the
political and economic restructuring begun by Gorbachev is to
succeed, Yeltsin said on the sixth day of the popularly elected
parliament's inaugural session,
   He called for an immediate transfer of authority from the party
and suggested the president submit to an annual referendum on his
performance.
   The session, broadcast live to the nation, has seen
unprecedented public criticism of the Soviet leadership.
   Gorbachev kept a stoic face throughout Yeltsin's speech and
scanned the hall for reaction. Most deputies politely applauded.
Members of the party's ruling Politburo who attended the session
and sat in a special section of the hall did not clap.
   Gorbachev's performance of the past four years has been
criticized since the Congress convened, and many deputies
questioned him sharply before they elected him to a second term as
president last week. At that time, Gorbachev promised he would not
take advantage of the increased powers of the presidency.
   Another deputy proposed constitutional amendments recognizing
the 15 Soviet republics as sovereign states with the power to
control their own resources, make their own laws and shape a new
relationship with the Kremlin.
   Estonia and Lithuania, which have defied the Kremlin by
declaring themselves sovereign with the right to overturn Soviet
laws, had been expected to propose such amendments.
   But the sponsor turned out to be a Gorbachev protege, Latvian
President Anatoly Gorbunov.
   ``The U.S.S.R. is a union, a multinational state, formed on the
basis of agreement, equal republics, with self-determination of
nations,'' Gorbunov said. ``Only the republics can delegate power
to the union.''
   He said a redistribution of power was needed ``to eradicate the
roots of ethnic tension.''
   Gorbunov whispered with Gorbachev during the following speech
and conferred again during the next break, but the president did
not respond publicly to the proposal.
   The highest-level comment on Gorbunov's radical proposals came
from Anatoly Lukyanov, elected Monday as vice president. He said
the proposals may go too far and called for a combination of
central, republic and local control.
   Moscow Deputy Yuri Vlasov ripped into Gorbachev for denying
knowledge of what happened when troops that were dispatched to
break up a pro-independence demonstration in Tbilisi, capital of
Soviet Georgia, killed 20 people.
   ``In no circumstances is it possible to accept that the head of
state doesn't know the circumstances of the case,'' Vlasov said.
``Otherwise, what kind of head of state is he?''
   The Congress on Wednesday approved a commission to investigate
the incident.
   Vlasov also criticized the long-sacrosanct KGB secret police,
charging that ``the best people of the country were tortured in its
basements'' and it remains almost uncontrollable, continuing to
dominate the lives of all citizens.
   Yeltsin's speech was packed with proposals, and his fellow
deputies sat riveted to their seats when he demanded the Congress
seize power from party leaders who are ``the same people who have
not managed to get society out of its crisis in politics, the
economy, finances and the standard of living.''
   Yeltsin, who became a hero to many Soviets by demanding a better
life for the common people, said ``the threat of financial collapse
has become real'' since Gorbachev was named Kremlin leader in March
1985. Tens of millions of people live in poverty, he said.
   Yeltsin proposed the Congress grant free medicine and mass
transit to invalids and the poor and suggested it convert special
hospitals and clinics for the elite to health centers for mothers
and children.
   Yeltsin, a member of the party's Central Committee, also called
for removal of many of that policy-making body's members, saying
they have proved incapable of solving the nation's problems.
   Despite his harsh words for Gorbachev, Yeltsin's proposal on
transferring power from the party to the government could have
Gorbachev's support, Deputy Revaz Tabakashvili said later.
   Gorbachev has said his reforms are designed to separate the
government and party bureaucracies, get the party out of day-to-day
public affairs and let the popularly elected Congress and its
full-time legislature set policy and law with the guidance of a
strong president.
   One deputy noted that Gorbachev chose Wednesday's speakers,
including Yeltsin, from among the 440 deputies who asked to comment
on Gorbachev's address on Tuesday.
   Since Gorbachev heads the party and the government, he would not
be threatened by Yeltsin's proposal. But thousands of party
bureaucrats in every organization in the country, from a tiny
Siberian factory to the ruling Politburo, could stand to lose power.
   Vice President Lukyanov told reporters afterward, ``I think the
party's position in our country is just fine and precisely defined
in Article 6 of the Constitution.''
   The article says the Communist Party is ``the leading and
guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political
system.''

<HEAD>Gray Complains of Leak; Thornburgh Orders a Probe</HEAD>

   Rep. William H. Gray III, in an uncomfortable
spotlight after a Memorial Day visit from FBI agents, wrote an
angry letter Wednesday to the Justice Department demanding a probe
of news leaks.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh assured the fourth-ranking
House Democrat that he had ordered ``a full investigation'' into
leaks saying the FBI had begun a preliminary probe into allegations
that Gray may have had a ghost employee on his payroll.
   Jon Plebani, Gray's staff director, said Wednesday, ``Every
employee who works for Bill Gray comes to work and does work. He's
a very demanding boss.''
   Gray is seeking the post of majority whip being vacated by Rep.
Tony Coelho, D-Calif. In his letter to Thornburgh, Gray questioned
why the department waited ``until the eve of Democratic leadership
changes to inform me or ask my cooperation.''
   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., one of Gray's opponents in the
whip's race, also complained, ``The American people are fed up with
the effort to use innuendoes and rumors to discredit our public
officials. We must stop this destructive politics of character
assassination.''
   Government sources told several news organizations Tuesday that
Gray had been visited by FBI agents who were conducting a
preliminary inquiry. Gray denied that he had done anything wrong
and suggested in an evening news conference Tuesday that the
allegations were politically motivated.
   ``I was told over and over again I was not the subject of an
investigation,'' Gray said. He said he'd been told that the bureau
was ``looking into allegations about an employee or employees.''
   Gray wrote a sharply worded letter to Thornburgh demanding an
independent investigation of the source of any leak. Thornburgh
responded, ``Prior to receiving your letter, I had ordered a full
investigation of the apparent unauthorized disclosure of
information in this matter.''
   The purpose of the investigation, Thornburgh said, ``is to
uncover any possible wrongdoing within the department or elsewhere
and to prevent such leaks in the future.''
   In Philadelphia, FBI spokesman John Kundts said Wednesday that
the bureau would not ``confirm nor deny that there is an
investigation under way.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel disputed suggestions
that top department officials leaked information for political
reasons.
   ``If that is going on, it's going on at a lower level of the
department,'' Runkel said.
   The spokesman described Thornburgh as ``disturbed by leaks that
have come out of the department concerning matters which have led
to news stories on members of Congress.''
   ``If there is some attempted interference here in the actions of
the House Democratic Caucus it is of concern to us,'' Runkel said.
   Last Thursday, the attorney general asked Assistant Attorney
General Edward S.G. Dennis ``to look into the unauthorized
disclosure of information'' leading to stories that Coehlo and Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley were being investigated by the FBI.
   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the FBI was
conducting a preliminary inquiry into investments that Coelho and
Bradley made through the investment firm of Drexel, Burnham and
Lambert.

<HEAD>Actor Says Slain Producer Feared Trouble On Night He Disappeared</HEAD>

   Actor Demond Wilson testified Wednesday that
slain movie producer Roy Radin feared ``there might be some
trouble'' on the night he disappeared because of Radin's ties with
the film ``The Cotton Club.''
   On May 13, 1983, Radin assigned Wilson, former star of TV's
``Sanford and Son,'' to follow him with a gun as the producer
headed for a business dinner at a swanky Beverly Hills restaurant,
Wilson said.
   Wilson's testimony came in a preliminary hearing in the ``Cotton
Club'' case in Municipal Court to determine if four people should
stand trial for the abduction-slaying of Radin.
   ``He asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything
happened,'' Wilson said. ``He said that there might be some
trouble. He said that something might happen to him as a result of
his association with the ... `The Cotton Club.'''
   Wilson, who acknowledged that he had drug habit at the time,
said he lost Radin's limousine in traffic on Sunset Boulevard and
never saw him again.
   The 33-year-old New York businessman's body was found a month
later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had
been shot in the head repeatedly.
   Wilson's testimony conflicted with that of his former secretary,
who testified earlier that she was with Wilson and saw Radin pull
off the boulevard followed by another car full of men, but said she
and Wilson did not follow.
   Under questioning, Wilson said he used cocaine, alcohol and
pills in 1983. Asked by an attorney whether he underwent a drug
rehabilitation program, he said, ``No, sir. I found Christ.''
   Wilson is now an evangelical preacher in Washington, D.C.
   Defense attorneys attacked Wilson's account of Radin's last
night, saying the actor never before told anyone that Radin
expressed fear.
   ``He was pretty fearful,'' Wilson insisted. ``There was a lot of
anxiety around him. ... It was not a fear that somebody's hands
were shaking. It's something that a friend knows.''
   Deputy District Attorney Sally Thomas had Wilson describe his
friendship with Radin and the last night the producer was seen
alive.
   The prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer Karen DeLayne
``Laynie'' Greenberger arranged Radin's murder after they fought
about her share of profits from ``The Cotton Club.'' She is charged
with murder along with Alex Lamota Marti, William Molony Mentzer
and Robert Ulmer Lowe, former bodyguards for Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt. Lowe is fighting extradition in Maryland.
   On the night Radin disappeared, Wilson said he visited Radin in
his hotel suite and ``That was when I saw the crux of his anxiety.''
   He said Radin asked if he had a gun, which Wilson did, and
arranged for him to come along to La Scala restaurant, where Radin
was to dine with Mrs. Greenberger. Wilson was assigned to follow in
his own car. The actor said he offered to call the police, but
Radin declined.
   Wilson brought his secretary and also had a reservation for
dinner. But he said the plan went awry when he lost Radin's
limousine in traffic.
   He said he began to follow but got stopped at a red traffic
light. By the time he turned onto Sunset Boulevard, he said, he was
about 10 cars behind Radin.
   He said he continued on to the restaurant, but Radin never
showed up.
   Attorney David Kenner, representing Marti, attacked Wilson's
story, pointing out discrepancies between his current account and
what he told police in interviews following Radin's disappearance.
   Kenner then asked, ``Do you have a recollection of telling
anybody before today that Mr. Radin was expressing fear,
nervousness or anxiety on May 13, 1983?''
   ``No,'' said Wilson.

<TEXT>
   Three days of negotiations on a share
in the Afghan guerrilla government for minority Shiite Moslems
ended in deadlock Wednesday, but the main Shiite leader said more
talks would be held.
   Karim Khalili, leader of the eight Afghan guerrilla groups based
in Iran, said a six-member commission had been formed to maintain
contact between his alliance and guerrilla leaders headquartered in
Pakistan.
   Khalili and the Shiite minority want seven Cabinet posts in the
provisional government and have been offered four. They also demand
representation on a council controlled by leaders of the
seven-party coalition based in Pakistan.
   About 15 percent of Afghanistan's people are Shiites, and the
rest follow the main Sunni sect of Islam.
   The guerrillas present the provisional government as an
alternative to the Soviet-sponsored Marxist regime in Kabul.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered country in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 were in Afghanistan when the Red Army began its
withdrawal, which was completed Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Encourage Less Violence, Drugs, Sex on TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved legislation Wednesday
aimed at encouraging television networks, local stations and cable
systems to reduce graphic depictions of violence, drug use and sex
on TV.
   The bill by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., was approved on a voice
vote after an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was adopted to
include depictions of sexual acts in addition to drug use and
violence in any guidelines the industry might develop.
   Technically, the bill only exempts the industry from antitrust
claims that might result from joint efforts to develop the
guidelines. But its passage was clearly aimed at sending a signal
to the industry that some depictions of violence and sex have
become too graphic.
   Network executives did not embrace the measure but they also did
not try to stop it. The American Civil Liberties Union, however,
opposed it as a step toward censorship and a threat to First
Amendment rights of free speech.

<HEAD>Judge Appoints 3 to Oversee Teamsters Under Racketeering Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former federal judge with a reputation as a
corruption fighter and an ex-Wall Street prosecutor were among
three watchdogs appointed Wednesday to oversee Teamsters union
operations.
   The appointments, announced at federal court in Manhattan, were
part of the settlement of a civil racketeering lawsuit against the
nation's largest trade union.
   ``Honest union members and the public at large are entitled to a
decent and honest union _ free of criminal influences and corrupt
practices,'' said U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein. ``Today's
appointments are an important first step in that direction.''
   The three appointed are: Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal
judge and U.S. attorney in New Jersey; Charles M. Carberry, former
head of the commodities and securities fraud unit of the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan; and Michael H. Holland, former
general counsel to the United Mine Workers of America.
   The three will oversee various union functions until late 1992.
   Lacey, 68, of Glen Ridge, N.J., a 15-year veteran of the federal
bench, became known for prosecuting corruption while U.S. attorney
in Newark that led to the conviction of several political figures.
   As administrative officer, Lacey will have the same authority as
the union's international president and executive board to veto
union expenditures, disciplinary actions and appointments.
   Holland, 42, of Chicago, will oversee the union's 1991 elections
and will have the right to supervise the union's 1996 elections. He
was general counsel for the United Mine Workers from 1982 until
last January.
   Lacey and Holland were both sworn in Wednesday by Edelstein, who
approved the out-of-court settlement in March.
   Carberry, 38, who will investigate alleged corruption in the
union with the right to file charges against Teamsters officials,
members and employees, will be sworn in later, said the judge.
   In 1986-87, Carberry headed the federal criminal probe of
figures in Wall Street's insider trading scandals, including Dennis
Levine and Ivan Boesky.
   Edelstein said the trio's task ``is enormous in scope and
importance'' but they ``are more than up to that task. Their
ability, dedication and integrity cannot be questioned.''
   ``We're very pleased with the appointees,'' said James T. Grady,
the union's general counsel. ``The interest of a clean and
democratic union are consistent with the goals of the present
leadership.''
   The three posts were created as part of a settlement of the
government's massive civil lawsuit against the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen.
   The lawsuit, filed last June under the civil aspects of the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, charged that the
top leadership of the union was dominated by organized crime and
had ``made a devil's pact'' with the Mafia.
   The lawsuit noted that four Teamsters presidents since the 1950s
have faced federal felony charges and three were convicted: Dave
Beck for embezzlement; Jimmy Hoffa for obstructing justice and mail
fraud and Roy Williams for trying to bribe a U.S. senator.
   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the time
the lawsuit was brought, died while under indictment for alleged
embezzlement.
   Twenty-five of the 26 reputed mob figures originally named as
defendants have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such as
extortion, embezzlement and illegal labor payoffs.
   Most were dismissed from the case when they either agreed, or
were ordered, to drop any involvement with the Teamsters.
   The settlement between the union and federal prosecutors,
reached just hours before the case was to go to trial, also called
for the direct election of international officers by the rank and
file.
   In exchange, Teamsters leaders, whom the government sought to
oust, were allowed to remain in office.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States accused Romania at an East-West
human rights conference Wednesday of repressing and driving away
thousands of people, but Romania told other nations to keep out of
its internal affairs.
   Earlier in the day, Turkey appealed to the conference to help
ethnic Turks who have been subject to an assimilation campaign in
Bulgaria.
   Romania and Bulgaria are expected to be singled out as nations
that routinely violate human rights by the month-long 35-nation
Conference on the Human Dimension, which began Tuesday in Paris. It
is being held in the framework of the East-West Helsinki Accords on
human rights.
   U.S. chief delegate Morris B. Abram told delegates that more
than 20,000 people had fled Romania in the past 18 months to escape
political and economic repression. He said Romania now ``turns its
back'' on the human rights commitments it made with other nations.
   Romania has come under heavy criticism from nations including
Hungary, its Communist bloc neighbor, for a program to destroy
thousands of villages populated by ethnic Hungarians and resettle
their populations in industrial centers.
   However, Constantin Ene, chief of Romania's delegation, said the
delegates should ignore their mandate to examine specific cases of
human rights abuse.
   He said such a process would interfere with a nation's
sovereignty. ``I want to underline that the domestic and foreign
policies of Romania are decided in Bucharest and not in just any
capital,'' he said.
   Challenging Ene, Abram told reporters at a news conference:
``Sovereignty does not give a state a right to oppress its own
citizens.''
   An emigre source said a leading Romanian dissident, Doina
Cornea, was beaten and kicked by Romanian police for the second
time this month when she tried to leave home May 18.
   Mihnea Berindei, a spokesman for the Paris-based Romanian League
of Human Rights, told The Associated Press in Vienna, Austria, that
it was not known if Cornea was allowed to receive medical treatment
in a hospital.
   Emigre sources said the dissident was also beaten earlier this
month and told she would not receive a visa to attend the human
rights conference in Paris.
   Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz said ethnic Turks face
irradication as a national minority in Bulgaria. He called
Bulgaria's assimilation campaign ``one of the gravest human rights
violations of our time.''
   Bulgaria started the drive in 1984, forcing ethnic Turks to
change their Moslem names to Slavic ones and forbidding use of the
Turkish language and Islamic worship.
   Bulgaria has said three people were killed over the weekend in
rioting by ethnic Turks. Turkish emigres sources say up to 30
people died.
   Some ethnic Turks at the Paris conference say Bulgaria is
imprisoning, torturing, exiling or killing those who resist
assimilation.
   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, says
about 100 Turks died fighting the campaign and thousands were
jailed.
   Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov has blamed the charges on a
``campaign of slander'' by Turkey and Western groups.
   Also Wednesday, Bulgarian exile sources said a union leader who
planned to attend the Paris conference was arrested May 26.
   The sources in Austria and West Germany said Konstantin
Trenchev, chairman of an independent Trade Union of Intellectual
Workers, faces charges that could jail him for up to 15 years.
   They said he had helped ethnic Turks draft a resolution
publicizing their grievances.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to continue
subsidizing local freight railroad lines that otherwise would be
abandoned because of little traffic.
   As a budget-reducing measure, President Bush had called for
ending the 16-year-old subsidy program once the $10 million
appropriated for this year was spent.
   But on a voice vote with no dissent, the Senate approved a bill
by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to continue the program with the intent
of providing some $50 million in new aid through 1993.
   However, the new legislation increases from 30 percent to 40
percent the local share required for federal matching funds to
acquire and repair tracks and terminal facilities. None of the
federal aid can be used to subsidize the operating costs of the
lines.
   The program originated in the government's bailout of the Penn
Central Railroad in the early 1970s when shippers and local
communities were faced with the prospect that thousands of miles of
track would be abandoned. It was expanded nationwide in 1976.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church of England envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared while trying to negotiate freedom for American hostages
more than two years ago, turned 50 years old Wednesday.
   Waite was on his fifth mission as personal representative of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie when he dropped from sight
Jan. 20, 1987, in Moslem west Beirut.
   He was last seen leaving the seaside Riviera Hotel at 7:30 p.m.
to meet the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers of two Americans.
   In England, Waite's family observed the birthday quietly,
praying for his safe return.
   His wife Frances and brother David had an ``entirely private''
meeting with Runcie at Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's residence,
a church spokeswoman said.
   David Waite said the family believes his brother is alive. ``Our
faith takes the pressure out and we can relax in the knowledge that
at the right time Terry will be released,'' he said.
   On the night he disappeared, the policeman's son who became a
spiritual leader's personal emissary told his Druse bodyguards he
did not want them to escort him to the clandestine meeting.
   Well-informed sources said Waite was driven to the home of a
Shiite Moslem physician who had acted as go-between. He apparently
was to make contact with representatives of Islamic Jihad, which
holds U.S. hostages Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Waite never returned.
   Nothing has been heard of him since. No group claims to hold
him, the British government says no ransom demands have been made
and there have been no photographs or videotapes from the
kidnappers to prove he is alive.
   Other Western hostages freed since, however, have reported
seeing a man believed to be the bearded, 6-foot-7 Briton in an
underground prison.
   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt claimed Waite was held by the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for
kidnappers holding most of the 18 missing Westerners. Hezbollah
denied it.
   Many rumors circulated after Waite's disappearance. He was
reported ill, released, killed, wounded while trying to escape and
smuggled to Iran.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Submarine's Hull Cracks Stem From Manufacturer's Failure, Company
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cracks discovered in the hull of a nearly
completed nuclear submarine stem from a failure of the steel
manufacturer and went undetected by Navy officials and the ship's
builder for five years, the submarine builder said Wednesday.
   The Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp., which
described the cracks in a memo to lawmakers last week as ``quite
severe,'' said repairs have been completed and apparently would not
impact on the Sept. 30 commissioning date of the USS Topeka, a
SSN-688 Los Angeles class attack submarine.
   Electric Boat spokesman Neil Ruenzel said metallurgical tests
conducted by the Groton, Conn., sub maker showed that the steel
plate in question developed a defect during the manufacturing
process.
   The steel maker, Armco Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., initiated
repairs, but ``did not completely eliminate the defect in this
plate when they made the repair,'' Electric Boat said in a
statement.
   ``The cracks were present prior to or during heat treatment
following the repair. While it is not uncommon for a vendor to
correct defects in steel plate used in submarine construction, it
is rare that cracks remain after this repair,'' Electric Boat said.
The cracks were on the area that had undergone repairs, Ruenzel
said.
   Jim Herzog, a spokesman for Armco, said the steel maker would
withhold comment until it receives Electric Boat's report on the
findings. That report had not been received by the end of business
Wednesday, he said.
   The steel plate was manufacturered by Armco's Houston plant and
delivered in 1984, Herzog said. The Electric Boat order was among
the last for the Houston plant before it was shut down, he said.
   Ruenzel, when asked how the cracks could have gone undetected by
company and Navy inspectors for five years, said, ``It could have
gotten bigger over time. I think that's the best explanation.''
   Navy and company officials refused to describe the cracks,
saying the information was classified. But The Hartford Courant
reported that one was a 2-inch long hairline crack and the other
was smaller.
   The cracks were discovered by a foreman during preparation for
painting the hull at the Groton shipyard.
   Ruenzel said it was not immediately known how much the repairs
cost Electric Boat. The question of liability would be addressed in
the future, he said.

<HEAD>Yeutter Announces Wheat Set-Aside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced Wednesday a required 5 percent acreage reduction and
several other provisions of the 1990 wheat program.
   ``We need more wheat,'' said Kelly Shipp, in explaining why the
set-aside was not higher.
   Under the law, the agriculture secretary each year must decide
what, if any, acreage should be set aside in order to keep
surpluses down. Yeutter could have asked for a greater acreage
reduction or none at all.
   The 5 percent figure is dramatically lower than past set-asides
during times of great surplus. In recent years, farmers have been
asked to cut back the amount of land devoted the crop by as much as
25 percent.
   Currently, U.S. wheat supplies are low because of the past
success of the set-aside program and because of two years of
drought.
   Yeutter said price support loans and purchase rates would be
$1.95 a bushel, a 20 percent reduction from the basic loan and
purchase rate of $2.44.
   This is the minimum allowed by law and 5 percent below the 1989
loan and purchase rate of $2.06 a bushel.
   He also set the established target price at $4 a bushel, the
statutory minimum and down about 2 percent from the 1989 target
price.
   Furthermore, he said would not implement paid land diversions,
marketing loans or related programs. No secretary since 1985 has
implemented these programs for wheat or corn, partly because prices
have been high and there has been no need for them.

   Police said the partially naked,
manacled body of the wife of a political opposition leader was
found on a beach early Wednesday, three days after she was reported
missing.
   Arah Hector, wife of Caribbean Liberation Movement leader Tim
Hector, disappeared from their farm Sunday. Swimmers found her body
at Jabberwalk Beach north of St. John's, the capital.
   Police said they had detained a man employed at the farm, where
Mrs. Hector's glasses and parts of her clothing were found on the
ground Sunday. They said there was no indication of the motive.
   The body was partially buried in the sand, with the hands tied
behind the back and clothes wrapped around the neck, police said.
They speculated that she was killed on the farm and buried at the
beach.
   Mrs. Hector, in her early 40s, had three sons and led the
Marxist party's Women's Action Group. Tim Hector was in London on
Wednesday and was traveling in North Africa last week.
   The Hectors and their party, which is not represented in the
15-seat legislature, recently began a campaign against drug
trafficking on the island. In recent editorials, the party
newspaper Outlet denounced government corruption and accused some
ministers of involvement in the drug trade.
   The Foreign Ministry of the former British colony said the
government had asked Scotland Yard's assistance in the
investigation.

<TEXT>
   President Bush should make full use of U.S.
leverage to discourage Chinese leaders from cracking down on
students demonstrating for democracy, a former chief U.S.
disarmament negotiator said Wednesday.
   In the coming days, ``hard-line elements in the government and
the armed forces may crack down on the students and workers in
China's democracy movement,'' involving serious abuses of human and
political rights, former negotiator Max Kampelman said in a letter
to Bush.
   Kampelman now is chairman of Freedom House, an independent
U.S.-based policy organization that promotes human rights and civil
liberties throughout the world.
   The United States and China cooperate on military, economic,
cultural, scientific and educational programs ``which the Peoples
Republic of China finds very much in its interest,'' Kampelman said.
   ``This is the time for the ... United States to make it clear
that such relationships as these may come under greater public
scrutiny in our country and may not be sustainable if the
established Chinese leadership attempts to preserve its rule by
abusing the basic political rights and civil liberties of the
Chinese people,'' Kampelman's letter said.
   Kampelman returned last month to Freedom House after more than
three years as chief negotiator for former President Reagan's
administrator in the strategic arms reduction talks with the Soviet
Union.
   ``We at Freedom House believe it is wrong now not to hold China
to the common standards the United States uses in judging a
country's performance with regard to human rights,'' Kampelman said.
   In the past, the United States has ``understandably refrained''
from criticizing human rights abuses by allies and other friendly
countries, he said, but ``too often that reluctance has proved
ill-founded and short-sighted.''

<TEXT>
   Provincial governments opened
soup kitchens and Congress increased social benefits Wednesday in
bids to end a week of food rioting and looting that has killed 15
people, most of them trying to get food.
   President-elect Carlos Menem met on Wednesday with outgoing
President Raul Alfonsin, who was forced to declare a state of siege
two days earlier. Menem indicated he will work closely with the
government on the economic crisis that sparked the looting, but he
again refused to take office early.
   ``I don't want to interfere with the desire of President
Alfonsin to serve out his mandate,'' Menem, of the labor-based
Peronist Party and winner of May 14 national elections, told
reporters. Alfonsin is to step down Dec. 10.
   The two agreed to review the 1989 budget and put more money into
health and nutrition programs, increase state revenue from customs
taxes, and coordinate policy on public salaries, utility rates and
the $59 billion foreign debt, Menem said.
   Small-scale looting was reported in the provincial capitals of
Corrientes and Mendoza, and in the working class neighborhoods of
Moreno, San Miguel, Jose C. Paz and Munro in Buenos Aires'
industrial belt.
   Two teen-age boys and a 50-year-old man were killed during a
raid on a supermarket and food warehouse in Moreno on Wednesday,
and a 9-year-old boy died of shotgun wounds suffered the day before
in rioting in San Miguel.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias quoted police as
saying they arrested shop owners who shot and killed the Moreno
looters, but did not say how many were involved in the shooting.
   Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd
trying to break into a supermarket in western Mendoza, Argentina's
fourth-biggest city.
   ``I had hoped to live what's left of my life in peace and quiet,
but now it seems more likely that I'll die in the middle of a
war,'' said Buenos Aires resident Matilde Alvarez.
   In general, however, the violence appeared to subside.
   ``Calm reigns throughout the country,'' Interior Minister Juan
Carlos Pugliese said before Wednesday's deaths were reported.
   But there were none of the confrontations the past two days
brought between security forces and mobs in Buenos Aires and
northern Rosario city.
   Six people were killed Tuesday in the capital and five the day
before in Rosario. At least 70 looters and bystanders have been
shot and wounded, and dozens more injured by tear gas, stones,
sticks, broken glass and fists. More than 2,000 people have been
arrested.
   An elite coast guard squadron was sent Wednesday to Rosario, 186
miles north of the capital, to help 2,000 border guards there
establish order.
   Police were stationed at supermarkets throughout the country.
   ``They took everything, even the bones,'' a butcher in San
Miguel said Wednesday, moments after his store was sacked.
   Cesar Melville's nearby supermarket was looted the day before.
``I asked them to just take the food, but they grabbed clothing,
wine and coffee,'' he said as he mopped up spilled milk and
mayonnaise.
   The riots began last week in Mendoza and Cordoba, the
second-biggest city, after months of devaluations caused price
rises far ahead of wage increases and prompted nationwide layoffs
and shortages.
   Real wages have shrunken to 35 percent of what they were in
December 1983 when Alfonsin took office, according to a survey by
the conservative Center for a New Majority.
   Congress on Wednesday approved the 30-day state of siege,
increased state pensions and allocated more money for social
services.
   At the insistence of the Peronists, legislators raised the
minimum pension for retirees to $36 a month and for widows to $33.
   On Tuesday, the monthly minimum wage was more than doubled to
$44.
   Provincial governments on Wednesday set up soup kitchens and
charity drives, lowered water and electricity tariffs, began
negotiating with businessmen to prevent layoffs, and made plans to
halt building projects and funnel more money to social programs.
   In Caracas late Tuesday, President Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela called the Argentine situation ``extremely difficult,
because their economic situation keeps getting worse.'' He blamed
industrialized nations for not offering solutions to Latin
America's economic crunch, saying ``they close the doors on us''
when it comes to negotiating the region's $410 billion debt.
   Venezuela suffered looting and rioting in February after Perez
announced economic reforms, with 300 people listed officially as
killed.

<HEAD>FTC Chairman Says States Must Regulate Cosmetic Surgery Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators, not the federal government,
must take the lead against false and misleading advertising and
promotions involving cosmetic surgery and other medical procedures,
a federal official said Wednesday.
   That assertion by Daniel Oliver, chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, was challenged by other officials who told a
congressional panel that states sometimes are hampered by federal
policies.
   Oliver said ``False and misleading advertising for cosmetic
surgery is, and should be, a matter of concern to all agencies and
organizations, public and private, at both the federal and state
level.''
   But, he added, ``Such procedures are generally practiced and
promoted at a local level and, therefore, consumer protection must,
at least initially, be the prime responsibility of the state
medical boards and the state consumer protection authorities.''
   Oliver also rejected any commission responsibility for physician
competency in an appearance before the House subcommittee on
regulation, business opportunities and energy.
   But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said
Oliver's view was ``an absurd rewriting of the FTC role in
protection of consumers.''
   He said Oliver was trying ``to make the states ... take the lead
in areas the states say they are powerless to deal with.''
   Richard G. Gannon, executive director of the Kansas Board of
Healing Arts told the subcommittee the issue of false and deceptive
medical advertising is too complex and costly for the states to
handle.
   ``Various FTC and court rulings have made it extremely difficult
to discipline a doctor solely on the basis of advertising with the
exception of the most blatant violations,'' Gannon said, although
he was unable to provide an example.
   Oliver contended the commission's antitrust law enforcement
program presented no obstacles to effective state regulation and
said rules that might suppress broad categories of truthful
advertising were not the answer to the problem.
   Instead, Oliver said, the agency's 1979 order lifting the ban on
medical advertising and all subsequent orders expressly instructs
or permits medical professionals ``to deal effectively with all
forms of deceptive advertising.''
   But Gannon said the only recent communication his state has had
with the FTC was when the commission questioned whether the state's
censure of two doctors for deceptive and misleading advertising
might place illegitimate restrainst on truthful advertising.
   ``Contacts by federal agencies whenever such actions are taken
does cause consternations and may have a chilling effect if the
result is to become embroiled in actions brought by the Federal
Trade Commission,'' Gannon said.
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., suggested state regulators could
remove federal jurisdiction from issues like medical advertising
through action by state legislatures.
   Dr. Hugh Johnston, chairman of Oregon's Board of Medical
Examiners, testified he'd been instructed by the state attorney
general ``to stay out of advertising'' because the state couldn't
be sure of what constituted false advertising.

<HEAD>District Drops Plans for Teen Curfew</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia has abandoned plans
to impose a curfew on teen-agers as part of an effort to reduce
illegal narcotics sales and drug-related violence in the nation's
capital, city officials said Wednesday.
   Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Richey struck
down a proposed city curfew law, ruling that the measure violated
constitutionally protected freedom of association and free speech
rights.
   The judge earlier had struck down a more restrictive curfew
measure.
   Charles Pearson, a spokesman for district councilmember Frank
Smith, said Smith, who had helped draft the two previous bills, had
expressed no intention of writing a third.
   John C. White, a spokesman for Mayor Marion Barry, said neither
Barry nor other top city officials intended to pursue the matter.
   The curfew, aimed at keeping teens from congregating in the
district's notorious open-air drug markets, would have prohibited
anyone under 18 from gathering outside after 11 p.m. Sunday through
Thursday and after midnight on Friday and Saturday. The curfew
would have been lifted each day at 6 a.m.
   The city's second curfew bill included exemptions for teens
traveling in cars or with their parents or when returning from
work. In addition, those returning from school and church-related
functions also were exempt.
   However, Richey ruled that the measure would have subjected
thousands of law-abiding city teen-agers to ``virtual house
arrest.''
   The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union brought
both suits against the city.

   The prospect that Rep. Tom Foley will
replace Jim Wright as speaker of the House was greeted
enthusiastically Wednesday in the majority leader's home state and
congressional district.
   ``It's no secret that we feel he would be the best choice for
the job,'' said Karen Marchioro, state Democratic Central Committee
chairwoman. ``Personally, he's very urbane and civil. He's a rock,
really, and right now, that may be what we need.''
   Foley has been a steadfast supporter of Wright, and during
appearances in Washington state last week repeatedly urged the
speaker not to step down. But in the wake of a House ethics
investigation into his financial dealings, Wright said he would ask
for a Democratic caucus in the House to elect a new speaker on
Tuesday.
   Foley, a 13-term congressman, is not expected to face a
challenge to succeed Wright by moving up from his No. 2 position in
the House Democratic leadership.
   Foley, 60, was a protege of Washington state's two most powerful
politicians, the late Sens. Warren Magnuson and Henry M. ``Scoop''
Jackson.
   A self-described parliamentarian and pragmatist, Foley is best
known for his attempts to build bipartisan coalitions, rather than
clinging to party ideologies.
   ``Although I wish to proclaim I've always been totally satisfied
with the innocence of Speaker Wright, I think that (Foley's
speakership) will be a tremendous boon to the state of Washington,
to the eastern district of the state, and to the nation,'' said
Carl Maxey, a prominent Spokane lawyer and Democrat.
   ``Tom Foley's my good friend,'' said Maxey. ``I would personally
advise him to beware of being too compromising with these
Republicans, because I'm satisfied the actions against the
Democrats are a political ploy, much like the McCarthyism of the
'50's.
   ``He's going to have to learn to fight.''
   In his 13 campaigns, Foley has rarely had to fight, earning a
reputation for gentlemanliness and always saying nice things about
outgunned opponents in his largely rural 5th Congressional District.
   ``He certainly represents a district that would be one of the
more conservative districts in the state, but he represents our
party well,'' said Mrs. Marchioro. ``He's got to be, next to Scoop
and Maggie (Magnuson), one of the most popular elected officials in
this state.''

   The burden of ending what House Speaker Jim
Wright called ``this season of bad will'' now rests with Thomas S.
Foley, the Washington Democrat who will inherit Wright's job next
week. And virtually no one thinks there's a better man for the
challenge.
   Foley, who presided over the House on Wednesday as Wright
defended his honor and abdicated his office, will lay full claim to
the gavel when he is formally elected to Congress' most powerful
job. He will bring to the speakership a less partisan style that
fits perfectly with President Bush's call for accommodation between
the executive and legislative branches.
   As House majority leader, Foley, 60, has won admiration from
both sides of the aisle for his command of issues and tireless
negotiating skills. He is a master at finding consensus and
striking compromise.
   Wright acknowledged in his farewell address that ``perhaps'' he
had been ``too partisan, too insistent, too abrasive, too
determined to have my way.'' Foley is none of those things, as any
Republican will tell you _ to the dismay of some Democrats.
   Like Wright, Foley's political roots trace to the New Deal of
Franklin Roosevelt, but he is no knee-jerk liberal _ and wouldn't
have lasted in the House if he were. Unlike most leaders whose
seats are ``safe,'' he is from a distinctly Republican and
conservative district that has put him through many close
elections, though he won last year with 77 percent of the vote.
   Though hand-picked for the House's elite by Wright and his
predecessor, former Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, Foley never
shared their penchant for bashing the Reagan-Bush administration or
other Republican opponents. O'Neill admired Foley most for
qualities he admittedly didn't possess himself _ meticulous
craftsmanship of legislation, thorough command of the issues,
attention to organizational detail.
   ``Tom Foley,'' O'Neill once said, in both exasperation and
respect, ``is a man who can see three sides of every issue.''
   ``The reality is that in a modern, participatory Congress ...
the responsibility of leadership and the necessity of leadership is
to constantly involve members in the process of decision and
consensus,'' Foley says.
   According to Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., the troika of Wright,
Foley and soon-to-resign Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California
has worked like this: ``Jim ... the captain, Tony the oar drummer
and Tom the navigator. Democrats in the House and most Republicans
have great respect for the navigator.''
   Foley's office furnishings reflect his eclectic approach.
Instead of the big, imposing desk preferred by most members of
Congress, he has a coffee table surrounded by enough sofas and
chairs to accommodate at least 18 visitors. He does his paperwork
at a small writing table in the corner.
   And Foley and his coffee table have been at the center of some
of the most important legislation, invariably compromises, to
emerge from Congress in this decade.
   Just this year, Foley was host of the extraordinary talks that
in mid-April produced a budget agreement for the next fiscal year,
and he was pivotal in the bipartisan deal with the Bush
administration over Central America policy.
   A year earlier, he chaired the economic summit sessions that
followed the October 1987 crash of the stock market. Prior to that,
he engineered the final agreements on the Gramm-Rudman budget law,
and arms control policies shared by Congress and the White House.
   ``Tom Foley is just a very able, capable individual,'' says Bob
Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader. ``He's well-liked
on our side, and he's also recognized as a very formidable
opponent, one who will state the case well, and is eminently fair.''
   ``He's a man of total integrity,'' said Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``He knows the players, knows the issues.'' And
this, from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``I wish he were a Republican.
If he were, he could be a presidential candidate.''

<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., is in line to become Speaker of the House next week with
the resignation of Jim Wright. But a scramble is underway for other
Democratic leadership posts.
   Foley, who has been in the No. 2 post for the past 2{ years, was
the only candidate for the top House position although he did no
campaigning for the post prior to Wright's announcement.
   ``Now there is a vacancy,'' Foley spokesman Jeff Biggs said late
Wednesday, adding that he expected Foley would begin calling his
colleagues.
   A caucus of the ruling Democrats was scheduled for Tuesday to
nominate Foley for the speakership.
   Jockeying was intense for the other top party positions, which
will turn over both because of Wright's resignation and the
announcement last week by the third-ranking House Democrat,
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., that he would step down.
   It was not immediately clear on Wednesday whether those
positions would all be elected at Tuesday's caucus, but party
leaders were said to be eager to get the party organized and moving
forward in the wake of its unprecedented congressional crisis.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who ran unsuccessfully for
the Democratic presidential nomination last year, was considered
the favorite to replace Foley as the majority leader. His
competitor for the post was Rep. Ed Jenkins, a more conservative
Georgia Democrat.
   The race for Coelho's post of majority whip, the speaker's chief
vote-counter, was a wide-open contest among several prominent party
members, including:
   _William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, currently the chairman of
the House Democratic Caucus. Gray is fighting bad publicity from
reports that the Justice Department is conducting a preliminary
inquiry into allegations that a no-show employee was carried on his
office payroll.
   _David Bonior of Michigan, currently the chief deputy whip.
   _Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   _Henry Waxman of California, a powerful member of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Two lawmakers were running to become Democratic Caucus chairman,
Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut.

   Sen. Richard Lugar will represent the United
States at the inauguration Thursday of Alfredo Cristiani as
president of El Salvador, Lugar's office said Wednesday.
   Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, headed the U.S. delegation that observed the 1988
provincial and municipal elections in the war-torn Central American
state.
   President Bush will be in London on Thursday at the conclusion
of his European trip.
   Cristiani, a member of the right-wing Arena party, succeeds
ailing President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat known
for his moderate views.
   Cristiani, a U.S.-educated businessman, has impressed members of
Congress during visits here both before and after his landslide
election victory on March 19.
   But some U.S. lawmakers worry about what they regard as
extremist elements within his political party.
   Some Arena party members are accused of having links with
death-squad activities and are scornful of U.S. emphasis on
protection of human rights, contending it impairs the war effort of
the Salvadoran army against leftist guerrillas.
   But the Bush administration appears to have convinced Congress
that El Salvador should continue to receive substantial U.S.
military aid, arguing successfully that Cristiani should not be
penalized before he even takes office.
   Administration officials and congressional sources have said
U.S. military aid to El Salvador in fiscal 1990 is expected to
remain at $85 million, about $12 million less than the State
Department had requested.
   Lugar planned private meetings with both Cristiani and Duarte
and will play host on Thursday to all foreign officials and
dignitaries attending the inauguration.
   ``These are exciting times in which change toward greater
freedom is sweeping the world,'' Lugar said in a statement.
   ``But we must all remember that with burgeoning freedom comes
sobering responsibilities for leaders everywhere _ responsibilities
to protect human rights such as free speech and peaceful life.''

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble lost at least $300
million because Kimberly-Clark copied the design of its
super-absorbent diapers, an attorney said Wednesday in final
arguments in a federal lawsuit over Pampers and Huggies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast it would make that much money annually
from its super-absorbent Pampers, said attorney Allen Gerstein, who
was representing the soap, toiletries and disposable diaper giant.
   But sales were $150 million below projections in each of fiscal
years 1986-87 and 1987-88 after Kimberly-Clark violated the Pampers
patent and introduced super-absorbent Huggies, Gerstein told U.S.
District Judge Falcon Hawkins.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble wants Hawkins to order
Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing super-absorbent Huggies and to
remove them from store shelves. The company also is seeking
unspecified money damages.
   About $3.3 billion worth of disposable diapers are sold each
year, according to industry officials. Procter &amp; Gamble is the
industry leader with about 47 percent of the market while
Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   Hawkins is expected to rule in the non-jury case sometime this
summer. If he decides Kimberly-Clark is liable, damages will be
determined in a separate proceeding.
   Twenty-three witnesses testified and about 4,100 exhibits were
introduced during 17 days of testimony in the trial that began last
month.
   Procter &amp; Gamble contends that researchers Paul Weisman and
Steve Goldman developed a way to combine wood pulp fluff and super
absorbent materials in diapers to allow them to be made thinner.
   The company has argued that Kimberly-Clark violated its patent
on the process when it later introduced its super-absorbent Huggies.
   But Kimberly-Clark says Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S.
Patent Office.
   Patent attorney V. Bryan Medlock Jr., representing
Kimberly-Clark, testified that if the patent office's examining
officer had known about earlier work on a similar process by an
Italian inventor, the patent would never have been issued to
Procter &amp; Gamble.
   In his closing arguments, Medlock said, ``Kimberly-Clark
totally, independently developed its Huggies super-trim diapers.''
   The super absorbent material in Procter &amp; Gamble's test-marketed
diapers did not work well, Medlock said, and they leaked.
   Procter &amp; Gamble addressed the problem in later versions of its
diaper products that included concentrating areas of super
absorbers and manufacturing double-layered diapers.
   The trial is being held here because Kimberly-Clark has a a
diaper manufacturing plant at Beech Island, near the Georgia border.

   A Justice Department investigation into the
personnel practices of Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting delegate to Congress, has been extended to examine all
of his hiring records for the last five years, The Associated Press
has learned.
   As part of the wide-ranging inquiry, a grand jury intends to
begin hearing testimony from current and former employees of
Fauntroy, a Democrat, and Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., over Fauntroy's
hiring of Savage's son, according to sources familiar with the
investigation.
   Thomas John Savage, the son of Rep. Savage, was paid $21,398
while on Fauntroy's payroll between September 1987 and June 1988,
but swore on Illinois election documents that he was living in
Chicago during that time. Those records were filed as part of his
unsuccessful bid to win an Illinois House seat.
   Individuals from the Fauntroy and Savage offices will be
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury within the next month, and
investigators have already subpoenaed payroll documents and office
personnel data from the two congressmen, said sources, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   Those records have been requested to determine whether the
younger Savage, his father or Fauntroy falsified payroll documents
or offered false statements to investigators.
   Fauntroy and Rep. Savage declined to comment when asked whether
documents from their offices had been requested by federal
authorities.
   When contacted by telephone in Chicago, Thomas John Savage
declined to comment Wednesday.
   In addition, investigators are examining the personal banking
records of Thomas Savage to learn whether he returned any money to
his father or Fauntroy, the sources said.
   Investigators are also closely examining accounts of the younger
Savage's job duties submitted voluntarily to federal officials by
Johnny Barnes, Fauntroy's chief aide, and several other Fauntroy
staffers, sources said.
   Barnes refused to comment on the documents when contacted
Wednesday by a reporter.
   While the statements from Fauntroy's staffers describe Thomas
Savage as regularly showing up for work, the AP has reported that
investigators have been told that the younger Savage showed up in
Rep. Savage's Chicago office on an almost-daily basis during the
period he was supposedly in Washington.
   On several occasions, the AP reported, office workers there
allegedly were told by staffers in Rep. Savage's Washington office
to keep the younger Savage away from windows to prevent anyone
passing the storefront office from seeing him.
   The FBI opened the case with a 90-day preliminary investigation
in December, shortly after the AP reported on Fauntroy's hiring of
the younger Savage.
   Officials at the Justice Department's Criminal Division then
recommended that Atorney General Dick Thornburgh appoint a special
prosecutor to look into the case under the terms an order by his
predecessor, Edwin Meese III. That rule, instituted by Meese just
days before he left office last August, required an independent
prosecutor to examine cases of alleged wrongdoing by members of
Congress.
   However, Thornburgh scuttled the Meese order and turned the
probe back to the Justice Department's criminal division, which
traditionally handles such cases.

   House members, reacting to Jim Wright's
emotional resignation speech, said Wednesday they supported the
speaker's decision to step down because charges of ethics
violations had ended his chance to be an effective leader.
   ``The price paid was so disproportional, but he did the only
thing he could do,'' said Wright defender Charles Wilson, D-Texas,
citing an ``emotional burden'' that made it ``impossible to go on.''
   Wright ``correctly recognized the utility of his speakership was
over,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who was chairman of a panel
that wrote many of the ethics rules.
   President Bush praised Wright, a fellow Texan, saying in a
statement, ``In spite of the present situation, I believe the
Wright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication to the
Congress of the United States.''
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said he hoped members listened
carefully to Wright's urging that Democrats refrain from thoughts
of avenging the resignation, and that Republicans not try to
retaliate for the defeat earlier this year of the nomination of
John Tower for secretary of defense.
   ``He did an awful lot of good as speaker,'' Frost added.
   Immediately after Wright made his announcement, Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas, stood at the same podium on the House floor and
expressed his fears about the ``evil wind blowing in the halls of
Congress.''
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, former chairman of the ethics
committee, warned that if the present mood remains ``the end result
will be to destroy this institution as we know it today.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Wright's
resignation was a sad time for the House and for Wright, but added,
``It is also an unprecedented opportunity for the House to begin a
bipartisan, comprehensive reformation of this institution and its
rules.''
   And Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said the House is ``like a war
zone right now where you don't know when the next bomb is going to
drop.'' He said a time for healing is needed, but warned that if
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed the original
charges against Wright, ``wants to engage in open warfare, there
will be a Democratic response.''
   Gingrich, who waged a vigorous public battle against Wright,
avoided reporters as he left the House chamber after Wright's
speech.
   But Richard Viguerie, chairman of the United Conservatives of
America, said, ``Liberal Democrats can obviously dish it out to
good and decent conservatives ... but they can't stand the heat in
the kitchen. The ethics war they started has turned against them.
Conservatives don't want scalps. They want fairness.''
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who was involved in Wright's
defense, said Wright's ``parting gift was a warning to stop'' the
vengeance.
   Torricelli said Wright had no choice but to resign rather than
fight the charges. ``He knew what the toll of that battle might
be,'' the New Jersey congressman said.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., expected to be elected majority
leader after the elevation of Majority Leader Thomas Foley to
speaker, praised Wright's record.
   ``Under Jim's leadership the House passed legislation on trade
reform, plant closing, the drug problem, welfare reform, housing,
aid for the homeless, clean water and other important measures,''
Gephardt said. ``Jim has a record of public service that he can be
proud of.''
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, head of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee, said his party planned to use the
resignation as a campaign issue unless Democrats passed an election
reform package acceptable to the GOP.
   ``I feel truly sorry for Wright as a human being'' he added, but
called the Wright case an example of corruption that occurs when
one party is in control of an institution for too long.
   ``I believe that in his heart he doesn't believe he did anything
wrong,'' Vander Jagt said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., called Wright's speech ``a very
poignant, emotional moment in American history. It was almost like
Hamlet, a prince on his knees.''
   ``He missed his calling; he should have been a trial lawyer,''
Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio. ``If he had been giving a summation to a
jury he would have walked.''

protesters who had shouted ``Freedom! Freedom!'' and demonstrated
for two hours against what they said was harassment of ethnic
Albanians by Yugoslav authorities.
   The demonstration was held in front of the downtown university
dormitory, and the rally and dispersal were witnessed by an
Associated Press reporter.
   Officers moved in at about 10:30 p.m. after a brief warning to
the demonstrators to disperse. Police launched tear gas canisters
and charged the protesters with truncheons.
   Demonstrators ran in panic inside dormitory buildings. Windows
and glass doors were shattered in the shuffle.
   Several protesters were seen being taken away in police vans
after the action.
   However, no one appeared to have been seriously injured and the
police action took about five minutes.
   This was the second day of protest against constitutional
changes passed in March that gave greater control over this
Albanian-dominated region to Serbia, of which Kosovo has been an
autonomous province.
   On Tuesday about 2,000 demonstrators, demanding to see a
visiting European Parliament's delegation, probing alleged human
rights violations in Kosovo, dispersed peacefully.
   In Belgrade, Yugoslav Premier Ante Markovic on Wednesday told
the delegation it would be allowed to meet prominent ethnic
Albanian dissidents.
   ``We were not able to fulfill our task in Kosovo because we were
not given the opportunity to meet with people from the other
side,'' Danish member Frode Kristoffersen said after the delegation
cut short its visit to Kosovo.
   The five-member delegation arrived in Pristina on Tuesday during
a new outbreak of unrest in which one ethnic Albanian died in
nearby Podujevo.
   Martine Charriot-Schneider, secretary of the mission, said the
group had planned to stay in Kosovo ``for three full days, but we
are leaving after 13 hours.''
   ``We are quite disappointed because the talks with ethnic
Albanian intellectuals and other members of the opposition were
absolutely necessary,'' Lilo Seibel-Emmeling, a West German member,
said.
   About 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million people are ethnic
Albanians. The Serbian minority complains of discrimination in the
southern province, which borders on Albania and is an ancient
Serbian heartland.
   Giorgio Rosetti, an Italian member, said the delegation had been
kept from meeting six Kosovo legislators who voted against the
constitutional amendments and who he said were indicted and now are
awaiting trial.
   He complained that Markovic would not arrange a visit to jails
housing ethnic Albanians accused of organizing demonstrations and
riots in February and March.
   The unrest killed at least 24 people and a state of emergency
was declared in the province.
   At least 60,000 ethnic Albanians took part in protests after
Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, adopted the constitutional
amendments providing greater control.
   About 800 ethnic Albanians were arrested and 237, including
former provincial Communist Party chief Azem Vllasi and other
prominent politicians, businessmen and intellectuals, were detained
without charge under federal emergency laws.
   At least 47 are still being held in isolation around Kosovo.
   Members of the European Parliament's delegation, headed by
Julian Grimaldos of Spain, said they also wanted to talk to Vllasi,
who is awaiting trial.
   ``Even though we were officially invited by the Yugoslav
government, we have a feeling they wanted to shorten our visit,''
Ms. Charriot-Schneider said. ``The conditions of the visit made us
fail in doing our job.''

   House Speaker Jim Wright resigned his
leadership post Wednesday under a cloud of ethics charges, becoming
the first speaker in the nation's history to step down under fire
in mid-term.
   ``Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation
for all this season of bad will,'' Wright said near the end of an
emotional hour-long defense against allegations of financial
wrongdoing.
   He said he also would resign his congressional seat before the
end of June, ending a 34-year career as a representative from Texas.
   Wright spoke to a hushed, nearly packed chamber, with his wife
Betty and his daughter Virginia sitting in the visitors' gallery.
Mrs. Wright wept when he announced his decision to resign.
   ``All of us in both parties must resolve to bring this period of
mindless cannibalism to an end. There's been enough of it,'' Wright
declared, asking fellow Democrats not to try to get even with
Republicans.
   Colleagues gave him a standing ovation, and Wright removed his
glasses and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief.
   President Bush issued a statement saying, ``In spite of the
present situation, I believe the Wright tenure was one of
effectiveness and dedication.'' He wished Wright and his wife well.
   Wright's move cleared the way for the elevation to the
speakership of Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and for a
string of other changes that would complete a shift to a new,
post-World War II generation of leaders in Congress.
   The resignation, which will become effective after the new
speaker is elected by the House on Tuesday, came after a year-long,
$1.5 million investigation by the House ethics committee that led
to formal charges that Wright violated House rules in 69 instances.
   Many of the specific charges involved two main allegations:
   _That he used bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of a Public
Man,'' to hide contributions from groups to which he had spoken.
   _That he received $145,000 in benefits, including a no-work job
for his wife, from George Mallick, a Fort Worth businessman with an
alleged direct interest in legislation before Congress.
   The charges, which preoccupied Capitol Hill in recent weeks,
caused widespread concern among the Democrats who elected Wright
speaker three years ago that his effectiveness as the party's
highest elected leader had been permanently damaged. Some also
indicated, usually in private, that they were worried the issue
would hurt them in next year's elections.
   The ethics committee postponed a meeting that had been scheduled
for Thursday to take action on Wright's motion to dismiss the most
serious charges. One Democratic source sympathetic to Wright said
he believed the ethics panel now would drop the case entirely.
   In his floor speech, Wright argued forcefully and in detail
against the charges, contending Mrs. Wright had researched
investments for the small company owned by the Wrights and the
Mallicks and earned her salary and the use of a car and condominium
Mallick provided. And he repeated his contention that Mallick had
no direct interest in legislation.
   Wright also contended his book was not a scheme to evade outside
earnings limits, as the ethics panel alleged, but a legitimate
publishing venture.
   He challenged the ethics enforcement process, which he said had
been ``agonizing'' for him, and suggested it should be reformed.
``Perhaps we might want to consider outright aboliton of all
honoraria and speaking fees altogether,'' in exchange for an
increase in federal pay.
   Wright repeatedly wiped his brow during his speech. At times his
hands were shaking. He worked alone in his office on the statement,
then walked to the House floor to deliver it.
   His resignation had been expected since last week, when his
lawyers and members of the House ethics committee discussed the
possibility of an arrangement under which some of panel's major
charges against him would be dismissed in return for his giving up
the speakership.
   Wright himself has consistently denied knowingly violating
ethics rules, but his political support among Democrats in the
House eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically
investigated his finances.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said the resignation would not hurt the
House.
   ``What it really represents is the moving of a new generation of
political power into this place,'' Obey said, alluding to the
earlier selection of Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, as the Senate
majority leader. ``With the ascent of Foley into the leadership you
have a total changing of the guard.''
   Foley, in a statement, called Wright ``a symbol of constancy,
courage and commitment to principle'' who would go down in history
as ``a great speaker.''
   Some Wright supporters were bitter.
   ``There is an evil wind blowing in the halls of Congress that is
reminiscent of the Spanish inquisition,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas.
   Added Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who listened to Wright's
defense in the House chamber: ``After 35 years of effective and
able service to his state and to the nation, Jim deserves better
than this.''
   ``The whole last year has been a living nightmare for him,''
said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
   The House Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois, said while
the resignation was a sad moment for the House and personal tragedy
for Wright, ``it is also an unprecedented opportunity for the House
to begin a bipartisan, comprehensive reformation of the institution
and its rules.''
   One Democratic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wright had concluded last week that he would have to resign after
he received word that the ethics committee was poised to reject his
motion to dismiss the most serious charges.
   Few took the Wright matter seriously in December 1987, when Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., announced plans to file a complaint against
the speaker with the ethics committee. Common Cause, the government
watchdog group, called for an investigation five months later.
   The ethics panel opened deliberations June 2.
   The 100th Congress adjourned on Oct. 22, with one of the most
productive records of recent years under Wright's leadership, and
the ethics committee continued to take testimony into the fall and
winter. Wright was re-elected as speaker on Jan. 3.
   On April 3, Wright conceded that he might have
``unintentionally'' and ``technically'' violated some rules, but
defended his intentions as good.
   As the House reeled from nearly daily allegations of new
scandals, ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said
Wednesday that innuendoes of wrongdoing were ``getting out of
hand.''
   The latest to hit the Capitol was word from government sources
that the FBI was investigating allegations that Rep. Bill Gray,
D-Pa., had a no-show employee on his payroll. Gray denied
wrongdoing.
   Gray is a candidate for majority whip, the No. 3 Democratic
leadership post left vacant by the weekend resignation announcement
of Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. The Pennsylvanian questioned the
timing of the word about the investigation.
   Coelho faced his own ethics problems over a junk bond
investment, and said he was choosing to get out rather than subject
the party to another protracted ethics probe.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the city Jim Wright represented for
34 years, the House speaker's resignation Wednesday prompted fear,
sorrow, anger at Republicans and little surprise.
   ``Anybody who knows anything of the American political process
knows the loss of the speakership is a major loss for this area,''
said Mayor Bob Bolen, whose city has long counted Wright as a major
asset in attacting defense jobs.
   Officials said it may be impossible to rebuild the political
power or match the economic gain the region enjoyed from Wright's
34-year tenure and his leadership in the Democratic Party.
   ``We just lost our right arm in Fort Worth,'' state Rep. Doyle
Willis, who represents the city in the Texas House, said in Austin.
``I think he got a dirty Republican deal. I think they were after
him, and they finally got him.''
   Wright resigned under a cloud of ethics charges.
   ``I disagree with Mr. Wright's implication that he was treated
unfairly,'' said Texas Republican Party Chairman Fred Meyer of
Dallas. Meyer said the House ethics committee, which investigated
and charged Wright with violations of House rules, acted in a fair
and bipartisan manner.
   Gov. Bill Clements, the state's only Republican governor this
century, praised Wright's efforts for Texas.
   ``This is not a good day for Texas,'' Clements said. ``Jim
Wright has done a fine job representing the state in Washington,
D.C., and his years of service and leadership in Congress will be
sorely missed.''
   As pressure against Wright grew this week, Texas politicians
began talking about potential replacements. State Sen. Hugh Parmer,
a Fort Worth Democrat, was frequently mentioned to serve the
remainder of Wright's 18th term in the House.
   Clements can call a special election no sooner than 30 days and
no later than 90 days after the date of resignation. Wright said he
would step down as speaker as soon as his colleagues choose a
replacement and that he would resign his House seat by the end of
June.
   The executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, Ed Martin,
predicted trouble for the GOP if a Republican tries to win Wright's
seat.
   ``I don't think there'd be a real reservoir of good feeling
towards Republicans,'' Martin said. ``If I were a Republican, I
think I'd wear a flak jacket in Fort Worth.''
   Parmer, who describes Wright as his ``oldest and closest
political friend,'' said Wright's decision was ``a loss for all of
us.''
   ``Nothing that has occurred can take away from the immense good
this man has done for his district, Texas and for America. Hungry
children eat because of Jim Wright. Homeless people have hope
because of Jim Wright. American boys are not dying in Central
America because of Jim Wright,'' said Parmer.
   In Wright's 12th Congressional District, people gathered around
televisions in an electronics shop to watch his resignation speech
to the House.
   ``I think it's horrible,'' said Lynn Bratcher. ``He's the only
one I could call on for help when I needed help. ... He's the only
one that has ever really done anything for anyone for Texas.
   ``I think it's a shame and disgrace that the news media has
challenged his integrity.''
   At a federal office, workers turned on the radio and cheered as
Wright defended himself in his hour-long speech. One woman yelled
``Touche!'' as Wright dismissed the ethics committee's charges.
   Minutes later they fell silent as Wright said, ``I give you back
this job ....''
   The employees went back to work. They declined to give their
names.
   In Weatherford, the ranching town about 30 miles west of Forth
Worth where Wright grew up and served as mayor in 1950-54, Mayor
Sherry Watson called his resignation plans ``truly awful.''
   ``Jim has done us a wonderful job up there and I was truly
hoping that he would continue on,'' said Ms. Watson.
   ``Being the third most powerful man in Washington, he was able
to do a lot for all of us. This is an attack on Texas. I am anxious
for people in Texas to pick up from this and go on,'' she said.

   Showers and thunderstorms drenched sections of the Midwest on
Wednesday, threatening floods in sections of Ohio and Michigan.
   Rain and thunderstorms also doused southern Iowa, southern
Wisconsin, northern Illinois and northwest Indiana.
   The precipitation came from a cold front stretching from the
upper Great Lakes region across the middle Mississippi Valley to
the Texas Panhandle.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell along the front from
southwest Texas to western Missouri.
   In Ohio and Michigan, saturated ground, swollen rivers and
streams and the threat of more heavy rainfall prompted flood
watches Wednesday night for the southern two thirds of Michigan and
the northern third of Ohio.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included almost an inch at Youngstown, Ohio, more than two-thirds
of an inch at Dubois, Pa., and a half inch at Houghton Lake, Mich.
   The temperature differed as much as 30 degrees across the cold
front in Kansas. Northwest Kansas had temperatures in the mid-50s,
while southeast Kansas had readings in the mid-80s.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms fell across the
northern Rockies. Light snow fell across southwest Wyoming before
sunrise and an inch of snow dusted the mountains near Pinedale, Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees in Rock Springs, Wyo., to 96 degrees in Carlsbad, N.M., and
in Laredo and Beeville, Texas. The low for the 48 contiguous states
was 20 degrees in Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from New England to the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, the
middle Mississippi Valley, parts of Oklahoma and west Texas, with
thunderstorms most numerous from the lower Great Lakes to the
middle Mississippi Valley; and widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the Florida Peninsula, parts of the northern and
central Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley, central and eastern
Colorado and southeast Wyoming.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s across the upper
Great Lakes and sections of the central Rockies and central Plains;
the 90s from the desert Southwest to the southern Rockies, much of
southern and eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley, the
Gulf Coast states, the Tennessee Valley and the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast; near 100 degrees along the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas; and in the 70s and 80s in the rest of the nation.

   (Wrights offers for the record affidavits from five individuals
who attest that Mrs. Wright earned her $18,000 salary.)
   ... The outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested
that Mrs. Wright's employment somehow amounted to a gift. ...
   Does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes? So many
pages of typed manuscript? She wasn't a carpenter. Is a woman's
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a
work product? ...
   For most of her adult life Mrs. Wright has been a business
person, been an officer in a large hotel, an officer in a
successful real estate and construction firm, a professional staff
person on a congressional committee.
   She was making more than $18,000 when she worked at the
congressional committee.
   And here's the irony. The supreme irony.
   In 1976, when I was elected majority leader, Betty voluntarily
left her job as a professional staff person on the committee so as
to avoid any criticism ...
   Now it just seems to me there isn't any justification at all for
anybody's even raising questions about whether she earned her
$18,000 a year. ... Betty (also) had the use of a company car. That
is true, she did. ...
   I want to do the right thing, the honorable thing.
   I bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds. ...
What more can I do. Does that make it right?
   Now concerning the apartment ... We didn't think there was
anything wrong with paying a per diem rate. ... We paid on a daily
basis for our use of that apartment. ...
   Nevertheless, last year I said to George Mallick, I said, I want
to buy the apartment. ... I paid the amount suggested and appraised
by two real estate persons in Fort Worth, $58,000. ... I just
wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say if we've made a
mistake we've done what we can to set things right. I don't think
we've violated any rules. ...
   The second alleged violation continues on the assumption ...
that George Mallick, our friend and business partner, had a direct
interest in influencing legislation, which would make it illegal
for us to accept gifts from him.
   ... I've known this man for more than 25 years. He's been my
friend ... Never once in all the years that I've known this man has
he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation.
...
   Not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any
institution in which he has an interest. ...
   Now the only other basic question, it's just one that remains,
in the statement of alleged violations, concerns the sale of a
book, a little book now you'll recall ``Reflections of a Public
Man'' which I wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities.
   People who took it and gave it away to other people _ students,
newspapers, public officials and members of their organizations.
   And I wanted them to. I wanted to get the widest possible
distribution of the book. ...
   Now, the contention ... is that this book project ... on which I
got $3.25 for every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a
subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and
violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of Congress. ...
   If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you think I
would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the
houses there that give you a big advance?
   It is true I think that people on my staff were eager to sell
these books. They knew I wanted them sold. I've got to accept some
responsibility for that if it was wrong, but the rule doesn't say
it was wrong. ...The rules expressly exempt royalty income. ... I
didn't intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and
I don't believe legally that I did. ...

   A U.S. writer for Soldier of Fortune
magazine who once fought with Afghan guerrillas died Wednesday of
gunshot and shrapnel wounds suffered during fighting between
Burmese troops and border rebels.
   Lance Eugene Motley, a 32-year-old West Point graduate from
Sacramento, Calif., was brought to Mae Sot hospital Tuesday night,
medical staff said.
   Police said Motley apparently crossed into Burma three days
earlier with ethnic Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo
Ra, which has been besieged by Burmese troops since May 18.
   Fighting has been intense in the jungles of this border region
since Burmese troops launched an offensive last October against the
rebels, who are fighting for autonomy from the central government.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Neil Klopfenstein confirmed the death
Wednesday of an American citizen ``after an incident on the
Thai-Burma border,'' but refused to give details.
   The monthly Soldier of Fortune magazine, which specializes in
combat and weaponry, said in a statement that Motley was in
Thailand to cover wars in Burma, Laos and Cambodia.
   It said he previously worked for the magazine in Guatamala, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Colombia, the Philippines and
Pakistan.
   In 1985, Motley traveled across Afghanistan's Hazarajat region
and reached Herat, Afghanistan's second largest city, the statement
said, adding that the Afghans nicknamed him the ``Bearded Mystic.''
   It said Motley ``fought with the mujahedeen (Islamic holy
warriors) against the communist puppet soldiers and Soviets for
some months until wounded.''
   The publication said he was traveling with the Karens when hit,
but did not say if he intended to fight with them.

   About 300 soldiers marched in formation near
student-occupied Tiananmen Square Thursday as conservative leaders
turned up the heat in their campaign against the pro-democracy
movement.
   The government's show of force was the first of its kind near
Tiananmen since a sit-in for a freer society with less corruption
began May 13.
   The troopers from the People's Liberation Army marched in front
of the Beijing Hotel near Tiananmen about 6:30 a.m. and turned down
a side street.
   It was not clear how many of the thousands of students camped in
the square saw the procession.
   ``I think they were just sent to try and scare us,'' said Wang
Di, a sophomore at Beijing Journalism Institute, who saw the troops
pass by. ``But I didn't think anyone was scared. They didn't come
that close and not many students knew they were there.''
   The government Wednesday held its first rally in response to six
weeks of pro-democracy protests. But a torched effigy of China's
most famous dissident and slogans supporting Premier Li Peng's
hard-line policies failed to rouse the 4,000 people who attended
the rally 20 miles outside Beijing.
   Many participants said officials told them to attend.
   Thousands of noisy marchers, meanwhile, trooped from Tiananmen
to police and Communist Party headquarters Wednesday night to
demand the resignation of Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who
have led the crackdown on the popular uprising for democracy.
   Conservatives are trying to discredit the student movement and
consolidate their position in a political power struggle with
moderates.
   The marchers, primarily students, beat drums, pots and pans, and
chanted ``Down with kidnapping!'' to protest the arrest this week
of three leaders of an independent labor union.
   Zhao Pinglu, head of the trade union that was formed in sympathy
with the pro-democracy movement, said the men were released
Wednesday after police questioned them for a day.
   The government rally at a stadium in Daxing county was staged by
supporters of conservative leaders who reportedly have stripped
moderate Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang of his post.
   ``We will oppose whoever opposes Li Peng,'' read one banner.
Others supported martial law for central Beijing, decreed by Li on
May 20 after more than 1 million people took to the streets to
demand more democracy and an end to corruption among officials.
   The government rally, attended by peasants, workers and high
school students, lacked the enthusiasm of the pro-democracy
demonstrations that have been mounted in major cities.
   The burning of effigies of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, an
outspoken dissident who has campaigned for democracy, and an
unidentified ``schemer,'' an apparent reference to Zhao, failed to
stir the listless crowd.
   Few people joined rally leaders in shouting ``long live the
Communist Party'' and other slogans. Some giggled and others waved
tiny flags instead.
   ``I think this is a sham,'' said a 26-year-old worker shortly
after the rally ended. ``As a citizen, I feel very indignant.''
   ``That's right,'' said onlookers.
   ``To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an
18-year-old high school student.
   Zhou Hong, a county official who organized the rally, said the
demonstration was to ``oppose turmoil'' created by a ``small group
of people'' for political goals.
   Beijing officials informed some foreign journalists Tuesday of
the Daxing march and two others in suburban Beijing. Nationwide TV
broadcast a brief segment of one of the marches during the evening
news.
   Large banners bearing slogans opposing ``bourgeois
liberalization'' and capitalism over socialism appeared on Beijing
hotels on Wednesday.
   Fang and a handful of other intellectuals were purged from the
party in the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign of 1987, which
began after the last round of student-led protests for democracy.
   But diplomatic and Chinese sources say a meeting of the party
Central Committee to ratify the purge of Zhao has been postponed
because the leadership remains divided.
   Sources say at least 200,000 military troops called to Beijing
to enforce martial law also are pawns in the power struggle going
on at the top levels.
   Tens of thousands of citizens mobilized to block troops from
entering Beijing after Li declared martial law.
   The march through central Beijing Wednesday night was much
smaller than other pro-democracy demonstrations of the past few
weeks, highlighting the difficulties faced by the students to keep
their movement alive despite continued government pressure.
   The government maintained a media blitz condemning the
occupation of Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, where about
10,000 students live in squatter camps to press their demands.

   U.S. military officials called off the search for
14 U.S. Marines missing after their helicopter crashed in the ocean
off Okinawa, and all are presumed dead, a spokesman for American
forces in Japan said Thursday.
   However, the Japanese coast guard continued its search for
survivors Thursday morning, replacing three boats that searched
overnight with seven boats and two aircraft, said spokesman
Toshiaki Kawabata.
   The U.S. spokesman, Marine Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, said
American efforts were called off Wednesday night.
   Eight other Marines aboard the helicopter were rescued after the
CH-46 Sea Knight, based at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, crashed just before
midnight Tuesday soon after taking off from the USS Denver in an
amphibious training exercise.
   By Thursday morning, the search in calm waters off Kiyan Cape
found only four pieces of metal, all believed to be from the
helicopter, said Kawabata, of the Okinawa office of the Maritime
Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   The pilot was not wearing night-vision goggles, said Capt. Lenny
Ryan, spokesman at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station.
   There is no requirement that night vision goggles be worn during
night operations, although they significantly enhance vision by
amplifying ambient light, said Maj. Kerry Gershaneck, public
affairs officer at the air station.
   He did not comment on whether lack of goggles could have figured
in the crash.
   Four survivors are in good condition and being treated for
injuries at Camp Lester Hospital in Okinawa, said Gershaneck.
   He identified them as Lance Cpl. Keith A. Brower, 20, of Washoe
County, Nev.; Lance Cpl. Marvin T. Cook, 22, of Bonneville County,
Idaho; Cpl. George S. Sanchez, 20, of Denton County, Texas, and
Pfc. Jason S. Wiggins, 18, of Ouachita Parish, La.
   Gershaneck said the following four survivors were treated and
released back to duty on the Denver: Sgt. John R. Becker, 24, of
St. Tammany Parish, La.; Lance Cpl. David M. Fleming-Jones, 19, of
Pierce County, Wash.; Cpl. William R. West, 22, of Jefferson
County, Colo., and Hospitalman 3d Class J.K. Largent, 23, of
Barboursville County, W.Va.
   Identifications of the missing Marines were being withheld until
the families were notified.
   Investigation into the crash is continuing, Gershaneck said.
   The helicopter disappeared at 11:55 p.m. Tuesday about 35 miles
south of Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa, and the search by U.S.
vessels continued until 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Rodrigues.
   It was the third crash of a U.S. military helicopter in East
Asia this year.
   Nineteen Marines were killed and 16 injured March 20 when a
CH-53D Sea Stallion crashed and four were killed March 17 in the
crash of a CH-46. Both helicopters went down in South Korea during
joint military exercises, and the causes have not been announced.

<HEAD>Chile's Military Goverment, Opposition Agree on Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Pinochet announcement, details;

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lame-duck military President Augusto
Pinochet on Wednesday said his government and the opposition have
agreed on democratic reforms in Chile's constitution, including
replacing a ban on Marxism.
   In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, the
73-year-old president and army commander called the accord ``an
expression of the national will to find the best ways to achieve
the full democracy we all want.''
   Hours before Pinochet's speech, Patricio Aylwin, spokesman for a
17-party opposition coalition, said the parties gave ``a green
light'' to the changes drafted by the government for the 8-year-old
constitution written by the military.
   The agreement came after two months of unprecedented
negotiations between the 15-year-old right-wing military government
and its foes. The negotiations put Aylwin face-to-face with
Interior Minister Carlos Caceres, and leaders of two pro-government
conservative parties also took part.
   Pinochet came to power in a military coup in 1973 that toppled
the elected government of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   Pinochet is scheduled to hand over power on March 11, 1990, to
the winner of an election set for Dec. 14. He had to call the
election after his bid to extend his term until 1997 was
overwhelmingly rejected by voters in a referendum in October.
   Aylwin is considered the most likely opposition candidate in the
election.
   Full details of the proposed changes were not immediately
disclosed, but Pinochet said they include replacing a controversial
article banning Marxism with another that ``ensures in a better way
a responsible political pluralism.''
   The government also agreed to the opposition's demand to change
the make-up of the future Senate, he said. It had offered to
increase the number of elected senators from 36 to 38, diluting the
influence of nine appointed senators.
   Aylwin said the government did not accept all the reforms sought
by the opposition ``but there was some clear progress.''
   The government submit the proposed changes to the four-man
military junta. Junta approval is considered certain, as is
approval in a subsequent national referendum expected in August.
   Another article strongly opposed by the opposition establishes a
military-dominated National Security Council empowered to
``represent'' its views on key matters to future civilian
governments.
   Pinochet said that clause would also be amended but did not
elaborate. The government indicated earlier it is prepared to add
another civilian member.
   Aylwin said the opposition will continue to push for changes
that lead to ``an authentically democratic regime.''
   Ricardo Lagos, a socialist opposition leader, said, ``This is a
first step, and a step that is positive for the country.''

   The body of Rep. Claude Pepper will lie in
state in the Capitol Rotunda as a tribute to a half-century
political career in which he championed the elderly and the poor,
his former colleagues promise.
   Pepper's political odyssey, one of the longest in American
history, ended Tuesday with his death at age 88. A Florida Democrat
who served as a state representative before his election to the
U.S. Senate in 1936, Pepper later served in the House after 12
years out of office and became its oldest member.
   ``He was always a voice for the voiceless and a helping hand for
the helpless,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Wright said
the House will adopt a resolution today so that Pepper can lie in
state Thursday.
   The Senate was also expected to approve the resolution today,
Wright said. Lying in state in the Rotunda is the highest final
honor an American can receive. It has been accorded presidents, and
more recently to the unknown soldier from the Vietnam war.

   The new Congress met today to choose a commission
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev said should ``get down to the roots'' of
the troop assault that claimed the lives of 19 pro-independence
demonstrators in Soviet Georgia.
   Boisterous debate in the Congress of People's Deputies on
Tuesday far overshadowed the Soviet president's earlier address on
foreign and domestic policy.
   The heated session featured a standing ovation for a Georgian
delegate, heckling of the military commander for the southern
republic and a soul-searching speech by the chief of the Georgian
Communist Party.
   More than 400 of the 2,250 deputies have signed up to respond to
Gorbachev's state of the union address, in which he called the
Georgian violence an example of ``tragic events with the loss of
human life'' that can happen among the Soviet Union's more than 100
national groups.

   Transplant doctors predict pigs will become a
main source of donor organs for people once the many technical
problems of cross-species transplantation are resolved.
   While primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better
match, pigs are cheaper, more plentiful and easier to breed, says
Dr. Hugh Auchincloss Jr., assistant professor of surgery at Harvard
University.
   ``What could change, I suppose, is that we could become better
at making artificial organs than we are now. Then we wouldn't need
the animal organs. But I don't see that as coming first,''
Auchincloss said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Transplant Physicians.
   Only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for
all types of research, according to Auchincloss.

   High schools are requiring students to read
almost exactly what they did 25 years ago: heavy on Shakespeare but
light on works by female and minority authors, according to a
survey.
   Eighty-four percent of public high schools assign students
``Romeo and Juliet,'' the tearful Shakespearean play that tops the
list of required works, according to the nationwide survey by the
Center for the Learning &amp; Teaching of Literature at State
University of New York at Albany.
   But only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by
a female author _ ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee. No
works were by minorities, according to the survey of 322 public
schools, 80 Catholic schools and 86 private schools conducted last
spring.
   ``I think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned
with emphasizing good literature. They continue to assign classics
complemented with modern and accessible works,'' said the survey's
author, Arthur N. Applebee.

<HEAD>Dallas County Commisssion: New Color, Old Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NEWBERRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The color of its leadership has changed after
more than a century of white domination but the hub of the civil
rights movement still is shackled, like much of rural Alabama, by
the irons of a stagnant economy.
   In the county where voting rights history was made in 1965, one
out of nine workers is looking for a job. The new majority black
commission pledges that everyone, no matter their race, has reason
to hope for better times.
   But signs of old racial animosities still flare, and Dallas
County Commissioner D.L. Pope, a 78-year-old black farmer, offers a
word of caution: ``Nearly 25 years have passed, but there are many
elderly people, and people who are not so elderly, brought up to
feel inferior. That's a carryover from the plantation days. Once we
bypass that, we'll be able to move forward.''
   It's been 11 years since the Justice Department sued to force
Dallas County to abandon an at-large system of electing the county
commission, a system civil rights advocates say ensured the
election of whites. Blacks comprise 55 percent of the county's
50,000 residents but less than 45 percent of registered voters.
   The county fought the lawsuit, proposing its own district
election plan that would have called for four districts _ two
predominately black, two mostly white _ and a commission chairman
elected by all county voters.
   ``It was fair,'' said Probate Judge Johnny Jones, who by virtue
of his office served as president of the commission under the
at-large system. ``The plan the commission devised was extremely
fair.''
   Meanwhile, black leaders, including Pope, devised an opposing
plan calling for three black districts and two white districts with
the commissioners choosing their chairman. The plan finally was
approved in the federal courts last year, leading to elections that
sent Pope, Erskine Minor and Perry Varner to the county courthouse.
   Pope admits his sprawling district is ``quite challenging,'' but
defends the arrangement as fair to everyone. ``I feel it is as just
a plan as we could come up with. Blacks are in greater numbers as
far as population is concerned, and we had to address the districts
accordingly.''
   The three were sworn in Jan. 16, the first blacks to serve on
the panel since the Republican Party controlled the South after the
Civil War.
   The new commissioners promised to end what they saw as
long-standing favoritism toward whites, but not everyone agrees
that their early actions have been colorblind. One of their first
acts was to remove the longtime license commissioner, who was
white, and replace her with a black woman.
   In addition, former commissioner Bill Kendrick accused Pope of
ordering the paving of driveways owned by blacks while ignoring
those of whites, a critical issue in a mostly rural county where
rain turns many roads into quagmires.
   ``I would like to see every road in Dallas County updated and
paved wherever possible,'' Pope said. ``But do them all alike.
Don't pick out certain roads. Whites got preference in the past.
The maps indicate that.''
   The dispute led Pope to claim that Kendrick had threatened his
life and Kendrick, who denied it, to claim that he in turn had
received threats.
   The new commissioners also found the same basic problems that
plagued previous commissions and other counties in the depressed
Black Belt, an area named for its rich, black soil but filled with
poor, modestly educated or illiterate people, most of them black.
   ``Basically, we're just trying to fulfill our major obligations
and barely meet our payroll,'' said Minor, a county employee for
more than 12 years until his election to the commission.
   Kendrick, who was replaced by Pope, understands the new
commission's dilemma. ``We never had any extra money. The only
thing the county commission can do is spend money frugally.''
   Twenty-four years ago, Selma became forever linked with the
struggle for racial equality when voting rights marchers were
beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge by club-wielding police at the
start of a march to Montgomery.
   Two weeks later, the marchers were back _ under federal
protection and with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. _ to cross the
bridge and complete their march into history. A few months later,
Congress approved the Voting Rights Act.
   Since those turbulent times, both blacks and whites agree that
Selma and Dallas County have made racial gains, at least
politically. But Minor says true equality won't be a reality until
blacks share in the county's limited wealth.
   ``I have not seen much economic gain for the black community. My
son is graduating from high school this year, and he plans to go to
college next year. When he graduates in four years, there will be
nothing for him to come back to in this area. I don't see any
opportunity for jobs.''
   Dallas County's unemployment rate stands at 11.3 percent, more
than twice the nation's average and significantly higher than the
state's 7.3 percent.
   ``The birth of the movement began here,'' Minor said, ``but
other counties are enjoying the fruits of our labor.''
   Adds Pope: ``I don't know of anyone in Dallas County or this
country who is looking for more than his percentage of the pie. We
can't continue to see whites get all the better jobs.''

<HEAD>Catholic Educational Chiefs Ask Bush To Clarify School Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Chieftains of Roman Catholic education are
pressing President Bush to clear up _ publicly _ whether he wants
parents allowed to put some of their taxes into schooling they
choose for their children.
   That, essentially, would be the effect of tuition tax credits
for parents of pupils in church and other non-public schools.
   It's a longtime explosive political issue on which the
``education president,'' as Bush says he aspires to be, has become
subtly enmeshed and on which Catholic educators want straight
answers.
   ``We assume a meeting with him is going to come through,'' says
Sister Catherine McNamee, president of the National Catholic
Educational Association. ``We're still waiting.''
   She and other Catholic educational leaders, plus ll archbishops
who co-signed a letter from Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago,
have asked Bush for a meeting June 9 to clarify his position.
   He indicated support for tuition tax credits in his campaign.
But a comment last March 29 ``gave the impression he's no longer
interested in it,'' Sister McNamee said in a telephone interview.
   ``We're still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt,''
she said, but want him to set the record straight, in a public way.
   Bernardin, in his letter signed by other prelates, suggested
Bush had a debt to Catholics since, because of his campaign
commitments, ``Catholics played a significant role in your
successful election bid.''
   ``The question of parental choice in education is a vital and
crucial issue in our nation today,'' he told Bush, and church
educators want him to ``clarify misconceptions and to address
questions or misgivings you might have.''
   In his March comments, Bush said he was ``intrigued with the
concept of tuition tax credits'' but that it is ``the obligation of
all taxpayers to support a public education system.''
   He said parents of non-public school students have a right ``to
shell out, in addition to the tax money, tuition money but that
they should not get a break for that.''
   Bush's press secretary subsequently qualified the comments,
saying Bush has not shifted his commitments, but current budget
contstraints prevent considering tuition tax credits.
   Despite the elaborations, Bush's comments have ``cast a shadow
of confusion on our previous perceptions,'' says Sister Anne
Leonard, vice president of educational administrators of the NEA.
   In her letter to Bush, jointly signed by other Catholic
education officials and school superintendents in major cities, she
said the meeting is needed to dispel confusion.
   ``We are not asking you or the federal government to subsidize
our religion,'' she said. ``We do not want that.
   ``We do believe firmly that parents have a constitutional right
to choose the educational milieu for their children without
penalty'' and ``to benefit directly from their educational tax
dollars.''
   Catholicism's vast educational enterprise, serving 7.6 million
students at all levels, includes 9,000 elementary and secondary
schools.
   Most of them, especially in urban areas, enroll both Catholics
and children of varied religions. Many are too poor to pay, but
tuitions of those who can and supplementary contributions pay the
multibillion dollar costs.
   ``Parents should be able to choose the kind of education and
schools they want for their children,'' Sister McNamee said in a
telephone interview, but many now can't because it ``means paying
double'' _ school taxes and tuition.
   ``Many families now do not have a real choice in schools for
their children because they can't afford that double burden.''
   The suggested June 9 meeting with Bush _ proposed two weeks ago
with no direct reply yet _ was suggested because administrators of
the ``Big l0'' Catholic schools systems are meeting in Washington
at that time.
   Sister Leonard, also director of educational services in Chicago
besides her post with Catholic education administrators, said in
the joint letter to Bush:
   ``As Catholic educators, we have struggled to maintain a viable
presence in the heart of our urban centers to give the poorest in
our land a real option, a genuine choice for their children of an
education that is God-centered and which has a moral component to
it.
   ``Parents want this choice but are often unable to exercise it
for financial reasons.''
   Noting that the 2,700 schools in ll major urban dioceses enroll
a million children at a cost of $1.4 billion annually, she says
this saves the country $2 billion annually since per-pupil costs in
public schools range from $4,l00 to $6,900 per year.
   Citing remarks by Bush that the govenment cannot afford to help
parents of children in non-public schools, she said:
   ``We strongly disagree. We believe, faced with the present
national crisis in education, that you cannot afford not to help.''

   The recently merged Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America ended its first fiscal year with a deficit of $15.8
million _ spending $104.3 million but with income of only $88.5
million.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the 5 million-member
denomination, says the situation requires ``some painful
adjustments in the coming months,'' but the ``long-range picture
for the church is good.''
   He says members apparently have increased giving at the local
level but cut back in giving to the churchwide organization on the
assumption it was ``doing all right.''
   Among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on
staff enlargements, limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 2.5
percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional
events.
   The deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale
of property, mainly former headquarters of the three merging
denominations before locating here.

teaching under protest until trustees reaffirm the university's
commitment to academic freedom.
   Dean Antanas Suziedelis says the school's faculty, by a vote of
16 to 4, adopted a resolution saying the university's dismissal of
the Rev. Charles Curran at behest of the Vatican jeopardized
academic freedom there.
   Suziedelis says academic freedom supposedly protects scholars
from being penalized for views reached through competent
scholarship as judged by their peers. He says trustees must clarify
``under what circumstances are external judgments to be
automatically applied,'' such as in the Vatican's action on Curran.

   Faith still brings martyrdom for many
Christians, says a noted missions researcher.
   The Rev. David Barrett, editor of the World Christian
Encyclopedia, estimates 325,000 Christians have been killed for the
faith each year over the last quarter century.
   ``There's nothing unusual about this,'' he says. ``It's gone on
for 20 centuries. It's simply a part of the life of the church.''
   He says his estimates are based not only on news accounts, but
on data that often emerge years after the incidents. Also, he
counts as martyrs believers who lose their lives because of human
hostility, often political.
   Barrett, a British Anglican now serving the Southern Baptist
Foreign Missions Board, estimates 40 million Christians have been
martyred since the time of Christ.
   But the church knows the names of only 15,000 martyrs, he says.
As for the rest, ``nobody wrote their story down. Their names are
lost.''

   Hildegard Haskell took the right precautions.
   Mrs. Haskell, 77, who used a metal walker, enlisted the aid of
her friend Hazel Selden, 80, in crossing busy Beachwood Drive on
Oct. 27. At 7:55 p.m., it was dark, and difficult for the drivers
of cars speeding through the Hollywood Hills to see people on the
street.
   No doubt, the women waited a while before stepping off the curb.
   When they did they were hit, police say, by a car driven by a
40-year-old schoolteacher who sped off as the women were thrown to
the pavement. Both died.
   The deaths reignited a debate in Los Angeles about crosswalks _
now being eliminated by the hundreds in a citywide repaving project.
   Neighborhood residents set up a shrine at the intersection and
demanded signals and crosswalk markings. But traffic engineers
decided white lines on the pavement wouldn't offer a solution.
Instead, they installed stop signs.
   Experts agree that in some cases, having no crosswalk actually
is safer than having the painted lines on the street. Studies show
that markings often increase a pedestrian's chance of being hit _
especially at intersections with no lights or signs _ because of a
false sense of security.
   ``The feeling that you're safe in that crosswalk is definitely a
facade,'' said Sgt. Doug Shur with the Los Angeles Police
Department. `It's just one-sixteenth of an inch of raised white
paint on the pavement.''
   A 1987 Federal Highway Administration report found marked
crosswalks usually were safer than unmarked ones, but studies of
markings at intersections uncontrolled by lights or signs found
just the opposite.
   In Los Angeles, 42 of the 157 pedestrians killed in 1988 were
struck in marked crosswalks compared to 23 in unmarked crossings.
The majority of the dead were jaywalking.
   In Long Beach, a study of 10 years of accidents found eight
times as many pedestrian-involved collisions at marked crosswalks
as unmarked crossings.
   A 1970 San Diego study of 400 marked and unmarked intersections,
all without signals, found twice as many pedestrians were struck in
marked crosswalks as in unmarked, said Bruce Herms, author of the
study.
   ``The evidence seemed to indicate that pedestrians tended to be
more trusting in the marked crosswalks, trusted the motorist to
see,'' said Herms. ``But the motorist said, `The first I knew the
pedestrian was there was when I heard the bump on the car.'''
   His advice: ``Don't rely upon the painted lines to stop the
automobile.''
   According to Fred Ranck, head of the pedestrian safety program
for the National Safety Council in Chicago, the trouble is that
``many cities have put in crosswalks where they shouldn't have been
in the first place,'' primarily for political reasons.
   The painted lines have done nothing to halt injury and death at
the intersection of Eighth and Concord streets in the Boyle Heights
neighborhood of Los Angeles, where residents have demanded a
traffic light.
   In the twilight of Nov. 28, 9-year-old Juanita Martinez was
struck by a car and killed as the driver rushed to work. On Jan. 6,
two 14-year-old girls walking to school were hit by a car and
injured.
   Cities such as San Diego and Los Angeles have begun removing
crosswalks at such uncontrolled intersections to increase safety.
San Diego has removed 700 crosswalks since 1970; Long Beach has
eliminated 700 since 1975. Los Angeles has wiped away more than 200
and plans to delete up to 300 more.
   Herms said that in San Diego, pedestrian deaths in the six years
before the deletions were 157; from 1971 to 1976, 117 pedestrians
were killed.
   Nationwide, one in six people killed in a traffic accident is a
pedestrian. About 8,500 died in 1987, the most recent year counted.
   ``Pedestrians really are the forgotten stepchild in traffic
safety,'' Ranck said.
   ``Especially in New York and L.A.,'' said Richard Retting, New
York City's deputy assistant commissioner for safety, ``everyone's
in a rush and ... they're just not thinking for that moment.''
   Authorities eventually caught the woman they say was driving the
car that struck Mrs. Haskell and her friend. Beatrice Margaret
Buocz pleaded innocent to hit-and-run driving and awaits trial.
Police Detective Robert Smith said it appears Ms. Buocz was not
speeding, but simply didn't see the women.
   Experts agree that the pedestrian usually is at fault.
   ``The majority of pedestrians killed in traffic violated a
traffic law or committed an obviously unsafe act,'' says the
American Automobile Association.
   No one may ever know who was at fault in the deaths of Mrs.
Haskell and Mrs. Selden. But police believe the elderly women took
care.
   ``The lesson is, when you cross the street _ make sure that the
cars are stopping,'' said Shur. ``Regardless of who is right or
wrong, the pedestrian always comes out last ... and they usually
come out dead last.''

   Is the prime-time soap opera, one of
television's most popular formats, an endangered species _ or is it
just changing form?
   ABC canceled ``Dynasty'' after nine years. CBS renewed
``Dallas,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Falcon Crest,'' but the luster
is gone. ``Dallas'' and ``Knots Landing'' barely made it into the
top 30 highest-rated shows the past season.
   No new prime-time soap is on the horizon. The last effort was
NBC's ``A Year in the Life'' two seasons ago.
   But the form has evolved into something else.
   The foremost exponent of the new format is NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
It's not as outrageous as ``Dallas.'' It's not as melodramatic as
``Knots Landing.'' But the essential elements are there: a strong
dramatic narrative, ongoing stories and evolving characters.
   Other shows in this new format are ABC's ``thirtysomething'' and
``China Beach,'' and CBS' ``Wiseguy'' and ``Tour of Duty.''
   ``I don't know the difference anymore between the so-called soap
operas and `L.A. Law' and `Wiseguy,' except the story arcs are
shorter,'' said David Jacobs, the creator of ``Dallas'' and ``Knots
Landing.'' ``I think that the fading of the other shows, other than
`Knots Landing,' is just that they're old and old shows tend to
fade.''
   Esther Shapiro, who created ``Dynasty,'' declined to comment,
but has said in the past she thinks the prime-time soap opera has
undergone a metamorphosis into such shows as ``L.A. Law'' and
``thirtysomething.''
   Jacobs said ``thirtysomething'' reminds him of the early years
of ``Knots Landing'' when it ``was a little softer and more
self-conscious.'' He said ``Knots Landing'' evolved into a
melodrama because it needed more excitement to hold the audience.
   CBS' ``Dallas'' was the highest-rated show for three seasons and
second for two others. The ``Who Shot J.R.'' episode in 1980 broke
all viewing records up to that time.
   In the 1984-85 season, when the soaps reached their peak, ABC's
``Dynasty'' ranked first and ``Dallas'' was second. CBS' ``Knots
Landing'' and ``Falcon Crest'' were 9th and 10th for the year.
   The granddaddy of the prime-time soap opera was ABC's ``Peyton
Place,'' which ran twice, and sometimes three times, a week between
1964 and '69. ABC followed it with ``Harold Robbins' `The
Survivors','' an ill-conceived show that lasted only briefly in
1969. Other failed efforts: CBS' ``Sons and Daughters'' in 1974,
CBS' ``Beacon Hill'' in 1975, CBS' ``Executive Suite'' in 1976, and
NBC's ``W.E.B.'' in 1978.
   The current cycle of shows began with ABC's ``Rich Man, Poor Man
_ Book II,'' which ran for one season after the ``Rich Man, Poor
Man'' miniseries.
   ``I certainly had that in my head when I did `Dallas,''' said
Jacobs. ``The continuing saga seemed a reasonable thing to develop
for television.''
   After ``Dallas'' in 1979, Jacobs launched ``Knots Landing'' the
following year. CBS' ``Falcon Crest'' began in 1982.
   Numerous other soaps were attempted: CBS' ``Secrets of Midland
Heights,'' NBC's ``Flamingo Road,'' CBS' ``Emerald Point, N.A.S.,''
NBC's ``For Love and Honor,'' ABC's ``Call To Glory,'' NBC's
``Berringer's,'' NBC's ``Yellow Rose,'' NBC's ``Gangster
Chronicles,'' CBS' ``Hometown,'' NBC's ``A Year in the Life'' and
even NBC's ``Crime Story.''
   Prior to the soaps and serials, each episode of a series started
from scratch. The characters never learned anything from the
previous week's experience.
   ``I think shows like `L.A. Law' and `Knots Landing' are the
future of network television,'' said Jacobs. ``We can't compete
with what's on cable. We can't do nudity. If you're doing an
action-adventure you can't compete with `Rambo.' The one thing
network television can offer is a continuing drama and an
involvement with characters who change. You can't go back to shows
where the characters never changed or learned anything.''
   Jacobs said serials are difficult to launch because they demand
such an investment from the audience. ``You are there not only to
watch this week but next week and the week after that,'' he said.
   ``That's why serials have never worked on Saturday night. People
can't make the commitment. The biggest mistake some producers have
made is beginning a show as a serial. You have to win the audience
first. `Dallas' and `Knots Landing' didn't begin as serials.''
   Although ABC has pulled the plug on ``Dynasty'' as a weekly
series, that may not be the end of Blake Carrington, Alexis and the
others. The network is considering a two-hour movie for next season
to wrap up the loose ends and solve the cliffhanger that ended its
nine years on the air.

<HEAD>Getting Good Mileage From Travelers Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they get ready for summer getaways in the
weeks ahead, many American vacationers will be stocking up on
swimming suits, suntan lotion _and travelers checks.
   Despite the advent of the credit card and bank teller machine
networks, reported sales of travelers checks keep rising steadily,
98 years after an employee of American Express Co. named Marcellus
Berry hit on the idea.
   American Express, which remains the best-known travelers check
purveyor, says its worldwide sales of the checks increased from
$13.8 billion in 1983 to $21.1 billion last year.
   The Credit Union National Association, a trade group, says its
sales of checks to credit unions jumped more than 50 percent in
1988.
   CUNA attributes this growth to a booming travel and vacation
market at just about all age levels of the population, from the
youngest of the baby boomers to the rapidly growing ranks of older
Americans.
   The appeal of travelers checks, of course, is that they serve as
a kind of marked money _ nearly as handy as cash, but protected,
unlike cash, from the hazards of theft or loss.
   In fact, says the CUNA, less than 1 percent of the travelers'
checks that are issued become the subject of refund claims.
   Nevertheless, if you are going to take the trouble of getting
them for the protection they offer, financial advisers say, it
makes sense to handle them properly and wisely.
   First of all, they suggest, familiarize yourself beforehand with
the procedure for obtaining a refund in the places you plan to
visit.
   Then, you need a plan for safe, separate storage during the trip
of the documents that show what checks you have bought and their
serial numbers.
   Among the travel safety tips it offers, American Express
recommends drawing up in duplicate a list of the travelers checks
you will be carrying, along with numbers of such other things as
credit cards, passports and insurance policies.
   ``Keep one copy with you and leave the other at home with a
friend or business associate,'' the company says. ``It will speed
replacement or recovery in case of theft or loss.''
   ``Each time you cash a traveler's check, write down the amount
and number of the check, the place you cashed it and the time and
date,'' it adds. That way, you will know at any time the amounts
and numbers of checks that still may be lost or stolen.
   All this may sound like a lot of trouble to take, more than a
lot of people would actually bother with. After all, you are going
on a vacation, not to an accounting convention.
   But the whole idea of travelers checks is security, against loss
of your money and against the disruption of your trip.
   Few institutions that sell travelers checks charge onerous fees
for them. If you're inclined to shop around, however, you may well
find a place where they are available more cheaply.
   At the end of a trip, it makes sense to cash in any remaining
checks quickly to put the money to use elsewhere.
   A few years back, one firm suggested in its advertising that you
keep one or two unused checks in your wallet more or less
permanently as a sort of emergency reserve.
   Whether that appeals to you or not, you should bear in mind that
the suggestion does not come from a disinterested source. Companies
that make travelers checks profit from the ``float,'' earning
investment returns on your money between the time you buy a
travelers check and the time you spend it.
   So hanging on to an old travelers check is pretty much the same
thing as putting it into a savings account that pays no interest at
all.

<HEAD>Jew-Conversion Document Strikes Nub Of Comity With Christians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key producer of an evangelical declaration
stressing conversion of Jews says it was aimed mainly at some
fellow Christians and not at Jews whom it has keenly offended.
   They're incensed by it. So are some Christians. They say it's
contrary to developing Jewish-Christian reciprocity.
   As the conflict smouldered, the chairman of the panel that
produced the document, the Rev. Vernon Grounds of Denver (Colo.)
Seminary, said it was directed at an ``in-house issue'' among the
churches.
   ``A movement is gaining ground that repduiates the New Testament
mandate and says it's not necessary to evangelize the Jewish
people,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``More and more, this position is coming to the fore. We feel it
imperative to reaffirm the historic Christian position that the
gospel be preached to the Jew first.''
   The declaration asserts that Jews can be saved only by accepting
Christ. This contrasts with a developing, historic rapprochement
between Judaism and Christianity as both bound to God.
   That evolving concord, expressed lately in official statements
of a growing list of mainline denominations, Protestant and Roman
Catholic, has marked a watershed in religious annals.
   It comes after centuries of Christian demeaning of Jews.
   ``A major shift has occured among mainline Protestant churches
and Roman Catholics, but it's not without some challenges and
pain,'' said retired Ohio Episcopal Bishop John H. Burt.
   Burt, of Marqwuette, Mich., who chaired development of a new
Episcopal Church stance toward Judaism, said the trend ``has
triggered some backlash.''
   Some of that backlash was indicated in the evangelical
declaration, drawn up by 15 scholars in April and since endorsed by
the World Evangelical Fellowship, which estimates its global
adherents at 100 million.
   ``Some church leaders have retreated from embracing the task of
evangelizing Jews,'' maintaining that ``God's covenant with
Israel'' is sufficient for all times, the declaration says in its
preamble.
   However, it says the biblical status of Jews as ``God's people''
cannot save them without accepting Christ and that God's covenant
with Jews was conditioned ``upon the fore-ordained sacrifice'' of
Christ.
   While the declaration repudiates past persecutions of Jews and
condemns anti-Semitism, the declaration describes ``evangelizing of
Jewish people as a priority,'' and discounts dialogue without that
purpose.
   The ``biblical hope for Jewish people centers on their being
restored through faith in Christ to their proper place as branches
of God's olive tree from which they are at present broken off,''
the declaration says.
   Jewish leaders voiced outrage. Rabbi Alexander Schindler,
president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, called the
declaration ``retrograde and primitive.
   ``It is a desperate attempt to stop the clock of progress in
interrlegious relations. Jews have no interest in dialogue with
those who feel that they alone are worthy of God's grace.''
   Rabbi A. James Rudin, interrelgious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee, said the document is ``shot through with
the ancient Christian `teaching of contempt' for Jews and Judiasm.''
   He said if the declaration's objective of converting Jews were
totally successful it ``would mean the end of Jewish life
throughout the world,'' amounting to ``spiritual genocide.''
   The Rev. Galin Hiestand of Wheaton, Ill., North American
director of the World Evangelical Fellowship, said it had realized
that making the declaration ``would not be a popular thing to do.
   ``But we had no alternative other that to affirm Jesus Christ as
the promised messiah and acceptance of him as the only basis for
salvation.''
   Many noted theologians and actions by several denomination, the
Episcopal Church, Presbyterian Church (USA) and United Church of
Christ, have underscored the continuing validity of God's covenant
with Jews.
   The Rev. A. Roy Eckhard, a United Methodist specialist on
Christian-Jewish ties and long-time head of the religion department
at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., termed the change in church
attitudes ``a revolution.''
   `It's the wave of the future, a very solid thing, so different
from what has gone on for centuries,'' he said. ``The other point
of view is simply wrong and centuries of church history doesn't
make it right.''
   He said the deepended New Testament understanding is that God's
covenant with the Jews was opened ``to the Gentiles'' through
Christ. ``It's not a denial of roots but a rediscovery of roots.''
   He said the ``other side'' is ``not really being faithful to
Scripture,'' but does have ``a little bit of partial truth'' _ that
``Christians must not close the church doors to Jews or anyone. The
doors must always be open.''
   Grounds, a conservative Baptist who led production of the new
evangelical declaration, said ``we hope it will be wholesome rather
than divisive in its outcome.''
   ``Christianity is rooted in the Old Testament, and we are
grateful for the Jewish Scripture,'' he said. But the Jewish
covenant with God no longer applies, he said. ``Judaism is no
longer a redemptive religion.''

   Faith still brings martyrdom for many
Christians, says a noted missions researcher.
   The Rev. David Barrett, editor of the World Christian
Encyclopedia, estimates an average of 325,000 Christians have been
killed for the faith each year over the last quarter century.
   ``There's nothing unusual about this,'' he says. ``It's gone on
for 20 centuries. It's simply a part of the life of the church.''
   He says his estimates are based not only on news accounts, but
on data that often emerge years after the incidents. Also, he
counts as martyrs believers who lose their lives because of human
hostility, often political.
   Barrett, a British Anglican now serving the Southern Baptist
Foreign Missions Board, estimates 40 million Christians have been
martyred since the time of Christ.
   But the church knows the names of only 15,000 martyrs, he says.
As for the rest, ``nobody wrote their story down. Their names are
lost.''

   The dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at
the Catholic University of America says several professors are
teaching ``under protest'' until trustees reaffirm the university's
commitment to academic freedom.
   Dean Antanas Suziedelis says the school's faculty, by a vote of
16 to 4, adopted a resolution saying the university's dismissal of
the Rev. Charles Curran at behest of the Vatican jeopardized
academic freedom there.
   Suziedelis says academic freedom supposedly protects scholars
from being penalized for views reached through competent
scholarship as judged by their peers. He says trustees must clarify
``under what circumstances are external judgments to be
automatically applied,'' such as in the Vatican's action on Curran.

   The recently merged Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America ended its first fiscal year with a deficit of $15.8
million _ spending $104.3 million but with income of only $88.5
million.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the 5 million-member
denomination, says the situation requires ``some painful
adjustments in the coming months,'' but the ``long-range picture
for the church is good.''
   He says members apparently have increased giving at the local
level but cut back in giving to the churchwide organization on the
assumption it was ``doing all right.''
   Among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on
staff enlargements, limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 2.5
percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional
events.
   The deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale
of property, mainly former headquarters of the three merging
denominations before locating here.

   After years of toil, and following two heart
operations, James Garner has a new way of working: He smacks golf
balls and reads until his doorbell rings.
   If his partner in a production company, Peter Duchow, is waiting
outside, he knows it's time to dust off his actor's cap.
   ``I say, `Go ahead, Pete, work. And pretty soon it gets to the
point where he has to get me in on it, and suddenly I'm working
again and don't realize it,'' Garner says.
   But slowing down wasn't easy for the 61-year-old Garner, who was
once described as ``the last real man'' in America. He might be
6-foot-3 and robust, but his body has been telling him to ease up
for many years.
   He was twice wounded during the Korean War, and was awarded the
Purple Heart each time. In his first year on the hit TV series
``The Rockford Files,'' Garner ripped up his knee. Always ready for
an encore, he did it again the next year. He's also broken his tail
bone and his ribs, and injured tendons and ligaments. Add to that
ulcers, arthritis, disintegrating disks in his back and occasional
bouts of depression.
   But the stakes escalated last year when he was hospitalized
because of a weakness in the aorta, the main artery carrying blood
from the heart. He underwent a bypass operation and surgery on the
aorta.
   ``It wasn't very good news,'' Garner recalled, wryly.
   The operations slowed him down a little bit and ``made me smell
the roses a little more, I guess,'' he says.
   Now, he's happiest when he's making a birdie on the golf course,
or when he's home quietly reading. ``Happiness for me is relief
from stress,'' the actor said.
   Garner gave up tobacco after 45 years, and plays with beads to
keep his hands busy and away from cigarettes. But stopping smoking
wasn't easy for an actor who first appeared on television in
commercials, promising that ``Winston tastes good like a cigarette
should.''
   ``That's the way I did it, and a year later they did a whole ad
campaign to cross `like' out and put `as' in its place,'' he
recalled with a chuckle, although he's not sure whether it was
wrong in the script or if he made it wrong.
   However, the star of TV's ``The Rockford Files'' and
``Maverick'' and dozens of movies including ``The Americanization
of Emily,'' ``The Great Escape'' and ``Victor-Victoria,'' still
occasionally cheats and lights up.
   ``I would love to have one every few minutes but that's out of
the question,'' he confessed.
   Garner and Duchow have produced two television specials: ``My
Name Is Bill W,'' the story of the founders of Alcoholics
Anonymous, which was broadcast last month; and ``Promise,'' the
1986-87 Emmy award-winning story of a brother whose carefree
lifestyle is threatened when he is forced to care for his mentally
ill brother.
   ``I like stories that have to do with the human condition. But
I'm not a crusader,'' said Garner, who was nominated for an Academy
Award in 1986 as best actor for his performance in the movie,
``Murphy's Romance.''
   Garner was born in Norman, Okla., the youngest of Mildred and
Weldon Bumgarner's three sons. His father was a carpetlayer. His
mother died when he was young. He quit school at age 16 to join the
Merchant Marines in 1944 and dropped in and out of high schools as
he roamed the country for several years, shaking off the shyness
that resulted from years of berating by an overbearing stepmother.
   At age 17, he worked at a Hollywood gas station and got to know
Paul Gregory, who became a successful producer. Eight years later,
after a year at the University of Oklahoma and working for his
father's Los Angeles business, Garner drove by ``Paul Gregory and
Associates'' and decided to see if Gregory had been serious years
earlier when he told him he should become an actor.
   He said he saw a parking space in front of Gregory's building.
   ``If that space hadn't been there, I would never have driven
around the block to look for one,'' he once said.
   Gregory hired him for the stage production of ``The Caine Mutiny
Court Martial,'' and Garner worked his way from a non-speaking role
as a juror to a leading role on tour.
   He married actress Lois Clarke 32 years ago. They raised two
daughters, one of whom became an elementary school teacher and the
other a Nashville country singer.
   Garner cherishes traits he traces to his maternal grandfather, a
Cherokee Indian: ``Stoicism, stubborn, you bet. Dogged,
trustworthy, like a Boy Scout.''
   ``I think I have a lot of the old West values of `your word is
your bond,' honesty and that sort of thing that doesn't seem to
hold much value anymore to people,'' he said.
   He's been cited as an example of a man with values because he
has resisted the pitfalls of the ``me generation'' and its
companion attitude of, ``I'm going to get mine no matter who I step
on.''
   ``I come from Oklahoma where we're still kind of simple folks,''
he said.
   ``I have to live with my own conscience. When I go to bed at
night and my conscience doesn't keep me awake, I've lived by my
rules, whatever they may be.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Fifty years ago on June 6, a group of
neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a
scaled-down field in Williamsport, Pa. They called it the Little
League. Today more than 2.5 million young boys and girls play on
140,000 Little League baseball teams in the United States and 33
foreign countries. But despite its immense popularity, the
organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the Little
League turned out.

   When you drive south on Route 15 in
north-central Pennsylvania, just as you top the crest of Bald Eagle
Mountain pull over and cast your gaze on the valley below.
   If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of Little
League baseball, you are looking at it.
   The Susquehanna River winds down from the green Allegheny hills
through a town of 40,000 souls who live in clapboard houses with
porch swings and shade trees, a timeless scene off a postcard
labeled ``America.''
   An American flag large enough to cover a small infield draws
your eye to the north bank of the river. It flies proudly in front
of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields, the
international headquarters of Little League, Inc.
   Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year. Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6,
1939, have grandchildren playing in the league. A Little League
ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities,
villages and suburbs across the land.
   A three-team league of 30 Williamsport boys in 1939 was the
seedbed for what Little League, Inc. today calls the largest sports
organization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on
140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the United States and 33 foreign
countries.
   ``Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,''
says Carl Stotz, who founded the league while working as a clerk in
a lumber yard. ``All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhood
program. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.''
   At 79, Stotz still lives in Williamsport. He is a man with an
incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save
receipts.
   He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for the
first Little League season came to $174.63, that the collection
taken up at the first game netted $1.42, that the first boy-sized
catcher's mask, ordered from Chicago and which he still has, cost
$1.67, the first dozen balls $2. The first year's deficit was
$36.72, which Stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did every
year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black.
   Now Little League, Inc. has assets of more than $10 million and
a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges each
of those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $14 each year and earns
millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the
Little League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which Stotz
designed. The business of Little League is unquestionably big
league.
   Stotz's memory of how it all began is vivid.
   One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two
nephews, Jimmy and Harold Gehron, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at
1108 Isabella St. Running backward, he tripped over the jagged
stumps of a cut-down lilac bush and bruised his ankle. His left
ankle.
   ``I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing,
``rubbing my ankle.
   ``I said to the boys, `How would you like to play on a regular
team with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you can
really swing?'
   ``One of them said, `Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _
`who would we play?'
   ``I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.''
   Stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and
went to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers played
softball.

<TEXT>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.: played softball.    Through the winter Stotz
worked out the details, rules, age limits and the like, which have remained
essentially unchanged. He called on 57 merchants before he found the first
sponsor, Lycoming Dairy.    The next spring Little League was born. 
  ``When Carl passed out the uniforms, the day before the first game, it
was one of the proudest days of my life,'' recalls Bill Bair.    Bair,
who now lives in nearby Montoursville, hit .462 that year to become Little
League's first batting champion.    Frank Rizzo began as a Little League
umpire in 1941 and, at 78, is still at it, conducting the Little League's
umpiring school in Williamsport.    ``I've seen some ugly things when
the parents get too excited,'' he says. ``The kids walk off the field arm-in-arm,
but I know of mothers who would't speak to each other for a month.'' 
  Little League has had its share of critics over the years, but its very
prosperity indicates to supporters that its benefits clearly outweigh its
flaws.    Most parents who have sat on wooden benches on a lazy summer
afternoon and watched their own and their neighbors' kids enjoy the national
pastime, however ineptly, conclude that Little League can't be all bad.
   One of Little League's least vocal but most severe critics is, sadly,
Carl Stotz himself.    ``I have absolutely no animosity toward anyone
working for the corporation,'' he says. ``Many of them are my dearest friends.
But what Little League is now is not what I envisioned it to be and I do
not approve.''    Stotz feels that commercialization has blurred the neighborhood
focus of the program which he saw as its heart and its purpose.    His
critics say he was behind the times, a naive innocent who didn't realize
Little League's potential. His supporters say, as did one Williamsport
father, ``All my kid wants to do is play in the World Series. All I want
him to do is play baseball and have fun.''    Because of these and other
philosophical and administrative differences Stotz was eased out
of the Little League in 1955. He took with him, however, his Original Little
League. It is not affiliated with Little League, Inc.    The Original
Little League has thrived in Williamsport in the 34 years since Stotz's
ouster. About 150 children, including about 25 girls, play on 12 teams
in three age groups.    The field the ``Originals'' play on is the same
one Carl Stotz used to rearrange newspapers and figure out the proper distance
between bases for kids. The field has been improved over the years by volunteers.
It has a fence and scoreboard and dugouts and clubhouse and grandstands.
   On May 4, 1974 the city of Williamsport formally dedicated that field
on Memorial Park to its honored citizen and put up a sign: The Carl E.
Stotz Field.    So Uncle Tuck still has that.    Another honor came to
Carl Stotz on Oct. 8, 1988. The Original Little League threw a testimonial
dinner to celebrate its 50th anniversary.    Last year.    ``Our first
season was in 1939,'' says Stotz, his penchant for accuracy unremitting.
``So we celebrated our 10th anniversary at the end of the 1948 season,
not 1949. Count it up. Use your fingers.    ``In 1948 I put out a 25-page
6-by-9 booklet with pictures of all the boys. It brought in, let's see
here, $200.59 in contributions in excess of printing costs. This year's
50th anniversary of their Little League is a year late.''    In Carl Stotz's
back yard is a garage-size building which he built himself to preserve
what he calls ``my display.''    If you drop by, he will show you the
first Little League bat. You will see snapshots of the first three Little
League teams, no different in composition than today's Polaroids that decorate
refrigerators across the land.    Speaking of roots, you will also find
in Carl Stotz's display the brittle remains of the lilac bush that tripped
him up in his back yard and set him to dream of a better way, a dream that
became Little League.    ``That lilac stump? Well,'' says Stotz, ``after
a couple of years I went and looked and discovered it was still there.
So I dug it up.    ``Yeah, I guess that's one thing I saved on purpose.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The opening of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore 100 years ago this month, and the Hopkins medical school
four years later, greatly influenced the way America trains its
doctors. Besides setting the standards of medical education,
Hopkins researchers also have made remarkable contributions to the
practice of medicine in the 20th century.

   The Chief swept into the hospital lobby,
handing his hat, coat and books to the waiting crowd, dispensing a
cheery greeting and a wave of his hand.
   He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marble
Christ and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at a
bed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on The
Chief.
   William Osler, a showman with high forehead and the bold
mustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medical
students at the bedside. And he was making history.
   For this was Johns Hopkins Hospital around the turn of the
century. And Osler was among a small group of physicians who were
helping change the way America trained its doctors.
   With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the Hopkins medical
school in 1893, Osler and his colleagues became the first American
medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students.
They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by
experience.
   ``From the outset, Johns Hopkins embodied a conception of
medical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basic
science and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern all
institutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist Paul Starr in his
Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``The Social Transformation of
American Medicine.''
   This month marks 100 years of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions.
   The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical
education. In the past century, researchers there developed the
radical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renal
dialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other key
contributions.
   The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when
America had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones,
medical historian Lester S. King said in a recent interview.
   No national standards yet governed medical education.
   Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where
students could get some training with patients. Most schools could
not offer much bedside experience.
   In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratory
facilities and conducted only limited original research. Germany,
by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicine
that began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances in
microscopy, chemistry and physiology.
   The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather than
battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from
scratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to let
students into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching tool
from the beginning.
   When it came to opening the medical school, however, they also
had a big problem.
   As trustees of the estate of Baltimore financier Johns Hopkins,
they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in
American history. The $7 million Hopkins left upon his death in
1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university.
   But even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889, the financial
prospects for opening the medical school were shaky. Income from
the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried
up.
   Four wealthy, well-educated daughters of the trustees offered to
raise the needed money, provided the school would admit women on
equal terms as men. The trustees agreed.
   But by December 1892, the women had raised less than half the
$500,000 the school needed. Other medical schools, knowing of the
delay, were trying to lure the Hopkins medical faculty away.
   Finally, Mary Garrett, a member of the women's committee,
offered to donate the balance _ for a price. The school would have
to admit only students who had a bachelor's degree, and a reading
knowledge of French and German.
   The trustees, swallowing hard at requirements they feared might
drive away many prospective students, accepted. ``It is lucky that
we got in as professors,'' Osler told a fellow faculty member. ``We
could never enter as students.''
   It was a relief when 18 students, including three women, showed
up to form the first class.

   The medical curriculum Hopkins provided was marked not so much
by innovation, as by a combination of features that had appeared in
Europe and scattered American schools.
   It was an ambitious enterprise, even apart from requiring a
college degree for entry. Few other schools provided well-equipped
laboratories in basic science for teachers and students. Hopkins
aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of
existing knowledge.
   The idea was ``to give the world men who can not only sail by
the old charts, but who can make new and better ones for the use of
others,'' said John Shaw Billings, a Civil War battlefield surgeon
who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum.
   Hopkins also made a policy of learning by doing, both in the
laboratory and in the hospital. With Osler as their mentor at the
bedside, students took medical histories of patients, performed
physical examinations, conducted routine laboratory tests and
followed their patients' course.
   As Osler put it, ``the student began with the patient, continued
with the patient, ended his studies with the patient, using books
and lectures as tools, means to an end.''
   The school made full-time jobs out of teaching basic science,
rather than using local physicians to teach part time, as most
other schools did. The full-time idea, later extended to
instructors of medical practice, allowed Hopkins to go outside the
local community to lure top-notch faculty members.
   Eventually, the school also offered lengthy training in medical
specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the
regular curriculum.
   The result of all this was such that in 1901, Harvard's Eliot
congratulated Hopkins University president Daniel Gilman on a
``prodigious advancement of medical teaching.''
   The men who led the way were the Big Four.
   One was Osler, who had come from Philadelphia to become
professor of medicine at the school and physician-in-chief at the
hospital. The author of a classic medical text, Osler became one of
the nation's most highly regarded physicians.
   Joining him was William Halsted, a shy and excrutiatingly
meticulous surgeon. He became well-known for such innovations as
the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and his training of other
surgeons.
   Then there was William Welch, a genial, rotund pathology
professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education
and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy.
   Finally there was Howard Kelly, the gynecological surgeon, who
developed and improved that art. He ``took pleasure in quick,
flashy operating,'' one student wrote later. ``He'd be in and out
of the abdomen almost before you knew it, all the time talking and
illustrating what he was doing or about to do.''
   Of the 17 original hospital buildings, only three remain, hemmed
in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical
school.
   The scene today at Hopkins would astonish the Big Four.
   Faint rock music nudges the quiet of a white-walled laboratory
as Bert Vogelstein, 39, holds up a dark gray sheet of X-ray film.
It shows several series of smudged black lines.
   During the days of the Big Four, physicians were just beginning
to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells. Now, the
smudged lines on Vogelstein's film are helping to explain those
abnormalities.
   Victor McKusick, 67, arose shortly after 5 a.m. one recent day
at his Baltimore home. He drank some coffee, read the paper, picked
up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape
recorder. It was time to catalog a new human gene.
   When the Hopkins medical school was founded, the idea of genes
was not yet generally accepted, for the work of Austrian monk
Gregor Mendel in the 1860s was not yet widely known. Today,
McKusick maintains a list of human genes, accessible by computer
around the world. The entry he dictated before breakfast that
morning was number 4,584.
   But while medicine has advanced greatly since Hopkins began,
some things stay the same, notes Hopkins medical historian A.
McGehee Harvey.
   A committee that reviewed the Hopkins medical curriculum
recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing, and of not only
teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating
new knowledge, Harvey said.
   ``It's a process of rediscovery,'' he said with a smile. ``They
rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place
started.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a free high school for Catholic boys,
drawing students from all around New York City. And while other
parochial schools struggle with rising tuitions and dwindling
enrollments, Regis High School in Manhattan has managed to afford
$5 million in improvements in recent years, thanks to the
generosity of donors, largely alumni. The school also has managed
to maintain a standard of academic excellence.

<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unusual story behind the founding of Regis
High School is captured in the Latin words engraved in stone above
the columns on its classical facade: ``Deo et Patriae Pietas
Christiana Erexit.''
   Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trod
the corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate:
``Built by Christian piety for God and country.''
   Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave her
pastor $500,000 to build a free school for Catholic boys, Regis is
still giving full scholarships to every student it admits.
   It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochial
grammar schools in the five boroughs of New York, the surrounding
three-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield.
   ``Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says Mark
Mazzetti, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling
back and forth from Princeton, N.J.
   For Luis Taveras, 17, a senior who chose Regis over the Bronx
High School of Science, the trip to school is a 30-minute subway
ride from the Bronx.
   ``I love it here,'' Taveras says. ``When you come from the
Bronx, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind of
world. This school is a meeting ground for people from so many
different backgrounds.''
   Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _
valued by school officials at over $24,000 _ thanks not only to the
generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the
years gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500
alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their
own right.
   About half the $3.3 million budget comes from interest on the
school's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni,
foundations and other sources.
   ``Each year the costs go up at least $200,000,'' says the Rev.
James J. Fischer, S.J., the president since 1980. ``That's not
going to end.'
   But while other Catholic schools struggle with rising tuitions
and contracting enrollments, Regis has been able to pour $5 million
in recent years into expanding science labs and other major
renovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks from
Central Park. The top faculty salaries will hover near $40,000 this
fall.
   Last year's seniors scored an average of 1,273 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, 369 points above the national average. Many
graduates attend select colleges, including 84 who went on to Ivy
League colleges in the past four years alone.
   More than a third of the students come from families with
incomes below $30,000 a year, and 40 percent are the children of
immigrants from Ireland, Puerto Rico, China, the Philippines,
Italy, Cuba, Haiti and three dozen other countries.
   The school, largely white for decades, now has a 28 percent
minority enrollment, including 60 Hispanic students (12 percent),
51 Asian (10 percent) and 28 black (6 percent). Unlike many
parochial schools, especially in big cities, it does not admit
non-Catholics.
   Each fall, on the first Saturday in November, about 900 students
take a standardized admissions test. Students also are judged on
their elementary school grades, activities and, for the finalists,
an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly
before Christmas.
   Most of those admitted score in the top 5 percent on
standardized tests _ a common cutoff for the gifted.

<TEXT>NEW YORK: for the gifted.    The Rev. Frederick J. O'Brien, the
headmaster, will be succeeded as headmaster this summer by the Rev. James
F. Kuntz, who has been headmaster of St. Peter's Prep in Jersey City, New
Jersey. Kuntz, a 1966 Regis graduate, will be only the second alumnus ever
to run the school.    The school's two top administrators are two of only
a dozen Jesuits left on the 50-member staff. A quarter-century ago, more
than half the faculty were Jesuit priests or ``scholastics'' _ young Jesuits
halfway through the 13-year preparation process leading to ordination.
Not a few of them were alumni. In fact, a Regis yearbook marking the 50th
anniversary in 1964 noted that almost 10 percent of its alumni were priests.
   But few Regians opt for the priesthood these days. Many of the Jesuits
on the faculty are nearing retirement, and their replacements are not in
sight. It has only one scholastic this semester ``and we're not sure we'll
get a replacement when he leaves,'' says Frank Walsh, the assistant
headmaster.    Other things have changed at the school. There was a time,
says Lynda Blakinship, chairman of the science department, when a Regis
student was just a student. ``Now he's taking care of the younger brothers
and sisters, cooking the meals, doing the wash while the mother works.
In my advanced placement physics class, two-thirds of the guys had jobs.''
   No longer do students flunk out in droves in the sort of educational
triage that once characterized many Jesuit schools.    Latin, long the
backbone of the curriculum, became optional four years ago.    While that
raised the hackles of some alumni, O'Brien says, ``we're trying to get
needy students in here. We're bringing in kids who very often are the first
people in their family to complete high school. They know no reason to
study Latin.''    While it is no longer producing legions of priests,
Regis does inculcate in its students the value of community service. 
  Seniors are required to spend Tuesday mornings out as volunteer tutors
in grammar schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods, or working in hospitals
or nursing homes. Most seniors are freed from all classes during the last
trimester to devote full time to such pursuits, or to work on job internships.
   Its alumni include several university presidents, including Timothy
S. Healy (p942) of Georgetown and Joseph A. O'Hare ( 948) of Fordham, as
well as banking executives, corporate chieftains and judges _ although
rival Xavier High School boasts Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 
  The alumni rolls are also thick with lawyers who first honed their oratorical
skills in the classrooms of Regis and its Hearn Society, a perennial state
debating champion.    ``We still produce more lawyers than anything else,''
O'Brien says. ``If you teach here for a while you understand that it is
not an accident. Our kids love to argue.''    But the school's best-known
graduate is Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the AIDS researcher and director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases whom President Bush
has called one of his personal heroes.    Fauci, a 1958 graduate, remembers
fondly his four years commuting as a straphanger from Brooklyn to the upper
East Side, where he encountered ``an academic excellence that really was
unmatched in all of the educational experiences I've had since then.''
   Regis is now run by a board that includes both lay and Jesuit members.
Its leaders say it will retain that Jesuit character, even as the numbers
of priests on its staff dwindle.    Mazzetti, the freshman from Princeton,
said his parents have been pleasantly surprised at how few demands the
school makes for money to pay for extracurriculars or anything else. 
  ``At my old school, they always asked for money for every little thing,''
he says.    But an older student who overheard the remark chimed in knowingly,
``Never being asked for money? Give me a break. Wait until you graduate.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He likes to laugh and make others laugh, but
there's a serious side to Ed Zern. He's concerned about what's
happening to the planet and its creatures. That's why more than 30
years ago he established a program to give conservationists a pat
on the back.

   Outdoorsman and writer Ed Zern, a
conservationist with a sense of humor, is still spouting the
one-liners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers.
   ``I prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work,'' the
78-year-old Zern likes to say.
   And:
   _ ``Fishermen are born honest, but they get over it.''
   _ ``Some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of
string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other. This is
a silly definition, of course, for many fishermen use flies instead
of worms.''
   _ ``Fish is brain food. People who eat fish have large,
well-developed brains. People with large, well-developed brains
don't fish. It's that simple.''
   Beneath the mischievous grin, however, is a serious concern
about what could lie ahead unless Americans start paying more
attention to the world around them.
   ``Thirty-five years ago, we didn't have waste products of
nuclear plants,'' Zern says. ``We didn't have a lot of the poisons
that are poisoning the atmosphere. We didn't know that spray cans
could destroy our ozone layer.''
   Zern never imagined things would become as bad as they have.
   ``I thought something would be done about it, measures would be
taken,'' he says. ``Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.''
   The bearded, hoary-headed author of the ``Exit Laughing'' column
in Field &amp; Stream magazine, occasionally mistaken in the past for
another avid outdoorsman, the late Ernest Hemingway, is doing what
he can to increase public awareness.
   Zern is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology
entitled ``Hunting and Fishing from A to Zern.'' He also is creator
of the more-or-less imaginary Madison Avenue Rod, Gun, Bloody Mary
and Labrador Retriever Benevolent Association, whose motto is
``Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry.''
   ``It's implicit in everything he does, the respect for the
outdoors, the love for it,'' says Maggie Nichols, Field &amp; Stream's
managing editor.
   That zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards
program Zern founded in 1954 with corporate backing. His aim was,
and still is, to give conservation-conscious folks ``a slap on the
back.''
   His Chevron Conservation Awards Program, believed to be the
oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country, has
recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years.
The 1989 finalists were honored May 17 in Washington, D.C.
   Each year, Zern helps whittle down the list of up to 150
nominees. Some of them, he acknowledges, fit the stereotypical
image of the conservationist.
   ``Little old lady in tennis shoes? They exist and they're
charming people, usually,'' he says, chuckling.
   His all-time favorite finalist is a 70-year-old Pennsylvania
game warden who was honored in the late '50s. The man's wife, who
nominated her husband for the award, thanked Zern profusely
following the ceremony.
   ``This little old lady came up to me and said, `Mr. Zern, I want
to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a
wonderful thing it was for me,''' Zern says. ``I said, `Well, I
should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to
honor your husband.'
   ``She looked sort of surprised. She said, `Oh, no, it isn't
that. We've been married 52 years and this is the first time we've
ever stayed at a hotel.'''

<TEXT>Pittsburgh: at a hotel.    Zern's passion for the outdoors was nurtured
by his father, who headed West Virginia University's Department of Mines
during the 1910s. The elder Zern often took his young son on inspection
trips.    ``I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream,''
he recalls.    Zern caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his
family moved from West Virginia to the Pittsburgh area.    Since then,
Zern has fished and hunted on five continents.    Occasionally, sometimes
by accident and sometimes not, Zern repeats himself in his ``Exit Laughing''
column, which he began in 1958. It never goes unnoticed.    ``I always
get three or four letters and I have the same answer to all of them,''
he says.    ``I say, `Dear Mr. Thompson, Thank you for your letter of
such and such a date. The last time I heard the Philadelphia Orchestra,
they played the Brahms First and I understand they've done it several times
before. Sincerely yours.'''    So just where does he get his ideas? 
``I wish I had one,'' he says. ``I've got a piece due the day after
tomorrow. It was a lot easier when I was younger and smart-aleckier than
I am now.''    He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes
his hands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from a
manual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer.    Nevertheless,
Zern is at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., only about half the time. The rest
of the time he's on the road.    His favorite sport, and writing topic,
is fishing. Like many serious anglers, he tosses his catch back into the
water.    Zern doesn't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated. 
  ``I'm rather glad everybody doesn't like fishing or the good fishing
places would be so overpopulated,'' he says. ``So I'd never knowingly write
anything that would encourage anybody to go fishing. You can always build
more bowling alleys or tennis courts. You can't build more trout streams.''
   His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees.    Among the
11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a Juneau, Alaska, couple who
have developed a school curriculum on marine and wetlands resources, and
a Milwaukee man who has led a campaign to establish a national park in
American Samoa.    Ten professional conservationists also received $1,000
and a bronze plaque, including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist
from Massachusetts who is working to save the threatened Piping Plover,
a shore bird.    The five group finalists included the United Anglers
of Casa Grande High School in Petaluma, Calif., which is rehabilitating
local waterways so fish can migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 students are
raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed to meet earthquake
standards.    Zern says he has no real way of knowing whether the awards
program or any of his other efforts have had, or will have, a significant
effect.    ``We don't really know how many souls are saved,'' he says,
``no matter how tough the sermon.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ One of the managers of a Connecticut bar,
himself a recovering alcoholic, decided adults needed a place to go
to dance and party without being exposed to booze, like the
non-alcoholic clubs for teen-agers. So one night a week the Night
Life VIP Lounge becomes Club Soda, where the drinks are no stronger
than the name implies.

   The dance music pulses through the art
deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly
stir, shake and blend exotic drinks.
   The adult crowd at Club Soda is partying this Friday night, but
they are all sober. There is no alcohol in the drinks.
   ``It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze,''
says Joseph W. Perugini, one of the managers of Club Soda, a Friday
night non-alcoholic alternative for adults who want to party
without getting drunk.
   ``There are people out there that just can't drink and they have
nowhere to go.''
   There are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance
without alcohol for teen-agers, but a boozeless bar for adults is
unusual, says Perugini's partner, Thomas Rowlay.
   ``We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's
not what we were looking for,'' Rowlay says.
   Except for Friday nights, Club Soda is actually the Night Life
VIP Lounge, a full-service bar. And the decision to ban booze each
Friday night, typically a busy night for bars, was something
personal for Perugini, a recovering alcoholic.
   ``I'm recovering and I've met through my past two years out
there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the
sauce,'' Perugini says.
   ``I'm just tired of reading, `Just say no to drugs and say no to
booze.' You've got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time
we show people how to live. I feel real good about it.''
   Perugini credits Night Life owners Pat Scarpa and Dave DeStazio,
his employers for a number of years, with giving him the chance to
try the no-booze bar.
   It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager Lester J. Szmajlo
endorses.
   ``You've got people that maybe shouldn't be drinking, that don't
want to drink and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have
that same atmosphere, a party night, and not get drunk,'' Szmajlo
says.
   The Club Soda drink menu runs the gamut from the ever-popular
Shirley Temple, ginger ale with a dash of grenadine, to more exotic
items such as the Lemon Spritzer, Pineburst and a host of frozen
coladas, as well a mineral water, cappuccino and expresso coffees.
   ``The help has been very supportive of this and it's tough to
find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that
they're accustomed to in a real bar,'' Perugini says.
   The club, which opened Feb. 27, averages 130 to 150 people a
night, Perugini says. Most non-drinkers are discovering the club by
word-of-mouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local
newspaper.
   Michelle Killiany, 19, of Bristol, heard about the club in an
alcoholism recovery program in which she participates.
   ``I don't miss not having drinks, not at all,'' she says. ``I
like it here a lot. The mirrors and the non-alcoholic drink. Hang
around, you'll see, it's a gas. It's worth the drive.''
   There is a doorman at Club Soda, not to check ID's but to check
for boozers and potential troublemakers. The doorman does not admit
anyone who has been drinking.
   ``Some people may come in for a goof, but that's on them,''
Perugini says. ``They're the ones who paid the five bucks to come
in and walk right out.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's something of a cross between ``Ripley's
Believe It or Not'' and ``60 Minutes,'' which may have inspired its
name. Soviet television's rapid-fire news show ``600 Seconds,''
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the
establishment, has become immensely popular since it went on the
air. Before Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, such a program would
have been unthinkable in the Soviet Union.

   A lost bull roams a busy city street.
Prostitutes woo foreign customers. A holiday bombing rips off a
man's legs.
   These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviet
television screens as glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
drive for openness, goes video.
   Traditionally, the Kremlin has used state-run television as it
did other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather than
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just
plain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on
subjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commands
unlimited time.
   But Gorbachev is a more lively TV personality than his
predecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speeches
and broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first time
this winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other on
television.
   Western music videos are shown routinely, ``space bridges''
bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Soviet
living rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives
Soviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles.
   One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat stories
about the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is ``600
Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on Leningrad television that has
become a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987.
   Six days a week, 15 million people in Leningrad, Moscow and
other regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latest
sensations from the Soviet Union's second-largest city.
   ``600 Seconds'' is like a cross between ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not'' and ``60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show,
``Our City Scandal-Monger.''
   At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes
of news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotaped
reports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digital
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the
remaining seconds.
   Nevzorov's irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishes
stirring up the town with what he calls ``sensations.'' The program
consists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of the
bizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet.
   Nevzorov, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races around
this city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for his
Monday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from the
public and police.
   He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go
along with such status in the West _ no secretary, no private
office, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $475 a
month.
   Nevzorov is a former horse trainer and TV scriptwriter, and
bristles when the word journalist is mentioned. Most Soviet
journalists, he said, could not come up with the stories he does,
and he doesn't agree with the Western notion that journalists
should be objective and not sensationalize the news.
   The public turns to ``600 Seconds'' to fight the Soviet
bureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program to
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his
apartment window.
   ``600 Seconds'' and other Leningrad TV programs have helped lift
the veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution,
murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject,
privileges of the Soviet elite.
   But there are still forbidden themes. Nevzorov's boss, Alexander
A. Yurkov, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary.
   Edward A. Sagalayev, head of Soviet TV's Information Department,
who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult.
``I also have my bosses. We have our minister. He has his
deputies...And it is not always possible to overcome
psychologically these traditions.''

   While much of Soviet television is looking more
Western, the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers
to do things the old-fashioned way.
   ``Hello, comrades,'' Igor Kirillov says as he peers through
thick bifocals to begin Vremya, the nightly news on
state-controlled television.
   He has uttered those same words since Vremya first went on the
air on Jan. 1, 1968, and became a main news source for the Soviet
Union's 285 million people.
   While other Soviet TV programs and the press are tapping
glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness, to
air sensations about crime, history, or life in the West, Vremya
has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago.
   When the superpowers agreed last March that U.S. President
Ronald Reagan would travel to the country he had called an ``evil
empire,'' a major announcement worldwide, Soviets had to sit
through two hours of a Gorbachev speech about farming and a story
about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from Vremya,
which is Russian for time.
   Vremya still dwells on long-winded reports about the Soviet
economy, often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore
dubbed ``tractor news.''
   And in static pictures that make Western producers cringe,
cameras often fix on Kirillov and other announcers reading lengthy
government statements.
   Vremya has its high points, however. When an earthquake killed
thousands on Dec. 7 in Armenia, Vremya aired a dramatic report from
the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks.
   Kirillov, 57, read the news during the ``period of stagnation,''
the conservative rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, and has
continued through the glasnost years.
   Interviewed in Vremya's tiny studio, Kirillov compared the
program, then and now.
   ``Earlier it was good,'' he said through gritted teeth,
indicating some discomfort with that evaluation. Switching to his
full baritone voice, he added: ``Now it is also good.''
   Other TV programs borrow the style of American broadcasts.
Kirillov concedes he watches the Cable News Network, but says he is
sticking to his old-fashioned, formal style.
   A new man in charge of Vremya described the ideal anchorman.
   ``He should be a little bit of a journalist, a little bit of an
actor, a little bit of a politician,'' says Edward M. Sagalayev,
head of Soviet TV's Information Department.
   Producers are spicing up Vremya with graphics, foreign video
plucked off communications satellites, and shorter, more
interesting and timely reports.
   Sagalayev says Vremya lags behind other programs because it was
born before glasnost, when ``there was a big difference between
politics and real life,'' and ``because it has much official and
government information.''

   Dinah Manoff's earlier work for the producers
of ``Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in the
new NBC comedy.
   The show, about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly
finds himself living alone, was created by Susan Harris, who also
created ``Soap'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   Manoff plays Carol Weston, the self-absorbed daughter of the
pediatrician, played by Richard Mulligan, and sister of a
policewoman, played by Kristy McNichol.
   ``They auditioned hundreds of actresses,'' she says. ``Everybody
I knew went in for that role. They couldn't find what they were
looking for.''
   It would seem that Manoff would have had an edge because she had
played Elaine Lefkowitz in ``Soap'' for the producers,
Witt-Thomas-Harris.
   But, she says, ``They didn't think I was right for the part at
first because of the work I'd done in `Soap.' The characters were
different. They didn't want the New York, Jewish, fast-talking,
tough Mafia princess I played in `Soap.' I'd played the same kind
of character in the movie `I Ought To Be in Pictures.'
   ``So I asked to read. When I read I made sure that none of that
was showing. And they saw it and cast me.''
   Manoff says she has ``a real affinity'' for the writing of Susan
Harris.
   ``I understand her rhythm,'' she says. ``I understand her
language.''
   She disagrees with descriptions of Carol as neurotic. ``She's
just terribly self-involved,'' she says. ``Everything has to
revolve around her. If there's a disaster somewhere, her only
thought is how does it affect her. She regularly takes her
emotional temperature.''
   Manoff grew up in a show business family. Her mother is
actress-director Lee Grant and her stepfather is producer Joe
Feury. Last summer she worked in ``Boy's Life,'' a movie made on
location in South Carolina directed by her mother and produced by
her stepfather.
   ``It was very interesting,'' she says. ``It was kind of like
being 14 and told to clean up your room. That's the downside. The
upside is that she and I are very close friends and very admiring
of each other as actresses and artists.''
   She'd worked for her mother once before, on a TV movie called
``A Matter of Sex.'' The movie, which also starred Jean Stapleton,
was about sexual discrimination in the workplace.
   She didn't begin acting until she was 19 because her mother
didn't want her to be a child actor. She was a college film student
briefly, then quit to pursue her acting career.
   Manoff studied at the Actor's Studio and made her professional
debut in a production for PBS called ``The Great Cherub Knitwear
Strike.'' Next, she did a small role on the TV series ``Welcome
Back, Kotter.''
   Manoff won a Tony in 1980 for her Broadway role in ``I Ought To
Be In Pictures.'' She reprised her role in the movie version.
   Her only other series was ``Soap,'' on which she played the
daughter of a gangster and the wife of Danny Dallas (Ted Wass).
   Her film ``Child's Play'' is just out and ``Bloodhounds of
Broadway'' is due in September. Another movie, a thriller called
``Backfire,'' is coming up on Showtime.
   She is starting a new movie called ``Welcome Home, Roxie
Carmichael,'' which also stars Winona Ryder and Jeff Daniels.

   On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on the
other side the Sharks. The rival gangs from ``West Side Story''
huddle around microphones and watch conductor Paul Gemignani on a
small podium in the middle of a vast wood-paneled room filled with
musicians.
   It's a Sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' are in RCA Records' Studio A on West 44th
Street.
   The singers look at Gemignani. The conducter, wearing
headphones, glances at a man standing over a control panel in a
soundproof booth near the stage. Take after take is recorded until
Jay David Saks is satisfied.
   Saks, an RCA Records producer, is the man who must capture the
sound of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' a celebration of some of the
biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer.
Besides a suite of dances from ``West Side Story,'' the show
includes numbers from ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``The King and I,''
``Gypsy,'' ``Peter Pan'' and others.
   The final result, released in May on two records or two
cassettes or two compact discs, is one of the most lavish original
cast recordings ever made. It includes more than 120 minutes of
music and a 62-page booklet with extensive notes on each of the
musicals included in the show.
   ``Cast albums are very demanding,'' says Saks, who has been in
the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album
guru Thomas Z. Shepard at Columbia Records. ``They require a great
deal of advance preparation and a lot of study. If you're going to
record the Beethoven `Seventh Symphony,' you don't have to sit
there in advance and decide whether you're going to take it up a
key or whether you're going to leave out the third movement.
   ``But in the case of a Broadway show, you have a theatrical work
that's designed for the stage,'' he says, ``and how does it
translate to a record when you have nothing to go by except what
you're hearing? Frequently you have to change the reality of what
is happening musically to re-create more accurately the memory in
the listener.''
   Before the taping sessions, Saks wasn't sure how ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' would work on record. It presented special
problems.
   ``Most of this music is familiar, and most of it has been
recorded before,'' he recalls. ``For example, you don't want to
have just another recording of `West Side Story.' Plus there's a
lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show. So what do
you do with it?''
   Saks decided to record not just the music, but the feel of the
stage production. He brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he
calls ``crowd material,'' not just the singing.
   In the past, most Broadway musicals were recorded in one day,
usually the company's day off. Some still are, but ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' took three days, spread over two weeks, to
complete.
   For one reason, it was twice as long as a regular cast
recording. It has a large cast _ 62 performers _ and a large
orchestra _ 42 musicians plus two players added for the ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' segment.
   For another, technical advances have allowed for more material
to be placed on a record, tape or compact disc.
   Saks jumped to RCA in 1974 when Shepard did. He also became a
producer of classical recordings, supervising albums by such
orchestras as the Chicago Symphony conducted by James Levine and
the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. But he also
assisted Shepard on some of the best cast recordings ever made,
including ``Sunday in the Park with George'' and ``Sweeney Todd.''

   The 1988 Tony Awards show was the lowest-rated
Tony program ever, and the prospects don't appear much brighter for
the 1989 extravaganza (9 p.m. EDT Sunday, CBS-TV) saluting the best
of what has been a woeful Broadway theater season.
   But even last year's program, which was ranked No. 42 in the
Nielsen ratings for that week, was seen in an estimated 9.5 million
homes. Those viewers would fill a lot of Broadway theaters, a fact
not lost on the Tony nominating committee. All seven productions
nominated this year for best play or best musical are still running.
   And Tony Awards sell tickets. ``M. Butterfly,'' last season's
best-play winner, started to sell out after it won the top award.
Also-rans such as ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' and ``A Walk in
the Woods,'' quickly folded.
   Don Mischer and David Goldberg, who produce the Tony television
show, are optimistic about this year's edition, which will be
televised live from the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
   ``You always hope for a strong season,'' Mischer says. ``The
biggest thing you work for in this show is to try and keep the
television viewer familiar with what is happening on Broadway so
that when awards are given, they have some idea who the people are
and what the plays and musicals are about. If you have a really
popular season, that helps you a bit.''
   For the third straight year, Angela Lansbury will serve as host
for the show which will feature scenes or dance numbers from the
best-play and musical nominees. Among the stars scheduled to appear
are Steve Martin, Tommy Tune, Gwen Verdon, Colleen Dewhurst and
Richard Thomas.
   But the suspense should be minimal. ``The Heidi Chronicles,''
which has won every honor from the Pulitzer Prize to the New York
Drama Critics' Circle award, is a clear favorite to be tapped as
best play. Wendy Wasserstein's look at one woman's journey from the
1960s to the present faces ``Largely New York,'' Bill Irwin's
wordless entertainment; ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce by Ken Ludwig
about an indisposed opera star; and ``Shirley Valentine,'' Willy
Russell's portrait of a bored but never boring English housewife.
   There's even less uncertainty about the winner in the top
musical category. The season produced one hot ticket _ ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' _ and it should easily ace the best musical
category. The telecast will feature a dance number from ``West Side
Story,'' the high point of the Robbins show.
   Only two other shows _ ``Black and Blue'' and ``Starmites'' _
were nominated for best musical. The television presentation will
also feature two songs from ``Black and Blue,'' a revue of blues
songs and tap dancing, and a campy, Bette Midler-style number,
``Hard to Be Diva,'' from ``Starmites,'' a sci-fi, comic strip
musical.
   ``With the Emmys, Grammys and Oscars, the nation is basically
familiar with those TV shows, records and films nominated,''
Goldberg says. ``Here, it is more difficult. That's one of the
reasons we are presenting segments from the plays and musicals. We
are trying to make the show more relevant for them. So if Bill
Irwin wins, for example, they have seen him and what he won for.''
   Broadway had a bumpy year. Although it grossed a record $262
million, attendance declined slightly from 8.1 million to 8
million, and the number of productions slipped to 30, down two from
the previous season. The biggest hits were still two long-running
shows, ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables,'' and
others such as ``Cats'' and ``Me and My Girl'' show no sign of
closing soon.
   Even those big hits couldn't guarantee high ratings for previous
Tony shows. Mischer is philosophic about the gradual ratings slide
for the program over the years.
   ``The Tonys still do better than the average variety show on
television,'' he says. ``If you look back on the variety shows over
the last two or three years, the ratings have simply gone down and
down and down. We're living in an age of hyperactive television
watching. We sit there with a clicker in our hand, go through 38
channels and dare something to hold our interest for five seconds.
   ``That works against variety television. It works against things
that are different. If there is one act you don't like, one song
you don't like or one speech you feel is too boring, you're apt to
move on. And all of that affects the ratings.''

   Sales of new homes were up a strong 10.9
percent in April, the government reported, but housing economists
say the industry will remain sluggish at least into summer because
of high interest rates.
   The increase in sales to 620,000 units on a seasonally adjusted
annual basis reported Tuesday was due to an aberration in sales in
February and March, when sales dropped 10.9 percent and 10.4
percent, respectively, economists said.
   The April increase was the steepest since a 13.9 percent jump in
February 1988.

   International Business Machines Corp. has
elected a new president, but the technology-minded executive is not
in line to be chairman of the world's largest computer company
because he is older than the current officeholder.
   Jack D. Kuehler, the new president, is 56. John F. Akers, the
chairman and chief executive, is 54.
   The new job for Kuehler is a recognition of his contributions in
a 31-year career at the company, IBM spokesman Peter Judice said
Tuesday in announcing Kuehler's promotion.
   Kuehler's duties at IBM's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters will be
about the same as they were in his former job of vice chairman,
although he will have slightly more authority, Judice said. The
vice chairmanship will be left vacant for now.
   IBM has no mandatory retirement age, but top executives make a
practice of relinquishing their jobs at age 60. That gives Akers
potentially six more years as chairman.
   Kuehler's predecessor as president was Akers himself. Akers
became president in February 1983, added the title of chief
executive in February 1985 and added the chairmanship in June 1986
at the unusually young age of 51.
   As vice chairman, Kuehler's job under the bylaws was to assist
the chairman. As president, the bylaws state that he is to run the
business, after the chairman, and can act for the chairman.
   ``It's a somewhat more substantive position,'' Judice said.
   Kuehler is known within IBM as a technology expert, in contrast
to Akers, whose main strength is in marketing.
   Kuehler began with the company as an associate engineer at the
San Jose Research Laboratory in 1958. He was elected to the board
of directors in 1986 and executive vice president in March 1987.
   He was named IBM vice chairman of the board in January 1988 and
given responsibility for overseeing IBM United States, the
organization headed by Terry Lautenbach that is responsible for all
IBM activities in the United States as well as worldwide
development. He also has overseen corporate staffs in charge of
manufacturing and systems and programming.
   Kuehler will keep those responsibilities as president.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and chief executive of Matilda
Publications Inc., which publishes Ms. and Sassy magazines, has
resigned from the privately-held concern she helped found a year
ago, the company announced.
   Sources close to the company said Tuesday that the publishing
concern was looking for someone who may be willing to invest in
Matilda Publications.
   Sandra Yates resigned Friday and left the staff a memo in which
she said she was leaving to ``begin work on other publishing
projects.''
   ``I leave confident of the future prospects of Sassy and Ms.
magazines, both of which are doing well and continue to flourish,''
she wrote.
   A call was placed to Ms. Yates, but she was said to be
unavailable to elaborate on her reasons for leaving.
   The board of Matilda Publications appointed Carla Graubard,
Matilda's chief operating officer, as acting chief executive until
a successor to Ms. Yates is found. Ms. Graubard did not return a
telephone call.
   The board also said Anne Summers, editor-in-chief of Ms., will
assume editorial responsibility for both Sassy and Ms.
   Ms. Summers, who was Ms. Yates' partner in getting Matilda
started last June, said she would not speculate about her partner's
reasons for leaving.
   Ms. Summers said the company was ``in the process of doing a
refinancing'' and has for been looking for ``a couple of months''
at the possibility of bringing in ``a new partner who has some
publishing experience.'' She declined to say what conditions led to
the search, but said it would be incorrect to say that the company
had been placed on the auction block.
   Matilda's current financial backers include Citicorp's Venture
Capital Fund and Australia's State Bank of New South Wales.
   Ms. Yates had introduced Sassy, aimed at teenage girls, to the
United States in March 1988 as a publication of John Fairfax Ltd.,
which is based in Australia.
   Sassy had a circulation of about 437,000 at the end of 1988,
while Ms. has a circulation of about 550,000, Ms. Summers said.
   Matilda Publications was formed in June 1988 and bought Sassy
and Ms. from Fairfax for a reported price of about $15 million.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts are evaluating an extra-light type of
crude oil recently discovered in at least three fields in
southeastern Mexico to determine if it is profitable for marketing,
according to a source at the state petroleum monopoly Pemex.
   The new Toltec crude is at least 40 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute's gravity scale _ the lightest found so far in
Mexico, said the source, who spoke Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
   It was discovered at the beginning of the year at ``great
depth'' in the Juju, Tecominuacan, Paredon and other onshore fields
that lie between the Gulf of Mexico port of Coatzacoalcos and
Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco state.
   ``We are still making studies of the characteristics of this
crude. We are taking a series of samples and analyzing them to see
what characteristics they have, their yield and what (production)
problems are involved,'' the source added, refusing to say more.
   The Toltec is even lighter than the Olmec variety, measuring 38
to 39 degrees, discovered by Pemex last year in the state of
Tabasco and Chiapas states and now being exported in small
quanitities.
   One of Mexico's two other traditional varieties, the Isthmus
measures 33 API and the heavy Maya 22. The Olmec has been found to
contain very little sulphur and metals. Lighter crude is easier to
refine.

<TEXT>
   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, has
started to evaluate buyout offers, including bids by billionaire
Marvin Davis and Pan Am Corp.
   Davis and Pan Am said they met NWA's Tuesday afternoon deadline
for submitting acquisition proposals, but declined to outline
specifics of their bids. Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest
airline, would not disclose who the suitors were or how many
proposals it received.
   NWA's stock closed up $1.25 at $107.25 a share Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   James Fingeroth, a spokesman for Davis, said the Los
Angeles-based oil and real estate mogul made an offer but retained
a limited right to pursue his outstanding hostile tender offer of
$2.7 billion, or $90 a share, for NWA. The tender offer was
scheduled to expire this afternoon, but likely would be extended,
Fingeroth said.
   Fingeroth declined to provide details of the latest Davis offer,
which was submitted to NWA's financial adviser, First Boston Corp.
A spokeswoman for First Boston said none of the bidders or bids
would be disclosed.
   Pan Am indicated earlier Tuesday that it had obtained $2.7
billion in bank financing for a buyout plan that it submitted by
the deadline, but declined to disclose terms of the bid. The
proposal also includes at least $400 million in new equity
financing from a group that includes Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. and the partnership Airlie Group L.P.
   Other potential bidders that have expressed interest in NWA
included an investment group led by former Marriott Corp. executive
Al Checchi; Northwest's 20,000-member machinists union, which has
indicated it might team with an outside investor to buy a major
stake in the airline; and the Wall Street buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Checchi did not return phone calls Tuesday and a KKR spokesman
in New York said the firm would not comment. Guy Cook, president of
the International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143,
also did not return calls seeking to determine if the union had
submitted a buyout plan.
   NWA has directed four of its outside directors to review all
offers, but Chairman Steven Rothmeier repeatedly has said the board
could ultimately decide not to sell.
   Possible alternatives for NWA include acquisition of another
company, a partial or complete liquidation of the airline, a
repurchase of shares, payment of a special dividend, or the sale of
a bid stake to a ``white squire'' group that would obtain a
controlling interest but would support current management.
   Northwest, based in suburban Eagan, has said it would like to
make a decision in the takeover battle by the end of June.
   The NWA board has pushed for a single round of bidding, but
analysts said the process could start over if a higher bid arrives
after the deadline.
   Cooperation from Northwest's unions is considered crucial to the
bid by Pan Am.
   Industry analysts have been cautious about Pan Am's prospects
because of that company's $900 million in debt, $535 million in
outstanding pension liabilities and continuing operating losses.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett told investors last week that
should his bid for NWA succeed, he plans no sales of operating
assets and no sale or lease-back of planes.
   Plaskett also has said he was not counting on any revenue from a
sale of NWA's real estate in Japan, but would save $240 million by
streamlining the new carrier's corporate headquarters, marketing
operation, maintenance and other support services.

   International Business Machines Corp. has
announced supercomputing equipment that an executive said would
``compete very favorably against the other manufacturers of
supercomputers in the world.''
   IBM offers equipment and software that can be added onto its
most powerful mainframe computers so they function as
supercomputers. Although Cray Research Inc. is considered the
world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, IBM has actually sold
more units when its souped-up mainframes are counted.
   IBM developed the new offerings in cooperation with partners
including Cornell University and Los Alamos National Laboratory,
said the IBM executive, Thomas Jarosh, director of scientific and
technical computing marketing in the United States.
   Jarosh declined Tuesday to specify the peak speed of the systems
so no direct comparison is possible with machines made by Cray and
other supercomputer makers.
   Prices will be announced in 60 days and installations will begin
no later than the last quarter of 1989.
   IBM's most powerful mainframe computer is the ES-3090 Model 600,
which has six processors. New hardware and software will allow
customers to hook two of those machines together so a job can be
run across as many as 12 processors at once.
   Also announced was a communications channel that can transfer
data at 800 million bits a second. IBM said it was the first
channel to meet a draft standard established by the American
National Standards Institute.
   In addition, IBM said new software would speed up the computer's
ability to find and place data in storage devices.

<HEAD>Polaroid Discusses Strategy At Stockholders Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. outlined new corporate
strategies at its annual stockholders meeting, but the company's
successful defense against a hostile takeover was mentioned only
briefly.
   The topic of Polaroid's hard-fought battle to repel a $3.1
billion bid by investor Roy E. Disney, made through his Shamrock
Holdings Inc., came up when a shareholder asked a nominal question
about it Tuesday, officials said.
   The meeting instead focused on new marketing, product
development and manufacturing strategies by the company, based in
nearby Cambridge.
   Polaroid President I. MacAllister Booth told the group of about
1,200 stockholders at Wellesley College that the company in 1988
re-evaluated ``its technology, its marketplace, its organization
and its behavior, making a rapid, quantifiable leap forward in
profitability.''
   ``We are in the midst of a major turnaround in this company, and
because of the progress we have made, I have confidence that this
turnaround will continue,'' said Booth.
   Polaroid Group Vice President William J. O'Neill said the
company is aiming for a 50 percent increase in the growing imaging
field by 1995. Imaging refers to the storage of pictures or
documents through electronic means, as opposed to photographic
means.
   Carl J. Yankowski, vice-president of marketing, said Polaroid
will develop new market-driven technologies, especially in imaging.
   Yankowski said dealer and consumer response to Polaroid's new
conventional ``OneFilm'' has been favorable. The film represents
the first time Polaroid has ventured out of its specialty,
self-developing film. OneFilm is made for Polaroid by Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., or 3M.
   Polaroid reported a first-quarter profit of $25.9 million on
revenue of $442.3 million, compared with a profit of $14.2 million
on revenue of $410.1 million for the same 1988 period. Polaroid
said it spend $38.5 million to fight off Shamrock in the period.

<HEAD>Eastern Runs First TV Ad Since Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to persuade consumers it is
reliable, punctual and run by experienced workers, Eastern Airlines
has started advertising on television for the first time since the
start of a bruising strike.
   Eastern recently began running the commercial in Miami, New
York, Washington and Atlanta, at a cost of more than $500,000. The
beleaguered airline already had been advertising in major
newspapers.
   ``We're trying to build awareness and provide some
information,'' George Brennan, Eastern's vice president of
marketing, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
   In recent weeks, Miami-based Eastern has been promoting its new
plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell about $1.8 billion of
assets.
   The plan still must be approved by federal bankruptcy court in
New York, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection and
reorganization shortly after the March 4 strike began.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has given Eastern
permission to sell its Northeast shuttle service to developer
Donald Trump for $365 million and to lease 14 Boeing 727-200s to
Pan Am Corp. for $57.9 million over three years.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., has
been defending his plan in meetings with media organizations such
as USA Today, The Associated Press and NBC News.
   Eastern's unions, on the other hand, are pushing for a sale of
the entire airline.
   Of the 31,200 pilots, Machinists union members and flight
attendants employed by Eastern before the strike, only a few have
crossed picket lines. The airline has hired about 500 new pilots
and 60 skilled mechanics.
   Eastern's operations have been sharply reduced by the strike and
it has run only about 10 percent of its normal flight schedule.
   The TV ad doesn't mention the strike or bankruptcy filing. It
features a pilot who has flown for Eastern for 31 years and a
21-year maintenance manager speaking to the camera while seated at
a desk. The words ``Experience,'' ``Commitment'' and ``On-Time
Performance'' flash at intervals.
   The maintenance manager, Charlie Fisher, emphasizes what he
calls the cooperative attitude and ``esprit de corps'' of Eastern
workers. The pilot, Hal Harley, says that more than 5,000 Eastern
flights have arrived on time since April 1.
   ``We've got a brand new Eastern Airlines with a bunch of old
pros,'' Fisher says. ``We're taking off'' is flashed on the screen.
   The average age of newly hired pilots is 39 years, up sharply
from the pre-strike average of pilots in their late 20s, according
to the company.
   Fisher said the commercial was made in about six hours with no
script and no rehearsing. ``I think most employees would have given
anything to be in my place,'' he said in a phone interview from
Miami. ``I think the message we wanted to say got across.''
   Striking pilots disagreed.
   ``It's sad to see these lost sheep supporting Frank Lorenzo and
Texas Air,'' said Dan Ashby, a union spokesman.
   In New York, meanwhile, the ad agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc.
announced it had won the ad contract for the Trump Shuttle.
Advertising for Eastern's shuttle had been handled by Lintas, which
does ads for the rest of the airline.

<HEAD>Study: Insurers Must Consider Cost-Effectiveness Of New Medical Technologies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with spiraling medical costs, insurers
must begin weighing not only the health benefits of new medical
technologies but their costs and whether improved care justifies
the added expense, says a study by New England's largest health
maintenance organization.
   ``Cost is a legitimate consideration in making coverage
decisions,'' said a report issued Tuesday by the Harvard Community
Health Plan. ``Even when it is established that a new, more
expensive therapy is better than the existing alternatives, one
must question whether the added benefit is worth the added cost.''
   The report said that without a framework to evaluate the cost
and effectiveness of technologies, decisions on what should be
covered by insurance will be ``put off until time of crisis (and
then) are more likely to be influenced by emotions or political
expedience than by medical efficacy.''
   ``Not only might underserving technologies be approved, but the
most deserving technologies may be overlooked,'' the report said.
   The study said new technologies must first be investigated to
see if they represent an improvement in health care.
   The study pointed to rapid adoption of tissue plasminogen
activator, a genetically engineered drug for dissolving blood clots
that cause heart attacks. The report said it remained unclear
whether the drug, at $2,000 per dose, is any more effective than
Streptokinase, a competing drug, at $200 a dose.
   The report, based on the findings of a three-year study by a
special commission appointed by Harvard Community Health, also
suggested that older procedures be periodically evaluated.
   ``It was once thought that the minimal dangers of circumcision
were far outweighed by health benefits to the child, and so the
practice was commonly covered by insurers. Recent findings have led
many in the medical community to question whether the procedure
provides any health benefit,'' the commission said.
   But beyond comparing the effectiveness of various technologies,
insurers also should weigh the relative worth of new technologies
that are proven to be more effective. Insurers should ``avoid
treatments that cost far more than any benefits they might bring
about are worth,'' the study said.
   ``Few, if any, health plans now acknowledge considering cost in
their coverage decisions. The result is that cost effectiveness is
rarely analyzed in any rigorous way, and there is little pressure
on the proponents of new therapies to establish their relative
effectiveness.
   ``Those technologies that offer the greatest incremental gain
for the incremental cost ought to be adopted first,'' the
commission said. In addition, the panel said, new technologies that
benefit the largest number of members should be selected before
``those whose benefits would be limited to a few members.''
   The commission suggested a cap on the cost of new technologies
based on ``how many years' worth of earnings ought to be devoted to
extending a member's life for one year.''
   ``As more and more resources are devoted to extending a life for
a short time, it becomes clear that choices must be made between
competing goods,'' the panel said.
   Harvard Community Health created the commission in 1985 after
the Brookline, Mass., health organization became the nation's first
HMO to provide coverage for heart and liver transplants.
   ``The increasing sophistication and cost of new technology poses
a dilemma for all HMOs and health insurers: the HMO or insurer must
balance the welfare of the individual patient against the welfare
of all the people who pay premiums into the fund,'' wrote Thomas O.
Pyle, the HMO's president.
   ``By presenting this summary, we do not mean to imply that HCHP
endorses all of the commission's conclusions. Our goal is to
stimulate discussion in the hope that the community will benefit,''
said Pyle.

<HEAD>Avon Says `No' to Mary Kay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. has told Mary Kay Corp. that
Avon isn't for sale and sees no potential benefit from combining
the two cosmetics sellers.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
stated in a letter Tuesday to John Rochon, Mary Kay vice chairman:
``We strongly believe our opportunities will be better achieved by
Avon continuing with our business plan.''
   In the letter, released by Avon, Preston indicated Mary Kay has
had a longstanding interest in Avon.
   ``As I told you last January, we see no advantage to combining
our operations through some form of leveraged buyout or other
arrangement,'' Preston said.
   The reference was to a Jan. 11 New York dinner meeting between
Preston and Rochon, Avon spokesman John Cox said. The two had no
other face-to-face contact and spoke by telephone only once, to set
up the meeting.
   During the meeting, attended only by the two executives, Rochon
extolled the advantages of being a private company and asked
Preston to take Avon private and unite with Mary Kay.
   Rochon has been given much of the credit for the financial
success of the the 1985 leveraged buyout of the Dallas-based
door-to-door cosmetics company.
   Rochon also told Preston an LBO could provide Preston with a
financial windfall, allowing him to leave the company in a few
years several million dollars richer, Cox said.
   Preston replied that he wasn't interested and even if he were
contemplating a leveraged buyout he wouldn't need Mary Kay to do
it, according to the Avon spokesman.
   Although the meeting occurred in January, Avon had been aware of
Mary Kay's possible intentions earlier.
   The first hint came two years ago when Joel Stern of the
investment firm Stern Stewart &amp; Co. approached Avon about the
possibility of buying Mary Kay. He said he was working as a
consultant for Mary Kay, according to Cox.
   Avon's management evaluated the idea and decided the two direct
sellers wouldn't make a good match, he said. Plus, Avon sales
representatives probably would have reacted negatively because, in
some areas of the country, the Mary Kay sales force is the main
competition.
   Several months later in 1987 word came to Avon that someone was
preparing a hostile bid, Cox said. At about the same time, a public
relations firm Avon had hired resigned the account on the grounds
there might be a conflict with another client's business. The other
client was Mary Kay.
   Over the two years, Avon has been told Mary Kay has searched
unsuccessfully for investment partners to help buy Avon, Cox said.
Avon also learned Mary Kay wasn't interested in Avon's
international business, due to concerns about the risk of currency
fluctuations.
   Avon has learned that Mary Kay started buying Avon shares last
Nov. 10 but stopped short the threshold that would have triggered
federal ownerhip disclosure requirements, Cox said.
   No one at Mary Kay was available to comment on Avon's portrayal
of the events, a public relations representative said.
   Rochon publicly conveyed his company's feelings about Avon in a
letter to Preston last week that was released by Mary Kay. No terms
of proposed merger have been mentioned by Rochon.
   Earlier this month, Avon's board rejected an offer by Amway
Corp. to buy Avon for $39 a share, or about $2.1 billion. Amway
later withdrew the offer.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, Avon
closed at $35.62{ a share, down $1.12{.

<HEAD>U.S.-European Talks on Exports to Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks will resume this summer to set standards
under which U.S. products could be exported to Europe after
internal trade barriers are lifted there in 1992, it was announced
today.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Martin Bangemann,
European Commission vice president, announced the resumption of
talks in a joint communique released here and in Paris. The talke
are to be held in Brussels, Belgium.
   ``The issues of how standards will be set and what they will be
is a top concern of the American business community,'' Mosbacher
said in a statement released by the Commerce Department. ``With
this agreement to establish a dialogue, we have made significant
progress toward easing that concern.''
   The 12 nations comprising the European Community have agreed to
remove trade barriers in 1992 and operate as a single $4 trillion
market with 320 million consumers. Some government and business
leaders fear the regulations and technical standards being written
for the transition could result in barriers against U.S. goods.
   Mosbacher and Bangemann, who met Tuesday in Brussels, where
President Bush was attending the NATO summit, agreed that products
imported into the new European market would have the same access to
testing and certification procedures as European products.
   They also agreed there should be exploratory talks on
negotiations to ensure mutually recognized arrangements for product
safety and quality, the Commerce Department statement said.
   ``Establishing this dialogue between the United States and the
European Community is an important step for us to take together,''
Mosbacher said. ``It reassures American business and holds great
promise for the entire world trading system.''

   American companies were the biggest investors in
Japan, while the United States was the number-one destination for
Japanese investment overseas last year, Finance Ministry officials
said Wednesday.
   Investment by foreign countries in Japan jumped sharply last
year, and investment by Japan overseas hit a record high, they said.
   Despite the high yen, which makes investing in Japan expensive,
foreign companies increased their investment in Japan 46.5 percent
to $3.24 billion during the fiscal year ended March 31. American
companies took 54.7 percent of the total, according to a report
released Wednesday by the Finance Ministry.
   American investment in Japan jumped 89.1 percent over the
previous year to total $1.77 billion, the report said.
   During the same period, Japan's direct overseas investment hit a
record high for the fifth year in a row, jumping 40.9 percent in
fiscal 1988 over the previous year to $47.02 billion, a ministry
official said, citing a report released Tuesday.
   The United States attracted the most direct investment from
Japan _ $21.7 billion in fiscal 1988, up 47.6 percent from the
previous year.
   A total of $3.95 billion from Japan went to Britain during the
period, up 60 percent, while investment in the Netherlands nearly
tripled to $2.39 billion, the report said.
   Ministry officials attributed the increase in Japanese direct
investment overseas to active expansion of overseas production by
Japanese manufacturers and of overseas activities by financial and
real estate companies.
   By industry, direct overseas investment by machinery makers
totaled $1.43 billion, more than double the level in fiscal 1987;
investment by the chemical sector rose 42.1 percent to $1.29
billion; the steel and non-ferrous metal sector rose 73.9 percent
to $1.36 billion; and electric makers were up 25.6 percent to $3.04
billion, the report said.
   In the services sector, financial and insurance firms together
invested $13.1 billion overseas, up 22.8 percent from the previous
year. Real estate firms invested $8.64 billion, up 59.2 percent,
the report said.
   The report counted as direct overseas investment any investment
of more than 10 percent in an overseas firm, investment in overseas
branches by home firms and expansion of their subsidiaries in
foreign countries.

<HEAD>U.S. Computer Industry Says Milestone Reached in China Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GENE KRAMER</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is moving to solve a major trade dispute
with the United States by agreeing to provide legal protection from
piracy of imported computer programs, U.S. industry and government
officials say.
   A Chinese delegation last week signed a bilateral agreement with
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills to cover computer software
by law, and indicated that by the end of this year the Beijing
government would submit a copyright law for legislative approval,
the U.S. Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association
announced Tuesday.
   The industry ``views this agreement with the Chinese as a
landmark in U.S.-Chinese intellectual property rights negotiations,
but we are keenly aware that progress is still merely in the
conceptual stage,'' said Oliver R. Smoot, the association's
executive vice president.
   Only last February, a CBEMA statement asserted that ``piracy of
computer programs is rampant'' in China.
   Industry officials said the agreement was concluded in
Washington last Thursday. Hours later, Mrs. Hills mentioned recent
``significant agreements'' with China, Taiwan and Colombia on
copyright and patent protection issues, but still named China and
seven other countries to a ``priority watch list'' on copyright and
patent protection. It calls for intensified negotiations and review
by Nov. 1 of their anti-piracy safeguards.
   Mrs. Hills' office did not immediately comment on the industry
statements. A State Department official, insisting on anonymity,
described the U.S.-China accord as a memorandum of understanding,
which is less binding than a formal agreement.
   Computer association officials said they understood the Thursday
agreement staved off harsher treatment for the China in the U.S.
government's first application last week of the new 1988 Omnibus
Trade Act. Three countries, Japan, Brazil and India, were
designated for negotiations and potential punitive tariffs for
alleged unfair trade barriers.
   The Chinese Embassy quoted a foreign trade ministry official as
saying in a recent speech in Northeast China that ``administrative
and legislative measures can be taken to protect the interest of
the intellectual property rights holders.''
   Draft regulations on computer softwear protection should be
ready by the end of 1989, and China's 1989 legislative program
provides for submission to the People's Congress of a draft
revision of the patent law, the official, Liu Xiangeong was quoted
as saying.
   Liu also mentioned the traditional Chinese position that
intellectual property such as computer software could be protected
with buyer-seller contract terms providing for confidentiality. The
U.S. side has complained this fails to prevent copying and piracy
by outside parties.
   Differences over customs and patent protection have kept China
and the United States from making the customary five-year renewal
of their Science and Technology Agreement. Instead, they extended
it for only nine months last January.

<HEAD>Subsidiaries of Japanese Company Face Bias Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusual move, the vice chairman of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has charged two U.S.
subsidiaries of Japan's Recruit Co. with ``blatant'' employment
discrimination based on race, sex, age and national origin.
   Commissioners rarely bring charges themselves, but EEOC vice
chairman E. Gaull Silberman said she believed that
Interplace@Transworld Recruit and Recruit USA are continuing to
violate anti-discrimination laws.
   In addition, a judge for the U.S. District Court in Northern
California issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday prohibiting
the company from destroying, altering or removing from the country
any documents relating to an EEOC investigation.
   Recruit Co. was at the center of Japan's bribery scandal that
led to the recent resignation of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   With headquarters in Los Angeles, Interplace is an employment
agency with nine offices in cities that include New York, San
Francisco and San Mateo. Recruit USA shares a headquarters office
with Interplace and publishes help-wanted magazines in the United
States to advertise job openings in Japan.
   Richard Kelley, a senior vice president with Interplace, said
his company and Recruit USA would have no comment until their
lawyers had a chance to examine the charges.
   Court documents include an Interplace memo that describes a code
the company allegedly used on job orders to indicate when a client
wanted an employee of a particular age, sex or race.
   As detailed in the memo, ``Talk to Maria'' meant the client
preferred Hispanics, ``Mary'' meant Caucasians, ``Mariko'' meant
Japanese, ``Adam'' meant men, ``Eve'' meant females and
``Maryanne'' meant blacks. ``Suite 20 to 30'' meant age 20 to 30.
   Last year, after a former employee threatened to expose the
practice, Interplace executive vice president Hideyo Harada ``told
employees in Los Angeles that she had just been instructed `from
the top' to erase codes from all job orders in the computer
database,'' said Linda Krieger, a senior trial attorney with the
EEOC in San Francisco.
   ``We can prove Interplace was violating Title VII (of the Civil
Rights Act) from the job orders we have,'' she said.
   Most charges are filed by aggrieved parties rather than
commissioners themselves. But when employment agencies
discriminate, rejected applicants usually do not know they have
been harmed.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge shot up 0.8 percent in April as it reversed course after
posting declines in the previous two months, the Commerce
Department said today.
   The upward turn in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators
allowed the index to steer clear of the traditional signal of a
forthcoming recession _ three declines in a row.
   The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine
months into the future, had dropped a revised 0.6 percent in March
and 0.3 percent in February.
   Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated,
was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing,
there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime
expansion through its seventh year.
   ``It wasn't a good bet, it isn't a good bet and it's not going
to be a good bet in the fall that a recession is about to occur,''
economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said in
anticipation of today's report.
   Last month's increase in the index was the biggest rise since a
similar 0.8 percent jump in January.
   Using the three-month rule of thumb for predicting recessions,
the index has correctly forecast all eight economic downturns that
have occured since 1948, but it also has flashed false recession
signals on five other occasions.
   Most recently, the index declined five times in a row in the
months surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash, from which
the economy emerged unscathed.
   In April, eight of the 11 forward-looking business statistics
that make up the composite index pointed upward, led by an increase
in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods.
   Other indicators making positive contributions were: rising
building permits; a longer average work week; higher stock prices;
a decrease in initial claims for jobless benefits; slower vendor
deliveries, signaling stronger demand; a gain in orders for new
plants and equipment; and an increase in manufacturers' unfilled
orders.
   Three indicators pointed downward: a drop in an index measuring
consumer confidence; a contraction in the money supply; and falling
prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand.
   The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index has advanced 1.3 percent over the past six
months, compared with a 1.7 percent increase over the previous
six-month period.
   Annable said recent reports on the economy's performance
indicate that growth will slow to a more sustainable level and
``suggest this economy is in better shape for growth than even we
optimists thought.''
   Pessimists, too, are rethinking their views.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, has been forecasting a mild recession by year's end but
now concedes ``the odds are by no means convincing, even to me.''
   ``The evidence is coming in the side of a soft landing _
continued but subdued growth,'' Dederick said.
   That is just what the Federal Reserve has been trying to
produce. In March 1988, the central bank began pushing up interest
rates in an effort to slow growth just enough to restrain inflation
without toppling the country into a recession.
   Dederick said an upturn in the index ``doesn't mean that we
should be looking for the economy to go roaring off but it does
weaken the case that the slowdown is going to develop into
recession proportions.''
   The government reported last week that the economy expanded at a
moderate 4.3 percent annual rate during the first three months of
the year, but the growth in the gross national product was a
lackluster 1.8 percent when a statistical bounceback from last
year's drought is removed.
   That compares with GNP growth of 3.9 percent for all of 1988.
   Still, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the latest GNP
report indicates that ``Fed policy over the past year appears to be
succeeding in steering the economy to a more moderate, but
sustainable, growth path.''
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co. in New York said that even with an upturn in the leading index,
``the economy is still pretty weak.''
   A rebound in the index ``doesn't take away from the notion that
the economy is slowing down, but it does not imply a recession any
time soon,'' Kellner said in advance of today's report.

<HEAD>Mexico Reaches Agreement With Creditor Nations To Cut $2.6 Billion
Of Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico has reached an agreement with 16
creditor nations designed to cut its debt by $2.6 billion and
refinance 80 percent of its debt interest over the next decade, the
government announced.
   The Treasury Department in Mexico announced late Tuesday that
the agreement with the Paris Club, made up of representatives of 16
primary creditor nations, was reached in Paris earlier in the day.
   Under the agreement, Mexico's foreign debt would be cut by a
refinancing of credits for exportations to the 16 creditor nations
involved.
   Mexico currently suffers from a $107.4 billion debt and is among
the largest debtor nations in Latin America, second only to Brazil.
   New President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Treasury Secretary
Pedro Aspe have made refinancing of the foriegn debt a national
priority and Aspe has made numerous trips to Washington for debt
negotiations.
   Mexico in recent months has been presenting creditor foreign
banks and governments with a menu of options designed to reduce
real servicing costs on the foreign debt.
   The country paid $9 billion in interest and $5 billion in
principal in 1988 and servicing costs are expected to reach $16
billion this year.
   In a statement released Tuesday night, the Treasury Department
called the agreement ``exciting'' and said it was ``a solid
additional step in the firm and serious renegotiation of the
foreign debt.''
   It said members of the Club of Paris had accepted the plan,
presented by a Mexican delegation headed by Jose Angel Gurria,
deputy treasury secretary in charge of international financial
affairs.
   The International Monetary Fund announced in Washington on
Friday that it had formally approved a $4.1 billion credit line to
Mexico, which was first outlined in a letter of credit announced
several weeks ago.
   Of the total, Mexico is to use some 40 percent to pay off its
foreign debt.

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen D. Hassenfeld, chairman and
chief executive of toymaking giant Hasbro Inc., has been
hospitalized in New York City with pneumonia and is in intensive
care, the company announced.
   The company issued a brief statement Tuesday announcing
Hassenfeld's illness, but did not provide details. The Providence
Journal-Bulletin said a spokeswoman at Columbia Presbyeterian
Hospital in New York confirmed that Hassenfeld, 47, was
hospitalized there.
   The spokeswoman declined to provide details at the request of
Hassenfeld's family, the newspaper said. A Hasbro spokesman said
Hassenfeld was in stable condition.
   John T. O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial officer, said
Hassenfeld was hospitalized Friday, but The Wall Street Journal
said the executive was hospitalized Wednesday following more than a
year of speculation that he was seriously ill. Hassenfeld
repeatedly has denied rumors that he is suffering from acquired
immune deficiency syndrome or any related illness, the newspaper
said.
   The speculation began after he missed 10 weeks of work beginning
in July 1987 because of a bacterial infection of the heart lining.
Hassenfeld, who maintains homes in Bristol, R.I., and New York,
also was hospitalized at Columbia Presbyterian for that health
problem.
   Hassenfeld, the grandson of the company's founder, is credited
with building Hasbro into one of the country's major toy companies
through a series of acquisitions, including Milton Bradley Co., and
introduction of consistently successful new products. Among
Hasbro's well-known toys are GI Joe and Transformers.
   The company had sales of $1.34 billion last year, compared with
$104.3 million in 1980.
   Hasbro's stock climbed $1.25 per share on Tuesday, closing at
$20.62{ on the American Stock Exchange, on speculation that Hasbro
might be a takeover target because of Hassenfeld's illness.
   ``There's lots of speculation going on, but probably very little
of substance,'' said Richard W. Morsilli, manager of the Providence
office of Smith Barney, Harris Uphanm &amp; Co.
   ``For every 10 takeover stories I hear, maybe one happens.''
   O'Neill said Hassenfeld had been running a high fever, ``and he
finally got to the point that his doctors advised him to have a
rest and get into the hospital. The hope and the intent is that
Stephen will mend and will be back to running this company.''
   Hassenfeld's pneumonia did not appear to be linked to his
previous heart infection, O'Neill said.
   Alan Hassenfeld, Stephen Hassenfeld's 40-year-old brother who is
Hasbro's president and chief operating officer, will run the
company in the interim, O'Neill said.
   The Hassenfeld family owns 13.1 percent of the company stock and
Warner Communicatons owns 13.6 percent, which is held in a voting
trust controlled by the Hassenfeld brothers. Hasbro has the right
of first refusal to purchase Warner's stock.

   The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union says it intends to use an employee stock ownership plan in a
bid to buy Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., the men's apparel division of
West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   Chicago-based Farley Inc., which acquired West Point early this
year, said last month that it had retained Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. to find ways ``to maximize the value of West Point-Pepperell
Inc.'s Cluett Peabody &amp; Co.''
   Published reports have indicated that several companies may be
interested in acquiring Cluett, including Phillips-Van Heusen
Corp., a large manufacturer of shirts.
   No details of the union's plans, such as financing arrangements,
were available.
   The union intentions became known after it issued a notice of a
news conference scheduled for Friday. The Wall Street Journal
reported Wednesday that the news conference was canceled after the
union learned that Farley would meet with the union soon.
   Cluett's three divisions are Arrow, which makes men's shirts; J.
Schoeneman, which makes men's tailored suits; and Gold Toe, a maker
of men's socks.
   Its factories in Georgia, Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Delaware employ more than 8,000 workers.

   The stock market was slightly higher in moderate
trading today after the government reported that its main economic
forecasting gauge was in line with expectations last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.94 points to
2,478.49 after 30 minutes of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing and declining issues were running neck and neck on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 459 issues up, 455 down and 510
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 26.65 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported today that the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators jumped 0.8 percent in April after posting
declines in the previous two months.
   Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated,
was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing,
there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime
expansion through its seventh year.
   ``The number is positive in that it's up modestly after two
months of declines,'' said Mary Farrell, equities broker with
PaineWebber Group Inc. ``But it's not strong enough to engender
fears of inflationary pressures. So what we're seeing is a
non-reaction in the market.''
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.21 to 178.32.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
0.02 at 354.43.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.22 points
to 2,475.55.
   Declining issues outperformed advances on the NYSE by a margin
of about 5 to 3 with 917 down, 559 up and 490 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 151.78 million shares, up slightly from

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose 2.7 percent in April, the best showing in four months,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $239.4 billion last month
after rising 0.7 percent in March and dropping during the first two
months of the year.
   April's increase reflected higher demand in a variety of
industry categories, and would have been even stronger were it not
for a 15.8 percent drop in defense orders, which are subject to
wide swings depending on when big contracts are signed.
   Excluding defense, all other orders were up 3.6 percent in April
after falling 0.3 percent in March and 2.7 percent in February.
   April's upturn in factory orders was in line with other recent
reports on the economy's performance which analysts say suggest
that while growth is slowing, a recession is not imminent.
   It was the strongest gain since a 4.7 percent increase in orders
last December.
   Earlier today, the Commerce Department reported that its chief
economic forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, shot up 0.8 percent in April after declining during the
previous two months.
   Today's report on factory orders showed that in the volatile
transportation category, orders rose 1.4 percent in April after
jmping 11 percent in March and falling 7.6 percent in February.
   Excluding transportation, all other orders were up 3.0 percent
last month after falling during the previous two months.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods, meanwhile, posted a strong
6.1 percent gain in April after rising 2.5 percent in March. The
category is considered a good barometer of business investment
plans.
   The overall increase in factory orders last month included a 3.0
percent jump in demand for ``big ticket'' durable goods and a 2.4
percent rise in orders for non-durables.
   Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three
years, rose to a seasonally adjusted $129.2 billion in April after
rising 1.0 percent in March.
   The April increase in orders for durable goods included gains in
most industries, led by a 9.3 percent rise in demand for electrical
machinery and a 6.0 percent jump in orders for primary metals such
as steel.
   Orders for non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose to a seasonally
adjusted $110.2 billion after rising 0.4 percent in March. Nearly
half of the April increase was in the petroleum refining industry.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 2.4 percent in April to a
seasonally adjusted $233.4 billion, following three consecutive
declines.

   Stock prices turned slightly lower in moderate
trading today, as the market began to focus on a weakening dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.84 points to
2,473.71 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 2.94 points
higher an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a margin of about 10 to
9 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 587 issues down, 542 up and
582 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 52.89 million shares.
   Analysts said a weaker dollar and declining bond prices were
pressuring the stock market.
   ``The dollar has begun to head for lows of the day. Bonds are
getting ready to be down in sympathy and as a result we see
equities pull back,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The stock market opened weak but rose slightly after the
government reported that its main economic forecasting gauge was in
line with expectations last month.
   The Commerce Department reported that the Index of Leading

   A report at mid-morning that U.S. factory orders rose 2.7
percent in April also put some downward pressure on the market as
the U.S. currency softened, analysts said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.03 to 178.08.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.02 to 354.39.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain on Notions That Losses Were Overdone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
partially reflecting notions that prices have fallen too far, too
fast in recent weeks.
   The soybean market posted the strongest early gains, with the
price for September delivery of new-crop soybeans opening at $6.58
a bushel, 7{ cents above Tuesday's close.
   Grain and soybean prices sank on Tuesday, continuing a
three-week trend that has taken soybeans for July delivery from
about $7.45 a bushel to less than $7.15, and July corn from about
$2.75 a bushel to less than $2.65 since May 1.
   The recent, broad decline in prices is due to increased rainfall
in the Midwest, which has reduced fears of a second consecutive
drought year.
   ``The weather pattern has obviously been different and that has
been weighing on the markets and the whole thing has been going
down,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.62} a bushel; oats were 1}
cents to 2{ cents higher with July at $1.67\ a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents to 8 cents higher with July at $7.19 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
68.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 76.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with June at 47.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .23 cent higher with July at
29.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday with
pork bellies down sharply.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said
Wednesday it has produced the world's fastest experimental
million-bit memory chip at a factory in Yasu, Japan.
   The dynamic random access memory chip, or DRAM, was made on an
existing production line, demonstrating that it could be
manufactured in large volumes, IBM said. It did not say when volume
prouction might begin.
   The chip can retrieve a unit, or bit, of information in 22
billionths of a second, making it two to three times as fast as the
current generation of million-bit chips, IBM said. It can store the
equivalent of about 100 pages of double-spaced, typewritten text.
   DRAM chips are still slower than their more expensive cousins,
static random access memory chips, or SRAMs. But IBM said the new
chip shows the gap is narrowing.
   Last week IBM announced its plant in Essex Junction, Vt., was
manufacturing the world's fastest million-bit DRAM that is in
volume production. That chip will be used in its AS-400 business
computer.

<HEAD>Judge Won't Accept Pennwalt Plea Without Company Executive Present</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused to accept a guilty
plea from Pennwalt Corp. in the settlement of a pollution case
because none of the top corporate officers of the chemical company
showed up in the courtroom.
   ``Are we going to let lawyers plead guilty for them?'' U.S.
District Judge Jack Tanner said Tuesday. ``Why? What happens to the
deterrence we talk about?''
   Individuals who plead guilty to crimes are required to appear in
court, Tanner said. ``Why should we treat corporations different
than individuals?'' he said.
   Prosecutor David Marshall, a special assistant U.S. attorney,
replied that the law allows attorneys to plead guilty on behalf of
corporations.
   ``Maybe that's one of the problems,'' Tanner said, adding,
``What message is sent to them?''
   Marshall said the company's willingness to pay $1.1 million as
part of the plea agreement would deter others.
   ``They just throw money at it that they just pass on to the
public,'' Tanner said.
   The case involved a 1985 spill of a cancer-causing agent into a
Tacoma waterway.
   The company's attorney, Thomas Kelly Jr., of the Seattle law
firm Preston, Thorgrimson, Ellis &amp; Holman, said Pennwalt's board of
directors had approved the plea agreement.
   Kelly said the board and Pennwalt's top officers took the case
seriously.
   Tanner said it wasn't fair for an unknown board of directors to
allow an attorney to plead guilty by submitting a written plea
agreement.
   Marshall then asked Tanner if he wanted Pennwalt's chief
executive officer or another top executive to appear in court.
   Tanner didn't specify what officer would be appropriate but said
he wouldn't accept ``some official who is going to retire in six
months.''
   The charges stemmed from the spill of at least 75,000 gallons of
a chemical containing sodium dichromate into Tacoma's Hylebos
Waterway in 1985 after the rupture of a 180,000-gallon storage tank
that had been poorly maintained.
   Sodium dichromate is a toxic compound containing hexavalent
chromium, a cancer-causing agent.
   The agreement called for the company to plead guilty to five
misdemeanor counts _ two counts of negligently failing to maintain
adequate storage tanks at its Tacoma plant, two counts of
discharging pollutants, and one count of failing to promptly report
the 1985 spill to the Coast Guard.
   The company agreed to pay the $1.1 million, $600,000 of it to be
placed in an environmental trust fund to be used by the Coast Guard
to protect Puget Sound.
   In exchange, the government agreed to drop criminal charges
against three company executives in Pennsylvania.
   After the hearing, Kelly said he expected a company officer to
appear before Tanner. A new hearing is expected in the next few
weeks.

   Stock prices were mixed in moderate trading
today, amid a weakening dollar and a new economic report indicating
U.S. industry is advancing at a healthy clip.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.29 points to
2,474.26 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 1.84 points lower
an hour earlier.
   Advancing and declining issues were even on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 602 issues up, 602 down and 601 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 73.66 million shares.
   After slight gains early in the day, stock prices weakened,
taking a cue from softening bond prices as the U.S. dollar headed
toward the day's lows, although it remained firm against the
Japanese yen and West German mark.
   ``A lower dollar hurts bonds which hurts equities,'' said Dennis
Jarrett, technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Also pressuring stocks was a government report that U.S. factory
orders rose 2.7 percent in April.
   It was the best showing in four months, and led to new
speculation that the Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates
any time soon as earlier suggested.
   Expectations had grown over the last several days that the Fed
might lower interest rates to stem the rising dollar. But analysts
said after today's factory orders report that such a move by the
Fed is unlikely given its concerns about inflation.
   Earlier today, stock prices rose after the Commerce Department
reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators, shot up 0.8 percent in April after

   The government devalued the cordoba
against the dollar for the 18th time this year, effective
Wednesday, and raised the price of gasoline.
   The 4.81 percent devaluation, announced Tuesday night, was
accompanied by a 5.19 percent rise in the price of gasoline.
   The dollar will now fetch 8,300 cordobas, up from 7,900 per
dollar since May 25.
   The price of gasoline increased from 14,600 to 15,400 cordobas
per gallon on Tuesday, the government said. Prices of public
transportation will rise proportionally, the government said.
   Nicaragua depends entirely on imports for gasoline.
   The government announced a 15.5 percent rise in consumer prices
during May, after 12.3 percent inflation during April. Prices rose
more than 20,000 percent last year.
   The government has made severe budget cutbacks by eliminating
the government payroll and freezing salaries to try to control
inflation.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada on Wednesday quoted Central
Bank officials as saying the devaluation ``is something normal
within the policy the government has been pursuing for several
months to keep exports competitive.''

<HEAD>London Shares Close Lower As Pound Continues To Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed substantially lower Wednesday,
pressured by an early round of selling related to program trades
and by further upward pressure on interest rates as the pound
continued to slump.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 15.6
points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,114.4, just 0.4 point below
its best level. At its worst, the index was down 22.3 points at
about midday.
   The latest losses bring the cumulative decline in the 100-share
index to 90.3 points, or 4.1 percent, since May 19, the last day
before the market's most recent fears of a sterling crisis set in.
   The pound's weakness already has spurred a rise in British
interest rates, by 1 percentage point to 14 percent. Despite this,
the currency has continued to drop, sparking worries that further
interest rate hikes might be in store.
   ``The market is on a knife edge at the moment. People don't know
which way to go,'' said one dealer. As a result, trading activity
was fairly light, with many players preferring to sit on the
sidelines until the interest rate outlook became clearer.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 9.6 points down at
1,755.7. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 8.73 points to
close at 1,209.54.
   Volume came to 536.3 million shares, compared with Tuesday's
458.4 million shares.

<HEAD>Demand for Labor Increased in April, Conference Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demand for labor as measured by the volume of
help-wanted advertising increased slightly during April, according
to an analysis released Wednesday.
   The Conference Board, a business research organization, said its
monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index rose to 157 in April from 151
in March.
   The index tracks the volume of classified advertising in 51
major American newspapers and is considered sensitive to changes in
demand for labor and general business conditions.
   Advertising volume rose in all sections of the country except
the West South Central and Mountain regions. Substantial gains in
volume were noted in the South Atlantic and West North Central
regions, the Conference Board said.
   Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said the
Help-Wanted Index and other indicators point to continued job
growth.
   However, the gain in the index contrasted with a Labor
Department report that job growth slowed in April while
unemployment jumped to 5.3 percent from 5 percent during March.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said Wednesday it
has begun the first phase of a five-year project to give it the
world's largest private international telephone system.
   The Fairfield-based company signed a contract with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., British Telecommunications Ltd. and
France Telecom Inc. at the United Nations Tuesday to build a
communications network between the United States, Canada and Europe.
   GE plans to create a network to link GE's offices globally with
high-speed lines to transmit voice, video and data signals, said GE
spokesman Bruce Bunch. The network will enable GE's 300,000
employees to call one another by dialing only seven digits, he said.
   The value of the contract was not disclosed. Bunch said it is
``much less'' than the $300 million GE agreed to pay AT&amp;T for its
U.S. network.
   ``This new network will play a key role in our strategy of
meeting customer needs worldwide,'' said Stanley M. Welland, GE's
manager of corporate telecommunications.
   ``We expect the system to provide us with a competitive
advantage by increasing the speed of information needed to make key
business decisions,'' he said.
   AT&amp;T, British Telecom and France Telecom are expected this year
to link GE's offices in United States, Canada, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Spain.
   In the early 1990s, GE said its offices in the Far East,
Australia, Middle East and South America will join the network,
which will be managed by GE in Princeton, N.J.
   GE said its network will use digital lines where available,
including the trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable TAT-8 which was
completed in December 1988. GE expects to use about 2 percent of
the cable's capacity.

   The stock market bounced back from earlier
declines in moderate afternoon trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 10.48 points to
2,486.03 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 1.29 points
lower at noon eastern time.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 3 to
2 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 812 issues up, 542 down and
544 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 116 million shares.
   Analysts said stocks rallied behind strengthening bond prices as
the dollar continued to firm.
   Stocks had seesawed through the morning session, rebounding from
a weak opening after the Commerce Department reported that its
chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, shot up 0.8 percent in April after declining during the
previous two months.
   Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated,
was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing,
there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime
expansion through its seventh year. Also, the number was not strong
enough to engender new fears about inflation, analysts said.
   Stocks later declined as the dollar and bonds lost some of their
earlier strength following a government report that showed orders
to U.S. factories rose 2.7 percent in April.
   It was the best showing in four months, and led to new
speculation that the Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates
any time soon as earlier suggested.
   Expectations had grown over the last several days that the Fed
might lower interest rates to stem the rising dollar. But analysts
said after the factory orders report that such a move by the Fed is
unlikely given its concerns about inflation.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.94 to 179.05.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 1.12 to 355.53.

<HEAD>Chrysler Breaks Ground for New Assembly Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quintet of shovel-wielding corporate, union and
government officials broke ground Wednesday for Chrysler Corp.'s
$1-billion Jefferson North assembly plant, which Lee Iacocca called
``a big risk.''
   The five officials _ Iacocca, chairman of the corporation; UAW
Vice President Marc Stepp; Gov. James Blanchard; Sen. Carl Levin
and Mayor Coleman Young _ verbally patted each other on the back at
the ceremony held under a canopy in a gravel-filled mud field.
   ``Some risks have to be taken,'' Iacocca said before the shiny
shovels turned dirt in a small box on a stage. ``For us, this is a
big risk.''
   The plant, which will involve a total investment of about $1
billion, will replace the aging Jefferson Avenue plant and will
begin production of a new line of sport-utility vehicles in January
1992.
   It will employ about 3,000 people and continue a tradition of
Chrysler and its forerunners building vehicles at the site on the
city's east side since 1907.
   Before the first spade of dirt was turned Wednesday, the
Jefferson North plant has been the focus of controversy.
   There have been lingering questions of how much the city paid
for land and equipment when it was getting the property together
for the plant. The state Department of Natural Resources was called
in after reports of toxic substances being found at the site.
   Last week, a controversy arose over Chrysler's hiring of a
Japanese company to do some design and engineering work for the new
plant's paint shop.
   ``We're talking 20 people in the next year and a half,'' Iacocca
said after the ceremony. ``A couple of million dollars, maybe two,
maybe three tops, to do some work on a design board.
   ``It's minuscule. It's so small that it's tough to talk about in
the context of a billion bucks,'' he said.
   Chrysler will make a sport-utility vehicle code-named ``ZJ'' for
Jeep and Dodge dealers at the new plant.
   The company is betting that the sport-utility market, which it
relies upon for much of its profits, will remain strong into the
next decade. Chrysler and French automaker Renault will begin
producing a smaller sport-utility vehicle, the ``JJ,'' shortly
after the ``ZJ'' begins rolling off the assembly line.
   The ``ZJ,'' to be offered in two models, will be larger than the
Jeep Cherokee, now made at Toledo, Ohio. Further details about the
``ZJ'' will be unavailable until closer to production. The Dodge
and Jeep vehicles will receive other names later.
   Chrysler officials have said the ``ZJ'' will not replace the
Cherokee, which still will be made in Toledo after 1992, when the
company's five-year contract with the United Auto Workers union
expires.
   The Jefferson Avenue plant makes the Dodge Omni and Plymouth
Horizon subcompacts. Company officials have said they were unsure
whether those nameplates will continue after 1992.
   The plant is the second assembly plant to be built within
Detroit in the last decade. General Motors Corp.'s Hamtramck plant
began production in 1985.

<HEAD>6,000 Layoffs Planned Because of Defense Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hughes Aircraft Co. will lay off 6,000
workers in the next six months because of anticipated cuts in
defense spending, the company announced Wednesday.
   The cuts, which amount to 8 percent of the company's workforce
of 75,000, will be in all areas of management, engineering and
manufacturing, the company said.
   Hughes has operations in 12 states, but the bulk of its
workforce is in Southern California, with 6,000 in Tucson, Ariz.
The company, which is owned by General Motors Corp., makes
air-to-air missiles, radar for fighter jets, satellites other
military gear.
   The decision was based on executives' expectation, widely shared
in the defense industry, that defense budgets under the Bush
administration will be smaller than they were in the Reagan era.
   ``We're getting down to fighting trim,'' said Malcolm Currie,
Hughes' chairman and chief executive officer.
   Hughes will try to cushion the blow by trying to make some staff
cuts through attrition and voluntary resignations, and will offer
retraining and job-hunting help.
   The cuts aren't in response to government action on any one
contract, said Hughes spokesman Mike Murphy. No one contract
accounts for more than 6 percent of sales, he said.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson's Son Quits Drexel Internship; Cites Press Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's son quit a
summer internship in Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond
department because he was ``bombarded'' with calls from reporters,
a Jackson spokesman said Wednesday.
   Jonathan Luther Jackson, 23, a business student, started working
May 15 in the much-publicized division once run by indicted Wall
Street financier Michael Milken.
   He resigned Tuesday, said Frank Watkins, spokesman for Jackson's
Rainbow Coalition in Washington, D.C.
   ``He's a young man, he was simply trying to work and learn
something about the world of finance and all of a sudden he's
bombarded with press calls,'' Watkins said. ``His work was being
disrupted.''
   Reporters' calls to that Drexel office invariably are referred
to a company spokesman in New York. Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder
said Tuesday that Jackson resigned for unspecified personal reasons.
   Anreder said Wednesday the firm began receiving calls from
reporters about Jackson last Friday. ``I don't know what prompted
it but we were starting to get a lot of calls,'' he said.
   Jackson's Drexel employment was reported in last Friday's issue
of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, an investor newsletter covering
credit markets.
   The younger Jackson, who helped introduce his father at the
Democratic National Convention last year, has a business degree
from North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical University and plans
to enroll in a master's program in business at Northwestern
University in Chicago in the fall, Watkins said.
   His internship was in the credit research department, which
studies companies planning to sell high-risk, high-yield bonds
through Drexel.
   In last year's presidential campaign, Jesse Jackson railed
against ``merger-maniacs'' he said were costing jobs. Drexel has
played a major role in financing corporate takeovers this decade,
many through its junk bond division.
   Drexel last year agreed to pay the government $650 million and
plead guilty to six felonies to settle insider trading and
securities fraud charges. Milken took a leave of absence earlier
this year after he was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud.
   Drexel also figures in current ethics imbroglios involving two
prominent Democrats.
   House minority whip Tony Coelho of California, who announced he
would resign because of controversy, bought a $100,000 Drexel junk
bond with a loan from Columbia Savings of Beverly Hills that didn't
require him to put up any of his own money.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department are investigating whether Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
received preferential treatment in buying junk bonds through Drexel.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for more
rain in the Corn Belt quieted fears of a second year of drought.
   ``The midday forecasts were for a continued rainy type of
situation here for another five days and maybe longer,'' said Dale
Gustafson, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   The heaviest precipitation is expected in Illinois and Iowa, two
key corn-and-soybean states that have only partially recovered from
last year's disastrous drought.
   Prices had opened higher on perceptions that the losses of
recent weeks had been overdone, but the midday weather forecasts
``weakened the strongest portion of the market,'' Gustafson said.
   Since May 1, soybeans for July delivery have dropped from about
$7.45 a bushel to less than $7.15, and July corn has fallen from
about $2.75 a bushel to about $2.60.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5 cents lower with July at
$3.87 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with July at
$2.60} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with July at

<HEAD>Trading Partners Strike Back at U.S. Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American trade policies are incompatible with the
multilateral system of trade negotiations and could seriously
disturb the world economic outlook, some of the United States' main
trading partners said Wednesday.
   Japan, named last week by the Bush Administration for alleged
unfair trade practices, led the assault on U.S. trade policy.
Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, who is likely to become his
country's prime minister this weekend, said any unilateral American
action could undermine confidence in world economic projections.
   Britain strongly supported the Japanese position as did
representatives of the European Economic Community executive. West
Germany and Canada also expressed concern.
   The criticism of the United States was voiced as the foreign,
trade and economy ministers of the 24-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development began their annual meeting at
the secretariat's Paris headquarters.
   Japan, the only major industrialized nation cited by the United
States, was seeking agreement on language in the OECD's final
communique to be issued Thursday criticizing ``discriminatory or
unilateral actions contrary to international commitments.''
   The communique, however, would not name the United States.
   Japan, Brazil and India, were named to the Super 301 list of
countries that the United States says have discriminatory trade
barriers to U.S. goods or investments.
   Super 301 is the name given to a section of the sweeping 1988
U.S. trade law, passed by a Congress frustrated with a trade
deficit that totaled nearly $120 billion last year.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher denied Americans were
backing away from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
said at a news conference the Bush Administration was strongly
committed to a multilateral approach to trade negotiations.
   He said the Americans were telling their trading partners that
the Super 301 provision was complementary to the GATT process.
   But judging by reaction from some European delegates, the
Americans did not appear to be making much headway with their
explanations.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said unilateral
trading restrictions would not cure the U.S. deficit and ``even the
threat (to use them) endangers the multilateral trading system.''
   He said that despite efforts made by the U.S. administration to
to limit the list of countries named under Super 301, anxieties
about the legislation remained.
   Howe said it is vital that the United States respect the
principles of the multilateral trading system.
   Two officials of the European Economic Community, Frans
Andriessen and Henning Christopherssen, also were critical of U.S.
trade policy.
   Andriessen said the U.S. legislation was not compatible with
GATT and called on the ministers to adopt a firm stand regarding
the United States. ``No country has to the right to interpret the
rules (of trade) on its own,'' he said.
   ``I believe the Americans are sincere when they say Super 301 is
an instrument to open frontiers, but it is not the right
instrument,'' he told reporters.
   Nicholas Brady, head of the U.S. delegation, did not not refer
to the controversial legislation in his speech, but called on Japan
and West Germany to do more to reduce their trade surpluses or face
increased protectionism.
   He said the United States was moving to promote continued growth
for the world economy, in part by undertaking to reduce its budget
deficit to $100 billion in 1990.
   ``But many in the United states feel we are being urged to act
in a vacuum,'' he said. ``U.S. policy alone does not drive
international economic developments and international policy
prescriptions for current problems cannot end with U.S. fiscal
action.''
   The dispute over trade policies overshadowed other items on the
ministers' agenda, such as the surge of the U.S. dollar, inflation
rates in member countries and the environment.
   Brady expressed concern about the dollar's recent rise against
other major currencies, saying that if it continued it could
undermine efforts to adjust the international economy.

<HEAD>Pesticide Industry Argues That Chemicals Can Make Food Safe</HEAD>

   House legislation designed to strengthen
pesticide regulations is coming under attack from an industry
spokesman who says the bill neglects to consider the health
benefits of using chemicals on crops.
   Jay Vroom, executive director of the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, said recently his organization considers the
``Food Safety Amendments of 1989'' so inflexible as to be
unworkable.
   They apply standards for assessing how risky a pesticide is
without considering the benefits, he said.
   ``We hope to point out that there are many benefits associated
with an abundant supply of food that are health benefits,'' Vroom
said. He said some fungi and insects are more dangerous to human
health than the pesticides that kill them.
   He suggested, for example, that there might be insect parts in
bread and worms in tomato sauce if it weren't for pesticides.
   But Paul Allen, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said there are some pesticides that are so dangerous to
people, particularly children, that nothing else need be considered
in banning them.
   He said his organization, which led the public outcry against
Alar on apples, helped draft the legislation introduced by Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on health and the environment.
   Testimony from both Vroom's and Allen's organizations was
presented to the subcommittee Wednesday.
   ``This is an extension of the Alar debate,'' said Allen. ``We
think it is a pretty good bill.''
   ``From the point of view of the farmer, this would clarify the
situation and get rid of predicaments like we had with Alar in
which farmers may suspect a chemical is dangerous, but because it
is legal, they go ahead and use it,'' Allen said. ``Then there is a
public outcry and a market disaster.''
   The Waxman bill would establish a new health-based food safety
standard, taking into account risks to particular population
groups, like children.
   It would not allow the Environmental Protection Agency to weigh
economic benefits of pesticide use against health hazards.
   It would streamline EPA's procedures for revoking unsafe
pesticides. And, it would give EPA new authority to require that
health and safety data be supplied by the industry, with new
penalties if the data are not supplied.
   This was the second day of hearings on the bill. Representatives
of the EPA, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture
and General Accounting Office spoke to the subcommittee May 17.

was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing, the
economy is still strong enough to power the record peacetime
expansion through its seventh year without new fears about
inflation.
   The market lost steam by mid-morning, however, as the dollar
slipped from earlier levels and bonds declined following a second
government report that showed orders to U.S. factories rose 2.7
percent in April, the best showing in four months.
   Analysts said the report prompted speculation that the Federal
Reserve might not lower interest rates as earlier suggested.
   Recent expectations were that the Fed might lower interest rates
to stem the rising dollar. But analysts said after the factory
orders report that such a move by the Fed is unlikely given its
concerns about inflation.
   The impact was brief as the dollar continued its upward trend
despite Tuesday's discount rate hike by the Japanese. The dollar
closed mixed in European and U.S. trading. Bond prices firmed
behind the dollar and stocks followed the bond market.
   Analysts said the stock market's ability to break Tuesday's fall
as well as today's rebound shows an underlying strength in the
market.
   ``The lift in the bond market and the fact that the stock market
resisted yesterday's chance to go lower says we still have upside
momentum,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons Inc.
   Also helping prices late in the session was a report that the
Federal Reserve has come up with a new indicator of inflationary
pressures based on the money supply and economic growth. Analysts
said the new indicator, although experimental, suggests that the
Fed has room to ease monetary policy.

<HEAD>Plan Filed For Sunbeam Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. said Wednesday it
has filed a plan of reorganization for its Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary
in an attempt to extract the profitable small appliance maker from
bankruptcy court.
   It is the fifth plan the company has filed since entering
Chapter 11 reorganization in February 1988, and an attorney for
unsecured creditors who are owed $220 million gave the latest plan
about the same chances of success and the previous four.
   ``I don't give it much chance,'' said Robert Sable of Pittsburgh.
   If approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti, the plan
would pay cash to settle all of the approximately $240 million in
claims pending against the Sunbeam subsidiary. It would leave the
Pittsburgh-based parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with
creditors over settling their claims.
   Allegheny International also said Cosetti was so aggravated with
the collapse of the fourth reorganization plan that he suspended
the payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in
the case.
   To emphasize his disappointment that no reorganization plan was
submitted for the parent company, Cosetti also invited the U.S.
Trustee to file a request that he appoint a trustee to run the
company, Allegheny International said.
   ``The judge is trying to do something to get some movement in
the case,'' Sable said.
   But because some of the attorneys are paid by banks and
insurance companies, not the debtor, ``all it does is put pressure
on some people, not necessarily the people who can do anything
about it,'' Sable said.
   The unsecured creditors oppose the latest plan and are very
close to finishing their own plan of reorganization, he said. They
are also considering asking Cosetti to appoint a trustee.
   The fourth plan collapsed after investment firm Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette discovered that Allegheny International was
falling short of its earnings goals. The New York investment bank
lowered its takeover bid by $70 million to $687 million,
rreflecting its reliance on earnings estimates to raise takeover
funds.
   The Sunbeam subsidiary encompasses virtually all of the parent's
consumer products businesses.
   Allegheny International said it is confident of raising the
estimated $250 million needed to reorganize Sunbeam. It has already
begun discussions to find a new chief executive for the subsidiary,
which would also get an independent board of directors under the
latest plan.

   United Airlines plans a new Washington-Mexico
City route this year that will be the first daily non-stop service
connecting the two capitals, Stephen Wolf, chairman of parent
company UAL Inc., said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Wolf dashed speculation that the Chicago-based
company was considering buying part of the state-owned Mexicana
Airlines.
   ``It is our intention to grow United Airlines without equity
participation in other airlines,'' he told reporters. ``We want to
continue our close working relationship with Mexicana Airlines, but
only as a marketing partner, not as a buyer.''
   Mexicana's director, Manuel Sosa de la Vega, was quoted in
Wednesday's financial daily El Financiero as saying that if the
carrier were sold, it would be because of political rather than
financial reasons.
   ``There are politicial reasons for all that,'' he said.
   Sosa said that under Mexico's new foreign investment
regulations, a foreign investor would be able to purchase up to 49
percent of Mexicana, which he described as economically healthy.
   Wolf called the liberalization of foreign investment as a ``a
very progressive step'' and said that ``in the case of United
Airlines, it is a very positive background which will encourage us
to put more flights into Mexico.''
   Wolf said service between Washington and Mexico City would begin
later this year pending U.S. government approval.

<HEAD>Pivotal USX Chairman Retires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Chairman David M. Roderick retired
Wednesday after a 10-year term in which he made USX more of an oil
company than a steel company.
   Roderick, 65, a native of Pittsburgh's rough-and-tumble North
Side and a Marine Corps veteran, rose through the company's finance
department.
   In 1979, Roderick succeeded Edgar B. Speer, a steel operator who
as chairman, it was said, was not above questioning a blast furnace
foreman on the telephone if his unit's production fell behind
schedule.
   Roderick is succeeded by President Charles A. Corry, who
presided over the company's Diversified Group, which produced $6
billion by selling assets in transportation, real estate and other
businesses.
   Speer, Roderick and now Corry reflect the company's
transformation from an oversized, muscle-bound steelmaker, then
called U.S. Steel Corp., to a diversified energy and steel
corporation known today as USX.
   One of Roderick's first moves as chairman was to scrap plans to
build a planned mammoth steel plant on the shore of Lake Erie at
Conneaut, Ohio.
   USX officials sighed with relief that the company did not have
to carry the additional debt and production capacity into the
industry debacle that followed in the 1980s.
   USX under Roderick wrote off $3 billion in assets, mostly in
steel, and closed 140 steel facilities. Companywide employment
plunged from nearly 172,000 in 1979 to fewer than 59,000 in 1988, a
loss of around 113,000 jobs, most of them in steel.
   He has often said his most difficult task as chairman was to
preside over the steel shutdowns because of the pain they caused in
mill towns, including the nearby Monongahela Valley where he was
raised.
   In the meantime, USX spent $10 billion to acquire Marathon Oil
Co. and Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp., whose $9.9 billion in sales in 1988
accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company's $16.9 billion in
sales. Steel contributed $5.8 billion, or about a third.

   Oil futures prices were mixed in lackluster
trading Wednesday as June contracts closed for unleaded gasoline
and heating fuel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 5
cents to finish at $19.90 a barrel. Other contracts also declined.
   Among refined products, the June contract for unleaded gasoline
closed 0.83 cent higher at 67.44 cents a gallon, while other
contracts also showed gains.
   The heating oil contract for June delivery fell 0.44 cent to
48.17 cents a gallon. Other contracts also fell.
   ``The major feature today was the expiration of the June
products,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc. ``Gasoline went out strong, heating oil
weak.''
   Lebow and other analysts said the oil futures market was slow in
anticipation of next week's meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.
   Analysts said gasoline futures prices were strong following the
heavy Memorial Day driving weekend and expected strong demand over
the summer months.
   ``I think that market is strong,'' said Mary Haskins, an
assistant vice president with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The eight-member OPEC price monitoring committee is scheduled to
meet Friday to discuss recent problems, including quota cheating by
some cartel members, followed by a meeting of all 13 oil ministers
Monday.
   The primary focus of next week's meeting is expected to be
whether to raise or retain the cartel's 18.5 million barrel-a-day
quota. OPEC agreed last November to keep the level for the first
six months of 1989.

<HEAD>Naming Competitors In Advertisements Is Risky Business, Companies
Find</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Jartran Inc. ran ads touting its rental
trucks, it put U-Haul's competing trucks in the background, so they
looked small. But the ploy backfired: a court ruled the ads were
``deliberately false'' and ordered them halted.
   Jartran is one of dozens of companies that have learned the hard
way that mentioning a competitor's product in an advertisement, a
hard-nosed tactic that has become common since 1985, is
increasingly risky.
   ``Every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court,''
marketing experts Bruce Buchanan and Doron Goldman warned in the
May-June issue of Harvard Business Review. ``Once your competitor
files suit, you can do little to stop the process.''
   Congress may have accelerated the lawsuits last year by
strengthening the fair advertising laws. In addition, companies
suffering real or imagined slights by competitors have grown testy
and are now quick to shoot back, both in counter-ads and lawsuits.
   Even if they lose in court, they figure, they may dissuade
someone else from trying the same thing.
   Under the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, anyone who
misrepresents ``his or her or another person's'' goods or services
is liable for damages.
   That wording closed a loophole in the 43-year-old Lanham Act,
which prohibited false claims about one's own products but did not
mention ``another person's.''
   Buchanan and Goldman, who are researchers at New York
University's Stern School of Business, say it is too early to tell
whether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits.
   But they maintain there was no shortage of such actions under
the old law. They counted more than 60 judicial decisions in
comparative advertising cases, including 30 since the trend picked
up four years ago.
   Even that number is conservative, they say, because many more
cases undoubtedly were settled out of court or did not result in a
judicial opinion.
   In some cases, companies have found to their chagrin, they do
not even have to name a competiting product to get sued.
   When a Tropicana orange juice ad showed Olympic decathlon winner
Bruce Jenner squeezing oranges into a carton, the message was that
Tropicana, unlike other brands, was not made from concentrate.
   But a competitor complained, and a court ruled that the ad was
false, because Tropicana juice is not, in fact, squeezed directly
from oranges into the carton. It is pasteurized and sometimes
frozen first.
   Even claims with more than a shred of truth behind them have
been challenged successfully.
   R.J. Reynolds, for example, got in trouble when it said its Now
cigarettes had ``the lowest tar of all'' brands on the market, with
only 2 milligrams of tar apiece.
   That was true, at least for comparable king-size brands. But
Carlton 70, a shorter brand, had only 1 milligram. Its maker,
American Brands, went to court and won.
   In many cases, a successful suit merely leads to an injunction
banning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media. But if
the plaintiff can show harm, the claims can be expensive. U-Haul
International Inc., for example, was able to prove that it lost
sales and faced higher advertising costs, and it was awarded $20
million in compensatory damages and another $20 million in punitive
damages from Jartran.
   Still, advertising agencies say the tactic is more popular than
ever, with manufacturers of pain relievers, pickup trucks and soft
drinks constantly going head-to-head.
   ``You have to be very, very sure of your claims,'' said Mary
McElyea, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet trucks, which has been
pounding Ford in comparative ads since late 1987.
   ``But if you're careful, it can be very effective. The name of
the game is, cut through the clutter and make it clear to the
customer why your product is better.''

   The dollar slumped Wednesday amid speculation
about central bank maneuvering.
   There were rumors that the Federal Reserve and possibly other
central banks were selling dollars more discreetly than they have
in the past.
   During most of the dollar's recent run-up the central banks
tried to gain extra psychological impact by allowing their market
interventions to become public. That strategy did not appear to
work.
   Several times Wednesday the dollar appeared to be under downward
pressure even though dealers could not pinpoint anyone who was
selling, said Jerry Egan, chief currency dealer for the Bank of
Boston.
   ``A sudden supply of dollars from an unknown source is very
disconcerting to most participants,'' Egan said. The central banks
``certainly haven't had much success with their name in lights,''
he said.
   Central banks have tried to rein in the dollar because a high
dollar threatens to increase the U.S. trade deficit by making
American-made goods more costly in world markets. It could also
increase inflation abroad.
   Speculation continued Wednesday that the West German central
bank would raise interest rates or that the U.S. Federal Reserve
would lower them. However, many market participants said they
considered those steps unlikely.
   Adding to the choppiness were end-of-the-month dealings to even
up currency accounts and the absence of some senior dealers, who
were attending an annual foreign-exchange meeting in Lisbon,
Portugal.
   The lone currency against which the dollar rose in New York was
the Japanese yen. In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's
business day begins, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 142.70
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 142.30 yen. In New York the
dollar rose to 142.90 yen from 142.75.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5682 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5570 late Tuesday.
In New York, the pound rose to $1.5735 from $1.5710.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.9815 West German marks, down from
1.9960; 1.7098 Swiss francs, down from 1.7345; 1.2072 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2075; 6.7195 French francs, down from 6.7635;
and 1,434 Italian lire, down from 1,440.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9755 West German marks, down from 2.0100; 1.7055
Swiss francs, down from 1.7545; 6.6855 French francs, down from
6.8085; 2.2460 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2630; 1,443.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,452.50; and 1.2061 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2055.
   Gold prices fell in New York after having been up in Asia and
Europe.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.95 a troy ounce to a bid of $364.68.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $363.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $362.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $363.43
from $362.10.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $363.30 a troy ounce from $365.70 on Tuesday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$361 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $364.45 on Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices held steady on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $5.20 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.16 an ounce from $5.23.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Slide On Dim Outlook For New Marketing Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices sank Wednesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange amid growing pessimism about next week's special
meeting of the International Coffee Organization.
   On other markets, precious metals slid lower; grains and
soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed; cattle
futures were mixed and pork futures advanced.
   Coffee settled 2 cents to 4.08 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $1.3068 a pound.
   The sell-off was prompted by a report that John Rosenbaum, the
U.S. chief delegate to the International Coffee Organization,
remained determined not to attend the talks in London unless coffee
producers first offer a proposal acceptable to the United States.
   The five-day meeting of most of the world's largest
coffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations is aimed at producing
a new International Coffee Agreement to replace the six-year pact
that expires on Sept. 30.
   The United States, the organization's largest consumer member,
is resisting a push to simply extend the existing agreement,
calling instead for tighter restrictions on sales of coffee at
discount prices to countries that are not members of the
International Coffee Organization.
   Wednesday's sharp decline in prices suggests an abrupt change of
attitude among traders who had grown optimistic about a new
agreement following a meeting last week in Florida between
Rosenbaum and coffee-producer representatives from Brazil, Colombia
and Central America.
   ``I'd say the odds for an agreement are 50-50, and it's unlikely
that anything will be hammered out until it comes down to the wire
in September,'' said Sandra Kaul, a market analyst in New York with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York said the selling was also a reflection of the mild weather
in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, at the beginning of
the South American winter season.
   ``The market will be increasingly trading off the weather in
Brazil,'' Stevenson said.
   Silver fell to a 33-month low and gold prices also slipped on
New York's Commodity Exchange despite some weakening of the
dollar's value against other major currencies.
   The decline indicated a continuing lack of investor interest in
precious metals as an inflation hedge.
   Gold settled $2.40 to $3.20 lower with June at $363.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.7 cents lower with June at $5.16 a
troy ounce, the lowest spot silver price since Aug. 29, 1986.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the Chicago
Board of Trade as forecasts for more rain in the Corn Belt quieted
fears of a second year of drought.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
six-to-10-day forecast calling for normal rainfall in most of the
Midwest during the middle of next week.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 5\ cents lower with July at $3.87{ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with July at $2.60} a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher with July at $1.66} a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to \ cent higher with July at
$7.14 a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures prices notched lower while futures prices for
refined products ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
choppy activity fueled by conflicting statements from various OPEC
ministers regarding oil production and demand.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 10 cents
lower with July at $19.90 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent lower
to .08 cent higher with June at 48.71 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .28 cent lower to .83 cent higher with June at 67.44
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .45 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with June at 68.90 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 76.45
cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .65 cent higher with
June at 47.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to
.43 cent higher with July at 29.90 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Economic Indicators Soar, Easing Recession Worries</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS inverted March and February figures in 2nd graf: ``The
increase ... Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge jumped 0.8 percent in April, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday, easing fears that the nation might be about to tumble
into a recession.
   The increase in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators
followed declines of 0.3 percent in February and 0.6 percent in
March. Three monthly declines in a row has been a traditional
signal of a possible recession on the horizon.
   ``We believe there will be a slowdown that is gradually
occurring in the economy, but it's not going to ultimately end in a
recession,'' said ecnomist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``It was a bit too premature to call for a recession
later this year based on the data in February and March,''
   Still, analysts were not suggesting the strong numbers for April
meant a robust economy this summer.
   Bruce Steinberg, of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York,
said the report suggests that while there ``was a bit of a rebound
in April from March, the general story about the economy is that it
is slowing down and slowing dramatically.''
   While a three-month drop in the index has preceded all eight
recessions since 1948, there also have been five similar series of
declines _ including the five consecutive months surrounding the
stock market crash in October 1987 _ that were not followed by
recessions.
   In another report showing the economy was still expanding, the
Commerce Department said factory orders rose a strong 2.7 percent
in April to $239.4 billion. That followed a 0.7 percent increase in
March after declines of 1.2 percent and 2.0 percent in January and
February.
   The index of leading indicators is designed to foretell economic
activity six to nine months in the future.
   Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York, said recent reports show ``the
economy is confused, somewhere between boom and bust.''
   But he noted that over the past six months, ``there's been some
pretty steady decelerating in the growth of the index.''
   Commerce reported that the leading indicators rose 1.3 percent
over the past six months compared with 1.7 percent in the previous
half-year.
   The April report showed that eight of the eleven indicators in
the index rose, led by increased manufacturers' orders for consumer
goods, increased building permits and a longer average workweek.
   Other pluses were higher stock prices, lower initial claims for
jobless benefits, slower vendor deliveries meaning growing demand,
more orders for plants and equipment and an increase in
manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   On the minus side were the third consecutive drop in an index
measuring consumer confidence, a drop in the money supply and lower
prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand.
   Hagens said he was watching closely the consumer confidence
index.
   ``That has been a fairly good leading indicator on its own of a
recession,'' he said. ``It hasn't dropped nearly enough to indicate
that a recession is coming, but if it dropped dramatically over the
next three or four months, we would be concerned.''
   Instead Hagens concludes that the ``enconomy is in a slowing
mode,'' heading for a soft landing with growth over the next year
of 1.5 percent. Growth in the gross national product for the first
three months of 1989, with the statistical bounceback from last
year's drought removed, was 1.8 percent.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, also sees ``a soft landing _ continued but subdued
growth.''
   A soft landing, rather than a recession, is what the Federal
Reserve hopes to achieve in its effort to contain inflation by
tightening credit.
   William K. MacReynolds, U.S. Chamber of Commerce forecasting
director, said he believes ``it would be a mistake to interpret
April's uptick ... as an indication that the economy is in good
shape.
   ``Persistent declines in the money supply ... are a harbinger of
a more dramatic slowdown than most analysts expect,'' he said.
``Historically, a falling money supply has led to a large decline
in overall economic growth.''
   The drop in the money supply in April was the fourth in a row.
   The April Index of Leading Economic Indicators stood at 145.7
percent of its 1982 base of 100.

<HEAD>Equitable of Iowa to Sell Its Younkers Department Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Equitable of Iowa Cos. is looking
for a buyer for its Younkers department store chain, saying
Wednesday it would use the proceeds to expand its insurance
business.
   Equitable said it would begin soliciting bids in the next three
weeks and has retained the New York investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc. to advise the company on offers for the chain that
has stores in Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota
and had sales last year of $313 million.
   A sale is not expected to occur until early fall.
   ``I think it's a wise move,'' said analyst Vita Marino at
Firemark Insurance Research, a consulting and investment banking
firm at Parsippany, N.J. ``Many companies in the industry who
diversified in the last decade are now streamlining their
operations.''
   Investors appeared to cheer the news. In over-the-counter
trading, Equitable of Iowa stock rose $1.50 a share to $29.75 in
Wednesday's session.
   Analyst Jeff Hopson at the St. Louis investment firm A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. estimated a minimum value of $20 a share for
Younkers, or $140 million.
   The company has refused to speculate on what a sale would bring
or who would buy its retail business, but has valued Younkers at a
minimum of $73 million.
   Hopson said a logical suitor might be Dillard Department Stores
Inc. of Little Rock, Ark., but that he expected several other
companies also would be interested. A call seeking comment from
Dillard's was not returned.
   Asked about the possibility of a management buyout, Tom Gould,
the president of Younkers, said managers have decided to keep their
options open.
   ``It's better to wait and see what the opportunities are,'' he
said.
   Gould said Younkers has outperformed the industry in recent
years but it would take tremendous amounts of capital to continue
the performance.
   Younkers earned $8.3 million on $313 million in sales last year
and has been improving steadily in recent years. In 1984, for
example, it earned $680,000 on sales of $188.6 million.
   Equitable of Iowa, which purchased Younkers in 1979, had
earnings of $36.7 million on $509.7 million in revenue last year.
Just two years ago, it acquired the eleven-store Brandeis chain for
Younkers at a cost of $60 million.
   In its announcement in Des Moines, where it is based, Equitable
said the decision to seek a buyer for Younkers reflects an attempt
to redirect its capital from its retail interests to its insurance
business.
   ``At present, we see significant growth potential in both
businesses, but unfortunately this growth would require more
capital than is currently available,'' said Fred Hubbell, the chief
executive of Equitable of Iowa.
   The company said it would difficult and risky to attempt to
provide enough money to expand both businesses at the same time.
   ``Our core life insurance business, and in particular our
annuities business, offers great future promise,'' Hubbell said.
``We have greater management experience and expertise in insurance.
As a result, we believe it is appropriate at this time to seek a
buyer for Younkers.''

   Stocks seesawed Wednesday but ended mostly
higher, supported by a late recovery in the bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.60 points to
close at 2,480.15.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 8 to
5 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 896 up, 558 down and 505 unchanged.
   After a weak opening, stocks rebounded following a government
report that its chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8
percent in April. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators had
declined during the previous two months and economists had warned
that a third consecutive decline would signal a recession.
   The market quickly lost ground, however, as the dollar slipped
and bonds declined following a second report from the Commerce
Department that showed orders to U.S. factories rose 2.7 percent in
April, the best showing in four months.
   That report indicated the economy is still going strong,
prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve might not loosen its
hold on interest rates.
   The impact was brief, though, as fear of Fed tightening faded
and the dollar recovered from earlier sluggishness, lifting bond
prices and inciting some late-afternoon buying on Wall Street.
   ``The main factor was the bond market because of the dollar and
growing confidence that the economy is slowing down and that
interest rates are going to come down,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   Late word that the Bundesbank might not raise its discount rate
also firmed prices before a last-minute selling spree eliminated
much of the gains in the final minutes of trading.
   The market lost ground in the final minutes of trading.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 162.53 million
shares, up from 151.78 million shares Tuesday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 190.68 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $13.102 billion, or 0.49
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

   Philip Morris Cos. is test-marketing a new,
virtually nicotine-free cigarette that the company believes has as
much flavor as regular cigarettes.
   Published reports said Philip Morris was testing the cigarette,
but the company refused to confirm or deny the reports Wednesday,
saying it does not comment on product testing.
   However, a source, who asked not to be identified, said the
reports were correct.
   The lower nicotine levels in the new cigarette _ which will be
sold under the names Merit Free and Next from Merit _ are achieved
through a process similar to the decaffeination of coffee.
   The cigarette's competitors, which include American Brands
Inc.'s Carlton and RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Now, use a different
technology that affects the taste of the tobacco.
   The new cigarette will contain 0.1 milligram of nicotine, the
same amount as in Carlton and Now.
   Low-nicotine cigarettes appeal to smokers who are trying to cut
down their intake of harmful substances contained in tobacco smoke.
   The prospect of a new, potentially successful product apparently
appealed to investors Wednesday. Philip Morris stock rose $1.12{ a
share to close at $139.12{ in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.

<HEAD>Tyson Challenged in Delaware Court to Raise Bid for Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Tyson Foods Inc. is so eager to buy the
Holly Farms Corp., it should simply raise its $1.1 billion offer, a
lawyer for a competing bidder told a Chancery Court judge Wednesday
in Delaware.
   ``Why doesn't Tyson open its pocketbook?'' said Franklin
Balotti, a lawyer representing ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   Balotti's comment came at a hearing before Vice Chancellor
Maurice Hartnett in Wilmington, Del., on a request from Tyson to
block a proposed merger announced May 20 between ConAgra and Holly
Farms.
   After listening to arguments from lawyers representing Holly
Farms, Tyson, ConAgra and Holly Farms shareholders, Hartnett
retired to consider Tyson's motion. He did not say when he would
rule, but Balotti said it could take up to two weeks.
   Tyson has offered $1.1 billion in cash for Holly Farms' stock,
while Tyson would acquire Holly Farms in a stock swap valued at
about $1.3 billion.
   Tyson lawyer Rodman Ward said Holly Farms managers have
improperly favored ConAgra throughout a buyout squabble that began
last year.
   ``This battle has been bruising and expensive,'' Ward said.
   Balotti said ConAgra and Holly have a legitimate agreement
calling for a shareholder vote on the merger, and Bruce McNew, a
lawyer for Holly shareholders, asked Hartnett to allow that voting.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., can top ConAgra's offer if it
wants Holly shareholders to reject the merger, McNew said.
   ``Tyson doesn't want to compete,'' he said.
   A shareholders vote on the proposed merger is expected in July.
   The merger, to be accomplished through a stock swap, would be
worth $74.81 a share or $1.3 billion to Holly shareholders based on
the value of ConAgra shares at the time the agreement was announced.
   Lawyers told Hartnett, however, that the deal likely would be
worth about $68 a share based on the longterm expected value of
ConAgra stock.
   Tyson has issued a cash tender offer for $63.50 a share or $1.1
billion for all of Holly Farms stock.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, has been trying
to take over Holly Farms since last October, and the battle has
been tied up in Hartnett's court since Holly and ConAgra announced
a previous merger proposal last November.
   Holly shareholders rejected that proposal in April, but an
``asset option agreement'' included in the plan still is at issue
in the continuing debate.
   The asset agreement allows ConAgra to purchase about a third of
Holly Farms if the company is bought by someone else.
   Tyson's challenge of the asset agreement is expected to go to
trial, but no trial date has been set.
   Observers of the Holly Farms battle say the Memphis company
likely would function as an independent subsidiary with ConAgra,
while the same would not be true with Tyson.
   Holly Farms is a diversified company heavily dependent on fresh
fryer sales. ConAgra specializes in agricultural services and food.
   Although ConAgra is considered a friendly suitor for Holly
Farms, Holly lawyer Kenneth Nachbar said Tyson and ConAgra were
dealing behind the scenes until shortly before the proposed merger
was announced.
   Tyson offered to pay ConAgra $50 million to step aside but an
agreement based on that offer fell apart at the last minute,
Nachbar said.

<HEAD>Bilzerian Resumes Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian resumed
testifying at his federal securities fraud trial Wednesday, but
only after his lawyers revamped their case to compensate for an
unfavorable ruling by the judge.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Robert J. Ward ruled that if Bilzerian
testified that he didn't believe he was breaking the law in two
takeover attempts, it would open up a line of questioning to
prosecutors about what his lawyers told him at the time.
   Such lawyer-client conversations are usually confidential under
the so-called attorney-client privilege.
   When Ward ruled that privilege would be waived if Bilzerian was
asked and answered certain questions by his defense lawyers, they
asked for an adjornment to re-consider their strategy.
   ``We have determined an your honor,'' defense attorney Arthur
Mathews told Ward at the beginning of Wednesday's session ``that we
do not intend to pursue anything upon the direct examination of Mr.
Bilzerian that would waive the attorney-client privilege.''
   Mathews added later: ``We have restructured our planned
examination of Mr. Bilzerian.''
   Under Mathews' questioning, Bilzerian described his acquisition
of stock in H.H. Robertson Co. manufacturing and construction
concern and apparel-maker Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., two transactions
listed in the indictmet against him.
   His testimony was to continue Thursday.
   Bilzerian, 38, of Tampa, Fla., is accused of conspiracy,
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986.
   None of the charges involve Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover
of Singer last year.
   In two of those four transactions _ the 1985 purchase of Cluett
Peabody &amp; Co. shares and the 1986 purchase of Hammermill Paper Co.
stock _ the government contends Bilzerian falsely claimed to be
using millions of dollars of his own money, when most of the money
actually was raised by others.
   But the defense has contended Bilzerian acted in ``good faith''
and did not believe he was breaking the law in filing misleading
documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In statements he made to the SEC in 1988, Bilzerian said he was
merely following his then-lawyers' advice when he supplied
misleading information on SEC forms.
   Ward, however, said by taking the witness stand and invoking
that ``good faith'' defense under questioning by his own lawyers,
Bilzerian was waiving the attorney-client privilege and prosecutors
could ask on cross examination what was the basis for his belief
that he was not breaking any laws _ more specifically _ what had
his lawyers told him at the time.
   Bilzerian was not required to testify.
   If convicted, Bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in
jail and a $250,000 fine on each count.

<HEAD>FCC Recommends Abolition of Copyright System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications is recommending to
Congress that it abolish a 13-year-old copyright system that allows
cable television operators to pay a percentage of their income to
retransmit over-the-air TV programs, officials said Wednesday.
   The commission, in a ruling it made Tuesday and released
Wednesday, said cable TV companies should negotiate with
broadcasters and producers on a case-by-case basis for programs.
   Critics of that approach say it would be very costly for cable
operators to negotiate for every program individually and could
result in fewer programs being made available to cable subscribers
or cause subscription costs to go up.
   Congress in 1976 compelled broadcasters and program owners to
allow cable operators to retransmit their programs. In return for
this ``compulsory license,'' cable companies were required to pay a
specified percentage of their revenues to the U.S. Copyright
Office. The office's Copyright Royalty Tribunal decides how to
allocate the fees among broadcasters, program owners and entities
such as sports franchises.
   In establishing the rules, Congress reasoned that the costs of
working out contracts for every program would stymy the infant
cable TV industry.
   The cable industry last year paid $188 million in compulsory
license fees, according to Lynn McReynolds, a spokeswoman for the
National Cable Television Association.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the current system ``impedes
the efficient functioning of the market'' and ``weakens the
incentives of producers to respond'' to consumers' tastes and
programming preferences.
   He said it also subsidizes program acquisition by cable
operators and disadvantages competitive alternatives to cable.
   But James Mooney, president of the cable association, said the
FCC ``seems to be a little off the deep end.''
   Mooney noted that Congress last year extended the present
copyright system to companies that package TV programs for delivery
to backyard satellite dish owners rather than making those
packagers negotiate for shows one at a time.
   ``Congress and the commission seem not to share the same view on
these matters,'' Mooney said in a statement.
   The commission last year made a preliminary decision to
recommend repeal of the compulsory license rules for programs that
come from stations located outside local viewing areas.
``Superstations'' such as WTBS in Atlanta and WGN in Chicago are
examples of these so-called distant signals.
   Cable operators use satellites or microwave systems to relay
these signals around the nation and then pipe them into homes
locally.
   In its new decision, the FCC recommended that the rules be
repealed for all signals, both from distant broadcasters and from
local broadcasters such as channels 4, 7, 9 and so on.
   Commissioner Patricia Dennis concurred with Patrick in the
ruling. Commissioner James Quello concurred with repealing the
distant signal provision, but he argued for keeping the compulsory
license for local signals.
   ``It is conceivable that under full copyright liability cable
operators may choose not to carry local broadcast signals due to
the costs'' of obtaining rights to retransmit the programs, Quello
said.
   He said the FCC should, instead, recommend that Congress
reimpose rules requiring cable systems to carry all local broadcast
stations. He said these ``must-carry'' rules shouldn't exist
without compulsory license for local signals.
   He also disputed the agency staff's contention that costs of
negotiating contracts were lower today, per subscriber, than in
1976.
   Mooney said it was ``surprising'' the commission was
recommending repeal of the rules for local signals.
   He said that would create a situation in which ``cable could not
even retransmit local signals by joint agreement _ the original
rights owners in Hollywood would have to consent too, presumably
for a price.''

<HEAD>Salinas Presents Six-Year Blueprint For Mexico; Calls For 6 Percent
Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on
Wednesday unveiled an ambitious plan to transform Mexico's
stagnant, debt-burdened economy into a robust modern engine
generating a steady 6 percent growth a year.
   The National Development Plan for 1989-1994 proposes the
``modernization of the nation in all its aspects'' during Salinas'
six-year term of office.
   The Salinas administration's 164-page blueprint touches on
everything from drinking water to foreign policy, but the
centerpiece is economics.
   ``The economic strategy of the plan has two priority goals:
achieving a growth rate of around 6 percent a year and ...
maintaining stability so price increases are comparable to those of
our commercial partners,'' Salinas said in a ceremony at the
National Palace unveiling the plan.
   Salinas' prescription for economic health includes cutting debt
payments, keeping inflation down and prices stable, encouraging
productivity, savings and investment and modernizing finance,
technology and industry.
   One of the most critical elements is renegotiating the $107.4
billion foreign debt, the second-largest in the developing world
after Brazil's. Mexico paid $9 billion in interest and $5 billion
in principal in 1988 and servicing costs were expected to reach $16
billion this year.
   But Salinas warned against blaming the debt for all of Mexico's
problems. It will take more than stemming the financial hemorrhage,
he said, to transform the nation.
   ``Let's not fall into thinking that once this obstacle has been
overcome, we will have resolved all our problems,'' he warned.
``The internal effort to produce and produce better is
irreplaceable.''
   The plan, which the Constitution requires every president to
present during his first six months in office, reiterates Salinas'
election campaign and inaugural address promises of economic
recovery in a more democratic Mexico with a higher standard of
living.
   Salinas was able to point to substantial progress since his Dec.
1 inauguration. Mexico has liberalized its rules on foreign
investment, won concessions and credits from international
creditors, kept the lid on inflation, eased its dependence on oil
and sold off some state-owned industries.
   On Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced an agreement with
the Club of Paris, a group of 16 creditor nations, designed to cut
the debt by $2.6 billion and refinance 80 percent of the interest
over the next decade.
   Last week, the International Monetary Fund said it had approved
a $4.1 billion credit line to Mexico, 40 percent of which can be
used to pay off the foreign debt.
   The 41-year-old president stressed the importance of creating
jobs and fostering a work force that compete in world markets in
both productivity and quality.
   He said Mexico must keep pace with a changing world where
competition and technology are critical and commercial markets are
interdependent.
   The Salinas reforms follow decades of protectionism that saw the
Mexican economy grow by an impressive 6 to 7 percent each year but
also fostered inefficient industry dependent on government
subsidies and import barriers.
   They also are an antidote to the economic crisis that began in
1982, when the oil boom crashed and Mexico, a heavy borrower,
suddenly went from riches to rags.
   The buying power of the average worker is now half what it was
in 1982 and the party that has ruled Mexico since 1929 barely won
the 1988 presidential election.

Wednesday a restructuring that would separate those companies from
ownership interests in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., a
cellular-phone company.
   In February, API Print Corp. was created to hold Affiliated's

Globe, and Billboard Publications, Affiliated said.
   After a vote at Wednesday's shareholders meeting, one share of
Class A common stock and one share of Class B common stock of API
Print were issued for each outstanding share of company stock,
Affiliated Vice President William B. Huff said.
   Affiliated then merged its equity interest in McCaw Cellular. As
a result, McCaw Cellular will distribute 58,522,638 shares of its
stock on a basis of approximately 0.84 shares of McCaw stock for
every share of Affiliated stock held on May 31.
   After Wednesday's transactions, API Print changed its name to
Affiliated Publications, the company said.
   Affiliated shareholders now own stock in two different

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Says Channel One Reaction More Favorable Upon Viewing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who've seen the teen-oriented
Channel One news show are more likely to rate it favorably than
those who merely get a verbal description of the
advertiser-supported experiment, a Gallup study concludes.
   ``Although majorities in the general public generally approve of
the idea of Channel One, there is some level of apprehension,''
said the survey by The Gallup Organization Inc. of Princeton, N.J.
   ``This apprehension appears to diminish once the program is
viewed,'' said the group, which released its findings Wednesday.
   The survey referred to a 12-minute daily news show _ which
includes 2 minutes of commercials _ recently beamed to six high
schools on an experimental basis. In exchange for having students
watch the show each day, each school gets $50,000 worth of video
equipment free, and the company profits through the advertising.
   The company that created Channel One, Whittle Communications of
Knoxville, is trying to decide whether to expand the project
nationally.
   Some groups laud Channel One as a good way to get news to teens
and to get sorely needed equipment into the schools.
   Others say that it's a bad idea to have the captive, malleable
audience of teen-agers watching commercials each day in a public
school room and that educators could use the 12 minutes for other
things.
   Chairman Chris Whittle said his company two months ago arranged
for the Gallup attitude poll because it expected various school
boards and superintendents would request such information, although
so far they have not contacted the company for it.
   For its study, Gallup interviewed 1,046 shoppers in malls in
Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Iowa, Connecticut, South Carolina and
New York state after showing them a videotape of a Channel One
show, including commercials.
   Those responses were compared with another group _ 1,007 people
18 and over who were telephoned randomly across the country and
given only a general, verbal description of the show.
   The verbal description consisted of its basic offering (news and
features), timetable, equipment involved and the requirement of
daily watching. It also mentioned that there were commercials and
that the equipment was free.
   Of the telephoned group, 57 percent said they thought Channel
One is an excellent or good idea, while 34 percent said it's a fair
or poor idea.
   Of the shopping mall group, 85 percent of the 528 teen-agers
said they'd be interested in seeing Channel One in their local high
school. Eighty-seven percent of the 254 parents polled said the
same. Eighty-eight percent of the 264 non-parent adults said they'd
like to see Channel One in their local schools.
   In addition, more than 80 percent of teen-agers and non-parent
adults who saw the videotape said showing commercials with the news
program was acceptable. Seventy-four percent of the parents who saw
the tape said the same.
   Whittle said he was ``optimistic'' about the possibility of
expanding the project to all schools which want it, but won't make
a decision until he's finished mulling over other test results.
   The other tests include a survey of about 500 teachers, another
on the views of 10,000 students who participated in the pilot
showings, marketing tests and a test designed to show whether
students who watched Channel One retained the information it
contained.

   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it will expand from
79 daily flights in June to 221 in July, the company's largest
increase in service since a strike began March 4.
   Eastern said it will serve 27 cities in June and 52 in July as
it moves toward a new full schedule of 600 flights by the end of
the year.
   ``This is a significant part of a multi-phase plan to establish
Eastern as a competitive, dependable, full-service airline,'' said
George Brennan, vice president for marketing.
   Striking unions scoffed at Eastern's announcement. Hank Weber, a
spokesman for the pilots union, said the company won't have enough
pilots in July to make 221 flights daily.
   ``It's all flap and no throttle,'' Weber said. ``Unless they
actually do it, it's just talk.''
   Weber said Eastern has been flying 92 to 112 flights daily since
the beginning of the strike. The company has fewer than 250 pilots,
he said.
   Wally Haber, a spokesman for the Machinists union, said an
expanded schedule would be of little help to the carrier.
   ``Travel agents are not booking Eastern now because they're not
dependable,'' Haber said. ``Eastern is going to be flying a lot of
empty airplanes.''
   Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from its creditors March 9, five days after the start of a strike
by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for
Eastern, is expected to report at a hearing Thursday that no viable
offers have been made for the airline, The New York Times reported
in Thursday's editions.
   Eastern's unions have recently supported proposed buyout
proposals from two investor groups, one led by former Piedmont
Airlines chairman William Howard and the other by Chicago
commodities trader Joseph Ritchie. Shapiro has challenged the two
groups to put at least $100 million of their own cash at risk.
   Management, on the other hand, is proceeding with a plan to
rebuild Eastern as a smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion of its
assets separately.
   Eastern said the expanded schedule will allow the company to
recall by July more than 1,700 non-union workers placed on ``no
work'' status when the airline curtailed service shortly after the
strike started. Eastern said it has 5,000 employees now and
eventually will have about 17,000, compared with a pre-strike total
of around 30,000.
   Eastern was operating 1,000 flights daily before the strike and
has 110 now. Sixty daily flights currently are part of Eastern's
Northeast shuttle business that has been sold to developer Donald
Trump. The shuttle business is not included in figures for flights
planned in June and July, Eastern said.
   In Atlanta, Eastern's largest hub, the airline will launch 82
daily flights to 26 cities by July 2. New York-Bermuda service
begins June 9. Service from Miami to Caracas, Venezuela, will
resume June 1. Eastern also plans to increase flights between Miami
and New York during the summer.
   The carrier said it will continue its 200 weekly flights between
Miami and 14 cities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Eastern
said it will add about 614,000 seats in July.
   ``Eastern's comeback this summer will feature bargain fares
normally associated with the introduction of new service,'' Brennan
said in a news release.
   ``With $39 to $139 domestic fares, our customers can take
advantage of the lowest fares in the sky _ without restrictive
penalties or length-of-stay requirements.''
   For a limited time, Eastern also will offer first-class tickets
at prices below normal economy-class fares to attract business
travelers.
   ``Because of the turmoil here,'' company spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak said, ``we'll need to use price as an incentive to get
customers to try us again.''
   On June 9, Eastern said, it will resume or add service from
Atlanta to Washington; New York; Miami; Orlando, Fla.; Tampa, Fla.;
and Newark, N.J.
   On July 2, service from Atlanta will be restored to Boston; Los
Angeles; New Orleans; Denver; Chicago; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh;
Seattle; San Francisco; Milwaukee; St. Louis; Indianapolis;
Buffalo, N.Y.; Huntsville, Ala.; Charlotte, N.C.; Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.; West Palm Beach, Fla.; Sarasota, Fla.; Fort Myers, Fla.; and
Greenville, S.C.
