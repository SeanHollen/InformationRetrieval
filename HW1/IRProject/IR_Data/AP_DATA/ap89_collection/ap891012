   The widow of the Panamanian major who led an
unsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel Noriega says it failed
because her husband was betrayed by another major who switched
sides at the last minute, according to a published report.
   Countering what U.S. officials have been saying, Adela Bonilla
de Giroldi is quoted by the New York Times in its Thursday editions
as saying that the coup was ``very well organized and coldly
calculated.''
   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had worked with
Maj. Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in
planning the coup.
   Instead of being used to oust Noriega, however, Battalion 2000
was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led
Noriega's troops in crushing the coup.
   ``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's game
and he failed to come through because of his cowardice. He
committed treason,'' she told the Times in an interview conducted
in Miami.
   In a television interview with WTVJ of Miami, she said she
warned her husband of the perils of the attempted coup.
   ``I told him `Think of what you're doing.' I said, `If you're
going to do that, you're going to have to kill him.'
   ``He said, `I don't think that will be necessary. If things get
difficult, we'll give him over to the Americans. If not, we'll
retire him under house arrest,''' she said.
   She says her husband had wanted help from the Americans, but
military bureaucracy may have prevented that help from arriving in
time, she told the station. She said the battle with Noriega will
continue, and her husband's death could be a catalyst.
   ``Where (Giroldi) is now, he is OK,'' she told WTVJ. ``He's with
God. Noriega, not even hell wants him. Panama doesn't want him.
Hell doesn't want him. So, where will he go?''
   Mrs. Giroldi, airlifted from Panama, is staying with her
children and invalid mother at a secret location in Miami.
   She was not at military headquarters during the coup attempt on
Oct. 3 and her information came from officers who took part in the
coup and fled to the United States, the Times said.
   She said she believed the coup would have succeeded had it not
been for Olechea, whose battalion would have provided the firepower
to topple Noriega, she told the newspaper.
   Olechea ``turned sides at the last moment'' although Olechea and
her husband ``were good friends and had talked several times about
this coup'' she said.
   She also said that three captains who were supposed to persuade
Noriega to surrender ``didn't do it because they were cowards.''
   Her lends credence to reports that officers held Noriega for up
to five hours as they argued whether to turn him over to U.S.
officials.
   While the captains argued, Noriega slipped into a separate room
and telephoned for help and the coup was crushed.
   Mrs. Giroldi said that Noriega ``himself assassinated my
husband.''
   ``My husband could have killed Noriega, but he would not do
that. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by the
people,'' not the United States, she told the paper.
   Mrs. Giroldi did not have firsthand evidence that Noriega killed
her husband, the paper said.
   She confirmed that she had approached U.S. officials and told
them that a coup attempt was imminent and that the sealing of roads
by U.S. forces would help her husband's attempt.
   She told the Times that the coup attempt was hatched by junior
officers who were fed up with Noriega, who she said ``always seemed
drunk.''
   ``My husband told me that most of the time Noriega was operative
only an hour a day,'' she said, adding that it was widely believed
that Noriega drank heavily and used amphetamines.
   Noriega is very bright, she told the Times.
   ``The next time, he has to be the first to be killed,'' she said.

   More than 150,000 Chicagoans voted to elect local
school councils Wednesday as part of sweeping reforms that will
give parents more control of an education system labeled the worst
in the nation.
   At issue is the quality of learning in a system whose 410,000
students make it the nation's third largest, but whose low test
scores and high dropout rates in 1987 caused then-Education
Secretary William Bennett to brand it the nation's worst.
   The final tally is expected to show that more than 30 percent of
the parents voted in the elections, school officials said.
   An early tally of votes cast showed that 150,401 people voted.
Officials said that included 70,053 parents, 55,319 community
residents and 25,029 ballots cast by Chicago Public School staff
members.
   Officials said there were a number of reports of irregularities
in the balloting, most caused by inexperienced election judges and
ballots at some schools that had more than 20 candidates.
   ``I want to be part of the reform _ I think this is one way of
having a solution to the problems in the schools of Chicago. I feel
it's a responsibility of the parents,'' said Nacer Boundaoui, who
voted at Robert Healey Elementary School, where his son attends
first grade.
   Boundaoui led his 4-year-old daughter, Assia, into the school
gymnasium and stood behind a wooden screen hiding a metal school
desk, where he marked his vote on a paper ballot.
   The elections _ Wednesday at the city's 469 elementary schools
and Thursday at 71 public high schools _ were part of a reform
package passed last year by the Illinois General Assembly. Reform
also included cutting administrative jobs and shifting money in the
$2.26-billion school budget to educating low-income students.
   Community activists spent weeks trying to mobilize residents to
vote, but predicted a 50 percent turnout among parents with
children in school. School Board spokesman Bob Saigh said that
turnout was low by late afternoon, but was expected to improve by
the time polls closed.
   The 17,256 candidates sought 5,400 unpaid positions on the 540
councils, each of which will include six parents, two teachers and
two community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will
elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be
the principal of the school or schools the council oversees.
   The councils, scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within a
week of the elections, will have authority to hire and fire
principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend money.
   The councils would receive much of the authority previously
vested in the school system's central bureaucracy, headed by a
superintendent and the Chicago Board of Education. The old board of
mayoral appointees was scrapped under the plan and a seven-member
interim board, also appointed by the mayor, is running the system.
   Ultimately, a 15-member permanent board will be named by the
mayor, following screenings by citizens' panels.
   At George B. McClellan school, Mayor Richard M. Daley was one of
about 60 people who had voted by 11 a.m.
   ``I'd like to have them coming in, but it's slow,'' said
election judge Alfreda McLain, surveying the empty polling place at
McClellan. ``Maybe they don't understand that they should help the
public schools.''
   A survey by Designs for Change, an education research and
advisory council that helped shape the reform package, found that
nearly equal numbers of candidates came from low-income
neighborhoods as middle-class sections of the city. Participation
was as high at mostly black and Hispanic schools as at integrated
schools, the survey found.

   Arsenio Hall, star of his own late-night talk
show, was disappointed when he wasn't tapped to be the heir
apparent to the king of the talk shows, Johnny Carson.
   In Rolling Stone magazine's November issue, Hall said that when
Jay Leno was selected as Carson's substitute host, ``I thought it
should have been me.''
   Hall has long admired Carson and dreamed of being host of ``The
Tonight Show.''
   ``He was the guy,'' Hall said of Carson. ``Even when he wasn't
funny, he looked good. I had to cry to my mother for one pair of
sneakers, but what I really wanted was a Johnny Carson suit.''
   Hall praised Leno, saying: ``Jay Leno is one of the last pure
stand-ups left.''
   But no praise is forthcoming for another late-night host, David
Letterman.
   ``I think he hates my guts,'' Hall said. ``Sometimes you're just
not someone's cup of tea.''

   The Salvation Army honored televangelist
Billy Graham, awarding the preacher its highest humanitarian award.
   Graham was given the William Booth Award on Wednesday in
recognition of four decades of ministry and crusades, said Lt. Col.
David Riley, Salvation Army Southern California division commander.
   ``People are finding today that materialism doesn't satisfy,''
Graham said, describing the world's spiritual hunger. Today, Graham
is to be feted at a fund-raising dinner for the homeless.
   Graham's ``The Hour of Decision'' hit the airwaves in 1950 and
is broadcast on 500 U.S. stations and several hundred overseas.
   On Sunday, Graham is scheduled to become the first clergyman to
receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said his spokesman A.

   Michael Jackson's homecoming excited Gardner
Street Elementary School pupils, who watched as the pop music
superstar helped dedicate a remodeled auditorium named in his honor.
   ``This is the happiest day of my life,'' said Jackson, a
sixth-grader at the Hollywood school during the 1969-70 school year.
   Jackson, wearing a leather outfit covered in zippers, studs and
buckles, arrived at the school Wednesday to students' squeals of
``Michael! Michael!'' and was guided into the building by police
officers.
   After speeches by school officials, pupils and parents, Jackson
was presented a commemorative plaque by his former teacher Laura
Gerson.
   ``I am deeply touched and honored that the PTA, principal,
faculty members and students have been so kind as to dedicate this
auditorium, where I sat as a child, in my honor,'' Jackson said.
   Janique Hennessee, 11, said she was so excited to see Jackson
that she started crying, but Jackson came up to her and dried her
tears.

   While the Rolling Stones were thrilling New York
rock fans, another longtime star, Vladimir Horowitz, created a
different kind of excitement for classical music devotees.
   As selections from his new recording, ``Horowitz at Home,''
played in a midtown record store Wednesday, the 85-year-old pianist
autographed copies of it for his fans.
   Outside, more than 1,000 people patiently lined Sixth Avenue
from 51st to 52nd streets, waiting for a chance to meet the
virtuoso inside the store.
   It was a quiet crowd, not at all like the boisterous thousands
who greeted the Rolling Stones performances at Shea Stadium on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``This is a very rare event. His last public signing was in
October of 1986,'' said Jennifer Heinlein, a spokesman for Deutsche
Grammophone records. ``And this is a very good crowd.''
   Horowitz's latest album, recorded in the living room of his
Manhattan home, features him playing Mozart, Schubert and Liszt.

   Former movie star-singer Frances
Langford has donated a $600,000 house on the Atlantic Ocean to the
Florida Oceanographic Society.
   The society is planning a $14 million Coastal Science Center,
and Langford's gift will finance half of the center's first phase.
   ``The right people just happened to tell me about the Florida
Oceanographic Society,'' Langford told reporters Tuesday.
``Somehow, the activities of the society seem very exciting to me
and so I was pleased to make the gift.''
   The oceanfront residence on Hutchinson Island will be sold and
the proceeds will be placed in the building fund, said Frank Wacha
Jr., the society's president.
   Langford, probably best known for playing Blanche on the 1940s
radio show ``The Bickersons'' with Don Ameche, has been named a
founder of the new center and appointed to the society's board of
directors.

   Actress Peggy Lipton, a star of the old TV
series ``The Mod Squad,'' has filed for divorce from music producer
Quincy Jones.
   Miss Lipton cited irreconcilable differences and is seeking
unspecified spousal and child support, according to court papers
filed Tuesday. The couple married Sept. 14, 1974.
   She also seeks joint custody of the couple's two daughters,
Kidada, 15, and Rashida, 13, who have been living with their mother
since their parents separated three years ago, the court papers say.
   Miss Lipton played Julie Barnes in ``The Mod Squad,'' a series
about undercover, counterculture cops that was broadcast from 1968
to 1973. Jones has produced numerous hit albums, including Michael
Jackson's ``Thriller.''

<TEXT>
   The ex-warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary was fired for lax security, not reporting escapes and
operating a cockfighting business at the prison, the state's
corrections chief said Wednesday.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since in August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn said.
   Butler, a career corrections employee, stepped aside as warden
after a court-appointed investigator, former Angola warden Ross
Maggio, issued a highly critical report on operations at the vast
prison complex at Angola.
   Butler later asked the Civil Service Commission to reinstate
him, claiming that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into
retiring.
   Lynn has denied that Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not
involved in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right
decision'' to step aside. The governor said Wednesday that he
backed Lynn's decision to dismiss Butler.
   Butler can appeal his firing to an internal department panel and
to the Civil Service Commission.
   Butler refused comment and referred questions to his attorney,
Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of the charges
and declined comment.
   According to the charges, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison utilities.
Several hundred fighting cocks he owned have been removed from
Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   The charges said he also failed to maintain searches of
employees and visitors to the prison, allowed inadequate and
inoperable security equipment, ill-trained personnel, and failed to
report at least seven escapes for prosecution, as required by
agency policy.
   Lynn said the charges were referred to the district attorney who
handles Angola and a copy would be sent to U.S. District Judge
Frank Polozola, who is overseeing a long-running federal suit
involving the prison system.

<HEAD>Company Distributing AIDS-linked Pneumonia-Fighting Drug Free to
Poor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with cost of drug, quotes from officials;
a version moving on business wires; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyphomed Inc. has been distributing its drug
pentamidine, used to combat AIDS-linked pneumonia, free to poor
patients, the company said Wednesday.
   The company announced its plans to give away the drug in
February, but the actual distribution was held up until after the
drug won full government approval in June, said spokeswoman Melissa
Marsden.
   Community health organizations have been notified of the
availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lacked
insurance to cover its costs.
   Ms. Marsden said there have been no recent talks within the
company about reducing the cost of the drug to the paying public.
Lyphomed, based in suburban Rosemont, has been accused by AIDS
activists and others of overcharging for the substance.
   Lyphomed's action represents the first time a company has
distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge,
company officials and federal Food and Drug Administration
spokesman Brad Stone told The New York Times.
   Since 1984, Lyphomed has produced an injectable form of the drug
for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening form of pneumonia that is the
leading cause of death among AIDS patients.
   In June, the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol
version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure
by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia.
   Lyphomed charges about $100 wholesale for a monthly dose.
Patients pay up to $200 for the same dose through doctors and
pharmacies.
   Last month, the People With AIDS Health Group said it would
import the drug from England, where is it cheaper, and sell it to
AIDS patients in this country at a lower cost that the drug can be
bought here.
   Lyphomed said its charge is appropriate, given the research
money it spent developing the drug.

<HEAD>U.S. Bishops Attack Israeli Rights Abuses, Call for Palestinian Homeland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three U.S. Roman Catholic archbishops said
Israel should negotiate directly with Palestinians over ``territory
and sovereignty,'' and criticized Israel for alleged human rights
abuse.
   The joint statement by Archbishops Roger Mahony of Los Angeles
and William Keeler of Baltimore and Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York also called on Syria to leave Lebanon.
   Their statement, to be presented to the nation's 300 bishops,
asked the Bush administration to take more action in negotiating a
peace in the Middle East that meets the security needs of Israel
and the ``long-denied rights'' of Palestinians.
   But it also called on Palestinians to pursue ``sovereign
co-existence'' with Israel.
   ``The key to successful political dialogue will be Palestinians
willing to discuss secure boundaries and stable political relations
with Israel and Israelis willing to discuss territory and
sovereignty with Palestinians,'' the statement said.
   ``We feel as Christian leaders in the Catholic community that we
have a responsibility to ... pull factions that have been in
conflict together, to be instruments of peace,'' said Mahony,
chairman of the committee that drew up the statement. ``We see this
as a moral challenge. There is a better way to live.''
   The statement, ``Toward Peace in the Middle East: Problems and
Principles,'' will be presented to the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops' fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in Baltimore.
   Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director
of the American Jewish Committee, and Judith H. Banki, his
associate, said they were troubled by the bishops' ``premature''
support for Palestinian sovereignty.
   They also said that in criticizing Israel's handling of the
Palestinian uprising, the prelates failed to give equal weight ``to
Israel's very real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining
order in the territories,'' and a 40-year history of terrorist
attacks by Palestinians.
   An Arab-American leader praised the statement.
   ``The addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of
Palestinian independence is an historic development at a critical
juncture in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,'' said Abdeen Jabara,
president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
``History will record that the moral authority of the American
Catholic Church was indisputably on the side of peace in the Middle
East.''
   The prelates cited Israeli responsibility in the beating deaths
of Palestinians and people not involved in the uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the demolition
of homes and arrest and detention without trial.
   They said the statement was devised after consultations with the
Vatican, religious leaders in the Middle East, U.S. policymakers
and major Jewish, Arab and Christian organizations.
   ``It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists
in the Middle East, and that the United States has an indispensable
role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this
statement,'' said the committee.
   The nearly 2-year-old intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising, is a
cry for justice and personal and political identity that demands
``on both moral and political grounds, a response by the United
States government,'' the prelates said.
   They stopped short of calling directly for the creation of a
Palestinian state. But they said the United States must go beyond
the approach of the Camp David accords of the late 1970s, which
gave Palestinians a secondary role in the peace process, and grant
``their right to participate as equals, through representatives
selected by Palestinians, in all negotiations affecting their
destiny.''
   Having opened political discussions with the Palestine
Liberation Organization in December 1988, ``the United States now
has the opportunity to use its influence and relationships to
foster a more extensive dialogue among Israel, Palestinians and the
Arab states,'' the prelates wrote.
   They also called for a ``clear, consistent'' U.S. policy
``pressing Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.''
   They called on the Arab states and Palestinians to recognize
Israel's right to exist, and asked the Arab nations to establish
full diplomatic relations with Israel.
   ``Anything short of this leaves the `legitimacy' of Israel
undefined in the policy of the Arab states, and reinforces Israel's
position that the only road to survival is one requiring superior
military power.''

   Tens of thousands of Armenians fed up with the
ethnic conflict that has deprived them of food and fuel massed
Wednesday and called for creating self-defense units, activists
said.
   ``We consider it pointless to count on Moscow any longer,'' said
Karen Shakhbazyan, an Armenian independence activist who described
the rally by telephone from the Caucasus republic's capital of
Yerevan.
   ``People called for a free, independent Armenia and there were
appeals to the West and the European Parliament for weapons
support, because Armenia is turning to open self-defense,'' Ms.
Shakhbazyan said.
   The 19-month-old feud between Armenians and neighboring
Azerbaijanis over control of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh
appeared to be only steps away from full-fledged civil war.
   Azerbaijan has put a stranglehold on the Armenian economy the
past two months by blocking much of the rail traffic intended for
Armenia, including food, fuel and building supplies for repairing
areas ravaged by the earthquake that killed 25,000 people in
December.
   The Soviet legislature ordered the blockade lifted last week,
but a top transport official said Wednesday trains still were
having trouble getting through Azerbaijan to Armenia.
   Railways Minister Nikolai Konarev said Azerbaijani nationalists
were ``still taking measures to prevent trains that carry food and
fuel from getting through. They sit down and lie down on the
tracks,'' and have women and children do the same, he said on
Soviet television.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has a predominantly Christian Armenian
population but was an enclave mostly of Moslem Azerbaijan until
February, when growing tensions prompted Moscow to impose direct
rule.
   The move failed to ease tensions, however. Nagorno-Karabakh is
plagued with frequent armed clashes, widespread work stoppages,
supply shortages and almost total blockage of its roads.
   Soviet troops have been stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh to try to
keep peace for the past year.
   Armenian speakers at Wednesday's rally said the troops
ineffective and ``there was an appeal to creat self-defense
units,'' said activist Mehat Gabrillian.
   Gabrillian said the meeting was called by 12 organizations that
consider themselves a type of ``pre-parliament'' in preparation for
Armenia's independence.
   In the lastest violence in Nagorno-Karabakh, firefighters shot
at a crowd of attackers Tuesday night and critically wounded at
least eight people, officials said.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri M. Arshenevsky said the cadets
were riding in 19 vehicles and crossing a bridge into Stepanakert,
the enclave's capital, when a mob began throwing stones and firing
on the passing column. He said the firefighters were forced to
shoot in self-defense.
   However, representatives of the group that has led the campaign
for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh said the crowd was not
violent.
   Ashot Manucharyan, an Armenian legislator from the region, said
in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the Karabakh
Committee in Yerevan that the civilians were attracted to the
bridge by warning shots fired into the air by the cadets. He said
one civilian was killed.
   Meanwhile, a Soviet government commission investigating the use
of military force to put down a peaceful nationalist demonstration
in the nearby republic of Georgia in April said the decision to
send in the troops was made in the Kremlin, according to Thursday
editions of The Washington Post.
   The Kremlin has said local authorities made the decision to use
troops and denied involvement. But the commission, appointed by
Georgia's legislature, disputed this, according to the Post.
   In the resulting clash in the Armenian capital of Tbilisi, 19
demonstrators were killed and hundreds injured by soldiers who
dispersed them with sharpened shovels, clubs and poison gas.
   The commission said Moscow was in constant communication with
Communist Party leaders in the area and was involved in an
operation that was ``of a punishing nature, having the appearance
of a deliberately planned slaughter of innocent people carried out
with extraordinary cruelty.''
   ``The principal blame is with the republic,'' the report said,
``but at the same time responsibility lies with officials of the
central organs of power.''
   The report said the final decision to allow the use of troops
was made by Viktor Chebrikov, former head of the KGB, and Dimitri
Yazov, the Soviet defense minister. It cast no direct blame on
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

who landed in the U.S.S.R. were just trying to get back to New York
City.
   ``Anything's possible,'' says Bill Knell, a local UFO researcher
who firmly believes there was an alien presence in a park in the
borough of Queens seven months ago. ``Absolutely, there was some
type of UFO in Kissena Park.''
   Knell's assertions _ he also said there may have been a return
visit two weeks ago _ came two days after the Soviet news agency
Tass reported the presence of ETs in the town of Voronezh.
   Since then, scientists have disparaged the report, attributing
it to rising sensationalism in the Soviet press under ``glasnost,''
or greater openness.
   Neither story seemed to impress local residents, who were more
concerned with Knell's presence in the park than any report of
visiting ETs.
   ``This is my haunt. I've been coming to this park for years, and
there's nothing going on here,'' said Julie Ford, shaking her head
and laughing. ``They say that tree there was burned by a UFO _ it
was broken by kids swinging on the branches.''
   Sure enough, Knell did offer the damaged willow as evidence that
something had beamed down there. But he also offered a
mineralogist's report that a burned oval on the ground contained
particles of a type of feldspar quartz found on the island of
Aruba, not in Queens.
   ``We find this amazing,'' said Knell, who was joined by several
other believers in UFOs.
   According to Knell, five people riding a bus on March 9 saw
``very bright lights'' hovering near a lake in the park. Since the
park is located between Kennedy and LaGuardia airports, they
initially thought it was a downed aircraft, said Knell.
   Based on their accounts and other evidence, Knell said, UFO
investigators determined this was a legitimate sighting.
   Knell thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in
Queens never saw aliens or spoke with them.
   ``I believe they have their own agenda, and at this time it
doesn't include communication,'' said Knell, who on Wednesday
addressed several skeptical reporters at the site where the UFO
allegedly burned the ground.
   Unfortunately, that's also the site where the remnants of a
downed tree were piled, killing off all the grass underneath, said
park maintenance man Joe Mackey, 60.
   ``If there was a spot around here burned out, I woulda known
about it,'' said Mackey, who spends three days a week in the park.
``It's a figment of somebody's imagination.''
   Perhaps, but Knell's not alone. Some residents of Mississippi's
Delta region say the Soviet description of a UFO is similar to a
fast-moving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month.
   Lee Abide Jr. said he first saw the object about three or four
months ago. He saw it again early Wednesday while on his way to
work at Abide Aero Flying Service about five miles south of
Greenville.
   ``And it didn't come out of a bottle of vodka,'' he said,
referring to some speculation about the Soviet witnesses.
   Bill Kimmel, a pilot, said he saw the object two days ago while
flying to Memphis, Tenn. He said it was round, metallic, kept
changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3,000 feet some
distance off his left wingtip.
   ``There was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon
can travel that fast,'' he said.

   Readers of the 1990 Guinness Book of World
Records will have plenty to cluck about besides the world's largest
rooster.
   John Steele of Banff, Scotland, says his rooster named Bruno
tipped the scales at a record 22 pounds, 1 ounce on July 4, 1989,
but an 11-foot-high hairdo and a first-rate chin-balancing act are
among the book's other tidbits.
   The book, which went on the market Wednesday, is ``exploding
with the most astounding facts of nature, human endurance
scientific achievement, entertainment, business and sports,'' the
Sterling Publishing Co. said in a statement.
   Take that beehive hairdo, for instance. Team Hairfax of Fairfax,
Calif., built it onto a wig. Wendy Villasenor walked around wearing
it _ in public _ on July 29, 1989, ``without the wig tilting or
falling,'' the book said.
   The chin-balancing record could escape even the greatest
scholars. But Guinness readers will know that Frank Charles
balanced 24 milk crates, weighing 74 pounds, on his chin for 19
seconds at Leyton, England, on July 30, 1988.
   ``More amazing information is packed into this exciting volume
than ever before, since more new records were set in the past year
than in any since the book was first published,'' said the
publisher.
   And if you can't cope with all that excitement, go to Boston _
the city most prolific in psychologists and psychiatrists, with
``one shrink per 328 heads.''

   Trinity Repertory Theater is counting
its pennies, especially the ones that some patrons handed over for
$24 tickets. But that's what theater officials expected when they
told people to pay what they wanted.
   ``We got everything from a penny a ticket to $20 a ticket'' at
Tuesday night's performance, spokeswoman Suzanne Fortier said
Wednesday.
   The only rule was that no one got in free.
   The audience of about 240 people for the performance of Maxim
Gorky's ``Summerfolk'' ranged ``from students to elderly from the
apartment up the street,'' Fortier said.
   The crowd was larger than expected for a weekday night preview
performance in the 550-seat theater, she said.
   Based on similar experiments in Baltimore and San Diego,
Trinity's managing director, E. Timothy Langan, said he expected
people would be willing to pay between $3 and $4. Fortier said most
people paid between $5 and $10.
   Langan said the theater had set aside $5,000 to cover the costs
of the experiment. The average cost to produce a play is $30 a
seat, he said.
   ``There are no guarantees, but we do intend to do it again''
depending on whether outside subsidies can be found, Fortier said.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Approves Bush Clean Air Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's clean air bill is advancing
through a House committee that once was a graveyard for air
pollution legislation, but the measure is saddled with a conflict
between top administration officials.
   Wednesday was a day of political triumph and confusion for the
Bush legislation, which was approved in modified form by the House
Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee, 21-0.
   Except for an acid rain bill passed by the panel in 1986, the
subcommittee has been deadlocked over clean air measures for a
decade while its two most powerful members fought over automobile
and utility emissions.
   This year, subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,
champion of strict controls on autos and industry, and Rep. John D.
Dingell, D-Mich., a friend of the auto industry, reached an
historic agreement on auto emissions that ensured action on the
legislation.
   The bill intended to clear the skies of urban smog, acid rain
and toxic chemicals by the end of the century moves on to the full
Energy and Commerce Committee _ possibly stopping first at another
subcommittee for a debate on acid rain.
   But just before the subcommittee vote Wednesday, the panel was
thrown into confusion by conflicting, nearly simultaneous
statements from administration officials on Bush's plan for some
cars to run on cleaner burning fuels than gasoline.
   The Bush clean fuels language was weakened by a 12-10 vote, with
the bill's chief sponsors and most panel Republicans supporting the
change backed by the oil and auto industries.
   Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu expressed the administration's neutrality on the clean fuels
amendment, which eliminated Bush's requirement that automakers
build a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels.
   Lent and Dingell, the chief co-sponsors, backed the change which
environmentalists said would weaken the legislation.
   But Waxman said he, too, was called about the same time by
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly.
According to Waxman, Reilly urged rejection of the amendment.
   ``I don't know where the administration is and it may be all
over the lot ... on both sides,'' Waxman said. ``It tells a lot
about how they're handling the bill.''
   A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, said after the vote, ``We
support the president's proposals on alternative fuels.''
   He said Sununu told Lent the administration wanted something
close to Bush's language, and suggested changes in the amendment to
that end. Lent never mentioned such changes during debate.
   The bill that passed the subcommittee considerably toughened
Bush's original auto emissions standards, thanks to the Oct. 3
Waxman-Dingell agreement to adopt nationwide California's
toughest-in-the-country auto tailpipe requirements.
   But panel members all agreed that there will be more harsh words
and vigorous debates as the bill advances through Congress. There
is disagreement over sharing the cost of acid rain reduction, a
dispute over permitting expansion of coal burning utilities and
argument over the severity of controls on chemical plants. Plus,
the clean fuels issue is certain to surface again.
   The Bush proposal would have required auto companies to build 1
million clean-fuel cars a year from 1997 through 2004 in the
nation's smoggiest cities. The new language, introduced by Reps.
Ralph Hall, D-Texas, and Jack Fields, R-Texas, would only require
auto companies to certify they could build the cars, but the
government would not order them built.
   Ron Sykes, a lobbyist for General Motors, said the carmakers
didn't like Bush's language because there was no guarantee
consumers would buy the alternative-fuel vehicles.
   The amendment also would define clean fuels as anything that
achieves the same pollution reductions as a mixture of 85 percent
methanol and 15 percent gasoline.
   The oil industry contended the Bush plan would give the EPA
strong authority to choose a fuel and that the agency favored
methanol. The oil industry argued that every clean-burning fuel
should have an equal chance to power America's future cars.

   A fear of being sued is causing doctors to
stop delivering babies, leaving impoverished women with poor
obstetrical care and contributing to an increase in infant
mortality, the Institute of Medicine says.
   ``Significant numbers'' of obstetricians, family physicians and
nurse-midwives now are limiting their practices because of frequent
malpractice lawsuits and sharply increasing insurance premiums, the
institute study committee reported Wednesday.
   ``The fear of being sued has caused many doctors and midwives to
limit care especially for women with high-risk pregnancies,'' said
Roger J. Bulger, chairman of the committee and president of the
Association of Academic Health Centers.
   ``In urban areas, this often means that low-income women have
been hurt the most by the lack of providers,'' he said, but noted
that there is a ``serious shortage of obstetrical care'' in both
rural and inner areas.
   He said health providers tend to avoid patients with high-risk
pregnancies. These most often are the impoverished because they
generally are more likely to smoke and have poor diets, both of
which increase the risks of having an imperfect child.
   One result, he said, is that the United States ranks 19th in the
world in infant mortality and, by some measures, the statistics f
infant death are getting worse.
   ``In 1985, infant mortality for blacks and other non-whites
actually increased for the first time in 20 years,'' said Bulger.
``While the causes for this increase are many, the inaccessibility
of care for poor women, a situation clearly made worse by liability
concerns, is an important factor.''
   The committee, which includes doctors, lawyers and educators,
suggested both short-term and long-term solutions. Immediate
actions recommended were:
   _State subsidies for medical liability premiums for obstetrical
providers who treat women on Medicaid.
   _Reviving the National Health Service Corps. This would provide
more loans for medical students who then would be obligated to
serve in areas where physicians are in short supply.
   For more permanent solutions, the committee recommended:
   _State experiments with alternatives to the system of medical
liability. Possible models could include a no-fault compensation
system for certain conditions, such as neurological impairment of a
newborn. Also suggested were negotiated contracts between doctor
and patient, and establishing in advance a system of binding
arbitration to settle disputes.
   _Consideration of a plan by the American Medical Association
that calls for an administrative processing of claims that would
determine fault, fix awards and discipline offenders.
   The committee found that legal claims against obstetricians run
two to three times higher than for other medical specialties, and
that juries are twice as likely to find for the plaintiff in cases
where an obstetrician is the defendant.
   ``It is easy to understand this situation, since most cases
involve brain-damaged infants whose parents generally are without
the resources to provide for a lifetime of complex health care,''
Bulger said.
   Malpractice insurance premiums for obstetrics in some cities now
exceed $100,000 a year _ and sometimes the pro-rated cost per
delivery is higher than the Medicaid reimbursement for a normal
delivery, the committee found.
   Members of the committee said they found a number of
misperceptions on the part of both patients and baby doctors.
   Dr. Arthur L. Herbst, chairman of the department of obstetrics
at the Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, said
many doctors mistakenly believe poor families are more apt to sue
if there is a poor result from childbirth.
   Another misperception, said Dr. Donald N. Medearis Jr.,
professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, is that
obstetricians are to blame for all of the mental retardation
problems that occur in newborns.
   ``We don't know what causes most mental retardation,'' he said.
   The committee said the number of obstetrical care providers in
rural areas has fallen by 20 percent over the last five years. In
some states, said Bulger, there are whole counties where there is
no obstetrical care available.
   Doctors' fear of liability is also contributing to an increase
in the number of babies delivered by cesarean section, Herbst said.
The committee said that 20 years ago, only one in 20 babies was
delivered by the surgical procedure, but the rate in some areas now
is one in four babies.
   The Institute of Medicine is chartered by the National Academy
of Sciences. It is a private organization that acts as an advisor
to the federal government and initiates research of its own.

<HEAD>US Asks Italy to Investigate Alleged Computer Sale to Soviets</HEAD>

   The United States is asking Italy to
investigate allegations that an Italian company violated Western
export control rules and sold the Soviet Union computer equipment
used to manufacture a highly sophisticated jetfighter.
   The U.S. case regarding the Italian Olivetti company, which
officials say is based on intelligence information, was brought up
Wednesday at a White House meeting between President Bush and
Italian President Francesco Cossiga.
   ``The President did mention the concern about the Olivetti case.
And President Cossiga stressed that this was being pursued in ... a
highly cooperative manner,'' said Assistant Secretary of State
Raymond Seitz, briefing reporters about Cossiga's talks with Bush.
   The United States notified Italy earlier this month that
Olivetti, one of Europe's largest computer companies, was suspected
of violating rules set by the 17-nation Coordinating Committee of
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), said Italian Foreign Minister
Gianni De Michelis.
   He said Italy was investigating the information and would inform
the United States of the results at a meeting Oct. 22 in Rome with
Reginald Bartholomew, assistant secretary of state for science and
technology.
   In Rome, Premier Giulio Andreotti met for about an hour
Wednesday with Olivetti's Carlo De Benedetti. Neither made any
statements at the end of the meeting, although Olivetti has issued
a statement denying any violation of COCOM rules and contending the
products in question were shipped to the Soviet Union with COCOM
authorization.
   U.S. and Italian officials have refused to publicly discuss
details of the case, which involves one of the most powerful
companies in Europe and sensitive intelligence information about
Soviet weaponry.
   But an American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Olivetti was suspected of selling the Soviets machine tools
and computer software which were used to manufacture components for
the YAK-41 supersonic jetfighter. The highly sophisticated plane is
capable of taking off vertically.
   Another official said the sales had been going on for several
years, and involved ``less than $50 million.''
   Members of COCOM, which regulates the sale of high-technology to
communist countries, have differed in recent years regarding sales
of so-called ``dual use'' technology, which can be converted to
manufacture weapons.
   The most famous case of such a COCOM rule violation involved the
sale of computerized milling equipment by the Japanese Toshiba
electronics firm and the Norwegian state-owned Kongsberg
conglomerate to the Soviets. The equipment was used by the Soviets
to make silent propellers for submarines, making them harder for
the West to detect.
   As a result, Congress passed legislation last year empowering
the administration to impose sanctions, including import bans,
against companies found in violation of COCOM.
   De Michelis sought to play down the Olivetti case, saying he had
only discussed the matter for ``25 seconds'' with Bartholomew
Wednesday.
   De Michelis stressed that the main thrust of the Cossiga talks
with Bush was prospects for peace in the Middle East, the upcoming
elections in Nicaragua and, above all, the reforms in Eastern
Europe.
   Seitz told reporters Bush and Cossiga ``waxed philosophical
about East-West issues and the importance of defense throughout
this period of change in Europe.''
   Bush ``stressed how in these times of transition and uncertainty
and, in some instances, unrest, that the hope not precede the deed
and that the importance of a strong defense, a continuing defense,
a steady approach, a long-term approach cannot be understated.''
   Later at a state dinner Bush hosted in Cossiga's honor at the
White House, the American president lauded the friendship between
Italy and the United States, saying the ties have ``never been
stronger.''

   Looking for a different worship experience?
Consider ``Our Lady of Exxon,'' a local Methodist church where you
can drive in for gasoline and a lube job, then walk upstairs for
some fire and brimstone.
   And if you don't think God is watching, be forewarned that CIA
spooks might be peering down from their shuttered office windows
next door.
   For 17 years, the white steeple of Arlington Temple Methodist
Church has towered over a busy intersection in the heart of this
high-rise hotel and office building suburb just across the Potomac
River from Washington.
   Thousands of neighboring office workers have given the Arlington
Temple its irreverent nickname because of the red, white and blue
Exxon signs that beckon motorists to the gas pumps on the open-air
ground floor beneath the church.
   As far as anyone knows, Arlington Temple is the only combination
church and filling station in the country, the result of a deal
between a local businessman and a minister searching for a place to
house his congregation.
   In the early 1960s, when developers began razing Rosslyn's
taverns, pawn shops and decaying homes, William P. Ames decided to
build a hotel on part of his lumber yard and donate another parcel
for a church in his father's memory.
   But first, Ames had to relocate a gas station sitting on a
corner of his property. Along came the Rev. James L. Robertson,
whose flock had been worshiping in hotels, a school and a
carpenter's shop.
   The pastor wanted to build a ``church of the marketplace in the
concrete jungle of Rosslyn,'' a place where ``bishop or bum, rich
or pauper, influential or nameless'' could find a spiritual home.
   Under their deal, Ames donated the land for the new church, and
Robertson agreed to rent the ground floorto the gas station.
Arlington Temple was completed in 1972 at a cost of $750,000. The
mortgage was paid off last year, thanks partly to the $18,000 in
annual rent from Exxon.
   Today, the Rev. Jack Sawyer and station operator Larry Hamblett
are close pals and partners of sorts, as Hamblett puts a tiger in
his customers' tanks and Sawyer pumps his message of salvation for
the soul. The CIA recruiting office in the 12-story building next
door keeps its business to itself.
   During the gasoline crunch in the 1970s, Hamblett opened his
station for an hour after Sunday services so elderly parishioners
could fill up without waiting in long lines. Sawyer exchanged his
black robes for a pair of overalls to help Hamblett pump gas.
   Sawyer says he can always borrow a few dollars from Hamblett to
help a family in distress, and Hamblett volunteers as Santa Claus
for church Christmas festivities. After years of standing at the
church's rear door, observing Sunday services in grease-stained
denims, Hamblett recently became a formal member of Arlington
Temple with his family.
   ``Jack's a really great guy,'' Hamblett says. ``I wouldn't be in
business without him.''
   Hamblett explains that some of his customers have gotten nasty
since the Exxon oil spill in Alaska. They've spit in his face and
threatened to pour motor oil in his fish tank.
   ``I can go upstairs and talk to Jack for five minutes and feel
all is right with the world again,'' he said.
   Hamblett unwittingly provided the sound effects for a Saturday
wedding ceremony that Sawyer conducted a few years ago.
   Just as Sawyer uttered the words, ``Let them speak now or
forever hold their peace,'' Hamblett revved his drag racing car's
3,000-horsepower engine in the garage below. A deafening roar
filled the sanctuary, penetrating 18-inch walls and floors of
reinforced steel and concrete that are designed to shut out noise.
   ``It actually vibrated the whole building,'' Sawyer recalled.
``The groom sort of went into mild shock. I sent a minister friend
downstairs to tell Larry to turn it off, and told the congregation
`that was not an objection.'''
   Hamblett says he learned his lesson. ``If I hear organ music, I
try to keep the noise down,'' he says.

   The United States has more than 20 million
Hispanic residents, the Census Bureau reports, meaning only five
other countries have larger Latin American populations.
   ``This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' Jorge Del
Pinal, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at the
bureau, said Wednesday. ``It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.''
   Brazil has the largest Latin American population at more than
147 million people.
   The only other countries in this hemisphere with more Hispanics
than the United States are: Mexico with 86.7 million; Argentina,
31.9 million; Colombia, 31.2 million and Peru, 21.4 million.
   The new Census analysis showed that as of last March Hispanics
constituted 8.2 percent of the U.S. population and are the fastest
growing large population group.
   The bureau said immigration accounted for about half the growth.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in
just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by
Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.
   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New
Mexico and Colorado, the bureau reported.
   Estimates are not prepared for every state because ``Hispanics
are not well spread out throughout the United States,'' Del Pinal
said.
   The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
United States at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a year
earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000, Puerto
Ricans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   Mexicans were mostly concentrated in Texas and California, the
report said. Cubans are mostly in Florida, while Puerto Ricans tend
to live in New York, and Central and South Americans are largely in
California and New York.
   While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest
growing, the report said.
   Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau said
Central and South Americans had increased by 67 percent. The
``other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans,
up 30 percent, Puerto Ricans, 14 percent and Cubans, 12 percent.

   Three sisters got an unexpected
delivery from the pizza man who had accidentally ran over the
family dog: a fluffy, white puppy to help make up for the loss.
   ``I was in tears,'' said the girls' mother, Julie Mendyk. ``I
couldn't believe he did something like that. It restored my faith
in young people.''
   Brett Croner, 20, accidently killed the first dog during a
Saturday night run for Pizza Hut.
   Croner said he knew how the girls felt because his own dog was
killed by a car last spring.
   ``To lose one is to lose a part of yourself,'' he said.
   Mrs. Mendyk said her daughters, Rachel, 8, Sara, 9, and
Jennifer, 12, were all smiles when Croner brought the new dog
Sunday afternoon.
   She said Croner had stopped and apologized to the family on the
night of the accident, but she told him it wasn't his fault because
the 3-year-old dog, Sandy, was chasing a cat.
   ``I've had people get more upset about me dropping a pizza than
me running over their dog,'' Croner said.
   Still, Croner said he was determined to help ease the girls'
pain. After looking at about eight or nine different pups, he found
a mixed-breed, female dog that looked like Sandy.
   He left the puppy at the door of the Mendyks' house with a note
that read, ``Please accept this puppy as my apology.''
   Mrs. Mendyk said the girls have named the 6-week-old dog Brett.

   A $3 billion U.S. arms purchase by Saudi
Arabia faces little apparent opposition from Israel's supporters on
Capitol Hill.
   The Bush administration on Wednesday informally notified
Congress of the intended sale. That touched off a 50-day period in
which Congress either kills the deal by majority votes in the
Senate and House or lets it go through.
   The key items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the price
tag _ which is equivalent to a year's U.S. aid to Israel _ is the
cost of equipment and ammunition, including huge trucks to
transport any tanks that break down.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said more than two dozen members of
Congress had written to Secretary of State James A. Baker III
requesting ``additional consultation.''
   But before notifying Congress of the plan, Baker and other
administration officials held several sessions designed to gauge
congressional sentiment.
   ``We intend to have a full hearing,'' Smith said.
   Yet, the congressman added in an interview: ``I don't think
anyone is inclined yet to file a resolution of disapproval. We want
to be sure these tanks are not used by anyone else in the region.''
   Political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse the
concerns that customarily touch off strong opposition on Capitol
Hill to U.S. deals with Arab countries technically at war with
Israel.
   The Saudis would receive the M1A2 tanks beginning in the middle
of the 1990s, at about the same time the U.S. Army would field
them. Israel has a comparable tank, the Merkava.
   To smooth congressional approval, the Bush administration agreed
not to equip the Saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor, a much
denser metal than steel.
   It was not immediately clear where the tanks would be based.
   If some are deployed at the Tabuk military base the tanks would
be only 120 miles from Israel. Others may be based near Kuwait, and
still others at an armored training school near Mecca.
   In a separate deal, Israel is to receive $100 million in U.S.
payments for the pre-positioning of American military equipment.
The arms presumably would be used in the event of a Mideast war
that threatened U.S. security.
   Next year, Saudi Arabia is expected to try to purchase American
jet fighter planes. The purchase of U.S. tanks to replace
15-year-old and largely inoperable French tanks is considered a
warm-up test of congressional sentiment.
   Asked why Israel's supporters had not launched a fight against
the sale, a local military expert said the administration consulted
in advance with members of Congress and ``an effort is under way to
avoid a confrontation.''
   ``Besides, the tanks are a ground system, having a marginal
effect on Israel's security,'' said the non-governmental expert,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Administration officials have stressed in recent weeks the U.S.
commitment to make sure Israel maintains a qualitative edge over
Arab armed forces.
   The Saudi tanks will be equipped with special viewers for the
commanders and with night-fighting capability. Also, they will have
no electronics. ``It is the most advanced version of the tank that
has been put out to date,'' the expert said.
   Last year, the Reagan administration signed a deal with Egypt
for the manufacture of 555 tanks for the Egyptian army.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler declined to
discuss the purchase except to say Congress had been informally
notified of the administration's intention.
   The purchase was designed initially as a goodwill gesture for a
visit by King Fahd. But twice this summer the Saudi monarch
canceled trips to Washington with the explanation his government
was engaged in trying to arrange a cease-fire in Lebanon between
warring Christian and Moslem factions.
   Congress over the years has turned back several U.S. arms sales
to Arab countries out of concern for Israel's security.

<HEAD>Zsa Zsa Outdraws Pierce, Frank in Public Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five Americans know why Zsa Zsa
Gabor has been in the news lately, but only about one in 10 can
identify Samuel Pierce or Barney Frank without help, according to a
news industry survey.
   The survey, released Wednesday by the Times Mirror Center for
the People &amp; the Press, showed that Washington news gets a low
rating when people are asked what stories they are following very
closely.
   Stories about Frank, a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts
who has admitted having sex with a male prostitute and then hiring
him as a personal aide and driver, were followed by only 6 percent
of those surveyed.
   This made the Frank affair one of the lowest-interest stories
since the surveys began in 1986, equaled only by the
influence-peddling scandal that drove former Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita from office in May.
   Only 12 percent of the 1,234 adults interviewed by telephone
correctly identified Frank.
   Ten percent knew that Pierce was the former housing secretary
whose administration of rental subsidy programs for the poor is
under investigation by Congress.
   But 80 percent knew that Ms. Gabor was tried in Beverly Hills,
Calif., on charges of slapping a policeman. The survey was
conducted Oct. 5-8, a week after the actress was convicted.
   The most closely followed story in the survey was Hurricane
Hugo, with 60 percent saying they kept up with developments closely.
   This made it the third-ranking story in public interest since
the surveys began, exceeded only by the 1986 Challenger space craft
explosion at 80 percent and the rescue of young Jessica McClure
from a Texas well in 1987, which 69 percent said they kept up on.
   Times Mirror said in a news release that the difference in
public response to the Frank and Hugo stories ``is in keeping with
a pattern that has become clear from the monthly findings of the
Times Mirror News Interest Index. Public attentiveness to coverage
of news events is high, while public attentiveness to news about
most personal scandals is usually low.''
   Times Mirror also said its October findings ``dramatically
reinforced'' previous indications that news from Washington, even
when it has far-reaching consequences, often gets little attention.
   No major Washington story in the latest survey was followed
closely by as many as 25 percent of Americans. The most closely
followed Washington story in the history of the surveys was the
Supreme Court decision in July upholding a Texas law against
burning the American flag. It was followed closely by 51 percent of
those surveyed.
   Overseas stories often get a low rating also. The elevation of
the once-outlawed Solidarity Union to a role in governing Poland,
for instance, was followed closely by only 12 percent of those
surveyed in July.
   In the latest count even interest in overseas events, such as
the flight of East German refugees to West Germany at 31 percent
and the failed coup attempt in Panama at 29 percent, outdrew
Washington stories.
   Only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in Congress to
repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan. Among persons
over age 50, this rose to 36.
   House approval of a cut in the capital gains tax drew close
attention from 14 percent. Among people with family incomes of
$50,000 or more, this increased to 26 percent.
   The study was conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the
People &amp; the Press, a division of The Times Mirror Company, which
publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, the Baltimore Sun, the
Hartford Courant and other newspapers and owns broadcast stations.
   The center said the study was subject to a 3 percent sampling
error.

   A year ago Saturday, members of a
religious group brought the body of an 8-year-old girl to a rural
fire station. The death of Dayna Broussard set off a child abuse
investigation that is far from over.
   The next night, 53 Ecclesia Athletic Association children were
taken into state custody. Today, 40 remain in foster homes because
their parents won't agree to conditions set by the state Children's
Services Division.
   ``I think this is the only time in America that so many children
have been taken into care on such a crisis basis under such
horrible circumstances,'' said Bill Thomas, the agency
administrator.
   Parents of the children live at a farmhouse near Sandy, east of
Portland, where the youngsters were rounded up by state officials
12 months ago. State officials want the adults to admit their
children were victims of abuse and to promise that they won't be
abused again.
   ``We're still working with their parents,'' Thomas said. ``We
would like very much to make the kind of commitment that we in
Oregon need to hear so their children can be safe.''
   One parent they haven't worked with is Dayna's father, Eldridge
Broussard Jr., the founder of Ecclesia. State officials believe he
is in Oregon, but his whereabouts could not be determined this week.
   A telephone call to Ecclesia officials for comment was not
returned.
   On Wednesday, the state officials held a news conference at the
juvenile detention center where the children were taken on Oct. 14,
1988.
   ``Why we are here today is to remember Dayna Broussard and ...
to remember that Dayna did not die accidentally. Dayna was
brutally, ceaselessly, needlessly beaten to death,'' Thomas said.
   Four adult Ecclesia members were convicted of manslaughter. A
fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment in connection
with other beatings of children.
   Several children testified at the trial that they were
systematically beaten as part of the group's tough discipline.
   They said that Dayna was beaten with an electrical cord, rubber
hose, piece of plastic pipe and weightlifting belt as the other
children were forced to watch and count the blows.
   Eldridge Broussard Jr. appeared on the ``Oprah Winfrey Show''
after the arrests of Ecclesia members and blamed the media's
negative publicity about the group for his daughter's death.
   Broussard, a former college basketball player, founded Ecclesia
in 1975 at the Watts Christian Center in Los Angeles to steer
children away from drugs and crime. He motivated them through
discipline and athletics, saying once he wanted to prepare them to
compete in the Olympics.
   The group came to Oregon in the summer of 1987 and announced
plans to cultivate crops and train children for athletic
competition.
   Since the manslaughter convictions of his associates, Broussard,
who was not charged, has kept a low profile.
   ``He's not had any contact with the caseworker for his family.
He hasn't had any contact with me. He hasn't appeared in court
hearings. He hasn't been involved in any of the meetings or
contacts that we've had,'' said Bart Wilson, Clackamas County
branch manager for the children's services agency.
   Broussard's four surviving children are in state custody. He
hasn't seen them; his wife has, Wilson said.
   The state has spent $545,000 on the case as of July, and
continues to spend about $10,000 per month for foster care.
   Of the 53 children taken by the state, two were returned to the
custody of their parents, while 11 others remain under state
jurisdiction but live with relatives.
   The 40 in foster homes are impatient to reunite with their
parents.
   ``A year to you and I is 10 years to a kid,'' said caseworker
Jerry Huntley. ``No one can tell them what will happen tomorrow and
that's really difficult for them.''

<HEAD>Noriega: U.S. Recruited, Paid Junior Officers to Launch Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian officers who led last week's
abortive coup were recruited and paid more than $1 million by the
U.S. government, Gen. Manuel Noriega charged in an interview.
   The Panamanian leader also alleged that Panamanian businessmen
and Nicaraguan Contras served as messengers for U.S. officials,
relaying messages between the United States and the plotters, the
Los Angeles Times reported in Thursday's editions.
   ``The United States was involved before, during and after the
coup,'' Noriega said. ``They had to make the contacts, woo them,
convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish.
But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.''
   ``The Contras put them the coup plotters in contact with the
United States,'' Noriega said.
   Noriega said that an investigation following the uprising
revealed the existence of a bank account in the name of Capt. Erick
A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders, containing more than
$1 million.
   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Six
zeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' Noriega said.
   He charged that U.S. officials gave Murillo the money for
bribes, but would not identify the bank that held the account.
   Murillo, a member of the elite Battalion 2000, was one of 10
officers the Panamanian government said was killed during the coup
attempt.
   While government reports have said 37 soldiers were detained
following the attempt, Noriega said 77 have been.
   Noriega also said that one of the detained rebels had $700,000
in cash that he had been using to bribe the troops. He refused to
identify the soldier but said he is still in custody.
   The coup was masterminded by 17 members of the Panama Defense
Forces, Noriega said.
   Noriega also accused National Security Council member Everett E.
Briggs of involvement in the conspiracy, because Briggs visited the
country shortly before the uprising. Briggs served as ambassador to
Panama and then as ambassador to Honduras, where the Nicaraguan
rebels were based.
   There was no immediate comment from Briggs or an NSC spokesman
in the newspaper's account.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega changed
the rules of the barracks when he snuffed out the second military
attempt to topple him in 18 months. Now it's kill or be killed.
   ``I think the law of the jungle is now the rule within the
military,'' opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said in an
interview.
   When rebellious officers tried to overthrow Noriega in March
1988, the coup attempt was played by the old rules of Defense
Forces power struggles. It was bloodless.
   But the Oct. 3 barracks uprising, which showed Noriega's hold on
power was more precarious than previously thought, may have ended
with the summary execution of several mutineers. Top members of his
general staff were arrested, and their whereabouts or condition is
unknown.
   ``In military life, he who takes up arms in rebellion has his
answer in arms, too,'' Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, a member of the
general staff, said Wednesday.
   Noriega is accused of personally shooting the coup leader, Maj.
Moises Giroldi, who was credited with putting down the March 1988
revolt.
   The Defense Forces say Giroldi was killed by an artillery blast.
However, the family said three bullet wounds were found in his body.
   At least seven other officers and two sergeants also died,
possibly after surrendering.
   Capt. Leon Tejada was shot once in the right temple, his mother
said.
   Another officer, Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo, died in custody several
days after the uprising. The Defense Forces has offered no
explanation for what the coroner called ``death by asphyxiation.''
   Neither the whereabouts or condition of 36 other rebel soldiers
on the Defense Forces list of detainees is known.
   ``I am afraid other prisoners are dead,'' Roman Catholic Rev.
Francisco Guardia said as he prepared to say a funeral Mass for
Lorenzo earlier this week.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela on Tuesday accused
the Defense Forces of murder and called for Latin America to take
strong action against Noriega.
   The rebels stopped short of killing Noriega when he was a
hostage; U.S. officials say the rebels wouldn't even agree to turn
Noriega over to the United States for prosecution on drug charges.
Instead, Giroldi and his men surrendered.
   The Oct. 3 rebels hesitated and died for it. Now that Noriega
has rewritten the rules, few expect to see the mistake repeated.
   ``I think he's bringing upon himself greater opposition and more
violent opposition,'' Arias Calderon said. ``Noriega is much weaker
because he has brought violence and death into the center of his
power.''
   Panama has lived with military strongmen for 21 years but even
the 1968 coup in which the late Gen. Omar Torrijos took power was
bloodless. The country had not experienced the kind of
political-military violence that has traumatized neighbors such as
Colombia or El Salvador.
   Until now.
   Noriega, a Torrijos protege without the Torrijos charisma, has
become increasingly volatile since his February 1988 indictment in
the United States on drug-trafficking charges. Noriega denies guilt.
   Once admired for the sheer force of his personality, the general
now commands through fear.
   ``He is a beast,'' one coup participant said after reaching the
United States.
   ``He has established a new rule of the game,'' said Arias
Calderon. ``Kill or be killed.''
   The Oct. 3 uprising not only exposed deep discontent at the
highest levels of the 15,000-person Defense Forces, its bloody
ending also left Noriega isolated.
   Three members of Noriega's general staff, including the head of
military intelligence, were among those arrested after the mutiny.
Key units, such as the one responsible for security at Defense
Forces headquarters, were involved.
   Three colonels, two majors, three captains and nineteen
lieutenants are on the Defense Forces list of detainees and another
captain and 41 other people fled to the United States after the
coup failed.
   The revolt has sparked the largest shuffling of commanders in
Defense Forces history. The internal purges leave Noriega with an
officer corps stripped of many of its most professional leaders,
sources say.
   The Defense Forces denies Noriega personally killed any
mutineers. They say all the victims died during the fighting.
   At the same time, some clear, even clumsy, messages are being
sent.
   Several days after the uprising, the pro-Noriega newspaper
Critica ran a story about a 1987 coup attempt in distant Sierra
Leone on its front page under a thick red headline.
   ``Six People Executed For a Coup Attempt,'' it said.

   But when Robinson, 35, took the bus to work Wednesday, she saw a

<HEAD>Former President and Falklands War Leader Freed from Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Leopoldo
Galtieri, who led Argentina into the 1982 Falklands War and was
imprisoned for negligence in its defeat, has been freed by
presidential pardon.
   Galtieri said nothing to reporters on his release Wednesday from
Campo de Mayo army base on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
   Galtieri, 63, was one of 39 retired generals and admirals
pardoned Saturday by President Carlos Menem along with dozens of
people accused of being leftist terrorists and 174 soldiers who
rebelled against the former government.
   Galtieri's pardon also voids pending charges against him in
civilian court of human rights abuses.
   Menem, who took office July 8, said the pardon was needed ``to
close and stitch the wounds'' of the past so the South American
country of 32 million people might concentrate on its economic
problems.
   He said a second pardon is pending that will free Mario
Firmenich, co-founder of the Montonero urban guerrillas, and six
officers convicted of kidnap, torture and murder during the
military dictatorship's 1976-83 crackdown on leftist subversion.
   The officers include Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, both former
presidents and former army commanders-in-chief.
   Galtieri was president from December 1981 to June 1982. The
Supreme Council of the Armed Forces convicted him of negligence in
May 1986 for his handling of the 74-day Falklands War against
Britain, which Argentina lost _ a loss that led to the end of the
military junta and 1983 election of a civilian goverment.
   Galtieri began the war on April 2, 1982, to recover the South
Atlantic islands held by Britain and claimed by Argentina since the
early 19th century.
   The military's highest tribunal ruled that he did not anticipate
or prepare for a British counterattack, nor was Argentina's defense
of the islands properly coordinated.
   Galtieri also had faced federal court charges in the shooting
deaths of 13 political prisoners in December 1976, nine months
after President Isabel Peron was ousted in a coup and the new
military regime stepped up its crackdown on subversion.
   Rights groups oppose Menem's pardon and plan to challenge its
constitutionality in court.
   The Roman Catholic Church, major newspapers, two of the three
largest political parties, and influential business and farm
organizations endorsed the pardon and indicated they would support
its extension to Videla, Viola and Firmenich.
   At least 8,960 purported leftists were arrested and never seen
again _ presumed executed _ during the ``dirty war'' against
subversion, a presidential commission found. Some rights groups put
the total closer to 30,000.
   The armed forces insists it quelled an armed insurrection by
using the same tactics as guerrillas.

<HEAD>Study Critical of Surgery for Small Abdominal Aneurysms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large bulges in the main blood vessel in the
abdomen should be repaired because they are likely to burst, but
most small ones do not require routine surgery, a study published
today concludes.
   These balloon-like bulges, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms,
are being increasingly spotted as people undergo ultrasound tests
to check for other problems, such as gallstones and cancer.
   About 40,000 Americans have surgery to repair these aneurysms
each year, but some doubt lingers about whether smaller aneuryisms
can be safely ignored. When the aneurysms break, massive bleeding
may result, and about half of all such victims die.
   The latest study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that most
abdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones pose
little risk of rupture.
   ``Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be
routinely repaired,'' said Dr. John W. Hallett Jr., senior author
of the study. ``Their repair should be individualized.''
   He said that in some cases, repair of small aneurysms may be
considered reasonable, such as when patients suffer painful
symptoms or have other blood vessel disease. Overall, he estimated
that surgery is appropriate for about one-third of patients with
small abdominal aneurysms under 5 centimeters in size.
   For the rest, he recommended that doctors follow patients with
exams every three to six months.
   The latest study, based on a survey 370 aneurysm patients in
Rochester, Minn., was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Hallett said some surgeons recommend fixing all aneurysms
because of the belief that they will eventually expand and rupture.
However, several vascular surgeons said they are very selective and
limit routine surgery to patients with aneurysms larger than 4 or 5
centimeters.
   ``I don't think anybody has evidence that aneurysm surgery is
overused,'' said Dr. William Abbott of Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``I do exactly as they say. I am quite aggressive with
aneurysms over 5 centimeters and very selective on something that's
smaller. I don't think this will blow the medical profession away.''
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. E. Stanley
Crawford of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recommended
surgery for aneurysms larger than 4 centimeters. He questioned the
selection and diagnosis of patients in the study and said he does
not believe it accurately reflects the natural course of aneurysms.
   In the study, doctors concluded that the risk of rupture after
eight years was 25 percent in people with aneurysms larger than 5
centimeters, 5 percent in those with aneurysms between 3.5 and 5
centimeters and zero in people with aneurysms smaller than 3.5
centimeters.

<HEAD>Tensions Mount Amid Talk Of Gang Offering Bounty On Police Officers'

   Police filed in for roll call as usual, but this
day they were told the neighborhood stakes had gone up: A street
gang had put a $1,000 bounty on their heads.
   It might just be talk, police spokesman Jim Jordan said, but the
talk's been persistent _ so much so that commanding officers felt
they had to warn patrol units before they went out on the streets
Tuesday evening.
   ``We happen to think a police officer's life is priceless, so we
reject any street criminal trying to put some value on it,'' Jordan
said Wednesday.
   Word of the Franklin Hill Giants gang's bounty has spread
quickly through the streets of the Roxbury, Mattapan and Dorchester
sections, Jordan said, ``and people in the community feel a
repugnance at the notion.''
   But residents become equally alarmed when one of their own is
shot under murky circumstances, which is what happened several
hours after Tuesday's roll call.
   Orlando Carr, 30, was stopped for a search by two officers, one
of whom opened fire when he mistook a set of keys for a gun. He was
listed as stable Wednesday at Boston City Hospital.
   Deputy Superintendent William Celester said the officer saw
something shiny and ``feared for his life.'' Some residents see
things differently.
   ``I'm just as concerned about criminal elements as anyone in the
community,'' said Juanita Wade, a Boston School Committee member
and Roxbury resident. ``But it's a double-edged sword.
   ``You want to make sure that gang members participating in
violent activity are stopped or removed from the streets, but you
also want to make sure there's no abuse of that power.''
   Carr's cousin Marva Carr said Tuesday night's shooting was an
example of abuse. She said Carr had perhaps become a victim of
rumor.
   ``Maybe someone on the street said something about (a bounty),
but it's the first time I've heard of it,'' she said. ``I'm on the
street every day. I hang on the street and I don't know why I
wouldn't have heard of this.''
   Nonetheless, violence against police officers has increased: A
motorcycle officer was the target of a group throwing stones the
night Carr was shot, and at least three police cruisers have come
under gunfire during the last 1{ weeks, Jordan said.
   ``We're putting (reports of a bounty) together with other things
that have been taking place,'' he said.
   Ralph Agee, assistant executive director at the Roxbury
Multi-Service Center, said he hadn't noticed a huge increase in
tension on the streets, ``but it may be that people have just begun
to accept the tension.''
   Charles C. Yancey, a city councilor who represents Mattapan and
Dorchester, said officers live with daily dangers and word of a
bounty could heighten their fears to the peril of all.
   ``If they feel there are people out to kill them then they're
going to act in a manner that would consider self-preservation
first,'' Yancey said. ``And if these rumors have no basis in fact,
then a great disservice is being done not only to the police
officers but to the community itself.''

   Three weeks after Hurricane Hugo ripped
ashore, this inland city remains a ``silent victim,'' so littered
with downed magnolias and willow oaks that officials are urging
parents to keep children at home on Halloween.
   ``From an airplane, it looks like a forest that got hit by a
hurricane,'' said Don Steger, an assistant city manager who was in
charge of emergency operations after Hugo hit in the predawn hours
of Sept. 22.
   Residents like to brag about Charlotte's picturesque tree-lined
streets. Hundred-foot-tall willow oaks form a canopy over
residential areas surrounding the business district. Pine, magnolia
and hickory trees also were popular.
   But Hugo's blast changed the landscape, sending trees crashing
down through power lines and against homes, and leaving many
streets blocked. Today, debris is piled so high that some houses
are virtually hidden, and stumps the size of pickup trucks offer a
formidible challenge.
   City officials, worried at the thought of trick-or-treaters
strolling through the streets to avoid debris, want parents to keep
their children at home on Halloween.
   ``I'm scared to death a kid is going to get killed,'' Mayor Sue
Myrick said.
   City arborist Don McSween said Charlotte lost only 1 or 2
percent of its trees, although in older, residential areas near the
heart of the city, ``it was closer to 100 percent.''
   The toll is likely to grow as damaged but still-standing trees
begin to suffer.
   ``A lot of the trees have had their lives shortened as a result
of the storm,'' McSween said. ``Many will die over the next few
years from decay and disease.''
   ``Charlotte was the silent victim,'' Steger said, referring to
the national coverage of the devastation in Charleston, S.C. ``One
certainly didn't expect a city 200 miles from the ocean to suffer
this kind of damage.''
   Unlike the Charleston area, where the hurricane made landfall
with 135 mph winds, hardly anyone in Charlotte was left homeless.
By the time Hugo's eye passed just west of downtown, it had been
downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph and
gusts up to 90 mph.
   Still, the storm has been blamed for three deaths and caused
more than $300 million in damage in the Charlotte area.
   By the end of the month, contracts will be awarded to remove
200,000 truckloads of debris left by the storm _ enough to fill a
60-story skyscraper three or four times. City crews, which already
have carted away 15,000 truckloads, have been instructed to stop so
the federal government will pick up most of the $10 million cleanup
tab.
   Officials say it will take until March to haul away all the
debris.
   ``You can't walk on the sidewalk to catch the bus,'' said Mike
Gardner, who is waiting for estimates on damage to his house from
four downed pines.
   His wife, Susan, was concerned about the safety of their two
young children.
   ``You can't very well send them out to play,'' she said. ``They
would have to ride their bikes in the middle of the road. That's
too hazardous.''
   The storm also disrupted political life, forcing the city to
postpone its mayoral primary by two weeks. Myrick easily won
Tuesday's Republican primary, but only about 7{ percent of
registered voters turned out.
   Still, life is beginning to return to normal. As of Wednesday,
only about 50 homes remained without power.
   That compares with the morning of the storm, when Duke Power Co.
said nearly 100 percent of its 235,000 customers lost power. About
one of every two homes remained dark for a week or more.
   Homeowners are concentrating on repairing broken roofs, porches
and fences, although in some cases it takes a week or more just to
get estimates.
   One fence company said it has received 900 calls. Allstate
Insurance Co., anticipating 15,000 to 20,000 claims in Charlotte
alone, dispatched dozens of adjusters to the area.
   One family left a note of thanks on one of the few trees
remaining on their yard.
   ``We thank all those:
   _ out-of-town power company workers.
   _ Duke Power.
   _ city workers.
   _ phone company.
   _ paper carriers, letter carriers, police and fire departments.''
   Scribbled on the note was a P.S. _ ``We're alive!''

<HEAD>Inspector General: Investigators Conducted `Thorough' Criminal Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's inspector general says the Navy
properly investigated allegations of homosexuality involving USS
Iowa sailors Clayton Hartwig and Kendall Truitt during its criminal
probe of the explosion on the battleship.
   ``The Naval Investigative Service did not malign the character
of Hartwig or Truitt,'' Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said in
a report released Wednesday.
   Ms. Brown reviewed the investigation after allegations from
Truitt and Hartwig's family that the Naval Investigative Service
mishandled their duties and leaked damaging allegations to the news
media. But Ms. Brown concluded that the Navy conducted a thorough
criminal probe of the April 19 explosion that killed 47 crewmen,
including Hartwig.
   Her conclusions were sharply disputed by Ellis Rubin, the
attorney for Truitt, who called the report ``a perfect example of
one branch of the government covering up and whitewashing another
branch of the government. This whole Iowa investigation has been
one Watergate piled on top of another.''
   NIS investigators were brought in to assist Rear Adm. Richard
Milligan after suspicions of possible suicide or homicide arose.
   Milligan cited Hartwig as the most likely person to have caused
the explosion, saying he apparently placed some type of detonator
between gun powder bags. He concluded Truitt, who survived the
blast in the lowest level of the gun turret, had no link to its
cause.
   Ms. Brown review found ``the NIS investigation was thorough,
complete and expeditious,'' and that it was proper for special
agents to investigate allegations of possible homosexuality in the
case, even though no such activity was ever proven.
   Hartwig's family has charged the Navy with using the sailor as a
scapegoat and has sought a congressional investigation into the
Navy's report.
   Kathleen Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, said shortly after
Milligan's report was released that the family planned to file a
defamation of character lawsuit against the Navy for alleging
Hartwig may have caused the explosion.
   Truitt said the Navy slurred his reputation and his lawyer has
said the service apologized to him for leaking false information.
   But Ms. Brown said NIS agents ``did not apologize'' to Truitt.
   ``All logical investigative leads were covered, including those
that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the
explosion,'' said Ms. Brown.
   Rubin said, ``One good thing has come out of the inspector
general's report. For the first time, an officer of the U.S.
government has admitted that Ken Truitt had nothing to do with the
explosion.''
   ``We're also going to file extensive lawsuits against those
media outlets that initially carried the defamatory accusations
that Truitt was a homosexual involved in a murder-suicide plot.''

   President Bush is ``disturbed'' by Pakistan's
continued nuclear program without outside safeguards but says that
nation does not have a nuclear weapon, according to a congressional
aide.
   The president must make such a certification every year for
Pakistan to continue receiving U.S. aid.
   Bush sent a letter to Congress saying continuation of aid would
``significantly reduce'' the chances of Pakistan acquiring such a
weapon, the legal formula he is required to use for aid to continue.
   But according to the aide's description of the letter, Bush said
he ``continued to be disturbed by the fact that Pakistan is
continuing its unsafeguarded nuclear program.''
   Pakistan's nuclear program has posed the spectre of a nuclear
arms race with neighboring India for years. India exploded what it
called a nuclear ``device'' in 1974, a device it insisted was not a
weapon.
   In February, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States said his
country had deliberately refrained from taking the final step of
assembling a weapon.
   During her visit in June, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told a
joint session of Congress that Pakistan had no nuclear weapons,
would not build them and would not provoke a nuclear arms race with
India.
   The congressional aide who discussed Bush's letter is on the
staff of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Asia
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He spoke on
condition that his name not be used.
   He said Solarz expressed ``mixed feelings'' about the
president's letter _ glad that Bush was able to make the report he
did, but still worried about the Pakistani program _ and expects to
hold hearings on the matter.

<HEAD>House Refuses to Consider Census Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators will decide
whether illegal aliens will be excluded from next year's census
following the House's refusal to take up the issue on its own.
   The House voted Wednesday not to take up the measure, which has
pitted Sunbelt states whose populations have been swollen by
illegal aliens against Frostbelt states that stand to lose House
seats after the census.
   By a 232-184 vote, the House used a parliamentary maneuver
steered by Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., to keep the census
measure off the floor.
   That vote instructed House negotiators to accept a provision in
the Senate version of the State, Justice and Commerce
appropriations bill to condemn the continuation in power of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama. The rules permit only one set of
instructions to a conference committee.
   The move blocked Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., from offering his own
set of instructions on the census question to the House members of
the same committee.
   Ridge's provisions would have ordered the House negotiators to
accept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the use
of any money for the Census Bureau to count illegal aliens in its
1990 head count.
   The census bureau has always counted residents regardless of
citizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count
have always died in committee.
   Under current census rules, California, Florida and Texas, with
many illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats and New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are among those expected
to lose seats.
   ``The question is simple,'' Ridge said. ``Are people who have
entered our country illegally entitled to representation in the
United States Congress? I say no.''
   Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get
a vote on the Ridge proposal, backers of the census change used the
hour devoted to the Noriega censure to debate the census issue.
   Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political
fairness. ``I want equal representation for American citizens,''
argued Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.
   Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point
would cost $1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms and
retraining the census-takers. They said it was not clear counters
could even get accurate information on citizenship.
   Opponents have said the Senate provision is clearly
unconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of
``persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only to
citizens, it clearly says ``citizens,'' according to this argument.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher against the Japanese
yen Thursday, while share prices dove on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 144.60 yen, up 0.70 yen from Wednesday's
143.90-yen finish. It opened at 144.25 yen, and moved between
143.70 yen and 144.65 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 444.73
points, or 1.26 percent, to 34,795.34. It was this year's
second-largest one-day loss, following a 489.90-point decline June
15, dealers said.
   Many stock players sold issues in fear of another discount rate
increase, since Wednesday's increase seemed to have failed to
support the yen, said Masaya Hashizume, a dealer with Nikko
Securities.
   ``The most discouraging factor was the dollar's strength despite
the rate hike, not the hike itself,'' he said.
   Investors sold issues, such as constructions, that they had
bought because of the yen's strength.
   The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate, the key
lending rate charged commercial banks, by 0.5 percent to 3.75
percent. The discount rate also affects other domestic interest
rates, and discourages stock investment.
   Satoshi Sumita, Bank of Japan's governor, told a news conference
Wednesday the central bank made the hike in consideration of recent
flucutuations in exchange markets, domestic economic trends,
consumer prices and the money supply.
   In currency dealings, ``market players were still inclined to
buy the dollar because of the Greenspan comment Tuesday, which had
a much stronger impact on the market than the Bank of Japan's
discount rate hike,'' Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank
in Tokyo, said.
   U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted to
U.S. and Soviet officials in Moscow on Tuesday that the Fed would
not ease U.S. interest rates in the near term regardless of the
currency's movements.
   Citing the yen's weakness despite the discount rate hike,
Takeuchi blamed the Greenspan comments for the worsening foreign
exchange fluctuations.
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo said Wednesday, ``There is good
demand for the dollar, though the market remains a bit nervous.''
   Stock players were concerned whether the Federal Reserve Board
would lower its official interest rates based on the U.S. wholesale
price index for September, which is due Friday, the Bank of Tokyo
trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Market analysts say a discount rate cut by the U.S. central bank
would be the best remedy to halt the dollar's excessive rise after
a series of discount rate hikes in Europe and Japan, in addition to
concerted central bank interventions.
   Interest rate reductions tend to weaken the value of a currency.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Needs Tighter Control Over Cruise Ships, Board Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard should tighten control over
the safety of cruise ships that carry 7 million passengers a year,
the National Transportation Safety Board says.
   The board on Wednesday approved a series of recommendations for
the Coast Guard, cruise ship lines, operators of other passenger
ships and states for improving the safety of small and large
passenger vessels.
   Board member Jim Burnett said 264 people have died in passenger
ship accidents in the United States in the last 25 years.
   He acknowledged that is not many fatalities compared to the more
than 1,000 annual deaths in small boating accidents. ``But the
potential is there for a disaster that could double that figure in
one incident,'' said Burnett.
   Major foreign-flagged cruise vessels regularly carry hundreds of
Americans out of U.S. ports while remaining largely free of U.S.
regulation, he said.
   The five-member board, which oversees safety for all modes of
transportation, cited untrained crews that speak no English, a lack
of life vests, inadequate safety equipment, unsafe ship designs and
other problems on the foreign-flagged pleasure ships operating out
of U.S. ports.
   Burnett said solving the problems could be costly for some ship
operators but could save hundreds of lives.
   The panel also called for far more Coast Guard vigilance over
domestic passenger vessels and recommended that states also more
closely regulate the safety of boats operating on their waterways.
   The recommendations were accompanied by a study of passenger
ship safety which covered 36 passenger vessel accidents or
incidents that killed 176 people and injured another 364 in the
last 15 years.
   Although only five of the fatalities were in foreign-flagged
cruise ship accidents, board members said the potential for a major
catastrophe is high. The ships regularly carry several hundred
passengers but often have no plans for handling a major emergency,
investigators said.
   ``We're seeing a lot of vessels 10 years old with a brand new
coat of paint but lacking any of the safety equipment we're seeing
on newer vessels,'' said James Kolstad, acting board chairman.
   The board can only recommend actions and has no rule-making
powers. Its final report, which is to be edited and revised before
release, will be sent to Congress, the Coast Guard, passenger ship
companies and other interested parties.
   The board asked the Coast Guard to seek authority to investigate
accidents in international waters involving passenger vessels that
regularly operate out of U.S. ports, regardless of the flag they
fly.
   Investigations now usually are conducted by the country where
the ship is registered, and board officials say the inquiries often
do little to protect the safety interests of U.S. citizens. Nearly
all U.S. cruise companies register their ships in countries where
requirements are less strict than those for U.S.-registered ships.
   The board urged that all passenger vessels operating out of U.S.
ports be required to meet international safety regulations as well
as additional requirements.
   The report called for centralized fire control systems, heat and
smoke detectors with automatic fire door releases, sprinkler
systems, fire doors with holes for hoses to pass through and an
English-speaking crew that can communicate with each other and
passengers in an emergency.
   John Lauber, another board member, said passenger ship companies
have been ``driving through loopholes'' in the law that allow them
to escape safety regulations applying to larger vessels.

<HEAD>Ag Department Betting Crop Estimates Will be Better Than Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Agriculture Department estimates of 1989
crop production based on Oct. 1 field conditions have a good chance
of being close to the final figures when the harvest is all in.
   In the case of corn production, for example, the new estimate to
be released later today will have a ``confidence level'' of about
90 percent, meaning that chances are nine out of 10 that the
October estimate will be close to the final mark.
   But sometimes those heavy odds aren't quite enough to be on the
money, according to USDA statisticians. Take last year's drought
riddled corn harvest.
   The Oct. 12, 1988, report by USDA put corn output at 4.55
billion bushels, down 36 percent from about 7.07 billion bushels in
1987.
   Statistically, the report said, chances were two out of three
that the October corn estimate of 4.55 billion bushels would not be
above or below the final estimate by more than 3.8 percent, or
approximately 173 million bushels.
   Further the 1988 report said chances were nine out of 10 the
difference would not be more than 6.6 percent, or about 300 million
bushels.
   As it turned out, the U.S. corn crop was about 4.92 billion
bushels, according to current estimates for 1988. That meant the
October forecast was about 7.5 percent, or 370 million bushels,
below the final corn output.
   James Davies, head of statistical methods in the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service, said Wednesday that
although a forecast may be within a certain leeway 90 percent of
the time, ``one out of 10 times you expect it to be out of that
range.''
   Davies added in a telephone interview that many variables may
account for the give-or-take statistical cushion, including the
possibility of early snow storms in northern states, late-planted
crops and changes in figures for the number of acres to be
harvested.
   In the last 10 years, the October forecast has been below the
final corn production figures in seven years and above it in three
years.
   The new Oct. 1 crop estimates for 1989 production _ including
corn, soybeans and cotton _ will be revised in November. All crops
will be subject to fine-tuning in later reports.
   Right now, the crop situation for 1989 looks vastly improved
from 1988's drought-shriveled output.
   Don Seaborg of the department's Economic Research Service,
writing in his agency's Agricultural Outlook magazine before the
October estimates were made, noted the index of all U.S. crop
production dropped 16 percent last year because of drought.
   ``Production this year is rebounding to just below 1987's
levels, but will still fall short of the production in the early
and mid-1980s,'' Seaborg said. ``Cotton production, an exception to
the rebound, is declining because of reduced acreage.''
   Although 1989 weather has been less than ideal, it has helped
boost overall crop outlook. Also, farmers boosted plantings for
some key commodities.
   ``Farmers increased acreage because crop prices were the highest
in several years, and because government acreage-reduction
provisions were relaxed, allowing operators to expanding plantings
and still be eligible for benefits,'' he said.
   Again, cotton was the exception, as the government tightened
acreage restrictions because of market conditions.
   Seaborg said crop yields per acre are ``a better measure than
production of the impact of mixed weather patterns'' on the
nation's agriculture.
   Citing September figures, Seaborg noted 1989 corn and oats
yields may be up by one-third from last year's low levels, while
barley, soybean and hay yields are up about one-fifth.
   But the yield of all wheat is down about 4 percent from last
year, with ``marked increases in spring wheat yields are being more
than offset by an approximately 11 percent drop in winter wheat
yields,'' he said.
   The U.S. stockpile of most crops will again be whittled down but
will ``remain above pipeline needs during the 1989-90 season,''
Seaborg said. ``The drawdown in stocks will also occur in other
countries, but the rate of decline will be much less.''
   Meanwhile, he said, the farm prices of most crops ``will remain
sensitive to weather developments this winter, both here and
abroad.'' And that won't be the end of it.
   ``Farmers could well expand (crop) acreage again this winter and
next year, responding to similar factors that boosted planted
acreage this season,'' Seaborg added. ``Thus, 1990 weather
conditions will again be the focal point of the crop outlook.''

<HEAD>About 94 Percent of Schools Submit Asbestos Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government says most of the country's
schools are complying with federal asbestos regulations, but more
than 3,000 schools still have not submitted asbestos management
plans required a year ago.
   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged many schools
have been slow in complying with a 1986 law that required
inspections for asbestos in school buildings and established
deadlines for developing asbestos management plans and remedial
work if necessary.
   Asbestos is a cancer-causing substance once widely use for
insulation. It is particularly dangerous in exposed fiber form
where tiny particles are easily spread in the air.
   The EPA said Wednesday that as of late September, about 94
percent of the 50,544 local school agencies or individual schools
subject to the federal requirements have submitted management plans
to state officials.
   The plans were due in October 1988, but many schools received
extensions to last May. Even then, some schools did not submit
their complete action plans until just recently, officials said.
   The EPA statistics on how fast the schools are dealing with the
health matter represented reporting by both public and private
schools.
   EPA spokesman Sean McElheny said as of late September, about 6
percent, or 3,094 of the school entities, had not submitted the
required asbestos management plans to state agencies. He said the
EPA had no statistics on how many school had actually begun work to
remedy asbestos problems.
   Agency officials, nevertheless, were pleased with the 94 percent
rate of compliance to the reporting requirement.
   ``We are greatly pleased with the high rate of compliance,''
said EPA Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher. ``Our nation's
schools are serious about tackling the asbestos problem.''
   It was unclear from the EPA statistics how many school buildings
were represented by the reporting requirements. McElheny said in
some cases states reported actions by individual schools, while in
other cases reports were submitted on the basis of ``local
education agencies'' which could include anywhere from a single
school to a large metropolitan school district.
   Also, there was no breakdown available on the performance of
private schools vs. public school systems.
   ``We don't know how many (of the reports) were private and how
many were public schools,'' McElheny said.
   Officials said schools in California were not included in the
compliance figure because the state not yet completed processing
the latest submissions due to budget constraints.
   The 1986 law required school officials to begin implementing the
action plans by July 9, 1989. But many schools had yet to submit
the management plans by that date.
   According to EPA requirements, schools have several options for
dealing with asbestos in buildings, from removing it altogether to
keeping it in place and sealing it off from school occupants.
   Ms. Fisher said often the best approach may be to seal the
asbestos because attempts to remove it might throw small asbestos
particles might be thrown into the air.

<HEAD>Remains of Green River Killer's 41st Victim Discovered</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with police saying she wa a Green River victim</HEAD>

   A woman whose skeleton was found near
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is the 41st confirmed victim
of the Green River killer, investigators said.
   The remains of Andrea Marion Childers, who was 19 when she
disappeared in 1983, were found Wednesday just 50 yards from where
three other victims had been uncovered six years ago, authorities
said.
   Capt. Robert Evans, who heads the Green River Task Force, said
late Wednesday he had no doubt she was the 41st victim. Eight other
young women are missing and believed slain by the killer.
   ``The time of disappearance, what little we know now about the
background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims,'' he
said. ``The location ... the circumstances of the found victim,
those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a Green River
victim.''
   ``She was known to associate with prostitution,'' said Cecil
Ray, a King County police spokesman.
   Many prostitutes were among the victims in the killings, which
occurred from the summer of 1982 to early 1984. The killer operated
primarily in the Puget Sound area; the bodies of the first five
victims were found near the Green River, giving the case its name.
   No arrests have been made, but William J. Stevens II, 38, of
Spokane, has been described by task force investigators as a
``viable suspect.'' He has been jailed in Spokane on federal
weapons charges.
   Ray said it was not known what impact the discovery of the
skeleton might have on the 7-year-old investigation. The
identification was made through dental records.
   ``We always hope we'll find someone (who) maybe can give us some
information and other leads to follow,'' he said.
   Ray said the task force has always believed there may be more
victims.
   Ray said Ms. Childers was last seen by her boyfriend in April
1983, when police in suburban Edmmonds received a missing person
report about her. She was on her way to a shopping area frequented
by prostitutes near the airport.
   Green River investigators were called to a site south of the
airport on Wednesday after a worker who was cutting brush found a
skull.
   Ray said a complete skeleton was recovered and given to the
medical examiner's office.
   Evans said the skeleton was less than 50 yards from where
searchers found the remains of victims in June and November 1983.
Records indicate the bodies of three victims were found in the area
in late 1983.
   Evans said it was not known how long Ms. Childers' remains had
been at the site.

<HEAD>Nuclear `Share the Grief' Plan Meets Initial Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is meeting stiff
resistance to its plan to spread plutonium-contaminated wastes from
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant among seven states in order
to avert a plant shutdown early next year.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu and Energy Department
officials urged the seven governors and members of the states'
congressional delegations Wednesday to temporarily handle equal
amounts of waste from the Rocky Flats plant next year.
   ``My answer is absolutely not,'' said Rep. Butler Derrick,
D-S.C., whose district includes the Savannah River weapons plant
that is among the sites targeted by the Energy Department for
interim storage of the radioactive waste.
   ``The Energy Department doesn't know the definition of the word
`temporary,''' Derrick said in an interview. He noted 35 million
gallons of radioactive waste have been stored ``temporarily'' at
Savannah River, near Aiken, S.C., for decades.
   Most of the seven states _ Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington _ had indicated earlier
this week they would not accept any of the waste, which contains
plutonium that remains radioactive for 240,000 years.
   ``The answer is still no,'' Washington Gov. Booth Gardner said
after receiving a call from Sununu. He added that although the
federal government probably had the legal authority to force any
state to take the waste, he did not intend to relent.
   The administration says closing Rocky Flats would amount to
unilateral nuclear disarmament since it is the sole maker of
plutonium triggers for warheads.
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., whose district includes Rocky Flats,
said he saw little chance that other states would be persuaded to
voluntarily take the surplus waste.
   ``This has no more possibility of flying than a lead
dirigible,'' Skaggs said in an interview. ``It's an enormous
political hurdle for any governor to get over.''
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, citing a public health hazards from
continued accumulations of waste at Rocky Flats, has vowed to close
the plant if the waste exceeds 1,600 cubic yards. The Energy
Department estimates that limit will be topped by March.
   Rocky Flats is about 16 miles from Denver.
   The department had expected to have a permanent repository near
Carlsbad, N.M., ready by this fall to store the Rocky Flats waste,
but a series of technical and regulatory setbacks has delayed the
repository's opening until at least July.
   In briefings for congressional delegations from the seven
states, Energy Department officials identified eight sites in seven
states that Watkins wants to put the excess Rocky Flats wastes for
two years, and possible longer. They are:
   The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls,
Idaho; the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash.; the Los Alamos
National Laboratory near Los Alamos, N.M.; the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.; the Nevada Test Site, near Las
Vegas, Nev.; the Oak Ridge Reservation near Oak Ridge, Tenn.; the
Rocky Flats plant; and the Savannah River Site.
   The sites were chosen because they already hold vast amounts of
defense nuclear waste.
   Leo Duffy, Watkins's chief adviser on nuclear waste issues,
toured Nevada, Idaho and Colorado on Wednesday to brief those
states' governors on a new timetable for completing the permanent
waste dump in New Mexico. Watkins told Congress last week the dump
would not be ready to open before next July 1 at the earliest.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus said after a one-hour meeting with Duffy
that he was not asked to accept any of the Rocky Flats waste, but
indicated he would have turned down any request.
   Idaho had been storing the waste at the Energy Department's
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, but Andrus halted shipments
Sept. 1. That was the date Watkins had promised he'd have the $800
million Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico ready to
permanently entomb all waste generated at Rocky Flats.
   New Mexico, while not opposed to the permanent waste repository,
has battled the Energy Department over environmental and technical
aspects of the project and voiced concern that it not open
prematurely just to fix the Rocky Flats problem.

<HEAD>West Germans See Little Choice for East Germany But Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's communist leaders have little
choice but to make reforms like those in the Soviet Union under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, say two top West German military
officials.
   ``It's inconceivable that (East Germany) will stay as it is'' in
view of changes in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, West
German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters after
meeting with President Bush.
   Stoltenberg, who met with Bush on Tuesday, and NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former West German defense
minister who visited Bush on Wednesday, held separate news
conferences on Wednesday.
   They both said East Germany and other East European countries
will face mounting problems if they continue to resist reforms.
   ``The major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue
... their tough repression, they will not be able to manage the
change, they will not be able to peacefully develop their
countries,'' Woerner said.
   Stoltenberg added: ``If they do not move, there could be even
further growing tensions. And you could imagine some very dangerous
developments we all should want to avoid.''
   But Stoltenberg said East German reforms won't lead to
reunification of East and West Germany anytime soon. Reunification
would have to wait until democracy spreads through the rest of
Eastern Europe and could be accomplished within German
confederation in the larger European Community, he said.
   West German officials understood from Soviet authorities that
Gorbachev's public calls for greater flexibility by East Germany
were repeated in his private meetings with East German leader Erich
Honecker, said Stoltenberg.
   ``Indications give us the impression that he said, `You must go
on and move ahead; otherwise, the situation gets dangerous,'''
Stoltenberg said.
   Honecker indicated on Saturday that he planned to stick to his
hard-line approach as his country tries to stem the flow of its
citizens to the West. More than 100,000 East Germans have fled this
year, some of them by climbing over walls into the embassies of
western nations.
   The East German Communist Party's Politburo issued a statement
Wednesday indicating far more flexibility. ``All expressions of
opinion and suggestions for attractive socialism in the GDR (East
Germany) are important,'' it said. ``We are open to discussions.''
   Gorbachev is working to keep the Warsaw Pact together while
revitalizing COMECON, the Soviet bloc economic counterpart to the
European Economic Community, said Stoltenberg.
   Gorbachev ``may not like all attitudes and decisions of the
communist leadership in East Berlin, (but) he wants to keep them in
the camp and work with them,'' he said.
   The defense minister said Gorbachev appears ready ``to tolerate
remarkable special movements'' in different East European
countries, but that ``the Warsaw Pact stays together'' even if in a
new form.
   Stoltenberg arrived in Washington Monday and has met U.S.
officials including Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. He is due to
visit U.S. and German forces at military bases in Norfolk, Va., and
Texas before returning to West Germany Friday.
   Woerner has been holding similar meetings.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Travels Cost Twice As Much as Predecessor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department paid the FBI $730 to
fly Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to Pittsburgh May 15 and spent
$5,260 for the return trip the next day on a Marshals Service jet,
government records show.
   The twin-engine Marshals Service jet flew from Oklahoma City to
take Thornburgh back to Washington after the attorney general voted
in the Pennsylvania primary, met with FBI agents and was
interviewed by a hometown radio station.
   The May 16 return flight was one of three trips Thornburgh took
aboard Marshals Service aircraft in the last five months at a total
cost of $80,181, according to travel records released by Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   The figures show Thornburgh spent $154,618 for 47 flights on
government aircraft between Oct. 7, 1988 and Sept. 4, 1989. That
was more than twice the travel expenses incurred by his predecessor
during a comparable time period.
   Trips by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III cost the
government $74,247 between Oct. 1, 1987 and when he left office
Aug. 8, 1988, Runkel said.
   Runkel acknowledged Thornburgh has traveled more frequently than
Meese but attributed much of the greater cost to ``the incredible
charges of the Marshals Service'' for their planes.
   ``The attorney general told me when he saw those charges for the
first time he ordered ... those charges reviewed to determine if
the department is being ripped off,'' said Runkel.
   He said Thornburgh told him the charges ``appear to be
outrageous and that he wants them looked at again.''
   U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Stephen T. Boyle said the
Justice Department's accountants ``went over the bills in some
detail before they reimbursed us to determine if they were indeed
valid and justifiable and apparently felt they were because they
paid the bill'' for all three flights.
   Boyle said the bills reflected the costs of fuel the Marshals
Service used to fly the planes.
   A letter Boyle wrote last week to two news organizations
detailing the travel expenses said the twin-engine jet Thornburgh
took for the Pittsburgh-to-Washington flight was requested May 12,
three days before the attorney general left Washington on the FBI
turboprop.
   Runkel made Boyle's letter and a similar response by FBI
spokesman Milt Ahlerich available to reporters. The letters were
written in response to questions from The New York Times and the
Los Angeles Times.
   The Marshals Service also listed a $46,792 bill for Thornburgh's
Aug. 6-9 trip to Mexico City for meetings with Mexican officials
and to Honolulu, where the attorney general addressed the American
Bar Association.
   Following the Mexico City meetings, Thornburgh and several aides
flew from San Francisco to Honolulu aboard a Boeing 727 normally
used by the Marshals Service to transport prisoners.
   In addition to the expenses it billed the Justice Department,
the Marshals Service estimated that it cost $32,232 to divert the
Boeing 727 from carrying federal prisoners.
   Thornburgh and his aides also flew a twin-engine Marshals
Service jet on a June 12-14 trip to Texas at a cost of $28,118.
   Runkel said Thornburgh has been flying aboard government
aircraft because of FBI concerns about his personal security and
the secrecy of his communications while in flight.

   Some Democrats are already claiming
that Gov. Bob Martinez' losing bid to place further restrictions on
abortion will hurt his re-election chances next year.
   The Legislature defeated a series of anti-abortion proposals by
the governor, then adjourned its special session Wednesday. Florida
taxpayers spent more than $100,000 for the fruitless session, the
third called by the governor this year.
   Even the first-term Republican governor's glib campaign manager,
J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich, wasn't his usual talkative self. ``I'm
not going to spin it,'' he said. ``It's an issue he feels strongly
about. I'm going to let him do it.''
   Martinez said he was unconcerned about taking a political risk
on abortion. ``I stood for my convictions,'' he said. ``I don't
think the people in any state have an adverse feeling for someone
who stands up for his convictions.
   ``With me, it was a matter of value, a matter of conviction, not
a matter of politics.''
   House Republican Leader Dale Patchett and Sen. Richard Langley
said they thought the session may have helped the governor slightly
by solidifying his support among anti-abortionists.
   ``I think the governor will have a net gain,'' Langley said.
``People have got to respect him. He knew it was not a popular
thing to do, but it was a genuine conviction of his.''
   State Republican Chairman Van Poole also was busy Wednesday
trying to repair any damage done to the GOP's lead candidate for
next year. ``He had a lot of courage to call this session,'' said
Poole.
   Many Democrats said Martinez would pay the price at the polls
next year for his anti-abortion stance.
   ``The governor's profile as a blundering manager, as a
blundering political strategist who cannot read the sentiment of
the people of Florida is now carved in stone,'' said Party Chairman
Simon Ferro. ``There's nothing he can do to chisel away at it and
make it better. That is the profile Floridians are going to be
voting for or against next year.''
   State Sen. George Stuart, who is seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, said Martinez wasted taxpayers' money by
insisting on the session.
   And the chairman of the House Health Care Committee, Rep. Elaine
Gordon, said Martinez ``has awakened a sleeping giant and they will
be there to help him be defeated.''
   On Tuesday, Republican state Sen. Marlene Woodson-Howard decided
she would challenge Martinez for the GOP nomination come September.
   ``This is costing the governor a great deal,'' said Eleanor
Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. ``If
nothing else, he's seeing a primary he might not otherwise have.''
   Although the abortion issue itself wasn't the key reason for her
candidacy, Woodson-Howard said the governor's insistence on the
unpopular session was another example of ignoring lawmakers' wishes.
   ``He didn't build consensus and he didn't count his votes, and I
think that's crucial,'' she said.

<HEAD>U.N. Says 315 Missing After Search for Guerrillas' Prisoners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. investigators have found no
evidence to support charges the SWAPO guerrilla movement still
holds political prisoners _ but also failed to determine the
whereabouts of 315 alleged detainees, a U.N. official says.
   Martti Ahtisaari, head of the U.N. contingent monitoring
Namibia's transition to independence, said Wednesday that the
search for the missing people would nevertheless continue.
   Under the U.N.'s independence plan, both the South-West Africa
People's Organization and the South African-led security forces
were required to release all prisoners.
   Many of the more than 200 people freed by SWAPO alleged that
hundreds of others had been held along with them and either were
dead or still in custody.
   Ahtisaari sent an eight-member investigating team last month to
Angola and Zambia, where SWAPO maintained camps during its 23-year
bush war against South African rule of Namibia.
   The team's report, released Wednesday, said 448 of 1,100
allegedly missing people were alive and free, 71 were found to have
never been detained and 115 were believed to have died in
circumstances that were not specified. Others could not be
identified and 315 were unaccounted for.
   The U.N. investigators said they visited 30 locations in Angola
and Zambia during their three-week trip, including six sites where
prisons definitely operated. They said the prisons had been
dismantled and vacated.
   Ahtisaari said the team found no evidence that the alleged
detainees had been moved from any of the locations.
   Many of the former SWAPO detainees have alleged they were kept
in underground pits and tortured persistently into making false
confessions that they were South African spies. SWAPO officials
have acknowledged torture did take place.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, but agreed
last year to grant independence as part of a regional treaty that
also calls for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.
   SWAPO is favored to win the most votes in U.N.-supervised
elections Nov. 7-11 for an assembly that will draft a constitution
for an independent Namibia. It must win two-thirds of the votes to
have total control over the assembly.

   Former President Reagan spoke to a convention
of rental car agents in his first speech since undergoing skull
surgery last month.
   Reagan and his entourage were whisked in a side entrance and
ushered to a hall at the plush Caesars Palace resort where he spoke
Wednesday to several hundred rental executives and agents.
   The former president waved at two waiting reporters and said he
was feeling fine. On leaving, he was asked how he liked retirement.
   ``Pretty good,'' he responded.
   The media was not allowed to attend the event and no news
conference was held. Mark Weinberg, a Reagan spokesman, would not
disclose what Reagan said in the speech.
   Reagan later returned to Los Angeles.
   Reagan had surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., on
Sept. 8 to remove fluid that had accumulated on his brain. The
injury resulted from a July 4 accident in which he was thrown from

   Frank Sinatra says he won't cross picket lines
at Bally's unless musicians have settled their strike by the Oct.
19 opening of his engagement at the resort.
   Sinatra feels ``obligated not to violate the picket line for the
musicians I have worked with since the '40s,'' according to a
statement released by Frank Sinatra Jr., who is his father's
musical director.
   Several other top entertainers have refused to work in the
showrooms of the three Las Vegas resorts that musicians have struck
in a dispute over guaranteed pay and the use of taped music.
   Wayne Newton, Dean Martin, Rodney Dangerfield, Connie Francis,
Dionne Warwick, Burt Bacharach and Bill Medley have refused to
perform at Caesars, Bally's and the Las Vegas Hilton.
   Talks in the dispute broke off earlier this month, when
Musicians Union Local 369 officials rejected an offer the resorts
said was final.
   Hotel officials have replaced live orchestras with taped music
in production shows at the three resorts. They say they will pay
musicians working the headliner rooms only for the time they
actually work, refusing to guarantee them a certain number of weeks
of pay.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has replaced her
trial attorney with another lawyer to pursue the possibility of
appealing her cop-slapping conviction.
   Miss Gabor, the former Hungarian beauty queen and sometime
actress, will wait until after her Oct. 17 sentencing on the
misdemeanor convictions before deciding whether to file an appeal,
her new attorney, Harrison E. Bull, said Wednesday.
   William Graysen, Miss Gabor's trial attorney, said he referred
Miss Gabor to Bull because Graysen's firm does not handle appeals.
   Miss Gabor was convicted on Sept. 29 of battery on a police
officer, driving without a valid license and having an open
container of alcohol in her car. She could be sentenced to 18
months in jail.
   The charges stemmed from a June 14 traffic stop in which Miss
Gabor slapped Officer Paul Kramer after he pulled over her
Rolls-Royce convertible because its registration tags were expired.

<TEXT>
   Former White House press secretary James Brady
cannot recover damages from the maker of the handgun used by John
Hinckley in a 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, an
appeals court has ruled.
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that
R.G. Industries Inc. and its German parent company, Roehm, cannot
be held responsible for injuries received by Brady and Washington
D.C., police officer Thomas Delahanty.
   The appeals court rejected an argument by attorneys for Brady
and Delahanty that the .22-caliber pistol Hinckley used in the
shooting was inherently dangerous.
   ``The marketing of a handgun is not dangerous in and of itself,
but rather the result of actions taken by a third party,'' the
court said.
   Brady told The Washington Post he was disappointed by the
decision and that he hoped state legislatures would consider
enacting laws to establish the right to sue gun manufacturers.
   ``They're the ones that make them in the first place. And that's
what bothers me,'' Brady said.
   Brady, Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy were
wounded along with Reagan in Hinckley's assassination attempt. A
suit the three men filed against Hinckley is pending in federal
court.
   Brady's wife, Sara, has become a national spokeswoman in the
campaign to ban the sale of handguns and to register firearms.

   Banner-waving youths opposed to
Indonesian rule of East Timor fought baton-wielding police in the
territory today before the altar where Pope John Paul II was
finishing his benediction to about 60,000 people.
   At least four people were injured.
   Hurling chairs and shouting ``Viva independence!'' and ``Viva
Papa!'' about 20 youths unfurled a banner in front of the the altar.
   As the pope looked on, plainclothes police hit the youths with
canes. Much of the crowd scattered, but about 100 people came to
the aid of the youths, hurling chairs at the police.
   The protesters were supporters of Fretilin, the pro-independence
movement that has been fighting Indonesian troops since the
Portuguese left the former colony in 1975 and it was annexed by
Indonesia.
   They got to within 100 feet of the steps to the high altar where
the pope stood watching. The pope did not seem directly threatened.
   In his homily, the pontiff had urged Indonesia to respect the
human rights of the people of predominantly Catholic East Timor,
which comprises half of Timor Island in the southeastern reaches of
the Indonesian archipelago.
   As white-cassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm
the crowd, the pope, surrounded by Vatican and Indonesian
bodyguards, moved toward his car.
   From there he went directly to the airport as scheduled and flew
off to Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the world's most populous
Moslem country. After he left, youths began to chant ``Viva
Fretilin!''
   Dili General Hospital reported four women admitted after the
incident, all of whom had been battered by the surging crowd.
   There was no immediate report of arrests.
   Girl Scouts, who had been serving as ushers in front of the
altar, wept as they were caught up in the clash. The incident
lasted about 15 minutes. The crowd then left the dusty arena
peacefully.
   Security at the Mass was light and provided by unarmed police
and militia. The Indonesian army, which has a garrison of 13,000 in
East Timor, was apparently not deployed.
   Indonesia admits to having suffered ``thousands of casualties''
in the guerrilla war over the territory Portual ruled for 450
years. Indonesia had dismissed the strength of the separatist
guerrillas, saying only 200 remain in the hinterland.
   In his homily, the pope made no direct mention of Indonesian
rule, which is not recognized by the Vatican, but referred instead
to ``those who are responsible for life in East Timor.''
   Addressing the crowd, the pope urged Indonesia to ``act with
wisdom and good will towards all'' in the search for a peaceful
solution to East Timor's problems.
   Referring to the anti-Indonesian guerrilla war, the pope said
East Timorese had ``experienced destruction and death as a result
of conflict.''
   ``You have known what it means to be victims of hatred and
struggle,'' he said. ``Many innocent people have died while others
have been prey to retaliation and revenge.
   ``For too long you have been suffering a lack of stability which
has rendered your future uncertain. This distressing situation''
has prevented the economic development needed to prevent hunger and
unemployment.
   The pope urged Indonesia to bring about ``a speedy improvement
of conditions of life'' in East Timor.
   The visit came on the fourth day of his pilgrimage to Indonesia.
   The pope was met by Defense Minister Benny Murdani, the former
army commander who planned the takeover of East Timor. Murdani is
the highest placed Roman Catholic in the government of Indonesia,
which has 157 million Moslems and 5 million Catholics.
   Indonesia has been anxious for the visit to be seen to lend
respectability if not official recognition to its rule of East
Timor, which has a population of 590,000, of whom almost 80 percent
are Catholic, according to the Vatican.
   The pope had justified his visit by saying it would be ``an
offense to Timorse Catholics'' if he did not visit the former
Portuguese colony while on a state visit to Indonesia.

<HEAD>Widow of Panama Coup Leader Says He Was Betrayed By Comrade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of the leader of an unsuccessful coup
against Panama Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said the military
uprising failed because a second military leader pulled a
last-minute double-cross.
   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi said in interviews published today that
the switch helped doom efforts by her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi
Vega, to overthrow Noriega last week.
   Giroldi, his widow said, planned the coup with a longtime
friend, Maj. Francisco Oleochea, commander of the elite Battalion
2000.
   Battalion 2000, a crack anti-riot unit, was airlifted to the
scene of the fighting and _ instead of helping oust Noriega _ went
on to lead troops loyal to Noriega in crushing the coup.
   ``Everything was ready,'' Mrs. Giroldi told The New York Times.
``But Oleochea was playing a winner's game and he failed to come
through because of his cowardice. He committed treason.''
   In an interview with The Miami Herald, she countered U.S.
officials' assertions that leaders of the failed coup were divided
over what to do with the Panamanian leader.
   ``Everything was perfectly coordinated,'' Mrs. Giroldi said. ``I
don't think there ever was a dispute.''
   She told the Times the coup was ``very well organized and coldly
calculated.''
   Mrs. Giroldi, 36, told both newspapers the U.S. military in
Panama had been informed in advance of the coup, and the coup had
been plotted by junior officers in the Panamanian Defense Forces
fed up with Noriega's alleged corruption and ``drunkenness.''
   But the Herald termed Mrs. Giroldi's responses ``evasive'' when
she was asked to what extent the U.S. military had promised to help
the rebels.
   ``My husband was convinced that the Americans and his own
companions within the defense forces would support him,'' she said.
   Mrs. Giroldi is staying with her three sons, her brother and her
father at a secret location in Miami. She was not at military
headquarters during the Oct. 3 coup attempt.
   She told the Times her information came from officers who took
part in the coup and fled to the United States.
   Mrs. Giroldi also told the Herald that her husband may have lost
the last chance for a successful coup by not killing Noriega.
   ``My husband may have had a moment of weakness,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Antonio Housing Authority may have
violated state or federal laws through questionable spending
practices that exceeded $4.7 million, according to a federal report.
   A review by the inspector general's office at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development also said the San Antonio agency
should be required to pay back $84,260 it spent for such items as
Rotary Club membership fees and banquets.
   The investigators say the housing authority had $4.7 million in
questionable spending and have recommended that the HUD regional
administrator in Fort Worth require an accounting of where that
money went.
   In the Oct. 3 review, investigators reported possible violations
of law or conflicts of interest in several areas, including
procurement and contracting practices and the use of non-profit
corporations.
   Apolono Flores, the housing agency's executive director,
disputed the allegations.

   A Swiss-based grain company has been suspended

   The company, Richco Grain Ltd., has received $95 million worth

   USDA temporarily suspended the company effective Sept. 29
because of its connections to Marc Rich and a Rich associate,

   A strengthened Typhoon Dan roared
toward Vietnam today after killing at least 30 people, injuring 57
and leaving 142,000 homeless in the Philippines, officials said.
   At least 33 fishermen also were missing after Dan battered
Manila and southern areas of Luzon Island Wednesday with 62 mph
winds. Forecasters said winds increased late Wednesday to 74.4 mph,
making Dan a typhoon.
   Electricity had still not been restored today to wide areas of
Manila. About 95 percent of the Manila area, which has a population
of more than 7 million, lost power Wednesday as strong winds ripped
down power lines.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Lourdes Masing said 14 fishermen were
missing aboard seven boats that disappeared in Subic Bay west of
the capital.
   Another 10 people were missing after a deep-sea fishing boat ran
aground in Subic, she said.
   In Batangas province south of Manila, the coast guard said 10
people were rescued after two fishing boats collided and sank.
Early reports said up to 20 fishermen were missing but officials
said all but nine had been accounted for.
   Dan, the 16th tropical storm or typhoon to hit the country this
year, slammed late Tuesday into Sorsogon province, on the
southeastern tip of Luzon Island. It raced across southern Luzon,
passing just south of Manila before entering the South China Sea.
   The storm left seven people dead in Quezon province, five in the
Manila area, four on Marinduque Island, four in Laguna province,
three in Cavite province, three in Bataan province, two in Pampanga
province and two in Batangas province, rescue officials said.
   An average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms strike the
Philippines each year. On Friday, Typhoon Angela struck northern
Luzon killing 118 people.

   A doctor and his wife went rummaging
through the dump for World Series tickets after he unwittingly left
the precious ducats with other papers that had to be thrown away.
   Dr. Michael Smith and his wife, Pam, ended up raking through 3
tons of trash at the Marina garbage disposal site Tuesday before
finally finding them.
   The 43-year-old gastroenterologist had attended the final
National League playoff game Monday with his 12-year-old son, Rory.
Afterward, they left their Series tickets in the car.
   The next morning, when Smith started looking for the tickets,
the tickets were nowhere to be found. He figured they had been
thrown out and called Forest Disposal Co. to try to head off the
trash truck.
   Mia Litch of the Monterey Regional Waste Management District
radioed the landfill operators to clear a site for the Smiths to
wade through the garbage.
   ``The people were real nice at the dump,'' said Smith.
   Truck driver David Hare dumped the garbage and spread it out for
the Smiths, who recognized some of their garbage. Heartened, they
dove into the pile. Two hours later, the Smiths found the slightly
soiled tickets.
   ``It was not real pleasant,'' said Smith. ``But I tell you, the
outcome was worth it. My son and I are going to the games to see
the Giants win.''

<HEAD>Court Report: Fired Warden Ran Cockfighting Business in Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fired warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary operated a cockfighting business at the prison and
failed to maintain security and report escapes, the state's
corrections chief said.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn told reporters Wednesday.
   Butler stepped aside as warden after a court-appointed official
issued a highly critical report of the prison's operations. But he
later filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, claiming
that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into retiring. Butler
asked the commission to reinstate him.
   Lynn denied Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not involved
in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right decision''
in stepping aside. The governor said Wednesday he backed Lynn's
decision to dismiss him.
   According to Lynn, the charges against Butler stemmed from an
agency probe that followed allegations leveled by the
court-appointed investigator, former warden Ross Maggio.
   Butler was replaced after U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola
received Maggio's report, which said the prison suffered from lax
management and had failed to properly search inmates and visitors
for contraband.
   Polozola ordered Maggio to investigate after a rash of escapes,
assaults and suicides at the giant prison at Angola.
   Among Maggio's report, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on the prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison
facilities. Lynn said he had told all wardens to refrain from any
personal business activity on June 20, but Butler ignored the
order. Several hundred fighting cocks owned by Butler recently were
removed from the Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   Butler also failed to maintain searches of employees and
visitors to the prison, which ``resulted in a serious breakdown of
security,'' the report said. Drug and other contraband problems in
the prison ``were well known to the warden,'' the report said.
   Annette Viator, an agency attorney, said Butler could appeal the
decision to an internal department panel and the Civil Service
Commission. Under state regulations, Butler could still decide to
retire before the appeals process, she said.
   Butler refused to comment and referred questions to his
attorney, Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of
the charges and declined comment.

<TEXT>
   About 500 U.S. and British sailors on
shore leave went on a drunken rampage in downtown Lisbon, brawling,
smashing windows of shops and bars and attacking cars, police said.
   More than 100 U.S. and British sailors were arrested by Lisbon
police during Wednesday night's disturbances and at least seven
people were injured, a duty officer at Lisbon Public Security
police said.
   Authorities bolstered dockside patrols today to prevent further
clashes, said the officer, Paulino Cardoso.
   Cardoso said without elaboration that the rampage began after
four U.S. sailors got into a fistfight.
   British sailors from the carrier Ark Royal joined in, as did
more Americans from the tank landing ship Barnstable County, the
amphibious transport docks ship Shreveport and the amphibious
assault ship Nassau.
   The U.S. ships were berthed in Lisbon during a break from NATO
exercises off the Portuguese coast. The Ark Royal was on a five-day
courtesy visit.
   Cardoso said most of the arrested sailors were returned to their
ships after their officers gave assurances there would be no
further disturbances, though three were still be held for
questioning.
   Seven people were injured in the fighting, including four police
officers as the brawlers descended on the dockside police station,
Cardoso said. One police officer underwent surgery after his nose
was broken in the brawling.
   Lisbon police intervened to break up the fight but the violence
escalated, with rampaging sailors smashing the windows of shops and
bars and attacking parked cars in the dockside Cais do Sodre
quarter and the Chiado shopping district, he said.
   Cardoso said bar owners did not want to press charges against
the sailors, who are regular visitors to the seedy area.

<HEAD>Probe Begins Into Reports Syrian Fighter Flew Into Israel Undetected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel launched a top-level probe today into
reports a Syrian major flew a MiG-23 fighter jet undetected across
one of Israel's most sophisticated defense lines before landing at
a civilian airfield.
   The seven minutes that the Syrian pilot spent in Israeli air
space before landing and defecting caused an uproar over possible
flaws in the air defense system.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot's main headline questioned ``How a MiG
Flew for Seven Minutes _ Without Interference.'' The
English-language Jerusalem Post ran a front-page analysis about
upgraded Syrian air attack capabilities.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was angered that he did not even
know about the flight until after it landed, the Hadashot daily
reported.
   The investigation was launched by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron at the urging of Rabin, Israel radio said. It said a
brigadier general was heading the probe.
   Both Israel radio stations and most newspapers reported the air
force failed to scramble inteceptors before the Syrian
fighter-bomber landed near Haifa, a city of 250,000.
   Syria is Israel's most implacable foe in the Middle East. The
Golan Heights, over which the Soviet-built plane swooped into
Israel, were annexed by Israel after being seized from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The Davar newspaper said the plane came across the Golan at a
level of just 100 feet at a speed of 745 mph.
   Witnesses said the plane buzzed houses in the northern town of
Afula flying at 165 feet and town council leaders demanded to know
why civil defense officials were not warned, Israel radio reported.
   Members of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement and the
right-wing Tehiyia Party called for a paraliamentary debate on the
flight.
   Rabin said the plane was detected by Israeli radar officers and
patrol aircraft, but refused to confirm or deny reports that the
air force failed to scramble fighters to intercept the Syrian
warplane.
   ``All this will be clarified after a full inquiry into the
matter,'' he said.
   The radio said the MiG-23 was carrying two 23-mm cannons and 200
rounds of ammunition but its bomb racks were empty.
   The plane, flown by Maj. Adel Basem, 34, landed before noon at
an airfield used by crop-dusting planes at Megiddo, 60 miles north
of Jerusalem, an army communique said. Israel radio said Basem
asked for asylum.
   Workers at the airstrip said they were stunned by the plane's
arrival.
   The plane turned around on the runway ``and the pilot got out
and said, `I am asking for asylum, I have no intentions of war,'''
the Haaretz newspaper quoted one as saying.
   The radio and major dailies said Basem sat in a supply building
at a corner in the airfield for 20 minutes before air force
officials arrived. Other witnesses said they saw no Israeli escort
planes.
   Davar quotes Basem as telling an airstrip worker that he
defected because of poor treatement in the army, including one
incident in which secret police broke his arm and hit him in the
ribs after he requested better housing.
   In Damascus, a Syrian official said the pilot did not defect but
was forced to make an emergency landing. An Israeli army spokesman
denied the plane had technical problems.
   The craft had no visible signs of an engine fire reported by
Syria.
   Rabin indicated Israel could tell that the Syrian plane had no
hostile intentions, but refused to provide details, saying:
   ``It's difficult to explain the difference between an airplane
coming to carry out an operation ... and a pilot deciding to cross
the border during a training flight.''
   He defended Israel's handling of the affair, saying:
   ``In this case, it's good we did not shoot it down. We got an
advanced MiG-23 of the MLD version. It's one of the most advanced
versions of MiG-23 supplied to the Syrians after 1982.''
   ``Of course it will serve as a source of information for us and
the others,'' including the United States, Rabin said.

<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced a former nursing
home aide to 20 to 40 years in prison for helping her former lover
smother patients, and he agreed to her request that the two be kept
in separate prisons.
   ``Without you, I'm sure this matter never would have been
cleared up,'' Kent County Circuit Judge Robert Benson said
Wednesday in sentencing Catherine Wood. ``I'm convinced that you
truly show remorse. ... I'm also convinced that you are in fact a
follower and not a leader.''
   Wood, 27, admitted she sometimes served as a lookout or diverted
supervisors' attention while another aide, Gwendolyn Graham,
suffocated five patients at Alpine Manor Nursing home in Walker, a
northwest suburb of Grand Rapids.
   Wood testified the murder was part of a pact the two hoped would
bind their love. She said Graham told her the killings helped her
``relieve tension.''
   Wood originally was charged with two counts of first-degree
murder. Those charges were dropped after she agreed to plead guilty
to one count each of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit
second-degree murder. Wood also agreed to testify against Graham,
who was convicted last month of five counts of first-degree murder.
   Graham, 26, of Tyler, Texas, faces a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment without parole. Wood had faced a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment.
   Wood remained silent during sentencing, but her attorney read a
statement from her.
   ``Saying `I'm sorry' is not enough. Mere words cannot express
the remorse and guilt I'll have to live with for the rest of my
life,'' Wood wrote. ``I was caught up in a mess but do not excuse
my action or try to blame anyone for my part of this.''
   She also expressed sadness at being unable to watch her
9-year-old daughter grow up. The girl now lives with her father in
Grand Rapids. Police began investigating the deaths last year after
Wood's ex-husband said she confessed to him.
   Benson ordered 20 to 40 years on each count for Wood, but said
the sentences would be served concurrently in a prison other than
where Graham will be lodged when she is sentenced.
   Benson recommended that Wood be sent to a federal prison. She
would become eligible for parole in 16 years, two months.
   Jan Hunderman, daughter of 60-year-old victim Marguerite
Chambers, said she was pleased with the sentence. Wood testified
she stood guard outside the room of Chambers, who suffered from
Alzheimer's disease, while Graham suffocated her with a washcloth.
   ``She should have come forward and told people this was
happening,'' Mrs. Hunderman said. ``But now that I know that this
act did happen to Mom, it seems to settle everything.''
   Assistant Kent County Prosecutor David Schieber said he was
satisfied with the sentence.
   ``Because of Cathy's cooperation, we were able to bring the full
story out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Short Hemlines, Bare Midriffs Dominate Milan Runway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout. No pickup.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sexy clothes with lots of bare skin have
become a symbol of the ``moda Milanese.''
   A year ago Gianni Versace introduced his Band-Aid mini skirt, no
more than 12 inches from top to bottom. There were few who dared to
don the skimpy garment, but the message caught on quickly.
   Above the knee hemlines became a way of life.
   For the spring-summer 1990, the trend to hike the hemline
continues, with mid-thigh the preferred length. In the wake of the
mini, designers are also showing a myriad of short-petticoated
party dresses and short shorts.
   For those who prefer to keep their knees to themselves, the
Milan runway offers lots of pants, either super loose or skin tight
and airy chiffon dresses and skirts which flow softly down to the
ankle.
   But the real novelty in the sexy department is the above the
waist nude look.
   Models with bare backs, bare midriffs, even bare breasts paraded
down the runway in a myriad of bra tops, bustiers, low-back dresses
and see-through blouses. To emphasize the look, Giorgio Armani in
his Emporio collection sent a model down the runway in nothing but
a pair of Armani jeans.
   This accent on the female torso spells good news for beauty
farms and fitness centers. No one will want to be caught with the
proverbial midriff bulge.
   In general, the 40 Italian designers showing their warm weather
wears in Milan this week, including Armani, Versace, Ferre, Krizia
and Fendi have each gone their individual way, with less of a
common thread to the collections than in past seasons.
   However they have all agreed to promote one item _ the fringe.
Usually long and silky it appears on shawls and scarves, as well as
decoration on any type of clothing. Often it makes up the hemline
of a skirt or dress.
   In the color department the news is that bright shades are back
on the Milan runway after many a season of drab grays and browns.
Designers draw inspiration for their cheerful palette, from the
rich colors of tropical fruit, or the many fruit flavors of Italian
ice cream: mango, banana, papaya, coconut, kiwi, raspberry,
apricot, peach, watermelon, orange, lemon, lime and many more.
   Footwear for next spring and summer will be mostly flat by day,
and sometimes even by night.
   The newest shoe is the Krizia ankle strap platform shoe, taken
right out of the 1940's.
   Gold and beads are back in a big way, appearing in large
bracelets, necklaces and earrings, as well as decoration and
sequining in the more eleborate evening wear.
   The five-day, semi-annual Italian ready to wear shows end
Thursday night with a gala performance by Moscow's Bolshoi theater,
at Milan's famed La Scala opera house, followed by a buffet dinner
in the foyer.

<HEAD>Company Distributing AIDS-linked Pneumonia-Fighting Drug Free to
Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of a drug used to combat AIDS-linked
pneumonia is giving it free to poor patients, but those who can
afford to pay for treatment will continue to do so, company
officials said.
   Lyphomed Inc. in February announced plans to give away the drug,
pentamidine, but actual distribution was held up until June pending
full government approval of the drug, spokeswoman Melissa Marsden
said Wednesday.
   The company, based in suburban Rosemont, charges about $100
wholesale for a monthly dose. Patients pay up to $200 for the same
dose through doctors and pharmacies.
   AIDS activists and others have accused Lyphomed of overcharging
for the substance. But the company maintains its charge is
appropriate, given the research money it spent developing the drug.
   Community health organizations have been notified of the
availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lack
insurance to cover its costs.
   The company said it will send supplies of the drug several times
a year to groups of doctors who have large AIDS practices in New
York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Chicago and
Miami. The groups are filling out questionnaires that ask them how
much pentamidine they think they will need. The company said it
also may send the drug to other groups.
   Lyphomed's action represents the first time a company has
distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge,
company officials and federal Food and Drug Administration
spokesman Brad Stone told The New York Times.
   Since 1984, Lyphomed has produced an injectable form of the drug
for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening form of pneumonia that is the
leading cause of death among AIDS patients.
   In June, the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol
version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure
by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia.
   Last month, the People With AIDS Health Group said it would
import the drug from England, where is it cheaper, and sell it to
AIDS patients in this country at a lower cost than the drug can be
bought here.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Hold `Coming Out' Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of those who attended a second annual ``National Coming Out
Day'' around the country acknowledged that they were veterans of
homosexual-pride events, and they said the real ``coming out''
process is done privately.
   ``My coming out was when I opened the dictionary at age 14 and
looked up the word `homosexual' and realized that applies to me,''
said John Blakeslee, 34, of Providence, R.I.
   Blakeslee was among some 50 people who attended a rowdy Rhode
Island Statehouse rally and said they hoped it would encourage
others to seek out the state's homosexual community rather than
isolating themselves in despair.
   ``Gay youth has three times the risk for suicide as straight
teens,'' said Jon Winkleman, 22, of Warwick, R.I. ``When I was a
teen, I was afraid that my parents would stop loving me.''
   Elsewhere, hundreds of homosexual men and women celebrated their
sexuality with rallies, films and discussions Wednesday.
   ``National Coming Out Day is great. It's like a holiday,'' said
Tony Cheek, executive assistant at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian
Community Services Center, where about 500 people gathered.
   The celebration at the center included discussion of such films
as ``The Life and Times of Harvey Milk,'' about San Francisco's
murdered homosexual city supervisor.
   Cheek said the day's highlight was an open microphone at which
people could tell their own stories of coming out _ slang for
publicly acknowledging one's homosexuality.
   ``Some were funny, but there were a lot of tear-jerkers,'' he
said. ``We had a lot of first-timers.''
   At the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, students were
asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration. Black,
always a popular choice of students, proliferated on campus by
midmorning.
   ``This campus is so diverse, civility and being aware of social
issues is really important,'' said Max Mitchell, a senior and
president of the school's Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Alliance.
   In Boston, the Massachusetts Senate gave all but final approval
Wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in
housing, credit and employment.
   The bill, which has died in the Senate for each of the last 17
years, moved along after Senate President William Bulger ruled that
amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying
tactics.
   ``This really is the people's victory,'' David LaFontaine of the
Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. ``We are going to
herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement.''
   The Atlanta Gay Center sponsored a help-line and bought local
advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in Washington
two years ago. Homosexual residents had their names printed in the
ads as part of the commemoration.
   North of San Francisco Bay, the Marin County Board of
Supervisors voted 4-0 to proclaim Wednesday ``Marin Coming Out
Day,'' despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county
should not be endorsing homosexual lifestyles.
   Ken Searle, pastor at Marin Christian Life Church in Novato,
said he was ``very disappointed'' because the board's action ``will
be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle.''
   Supervisor Al Aramburu, one of two who wore ``Coming Out''
buttons, said the proclamation reflects a ``spirit of respect.''
   ``I think we respect one another as human beings,'' he said.
   Cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by
letting the heterosexual world know that there are homosexuals all
around them.
   ``If you find out your next door neighbor that you've known all
along is gay, then how can you hate him?'' Cheek said.

<HEAD>Parents' Complaints About Devil Worship Cancel Halloween Events</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer students in ghost and goblin get-ups
will be parading through the halls of Frederick County schools this
Halloween because of some parents' complaints that the holiday is
linked to devil worship.
   Several schools have canceled traditional Halloween costume
parties, opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations instead.
Other schools are bypassing Halloween altogether, asking children
to dress up as storybook characters in conjunction with National
Children's Book Week in mid-November.
   ``I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our
instructional curriculum,'' John Thompson, a county school
superintendent, said Wednesday.
   Other parents believe school officials have overreacted to the
15 to 20 parents who complained, Thompson said. But he said school
officials thought the parents had a legitimate concern.
   Larry Chamblin, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of
Education, said that although satanic activities have been brought
to the attention of school officials across the state, he had never
heard of Halloween parties being canceled in any other Maryland
schools.
   In Texas, similar parental complaints have prompted a school
district to considering limiting observance of the holiday, too.
   ``I asked the school board to ban Halloween because it's a
religious holiday,'' Janet Magee, director of children's education
at the 800-member, non-denominational Christian Fellowship Church,
said Wednesday.
   Tuesday night, the Harlingen Consolidated Independent School
District appointed a committee to examine Halloween's role in the
schools. About 200 members of area churches showed up, some wearing
orange anti-Halloween buttons.
   Committee members said they were not ready to decide on whether
to ban Halloween.
   Harlingen school Superintendent T. Carl McMillan said at a
Wednesday morning meeting he advised principals that ``in
situations where they were coming on strong with witches and
witches' brews and all that kind of stuff, perhaps they might want
to tone it down a bit and concentrate on pumpkins and that sort of
thing.''
   ``He agreed to take the yucky stuff out,'' Mrs. Magee said
Wednesday. ``Man, that's a major step.''
   But she wants all Halloween witches, witches' brews, ghosts and
goblins and what she calls ``the dark side'' out of the schools,
and hopes the school board makes the decision at its next meeting.
   ``The Christian religion is not allowed the same privilege in
the schools,'' she said.
   McMillan, however, said Halloween always has been seen as a
spoof of an old superstition.
   ``And kids have always looked on it as a fun time and a spoof
rather than anything serious like this,'' McMillan said.
   Frederick County School Superintendent Noel Farmer has not
issued a policy on Halloween, but at least three elementary schools
_ North Frederick, Walkersville and Hillcrest _ have discontinued
Halloween events. Others have changed the focus of the parties.
   Middletown Elementary School Principal Roy Clever said some
parents keep their children home from school to prevent them from
participating in Halloween parties. To keep the children in class,
the school decided to hold a fall celebration instead.
   ``We've requested that the students not come as witches and
goblins and ghoulish characters,'' he said.

   ``All three of them have developed exact methods of measurement
which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force
us to reconsider some basic physical laws, especially regarding
time and space,'' said Ingvar Lindgren, chairman of the awarding
committee.
   Ramsey's invention yielding the cesium atomic clock is the basis
for the present standard of time, with an accuracy of about one
part in ten thousand billion, or 10 followed by 13 zeros.
   He also introduced the hydrogen-maser technique, the most stable
source of electromagnetic radiation and a method for studying ``the
hyperfine structure of hydrogen with extreme precision,'' the
academy said. It also is used to measure short lengths of time and
shifts in frequency.
   Dehmelt and Paul were cited for developing ways of trapping
atoms to study a single electron or ion with extreme precision.
   ``The methods have been used in testing fundamental physical
principles such as quantum electrodynamics ... (and in) space
communication for measuring continental drift,'' the academy said.

<HEAD>Two Aides Leave Dinkins Campaign Over Anti-Semitic Remarks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix category code. Note language in 9th graf,
`It also ...'.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black activists accused of making
anti-Semitic comments have resigned from the mayoral campaign of
Democrat David Dinkins.
   Jitu Weusi, who had headed African Americans for David Dinkins,
and Robert ``Sonny'' Carson, a Dinkins volunteer, resigned
Wednesday.
   Dinkins said Weusi was leaving the campaign of his own volition.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith accused Weusi of
writing ``scores of anti-Semitic articles'' and of having referred
to Jews as ``vile money-changers'' and ``shylocks.''
   Dinkins spokesman David Fishlow said Weusi denied the substance
of the charges.
   In a letter to Dinkins campaign manager Bill Lynch, Weusi said,
``I harbor no anti-Semitic views now, nor have I in the past.''
Weusi said he was stepping down so he would not ``deflect New
Yorkers from the real issues.''
   The ADL said Weusi also read an anti-Semitic poem, reportedly by
a high school student, on the radio 21 years ago. According to
Dinkins, Weusi has repudiated that poem many times.
   In a letter written last Friday, the ADL complained to Dinkins
that Weusi wrote in 1971 that Jews had to be eliminated ``by any
means necessary.''
   It also said that in 1968, Weusi, under his former name of
Leslie Campbell, recited a poem on radio station WBAI which began:
``Hey, Jew boy, with that yarmulke on your head. You pale-faced Jew
boy, I wish you were dead.''
   Weusi said the poem did not reflect his views but the ADL said
the activist had ``described the poem as `beautiful' and `true.'''
   The ADL said Weusi used the pen name ``Big Black'' and wrote
several anti-Jewish articles for a publication called Black News.
Weusi denied using such a name.
   The ADL said Carson made anti-Semitic remarks in 1967.
   Dinkins said Wednesday that Carson had no official role in his
organization.

   The Navajos' suspended chairman has been
charged with taking more than $400,000 in bribes and kickbacks
while leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe. He promised to
``stand up and fight'' the allegations.
   The criminal complaints filed Wednesday in Navajo Tribal Court
also included charges of fraud, conspiracy and elections violations
against the suspended chairman, Peter MacDonald, who is under
investigation by a special U.S. Senate committee.
   Special prosecutors hired by the tribal council also filed
charges against MacDonald's son and the tribe's suspended vice
chairman.
   MacDonald was charged with more than 100 offenses. One complaint
charges him with bribery, fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy
in the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in Arizona in
1987.
   A second complaint alleges violations of the Navajo election
law, including charges that MacDonald accepted $115,500 in
undocumented cash and services from non-Indians and corporations.
   A third charges him with bribery, extortion and other counts in
connection with consulting contracts MacDonald purportedly entered
into with outside businesses in 1986 through 1989. Prosecutors
allege he pocketed more than $300,000.
   MacDonald's son Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. is charged with
conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and
suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is accused of ethics
violations in a fifth.
   The elder MacDonald said the charges were only a rehash of
allegations that surfaced during last winter's U.S. Senate hearings.
   ``Those lazy, good-for-nothing lawyers'' spent thousands of
dollars to come up with nothing more than ``allegations using the
testimony of the Senate hearings,'' he said. The 60-year-old
MacDonald, who was put on paid administrative leave in February,
said he had no plans to resign.
   ``There's no reason to give up as long as I'm alive and I'm
breathing,'' he said. ``The cause is valid in terms of these people
(supporters), and knowing what is happening to Indian nations _
what has happened to the Navajo _ it affects my children and my
grandchildren, and I'll continue to stand up and fight.''
   Tribal Interim Chairman Leonard Haskie, meanwhile, said he asked
the federal government to speed up its investigation of allegations
that MacDonald shared in the $7.2 million profit turned by Tracey
Oil and Gas Co. of Scottsdale, which bought the Big Boquillas from
Tenneco West for $26.2 million and sold it to the Navajos less than
24 hours later for $33.4 million.
   The complaint filed Wednesday alleges that MacDonald used his
position to talk the council into allocating the money.
   The tribe is suing MacDonald and others for $24 million in
damages in the ranch purchase.
   In January, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs began
an investigation of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, but became
embroiled in probing corruption of various tribal leaders.
   The most prominent target was MacDonald, who was in his fourth
term at the helm of the 225,000-member tribe.
   Among witnesses who testified under immunity of MacDonald's
taking kickbacks from contractors were Rocky MacDonald, who said
under-the-table payments were referred to as ``golf balls.''
   The elder MacDonald has maintained that taking gifts is a
prerogative of Indian leaders.
   He repeated his claim that the federal government wants to oust
him and other tribal leaders so it can plunder the natural
resources on reservations.
   MacDonald made his comments Wednesday in this north-central
Arizona community about 150 miles northwest of the tribal capital
and 250 miles north of Phoenix.
   Appearance summonses will be mailed to MacDonald, his son and
Thompson. They have 14 days to respond, and no attempt will be made
to arrest the defendants until then, officials said.
   Special prosecutor Robert Rothstein said in Window Rock that he
and his Santa Fe, N.M., law firm investigated up to 100 past or
present tribal officials and did not focus only on MacDonald.
   If convicted on all counts, MacDonald could be sentenced to 15
years in prison, fined up to $59,500 and prevented from holding
public office on the reservation for 114 years.
   ``I'm glad they think I will live that long,'' he said.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Gunman in Border Clash, Palestinian in West Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot and killed an unidentified gunman
in a shootout in south Lebanon, and a 25-year-old Palestinian was
killed during a clash in the occupied West Bank, the army said
today.
   At least five other Palestinians were reported wounded in
confrontations with soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a 35-year-old woman was hacked
to death, apparently by enforcers of the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule.
   The shooting in the West Bank occurred after soldiers heard
gunfire and saw three fleeing Palestinians, an army spokesman said.
   The victim, Yassin Al Masri, 25, was the 588th Palestinian
killed by soldiers or Israeli civilians in the 22-month-old
uprising. Forty Israelis have died in the violence.
   Palestinian reporters said four Palestinians were wounded
besides Al Masri and that the troops opened fire when they were
pelted with stones and bottles.
   Soldiers also shot a 3-year-old boy in the head with a
rubber-coated steel ball during a clash with stone-throwers in the
Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
He was reported in serious condition.
   In Nablus, the body of Nuhzu Mabruka, 35, was found hacked to
death in an alley. Palestinians said she was killed because she was
a prostitute.
   At least 128 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in
the uprising. Most have been slain because they were suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, but some victims have been
alleged prostitutes or drug leaders.
   A military announcement said the pre-dawn battle in Lebanon was
in Israel's self-declared security zone near the village of
Markabe, 1{ miles west of the Israeli border.
   An army patrol spotted a squad of guerrillas and opened fire,
killing one, the announcement said. No Israelis were reported hurt.
   The army refused to say what happened to the other guerrillas.
   Military sources said the dead man was from the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed PLO faction.
   The army said 71 guerrillas and two Israeli soldiers have been
killed this year in clashes along the border. The last incident was
October 3, when two guerrillas were killed and one soldier was
slightly injured.
   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its forces from Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year occupation. The
6- to 10-mile-wide strip of land is meant to block attacks on
Israel's northern border.

<HEAD>National Newspaper's Red Ink Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of USA Today, Gannett Co.'s
national newspaper, say the 7-year-old publication continues to
post losses and is experiencing a decline in advertising pages,
according to a published report.
   The Washington Post in today's editions quoted the officials as
saying Gannett's flagship paper probably would not be profitable
this year, but they were hopeful for its first full-year profit in
1990.
   ``Not making money this year is somewhat painful because it's
something we've been driving for,'' said Tom Curley, president and
chief operating officer of Arlington, Va.-based USA Today.
   Curley estimated that USA Today, in which Gannett has invested
$800 million, will end the year with about $2 million in losses,
down from a loss of $26 million in 1988.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We consider it a hugely successful
year'' for the newspaper overall.
   The newspaper is being affected by an industry slowdown in
advertising and the opening of five new printing sites in the past
two years, Curley said.
   USA Today carried 785 pages of advertising in the third quarter,
Gannett reported Wednesday in its quarterly report. That was the
lowest total in almost three years. For the first nine months of
1989, the paper's ad pages were off 4 percent, but its ad revenue
was up 13 percent due to higher rates.
   Curley said USA Today's total revenues would increase to $320
million this year, up 7 percent from last year. He also told the
Post that circulation between April and September was 1.75 million,
an increase of about 100,000 from the same period last year.
   Gannett on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings were up 11
percent to $83.1 million, or 52 cents per share from $75.1 million,
or 47 cents per share, last year.
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton told the Post that USA
Today's chances of getting into the black next year depend on the
strength of the U.S. economy.
   ``If things continue to soften and national advertising is weak,
they could have another year like this one,'' Morton said. ``If
there's a recession, (profitability) would be hopeless.''

   A federal appeals court called body-cavity
searches ``dehumanizing and humiliating'' and ruled
unconstitutional a Los Angeles police policy of conducting such
searches on anyone arrested for a felony.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling
Wednesday, said the practice violates the constitutional ban on
unreasonable searches.
   ``The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot be
overstated,'' Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall said in upholding $25,000
in damages to a woman searched after her arrest on her roommate's
accusation of grand theft.
   Noting that felonies in California include willful tax evasion
and securities fraud, the court said the felony designation has
little to do with the likelihood of a suspect's concealing drugs,
weapons or other contraband.
   Police offered no evidence that people arrested on suspicion of
a felony were more likely than other inmates to smuggle illegal
items into jail, the court said.
   ``A ham-handed approach to policy-making runs the serious risk
of infringing upon detainees' constitutional rights,'' said Hall, a
conservative appointed to the court by President Reagan.
   ``Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body
cavities (are) dehumanizing and humiliating,'' Hall said.
   The court, however, said it was not deciding if strip searches
in all felony cases, without inspection of body cavities, were
constitutional.
   No decision has been made on an appeal, said Los Angeles
Assistant City Attorney Richard Helgeson, who said he was
disappointed by the ruling.
   But Alva Cooper, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers
Association, said the ruling ``would have to be appealed to the
Supreme Court.''
   The general rule in California is that those arrested and
confined for more than a few hours are searched for drugs, Cooper
said.
   ``If someone can tell us how we keep narcotics out of jail
(without a body-cavity search), we'd be only too glad to do that.
No one likes cavity searches, but at the present time there's no
other way,'' Cooper said.

   State Police defended their $100,000 hunt
for two inmates who left false clues suggesting they had escaped
when they actually were hiding for a week inside the world's
largest walled prison.
   ``I'm not embarrassed in the least bit,'' said Detective Sgt.
Jerry Boyer. ``We had information to believe these guys were
outside and we followed up on it.''
   Prosecuting Attorney Joseph Filip said Wednesday he will let
prison authorities discipline convicted murderer David Bellah, 42,
and robber Steven Mikko, 27, rather than filing any new charges.
   The prisoners were found Tuesday hiding inside a stack of
corrugated boxes in a furniture factory at the 57-acre State Prison
of Southern Michigan.
   A homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope fashioned from
nylon laundry bags found with them led authorities to believe the
two planned to escape over the 28-foot prison wall after the search
for them died down.
   Boyer said the two left phony clues suggesting they had
disguised themselves as guards and escaped during a shift change on
Oct. 4.
   Negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false
guard badges, and a note indicated they had bought guard uniforms
for $250, he said.
   Mikko also arranged to have a cousin call a probation officer to
say she had been asked to pick up the two on the day of the
reported escape.
   ``It certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had
escaped from prison,'' Boyer said, adding the size of the
institution made it difficult to determine if they still were
inside.
   Boyer estimated State Police spent more than $100,000 searching
for the men within Michigan. The search also extended to Indiana
and Nevada, where Bellah and Mikko had friends and relatives.
   Prison spokeswoman Marcia Bailey said prison officials also
never stopped searching inside the prison.
   ``The evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some
doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were
trying to distract us,'' said Department of Corrections spokeswoman
Gail Light.
   Before the escape, the men were held at a level below maximum
security and could leave their cells during the day. Depending on
the outcome of disciplinary hearings, they could be placed under
tigher security and lose privileges.
   Filip said the county usually prosecutes inmates for new
offenses only if aggravated circumstances are involved, such as
injury to a prison employee or private citizen. A conviction for
attempted escape would add only two to five years to their already
long sentences, he said.

   An abducted newborn has been reunited
with his teen-age mother, and a woman who had told neighbors she
was pregnant was booked for investigation of kidnapping.
   Debra Marie Lucas, 36, was jailed without bail Wednesday,
accused of abducting 6-pound, 1-ounce Lee Thao late Monday only
hours after his birth.
   Authorities said a woman in a visitor's gown approached the
mother in her room at Mercy General Hospital and told her she had
to take the baby for a feeding.
   The mother, Kazoua Thao, a 15-year-old Hmong immigrant who
speaks little English, told authorities she thought the woman was a
nurse.
   Sgt. Gary Gregson said police went to Lucas' home on a tip from
someone who identified her from a drawing distributed to TV
stations and newspapers.
   The child, in good condition, was found at Lucas' house and
reunited with his mother at the hospital.
   Lucas' neighbors said she had told them she was pregnant and had
taken a maternity leave from the convalescent home where she worked
as a licensived vocational nurse, Gregson said.
   ``But whether she was in fact pregnant is not known,'' he said.

   In the Gethsemane Lutheran church in East Berlin,
thousands of pro-democracy activists find sanctuary as security
police roam the streets outside.
   At sister churches in Leipzig and Dresden, East Germans who have
been refused permission to emigrate to the West gather weekly for
candle-light vigils to protest the government's decision to make
them stay.
   Thousands of East Germans have recently spilled out of the
churches and into the streets as protests against the aging
Communist leadership's hard-line policies have swelled to record
proportions.
   Suddenly, the church has been plunged into the middle of efforts
to achieve political reforms in one of Eastern Europe's most
tightly-controlled societies.
   The church has long sought an uneasy co-existence with the
40-year-old, officially atheist state.
   The most recent figures available from East Germany say that
between 45 and 48 percent of the population belonged to religious
communities in 1987. About 39 percent of the population are
Lutherans. Martin Luther, leader of the Protestant Reformation, was
born in Eisleben, now in East Germany.
   While it has championed human rights causes and increasingly
pressured the government for more openness and dialogue in society,
the Lutheran Church has largely steered clear of open confrontation
with the state.
   East German officials have tolerated the church as long as it
confines itself to activities on its property, although its
publications are routinely censored.
   After years of relative tranquility, church leaders have found
themselves in tense mediations with police to prevent protests from
escalating into violence. Their run-down churches have increasingly
become forums for disparate opposition groups and pro-democracy
supporters.
   Church leaders are also speaking out more boldly for democratic
change.
   Hans Otto Furian, a church provost in East Berlin, has called on
the ruling Communist Party to ``give up its grip on total power.''
   Church sources inform Western media of dissident developments
and act as mediators between opposition groups and government
officials.
   Opposition groups have flocked to the churches because they are
the only haven of free speech in the strictly regulated country.
   Church property is also off-limits to state security officials
under terms of a law separating church and state.
   While there are similarities to the Catholic Church's support of
the Solidarity movement in Poland, the German Lutheran Church has
never had the same influence on daily life as the Catholic Church
in Poland.
   Western diplomatic observers and East German church leaders say
there are clear limits to the church's new role. Many say its
current role has been assumed reluctantly.
   ``The church has not deliberately chosen this role,'' said a
Western diplomat who tracks East German religious affairs. ``It was
forced upon it.''
   East Berlin pastor Rainer Eppelmann said the church, in seeking
to help many East Germans disillusioned by their society, has found
that ``people we're trying to reach out to are being torn apart.''
   ``You have to deal with these problems,'' said Eppelmann, who
was among the first East Berlin pastors to give sanctuary to
fledgling ecology and human rights groups.
   Johannes Hempel, the Lutheran bishop of Dresden, said he does
not believe the church is actively seeking the forefront of the
movement for changes in East German society.
   ``What is happening now is not really an activity of the
churches,'' he said. ``It comes from a large part of the
population, and only a small part are Christians.''
   Hempel said the church's role is to help ``avoid escalation and
violence'' and to build bridges between the opposition and the
state.
   That role will be challenged as opposition leaders continue to
demand more dialogue with the government.
   So far, only Communist officials in Leipzig and Dresden have
agreed to talk to opposition representatives. Church leaders there
played key roles in setting up those talks.
   Church leaders in East Berlin say ``working groups'' also exist
between the church and officials in the capital to discuss
solutions to the current unrest.
   Several church leaders are known to have good contacts with
high-ranking party officials.
   Church officials say they expect their mediation role to
continue to be a difficult one because many in the government led
by 77-year-old Erich Honecker have been unwilling to discuss the
need for changes.

   East Germany's Communist Party will consider
social reforms but will stick to a strict socialist ideology and
maintain its grip on power, a high-ranking party official said
today.
   But there were indications of differences within the party
hierarchy over how to deal with an increasingly agitated populace
demanding more freedoms from the hard-line government.
   West German media speculated today that 77-year-old Erich
Honecker may be forced to step down as East German leader.
   Some Communist Party leaders warned Honecker in a Politburo
meeting on Wednesday that unless calls for democratic reforms are
urgently addressed, he could face labor unrest, party sources said.
   After the two-day meeting ended, the Politburo maintained a
public unity that offered firm support for the policies of the past
but offered an olive branch to a growing movement for reform.
   The Politburo said in a statement: ``All expressions of opinion
and suggestions for attractive socialism in (East Germany) are
important. We are open to discussions.''
   But any reforms ``will serve the further development of
socialism,'' said Otto Reinhold, a party Central Committee member
and head of the government's Academy for the Social Sciences.
   ``There is a need for clear positions from the party, as to how
the socialist system can be further shaped,'' Reinhold said in a
commentary carried today by the official news agency ADN and the
state newspaper Berliner Zeitung.
   ADN said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in East
Germany from that in some other socialist countries. The government
in East Berlin has long emphasized it rejects the democratic
reforms taking place in Poland and Hungary.
   Baerbel Bohley, a co-founder of the opposition group New Forum,
described the Politburo statement as a ``verbal shift that does not
take into account real life.''
   In an interview with the RIAS radio in West Berlin, Ms. Bohley
said: ``In dialogue, there must be also confrontations, and those
who are trying to avoid confrontations are not for real dialogue.''
   Meanwhile, the mayor of Dresden, Wolfgang Berghofer, promised to
continue talks with the reform-minded Lutheran church and other
groups in the city but flatly ruled out accepting any demands made
by New Forum.
   ``We are continuing to talk with one another,'' Berghofer told
the East German newspaper Junge Welt. ``But I said that I am not
ready to accept any demands from the New Forum.''
   New Forum has been seeking greater openness in East German
society and meaningful elections. Any changes in those areas would
have to come from the central government, not the local level.
   The European Parliament, meanwhile, called on East Germany today
to release those who have been ``arbitrarily'' arrested in
nationwide demonstrations and to end police actions against
citizens trying to flee the nation.
   The European parliamentarians approved the criticism of East
Germany in a resolution unanimously adopted in Strasbourg, France.
   In West Germany, the ZDF television network, the Hessische
Rundfunk radio in Frankfurt and the mass-circulation Bild newspaper
speculated Honecker will soon step down.
   ``As of Wednesday evening, a resignation could no longer be
discounted,'' added the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
today.
   The East German sources said high-ranking Communist officials
had demanded Honecker deliver a report on the ``critical
situation'' of the nation by Friday. In the past month, nearly
50,000 people have fled to the West and the country has seen its
largest street protests since 1953.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported
resistance within the security forces and the state-controlled news
media to the government's harsh weekend crackdown on nationwide
pro-democracy protests.
   The Politburo, in its statement, reaffirmed its commitment to
socialism, saying the answers to current problems ``are not to be
found in the capitalist past.''
   The Politburo hinted at possible changes including more free
expression in the rigidly controlled news media and greater freedom
to travel.
   Party sources said another Politburo member, Egon Krenz, was
responsible for the decision to order security forces _ who beat
and arrested hundreds of protesters over the weekend _ to show
restraint during demonstrations Monday in Leipzig, East Berlin and
Dresden.

   A parolee led police to skeletal remains
believed to be those of a kidnapped 11-year-old girl he said he
accidentally killed two years ago.
   Sheriff Howard Ensley said the remains were found late Wednesday
in a shallow grave near here and would be analyzed at the state
crime lab. ``I hope this is the little girl's body so it will bring
peace of mind to her family,'' he said.
   Charles Blassingame, 43, was brought to Georgia from Marinette,
Wis., on Tuesday to help find the body of Tammy Lynn Maciulis, who
disappeared from her mother's apartment in Marinette in 1987.
   Blassingame pleaded guilty in Marinette on Monday to kidnapping.
Under a plea bargain, he told authorities where the girl was buried.
   Blassingame was on parole from Georgia after serving seven years
for assault and burglary and had been living in the same apartment
complex as the girl. He was apprehended three days after her
disappearance.
   He told authorities he accidentally ran over her and drove to
Georgia to bury the body.
   Wisconsin prosecutors had said they would consider bringing
murder charges if a body were found. ``I just totally can't believe
he accidentally ran her over with his car,'' Marinette County
District Attorney Tim Duket said this week.
   Under the plea bargain reached in Marinette, Blassingame will
serve 25 years in prison for the kidnapping. Authorities said he
had agreed to plead guilty to extortion if Tammy Lynn's body were
not recovered.

   A magistrate today said white
riot police had acted despicably and unlawfully in an attack on
mixed-race demonstrators, but he acquitted their two commanding
officers of assault charges.
   A mixed-race policeman who had accused the riot squad of acting
like ``wild dogs'' called the verdict unbelievable.
   Magistrate A.S. McCarthy said there was no evidence the major
and lieutenant on the scene outside Cape Town on Sept. 5 witnessed
the assaults and they could thus not be held responsible for the
actions of their men.
   But McCarthy said the assaults in Mitchell's Plain township _
described by witnesses at the trial and shown in a subpoenaed
videotape from CBS News _ were illegal and despicable.
   In particular, he criticized the whipping of women on their
breasts.
   The videotape was shown on government television Wednesday and
today but edited to omit scenes showing police hitting people as
they lay on the ground.
   ``The court is astonished that these members cannot be
identified by the police, or if they can be identified, that they
are not in court,'' McCarthy said.
   The trial was prompted by allegations of mixed-race Mitchell's
Plain police officer Lt. Gregory Rockman, who said the squad
charged peaceful anti-election protesters with whips and clubs.
   ``It is ridiculous what the outcome was,'' Rockman told
reporters after learning the verdict. ``This means they can go
around beating people. I don't accept it.''
   He said he would press for a meeting with President F.W. de
Klerk to discuss his concerns about police violence.
   The demonstration ocurred the day before parliamentary
elections, from which members of the country's 28 million black
majority were excluded.
   Rockman testified that as he tried to get one riot squad away
from the area to decrease tension, another one charged and attacked
bystanders with glee.
   Rockman testified that Maj. Charles Brazelle, in charge of the
riot squad, threatened to arrest him when he asked him to stop the
attack.
   Brazelle was acquitted along with Lt. David Roos.
   The magistrate said national emergency regulations allow police
to use violence to end illegal demonstrations and give immunity to
the police if they act in good faith.
   The prosecution argued that the riot squad officers were not
protected by the emergency regulations in this case because it was
clear the demonstration, although illegal, posed no threat to
public safety or the police.

   Two men were killed in clashes with authorities in
a restive territory claimed by both the republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan, a Soviet newspaper said today.
   The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said S. Akonyan was killed late
Tuesday in a clash between soldiers and local residents in
Nagorno-Karabakh. R.E. Sadikov was killed Monday in the region, the
report said.
   It quoted military officials as saying they had arrested Sadikov
and confiscated a rifle from him but that he then attacked a
soldier and was killed trying to escape.
   In both cases, soldiers were injured, said the report.
   On Wednesday, Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri M. Arshenevsky
announced that eight people were injured, two critically, when
firefighters defended themselves against a crowd threatening them
with stones and firearms.
   Armenian activists in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, said one
person _ apparently Akonyan _ died in that clash.
   The bloody dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has been going on 18
months. The region is in the republic of Azerbaijan, but the
majority of its citizens are Armenians. The republic of Armenia
wants control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Kremlin officials have imposed direct rule in the area in an
effort to calm tensions.
   As part of the dispute, rail shipments through Azerbaijan to
Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia were cut off late this summer.
   The Azerbaijan People's Front political movement, which
organized a general strike that included a halt to rail shipments,
decided earlier this week to end the blockade.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said some freight was arriving in
Nagorno-Karabakh, but not food or fuel.

   Here is a list of the 30 House members who
voted one way in a vote on abortion restrictions on Sept. 9, 1988,
and then voted the opposite way on a virtually identical proposal
on Wednesday.
   In September 1988, the House voted 216-166 to stick by its more
restrictive provisions, limiting federal abortion aid to women
whose lives are endangered.
   On Wednesday, the House voted 216-206 to abandon its own
proposal, and instead adopt Senate language extending eligibility
to women who have been victims of rape or incest and reported the
incidents quickly to authorities.
   The Senate language that the House agreed to Wednesday included
an unrelated provision restricting federal financing for programs
that provide hypodermic needles to intravenous drug users. This
provision received little mention in the House debate but could
have influenced some votes.
   In all, 27 members voted for liberalized rules Wednesday who
were recorded as voting against them in September 1988, while two
voted against the eased limitations Wednesday who voted for them 13
months ago.
   The two voting for easing the limitations last year but switched
to opposing them on Wednesday were Reps. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, and
George Gekas, R-Pa.
   Those who opposed easing the limitations last year but voted in
favor of them Wednesday were Reps. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif.;

   A Vietnam veteran, wearing a military jacket
and clutching divorce papers, shot and killed himself at the foot
of Tampa's Vietnam War memorial, police said.
   Robson James Mabry, 39, was found dead Wednesday by a jogger in
Veteran's Memorial Park, said police spokesman Steve Cole.
   Cole said Mabry, found with a .357-caliber pistol in his lap,
had shot himself in the head as he sat on the grass beneath a
flagpole. He was wearing a camouflage jacket with military patches
and a Bronze Star, police said.
   He earned the medal while serving in the Army from 1969 until
1971, military records show. He went to Vietnam in 1970.
   Mabry was holding papers from his Aug. 9 divorce in one hand.
   He had checked into the Veteran's Administration Hospital in
Tampa in 1971 for minor surgery and went back in 1987, said Marty
Gall, a spokesman for the hospital. He was not diagnosed as having
post-traumatic stress disorder, Gall said.

   Voters are focusing more on the abortion issue
this year, and some House members say that is leading them to
rethink the political wisdom of their past opinions.
   ``This year we're all listening,'' said Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr.,
R-S.C., as the House voted 216-206 on Wednesday to liberalize
Medicaid abortion funding rules.
   He was one of 27 lawmakers who voted to allow more
Medicaid-funded abortions on Wednesday but had voted the opposite
last year. Ravenel attributed the change to increasing public
awareness following the Supreme Court's July decision giving the
states more power to restrict abortions.
   ``There's been no time that the public awareness of this matter
has been as high as it is now since I've been in public office,''
added Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., another lawmaker who switched his
vote over the last year.
   ``They're perceiving their constituencies as pro-choice;
obviously a majority of them are,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., leader
of the House's anti-abortion forces, said of his colleagues after
the vote. ``Over the years, pro-lifers have been replaced by
pro-choicers.''
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who led the House fight for the
eased rules, was another who credited the climate created in the
aftermath of the high court's July 3 ruling in the Missouri case,
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services case.
   ``The Supreme Court case made the issue real,'' she said.
``Before it was hypothetical because they always had the courts to
rely on.''
   In rejecting restrictions in place since 1981, the House agreed
to allow federal aid for abortions for poor women who are victims
of rape or incest. Conservatives lost an effort to reverse the
vote, 212-207.
   Wednesday's votes reversed the chamber's 216-166 vote of Sept.
9, 1988, by which it decided to limit federal aid to cases where
the woman's life was in danger.
   The bill now moves to the Senate, which has already passed the
eased limitations. However, President Bush has threatened to veto
the measure.
   There has been one other significant congressional victory for
abortion rights forces since the Webster decision: the House's vote
Aug. 2 to expand eligibility for government abortion aid in
Washington D.C.
   But that vote was considered easier for lawmakers because it
affected only abortions in the capital, and not their constituents
back home. Wednesday's vote has sparked strong statements from both
sides.
   ``The politicians who flip-flop on the abortion issue may find
themselves in a political no-man's land, perceived as lacking
principle and trusted by neither side,'' warned Darla St. Martin,
associate executive director of the National Right to Life.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., who backs abortion rights, said he
believed Bush would veto the bill but predicted it would backfire.
   ``I would tell him by doing it, you're going to bring injury
upon yourself politically, but more important he's going to bring
injury upon his allies in the House,'' he said. ``He wins in the
short term _ the veto will stand obviously. But in the long term,
politically he's going to lose.''

<HEAD>Defector Claims North Korea Planned To Bomb Seoul Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A North Korean defector claimed today
that his country planned a series of bombing attacks at the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul but that the plan was canceled because of
fear of retaliation.
   Suh Yong-chul, 26, who defected from North Korea last month,
told a news conference that six members of his North Korean
commando unit were trained to bomb Olympic facilities in Seoul,
including the 10,000-capacity main stadium.
   He said the plan was scrapped at the last moment because North
Korean leaders feared it could invite a retaliatory attack on a
world youth festival scheduled in July.
   Both the Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 13th World Youth
Festival in Pyongyang, North Korea, were held without disruption.
   ``Six members of our unit received special training to
infiltrate during the Olympics, but the plan was canceled. I later
knew that it was because the North feared that the South Korean
side would retaliate against the youth festival,'' Suh said.
   He also said a 1983 explosion in the southeastern city of Taegu
that killed four people was caused by a bomb planted by a North
Korean agent, who was not captured.
   The North Korean agent, Lee Chul, was awarded a top government
medal for the Taegu mission, he said.
   Four South Korean civilians were killed and two others wounded
in an explosion in front of the U.S. cultural center in Taegu in
September, 1983. No suspects were arrested but police announced at
that time that the explosion was believed to be the work of North
Korean agents.
   Suh defected to South Korea on Sept. 17 after swimming across a
river that flows along the Demilitarized Zone separating the two
Koreas.
   He said there are six units in North Korea trained in commando
attacks on South Korea. He claimed their main mission is to
assassinate South Korean leaders and sabotage government offices,
airports and industrial facilities.
   Suh said each unit has about 200 members and is under direct
control of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party. Suh's said his unit
was based in North Korea's border city of Kaesung.
   During the news conference, Suh demonstrated his commando
skills, throwing a dagger at a target seven yards away and rolling
over the floor while aiming a submachine gun.

<HEAD>West German Party Asks to Join Legal Actions Against Atlantis Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German political party is asking to
join in legal actions to delay the launch of Atlantis, hoping to
gain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclear cargo
before the world court.
   ``Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we represent
them,'' said Lanny Sinkin, a lawyer for the Christic Institute _
one of three environmental groups that on Tuesday lost an attempt
to get a temporary restraining order against the launch.
   Atlantis is to be launched next week with the nuclear-powered
Galileo space probe in its cargo bay. After release from the
shuttle, Galileo is to embark on a six-year journey to the planet
Jupiter.
   The U.S. environmental groups had asked that the launch be
halted on grounds that NASA had not fulfilled its environmental
requirements and that an accident could poison the atmosphere with
deadly plutonium-238. The petition by the Green Party, delivered to
Sinkin in the midst of the hearing, cites possible violation of an
international treaty.
   ``They were asking for a 10-day temporary restraining order so
they could determine whether to go to the World Court, or whether
to approach the German government to intervene formally,'' Sinkin
said. He said it is his understanding that only a government can
enforce a treaty.
   The Green Party is a political party focused on environmental
issues and has some seats in the West German Parliament.
   ``Their claim is a violation of the outer space treaty signed in
1967 that both Germany and the United States have ratified,''
Sinkin said. ``One provision says activities in space exploration
by one country will not harm activities of another country. They
are concerned about the potential for plutonium contamination of
Germany.''
   The signatories to the treaty also agreed not to introduce
harmful contaminants into space and ``there is concern about the
potential of introducing both plutonium and biological life into
Jupiter's atmosphere because Galileo is not sterilized,'' Sinkin
said.
   The U.S. environmental groups have said they intend to carry
their fight against the launch to higher courts, but no further
legal actions had been filed.
   The newspaper Florida Today first reported the Germans' attempt
to intervene. The motion to join in the suit was filed on behalf of
the Green Party by Helmut Lippelt, secretary to the lower house of
West Germany's Parliament.
   ``As graphically demonstrated to the people of Germany by the
Chernobyl accident, such releases (of plutonium) can drastically
affect people situated far from the site of the accident,'' the
Greens' court motion says.
   ``The amount of plutonium on the Galileo mission exceeds the
inventory of radioactivity in the Chernobyl reactor at the time of
the accident,'' it said.
   NASA attorney Edward Frankle said the government will counter
additional legal maneuvers.
   ``Any further attempts to get an injunction or change the
current status, we will object to,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Nothing Wrong in Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior Republican member of the House
Armed Services Committee says he sees nothing wrong in accepting a
one-third interest in an investment venture funded by a businessman
whose companies have done $50 million in government defense work
since 1987.
   Rep. William L. Dickinson, R-Ala., said Wednesday he approached
Montgomery, Ala., industrialist Ben Collier in 1986 with ``what I
thought was a good business opportunity'' and Collier agreed to put
up $300,000.
   Dickinson said he supplied the ``contacts'' for the Montgomery
Investment Club and the two men agreed that any profits or losses
would be shared one-third by Dickinson and two-thirds by Collier.
   But the business opportunity soured when the $300,000 was turned
over to Steven A. Streit of Huntsville, Ala., whose claims of
unusually high investment earnings had attracted some 300
investors. Streit eventually pleaded guilty to securities fraud and
was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Streit's assets were frozen in early 1987, and Dickinson said
the investment club has received about 90 percent of the $300,000
from a bankruptcy clerk that is serving Streit's creditors.
   Dickinson said he does not think his one-third interest in the
investment club violates a House ethics rule that prohibits members
from accepting gifts of more than $100 from any individual who has
a direct interest in legislation before Congress.
   ``If he's got a direct interest in legislation I don't know what
it is,'' Dickinson said of Collier. ``He's never asked me to vote
any way, I don't know of any legislation he's interested in and
that's as far as it goes.''
   He said he saw nothing ``illegal, immoral or unethical'' in the
deal.
   Collier owns 45 percent of American Apparel Co., which was
formed in 1987 after Collier and several associates purchased the
assets of the bankrupt Selma Apparel Co.
   The firm now has three plants in Alabama, and according to Rick
Cippele, a part owner of the company, has received $48.6 million in
uniform contracts awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency after
competitive bidding.
   Collier also owns half interest in National Microsystems, a
Montgomery company that manufactures electronics components and
test equipment for the aerospace, automobile and appliance
industries.
   Mark Chesnutt, director of public affairs for National
Microsystems, said $3 million of the company's $9 million in total
revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense
contractors, United Technologies Corp. and GTE Government Systems.
   Dickinson said he has promoted National Microsystems among
defense contractors, just as he has promoted other businesses in
his district that are interested in Pentagon work.
   But he said he had nothing to do with Collier's purchase of the
assets of Selma Apparel, or with the new company's subsequent
approval by the Pentagon as an acceptable bidder on defense
contracts.
   Before Collier began negotiating to buy the bankrupt firm,
Dickinson said he signed a letter along with other members of the
Alabama delegation urging the Pentagon to save 600 Alabama jobs by
permiting Selma Apparel to resume bidding on defense contracts.
   The company had been barred from bidding after its owner, James
Utsey of Philadelphia, was convicted of federal bid-rigging charges.
   After Collier submitted his bid to bankruptcy court, lawmakers
again urged the Pentagon to allow American Apparel to bid on
government contracts. Dickinson was the only member of the Alabama
delegation who did not sign the letter, according to Walter
Braswell, an aide to Rep. Claude Harris, who initiated the letter.

   A federal judge threw out a subpoena
ordering Gov. Guy Hunt to testify at a hearing for a lawmaker
accused of influence peddling.
   Rep. Lewis Spratt and two other black Democrats are charged with
extortion stemming from efforts by a former legislator to open a
dog track.
   Spratt had subpoenaed the Republican governor, U.S. Attorney Jim
Wilson, and Wilson's predecessor, John Bell, to testify Oct. 20.
Spratt's attorney said he would show that black Democrats were
singled out by white GOP prosecutors.
   But on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Truman Hobbs granted a
motion by Hunt's attorneys to quash the subpoena. The hearing was
scheduled to consider Spratt's request for dismissal of the charges
based on racial discrimination.
   Hunt press secretary Terry Abbott said the governor is ``just
not involved'' in the case against Spratt.
   Spratt and Reps. Bobbie McDowell and E.B. McClain were indicted
in connection with effort by former state Rep. Hugh Boles to open a
pari-mutuel dog track at Bessemer. Spratt is accused of agreeing to
support Boles' measure in the Legislature in return for a promise
of stock options in the track.
   Boles was convicted in August of conspiracy and extortion.
   Spratt's lawyer, Carlos Williams, had claimed that prosecutors
ignored evidence of exortion and perjury by Hunt during his tenure
as state director of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.
   Hunt denied any wrongdoing while he held the federal job. He
resigned the post in 1985 amid allegations he tried to use his
office for political purposes and tried to impede the
investigation. The investigation was later dropped.

   The House Foreign Affairs Committee is
pressing an $837.5 million aid plan for Poland and Hungary, nearly
double the assistance proposed by President Bush, to encourage
those nations as they move toward democracy and free-market change.
   The committee endorsed the package 35-0 on Wednesday, choosing a
middle road between Bush's $455.5 million proposal and the $1.2
billion urged by Senate Democrats.
   The full House is expected to act on the three-year aid
authorization measure next week.
   ``Success with our help is uncertain, but failure without our
assistance is guaranteed,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., moments
before the bill was approved.
   Some Republican members said they were concerned the House bill
proposes too much spending and Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich.,
said a smaller amount is likely to emerge from the congressional
appropriations process.
   But most members said the legislation is an appropriate and
urgently needed response to democratic and free-market movements in
both Poland and Hungary.
   The House bill includes the $200 million to help Poland
stabilize its currency which Bush proposed last week, a move many
Democrats said was caused by congressional pressure to do more.
   The Bush administration took no position on the overall measure,
which builds on and expands U.S. assistance originally proposed by
the president.
   The legislation would authorize spending $837.5 million to aid
Poland and Hungary over the next three years, including $284
million in the 1990 fiscal year which began on Oct. 1.
   The largest share of the money is earmarked for Poland's new
non-communist government, which is beset with galloping inflation
and other serious economic problems.
   The House bill would authorize $200 million to operate
``enterprise funds'' to speed economic change in the two countries.
Bush has proposed spending $125 million for that purpose.
   The bill would boost the $100 million proposed by Bush for food
and livestock feed to a minimum of $125 million.
   Hamilton said the bill addresses an ``extraordinarily unique''
opportunity to wean Eastern Europe away from communism.
   ``This is an opportunity that may not come again for a long,
long time and I think we should grab it and run,'' said Rep. Robert
J. Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said the aid will
``lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when
you think of the enormity of the changes'' Poland and Hungary will
have to make to transform their state-run economies.
   ``I can only say that after four decades in which we spent
literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of
Western Europe, this is a relatively modest amount to spend to
promote the unravelling of communism in Eastern Europe,'' said Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.

<HEAD>Safety Board Calls for Testing Safety of Small School Buses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials say small school
buses lack standards that apply to larger buses and some have been
modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, meeting late
Wednesday, called for improved front door latches on all small
school buses and government tests to further improve the safety of
vehicles they say are already among the safest on the road.
   The board rejected earlier staff recommendations for full-scale
crash tests but called for tests using computer simulation and
crash sleds to determine the best design for barriers and seat
belts in school buses that carry from 10 to 24 passengers.
   The nation's 41,000 small school buses do not have to meet
federal standards set for larger buses, the NTSB staff noted.
   The board voted to call for installation of door latches that
would prevent a bus's front door from popping open in a crash. It
also urged federal testing of several possible improvements,
including lap and shoulder belts in front seats, uniform barriers
in front of the first seats and strengthened roofs and joints.
   ``In multivehicle crashes and other crash scenarios, small
school buses lack the built-in crash advantage of superior size and
weight provided by large school buses,'' the board concluded.
   But it also said investigation of 24 accidents involving the
smaller buses showed that they ``generally provided good crash
protection to both restrained and unrestrained passengers.''
   Safety belts are required for passengers in small buses, but the
NTSB staff said many students do not use them and lap-only belts in
the front seat may add to the danger of injury in some crashes.
   The board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger
buses since seats must be designed to form a padded compartment
around youthful riders.
   It said roofs in the smaller buses are less able to withstand
rollover forces and body joints are exempt from federal joint
strength standards that apply to larger buses.
   The board in August sent back the staff study for revisions
after failing to resolve questions over front-seat barriers and use
of seat belts in the buses.
   The staff proposed full-scale crash tests. But the four board
members present at the meeting refused to adopt that
recommendation. Sled-tests involve dummies on sliding devices that
simulate conditions of a crash rather than the destruction of an
actual school bus.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with dynamite found, trafficker arrested; reorganizes

<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government announced the arrests of
two suspected drug traffickers today and said it found 1,000 pounds
of dynamite hidden at a residence of one of Colombia's most
powerful cocaine kingpins.
   An Administrative Security Department spokeswoman said police
have arrested reputed trafficker Leonidas Vargas. She said she had
no information on the allegations against him or whether he is
wanted in the United States.
   But the newspaper El Espectador said Vargas ranks high in the
Medellin cocaine cartel and runs drug operations in the southern
state of Caqueta, where in recent years police have raided several
cocaine laboratories and seized tons of the drug.
   The paper said he was captured Wednesday at a ranch in the
central state of Tolima.
   The Administrative Security Department spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, also said police arrested Richard Houle of
Quebec and would deport him Friday to Canada.
   Houle was a fugitive since his conviction on charges related to
cocaine trafficking in Canada, the spokeswoman said. It was not
known when he was captured or how long he had been at large.
   On Wednesday, the government announced two arrests of
traffickers who were known to be wanted in the United States.
Manuel Palma was arrested Wednesday and Jose Abello Silva was
captured Tuesday in Bogota.
   Abello directed the Medellin cartel's operations on the
country's Atlantic coast, the Administrative Security Department
said. The office said in a communique that he had undergone facial
surgery to avoid being recognized.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Harri J. Kramer said
a federal grand jury in Tulsa, Okla., indicted Abello in 1987 on
charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine.
   Palma is wanted by federal authorities in Miami on charges of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an
operation to launder drug money, Kramer said.
   Kramer said the Justice Department had requested that Abello and
Palma be held for extradition.
   The army said today that it seized 1,000 pounds of dynamite at
the home of Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez-Gacha, a powerful Medellin
cocaine czar on the list of 12 Colombian drug barons most wanted by
the United States.
   The dynamite found Wednesday was in an underground storage area
that had a concealed door in the ground, the army's 13th Brigade
said in a communique. Six two-way portable radios, nine firearms
and hundreds of pamphlets with threats against the government also
were found, the army said.
   Since the drug traffickers and the governmment declared war on
each other, 161 dynamite bombs have exploded in Colombia's major
cities, killing 11 people and injuring 183.
   On Wednesday, El Espectador asked the government for protection
following the assassination of two employees in Medellin.
Traffickers claimed responsibility for Tuesday's killings and
threatened to kill the paper's 11 remaining employees in Medellin.
   El Espectador has been a strong supporter of the government's
anti-drug campaign. Its main offices were bombed last month and
several of its employees have been killed, including the publisher.
   Also Wednesday, Pablo Escobar, the reputed head of the Medellin
cartel, was quoted as saying in a letter that ``Colombian peace is
more important than the considerations and conceptions of the other
governments of the world.''
   The letter asked the director of La Prensa, a Bogota daily, to
intercede with the government and end its crackdown on drug gangs.
The letter was read by the Caracol radio network.
   The letter said La Prensa and other papers should act ``for the
sake of peace'' as go-betweens in negotiations between traffickers
and the government of President Virgilio Barco.
   Barco has said he will never negotiate with the traffickers
responsible for killing scores of the country's judges,
journalists, political leaders and police.
   Escobar heads the list of the 12 Colombian drug suspects most
wanted for extradition to the United States. None has been
apprehended.
   The main weapon in the government crackdown has been a promise
to extradite those wanted on drug charges in the United States.

   A woman was given five years in prison for
letting her infant daughter drown in the toilet where she was born.
   LaWonda Jean Warren, 32, was sentenced Wednesday by Judge Frank
Price, who convicted the woman of murder by omission in the 1985
death of her unnamed daughter.
   Ms. Warren testified she didn't realize it was labor pains she

court she managed to cut the umbilical cord with a disposable razor
before running outside for help.
   When firefighters arrived a half-hour later, the baby was
floating face-down in the water. An autopsy determined the baby was
alive at birth.

<TEXT>
   A terminally ill Defense Department employee
whose request for an Air Force air ambulance ride home to
Massachusetts was denied has died, his doctor said today.
   Avram Brody had sought an airlift from Palmdale, Calif., to his
family home in Norwood, Mass., so he could be with family members
when he died. The Air Force refused, saying Brody did not meet
criteria for such help because he was not a uniformed officer, the
flight was not needed to save his life and his illness was not
caused by his work.
   Dr. Abdallah Farrukh, who attended Brody over the past several
weeks, said in a telephone interview from Antelope Valley, Calif.,
that Brody, 25, died Wednesday night of a brain tumor in his
Palmdale home.
   There was no anwer this morning at Brody's home where his wife,
Amy, and a nurse have been attending him for the past several weeks.
   The Brody family enlisted the help of several U.S.
representatives along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and White
House aide Andrew Card, a Massachusetts native. But the Air Force
position remained unchanged.
   Another who worked on the case was Brad Pearson of the
Massachusetts Office of Handicapped Affairs.
   ``This one's a real sadness for the family. It's a heartbreaking
time,'' Pearson said today. ``I'm going to wonder probably for the
rest of my life if we didn't do too little, too late on this one. I
wish we could have gotten them home.''
   Pearson said of the Air Force position, ``I think that their
regulations ignored a very sad and simple reality.''
   Following publicity about the Air Force refusal to provide an
air ambulance, several private companies and individuals offered to
provide a ride for free. But by then Brody's condition had
deteriorated to the point where he could no longer be moved.

   Abortion rights leaders claim an
``unprecedented turnaround'' is putting anti-abortion forces on the
political run following defeats in the U.S. House and a special
legislative session in Florida.
   And in Virginia, Democratic candidate for governor Douglas
Wilder is challenging political wisdom on abortion by airing
pro-choice television ads aimed at winning support among
conservative voters.
   ``This is evidence that the anti-choice minority no longer
inspires fear in elected officials,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   Leaders of the national abortion rights group today unveiled new
TV and newspaper ads they are airing in the Virginia governor's
race attacking the anti-abortion Republican nominee and said they
planned extensive campaigns next year in races nationwide.
   ``We are building a strength in the states that, if we need one,
we can pass a constitutional amendment'' to protect abortion
rights, Michelman said.
   The House voted 216-206 on Wednesday to allow federal aid for
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest,
rejecting Medicaid restrictions it has kept in the law since 1981.
It instead backed more liberal provisions already passed by the
Senate.
   The vote was a defeat for conservatives and put Congress in
opposition to President Bush, who has promised to veto Medicaid
abortions.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., attributed the vote to an
abortion rights movement galvanized by the Supreme Court's decision
in July giving the states more power to restrict abortions.
   ``The Webster decision was a wakeup call,'' she said.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., for years the leader of anti-abortion
forces in the House, said House members are increasingly
``perceiving their constituencies as pro-choice.''
   Darla St. Martin, leader of the National Right to Life
Committee, said the vote ``opens the door to the use of tax funds
to destroy innocent unborn babies'' and vowed that members who
switched on the issue ``will now hear from constituents.''
   In Tallahassee, Fla., a special session of the state legislature
called by Gov. Bob Martinez rejected a series of proposed
restrictions on abortions that the Republican governor sought.
   ``A right, having been established, is not easily removed,''
said Tom Gustafson, Florida's speaker of the House.
   Martinez, appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
program, insisted today that most Floridians wanted certain
restrictions on abortions but that a handful of state legislators
kept colleagues from voting on measures he had proposed.
   ``They were rejected by killer committees. They didn't get to
the floor, unlike the action taken by Congress,'' Martinez said.
   The Florida session was the first in the nation since the July 3
Supreme Court ruling gave the longstanding debate over abortion a
fresh and relevant political focus.
   Florida was closely watched as a bellwether for the nation, and
more than 10,000 demonstrators had descended upon its capital.
   In Virginia, idependent polls show Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Wilder overtaking his anti-abortion opponent since he
began airing a tough ad accusing Republican Marshall Coleman of
trying to take away women's right to a legal abortion, even in
cases of rape and incest.
   Coleman accused Wilder of trying ``to spread fear _ fear from a
single, divisive issue.'' The election is in four weeks.
   Michelman, head of the national abortion rights group, said the
votes in Florida and in Congress ``are overwhelming evidence of the
dramatic and unprecedented turnaround among elected officials on
this issue.''
   She credited abortion rights demonstrators and dismissed the
anti-abortion forces as ``a small minority whose electoral bite
does not match their bark.''
   Supporters of expanded abortion rights argued the Supreme
Court's ruling in the Webster case mobilized their side by making
the possibility of new abortion restrictions seem more likely _ and
in the process prompted some abortion supporters to become
single-issue voters, just as some abortion opponents have been.
   The provision adopted by the House would allow Medicaid payments
for abortions when the mother's life is in jeopardy or when the
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest _ and was ``promptly''
reported to authorities.
   Since 1981 the House has voted for language allowing federal aid
for abortions only in cases in which the woman's life was in
danger. Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been
restricted in one way or another since 1977.
   The abortion provision is part of a $156.7 billion measure to
finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which
began Oct. 1. The spending bill, which was approved 364-56, now
moves to the Senate.
   Bush threatened in August to veto the bill if it contains the
more liberal abortion language, and administration officials
reiterated that threat this week.
   Though the House vote was too narrow to override a veto,
supporters of broader abortion rights said changing public views in
the wake of the Supreme Court ruling have given their side the
momentum.
   ``The political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if
President Bush vetoes this, he'd be making a big mistake,'' said
Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
   ``Webster has changed the entire political equation,'' said Rep.
Les AuCoin, D-Ore., who voted to broaden the abortion funding.
``Webster sent a signal to the country, particularly women, that
the courts aren't there, that they'll have to rely on the political
arena.''

   Panamanian officers who led last week's
abortive coup were recruited and paid more than $1 million by the
U.S. government, Gen. Manuel Noriega charged in an interview
published today.
   Noriega also claimed that Nicaraguan Contras and Panamanian
businessmen delivered money and relayed messages between U.S.
officials and coup plotters, the Los Angeles Times and The Boston
Globe reported.
   ``The United States was involved before, during and after the
coup,'' Noriega said in a joint interview. ``They had to make the
contacts, woo them, convince them. It's a lot of work before you've
hooked the fish. But they were the hook and the useful fools were
the fish.''
   ``The Contras put them in contact with the United States,''
Noriega said of the coup leaders.
   The military ruler said that forces loyal to him detained 77
rebel soldiers after the attempted coup. Previous reports said 37
soldiers were arrested.
   The two reporters conducting the interview received stern
warnings from a Noriega aide to avoid questioning Noriega about
allegations that 10 of those arrested have been executed, the Times
said.
   Noriega, according to the Globe, said that he had crushed two
plots from within the defense forces, the second being planned
under the direction of Col. Guillermo Wong, chief of intelligence
and a member of Noriega's general staff. He said that on the day of
the coup, Wong received several long-distance calls from an
unidentified U.S. military officer in Washington. He said Wong is
under arrest.
   He also there was no truth to reports he had been detained
during the coup attempt. ``I dominated the situation totally,'' he
said. ``When I started to talk with them, it was all over.''
   Noriega, speaking in Panama City, Panama, accused Everett E.
Briggs, the U.S. National Security Council's senior director of
Latin American affairs, of involvement in the failed coup.
   Briggs, who has served as U.S. ambassador to Panama and
Honduras, where the Contras were based, was linked to the coup
because he visited Panama shortly before the uprising, Noriega said.
   There was no comment from Briggs or any NSC official in the
newspaper reports.
   Noriega said his investigators discovered the existence of a
bank account containing more than $1 million in the name of Capt.
Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders.
   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Six
zeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' Noriega said.
   He claimed U.S. officials gave Murillo the money for bribes, but
would not identify the bank holding the alleged account.
   Murillo, a member of the Panama Defense Forces' elite Battalion
2000, was one of 10 officers the government said was killed during
the uprising.
   Noriega said one of the detained soldiers was found with
$700,000 in cash, allegedly used to bribe rank-and-file soldiers.
He said the soldier remained in custody but refused to identify him.
   He claimed the attempted coup was organized by 17 members of the
Panama Defense Forces, Noriega said.
   He said several coup leaders had ties with Contras established
during attendance at the Nicaraguan Military Academy before the
leftist Sandinistas overthrew Nicaraguan leader Anastasio Somoza in
1979.
   Noriega named Panamanian Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, the reputed
leader of this month's coup attempt, and Capt. Edgardo Sandoval as
onetime students of the Nicaraguan military school.
   He said Sandoval was a classmate of Luis Alfonso Moreno Payan, a
member of the Nicaraguan National Guard who later joined the
U.S.-backed Contras and operated under the name Mike Lima.
   He said other Contras and Panamanian businessmen were involved,
but declined to name them.
   Asked how he could protect himself against any future coups,
Noriega said:
   ``The world was created with good men and bad. Abel didn't know
Cain was going to kill him. ... The significance of this is that
the Defense Forces now wears the long pants.
   ``How do you consolidate an armed force? On the basis of your
errors.''

   A lawyers' organization and two consumer
groups want the government to investigate a household drain cleaner
they contend poses a risk of explosions that can cause serious
injury.
   But the manufacturer says the product is ``safe and effective
when used in accordance with label instructions'' and accused the
attorneys of trying to drum up business.
   ``On any given occasion, using (the product) is akin to playing
Russian roulette,'' wrote Russ Herman, president of the Association
of American Trial Lawyers, in an Oct. 5 letter to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   ``Even by explicitly following the product instructions,
consumers may experience the risk of sudden, violent explosion with
tragic consequences to their health and safety,'' Herman said.
   The name of the product is blacked out in a copy of the letter
obtained by The Associated Press. A source familiar with the
letter, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the product
as Red Devil Lye.
   Rhonda Askew, a Denver woman who is disfigured and partially
blind, told a news conference today she was injured when a
tablespoon of the drain cleaner ``blew back on me'' as she used it
to clear a clogged bathroom sink.
   ``I could see it coming but I couldn't get away from it,'' said
Askew.
   ``I don't know what it feels like to be happy. ...I don't know
joy,'' she said, describing how she has had 10 operations since the
incident.
   The lawyers association first contacted the commission about
potential dangers associated with the product in August. Two
consumer advocacy groups, the Consumer Federation of America and
Public Citizen, also are seeking an investigation.
   Red Devil Lye is a crsytalline drain cleaner manufactured and
distributed by a New York-based company, Boyle Midway Household
Products Inc.
   ``We have made repeated attempts to produce the `explosive'
effect described by ATLA using the product according to label
directions and have never seen such results,'' said Theodore Host,
president of Boyle Midway, in a written statement released
Wednesday.
   ``ATLA is engaged in a transparent effort to promote the
economic interests of its members by this blatant client-soliciting
effort,'' said Host.
   ATLA is a 65,000-member organization of attorneys who frequently
represent plaintiffs in personal injury cases.
   ATLA said it found 21 instances when the lye ``exploded from
drain pipes and injured users or bystanders.'' In addition, there
were reported incidents of ``ingestion by small children, with
catastrophic results,'' the letter said.
   ``The risk of blindness or permanent eye impairment is high;
severe alkaline burns to the face, arms and hands also are
likely,'' Herman said.
   ``We are convinced that this product, which is intended to deal
with a difficult household problem, is safe and effective when used
in accordance with label instructions,'' said Host.
   ``Any assertion that the product cannot be used safely by the
consumer is wholly unwarranted,'' Host added, noting the company
warns on the label that lye is a dangerous product on the label.
   David Smeltzer, head of the safety commission's compliance
division, said the commission had done preliminary investigations
of two companies that make crystalline lye. He said it revealed
more instances of explosions with liquid sulfuric acid drain
cleaners than with sodium hydroxide cleaners such as Red Devil Lye.
   ``If appropriate, we'll try to take some other action,'' he
said. The company said it was cooperating with the commission.
   Red Devil sales reached about $6 million in 1988 for a 6 percent
share of the drain cleaner market, the company said.

   An armed man burst into a home
where his estranged wife and stepson were staying, tied them up and
set the house on fire, killing two women, authorities said.
   The stepson and the boy's grandfather escaped before the house
went up in flames, officials said.
   Police today searched for Gary Raymond Newman, 40, who had two
previous arrests for domestic violence and was released from jail
last week.
   The victims' identities were withheld.
   Newman, armed with a shotgun, entered the house about 9 p.m.
Wednesday. His estranged wife and stepson were staying with his
wife's parents there, said sheriff's Sgt. Beth Bascom.
   ``He took his stepson, his estranged wife and his estranged
wife's parents hostage, tied them up in the residence and separated
them,'' said Bascom.
   The boy escaped and ran to a neighbor's home to call police,
Bascom said. The grandfather, 76, also got away after having his
throat slashed, she said. His condition was not immediately known.
   When deputies reached the home, it was engulfed in flames,
Bascom said. Later, authorities recovered the bodies of two women
from the home, she said.
   Glenwood Springs is about 120 miles west of Denver.

   Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega made
millions of dollars from his investment in a lab that made steroids
for the black market, authorities said.
   Milano Laboratories of Mexico, in Tijuana's border industrial
zone, was shut down by police in April. At the time, U.S.
authorities said it was the largest supplier of steroids to a
multimillion-dollar U.S. black market.
   Noriega invested $800,000 two years ago in the lab, and his
return of about $2 million was put back into the company several
times, said Enrique Guillermo Salazar, commander of the federal
judicial police in Tijuana.
   ``We are still working to see exactly how much money was
involved, but it was many millions of dollars,'' Salazar said
Wednesday.
   Salazar said the lab was shut down because of false labeling. He
said agents found a warehouse full of steroids, antibiotics and
vitamins along with boxes of labels claiming the drugs were made by
pharmaceutical companies in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.
   Agents also found business documents signed by Noriega, said
Salazar.
   Milano Laboratories president Juan Macklis Mercado was arrested
in Mexico City's airport Monday when he arrived in disguise from
Japan, authorities said. He was charged with evading taxes of about
$500,000.
   Many other suspects are thought to be living in the United
States, probably in San Diego, authorities said.
   Manufacturing anabolic steroids is legal in Mexico, where the
muscle-building drug is sold over the counter, but they are legally
obtainable in the United States by prescription only.
   Studies have shown that long-term use can cause heart disease,
liver failure and other maladies.

   A vandal broke into a pigeon farm and
strangled and clubbed 300 baby birds valued at about $8,000.
   The squabs were apparently killed on Monday and discovered
Tuesday morning at the Palmetto Pigeon Plant, said general manager
Tony Barwick. The farm has raised squab since the 1920s and ships
the delicacy around the world.
   Workers had to find new parents for orphaned fledglings and move
the eggs of the dead birds into incubators, Barwick said.
   Barwick said he was particularly upset because the company was
trying to recover from damage caused by Hurricane Hugo. A security
fence was knocked down and the plant was without water for at least
a day after the storm.
   The intruder may have gotten in through the broken fence, the
Sheriff's Department said.
   No arrests have been made.

<TEXT>
   Panama will not be allowed back into the Group
of Eight organization of Latin American nations until democracy is
restored there, President Carlos Menem of Argentina said today.
   His announcement came a day after the presidents of Venezuela
and Peru broke with tradition at the regional summit and denounced
Panama's government, which Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega effectively
heads, as a dictatorship.
   The summit ends tonight.
   Menem told a news conference that a document released at the end
of the meeting will outline the decision to continue Panama's
exclusion from the organization.
   The Central American country was suspended last year after
Noriega engineered the removal of civilian President Eric Delvalle
after Delvalle tried to fire him.
   The final document also will include full backing for the
struggle of the coca-producing Andean nations against the region's
cocaine traffickers, Menem said.
   One of the principal points the presidents agreed on was an
``all-out war against drug trafficking and terrorism until they are
liquidated,'' he told reporters.
   The leaders met under heavy security at the plush Hotel Las
Dunas on the outskirts of Ica, a city of 350,000 people in the
desert 180 miles southeast of Lima.
   In opening statements Wednesday, President Carlos Andres Perez
of Venezuela said Panama's military government is a ``masked
dictatorship.'' The comment came one day after he accused Noriega's
Panama Defense Forces of murder in snuffing out a coup attempt Oct.
3.
   Peru's Alan Garcia, host of the meeting, used his opening
remarks to ``express publicly the Peruvian people's and the
Peruvian government's repudiation and condemnation of the military
dictatorship'' in Panama.
   Their condemnations broke with the traditional reluctance of
Group of Eight nations to publicly denounce a member at such
meetings.
   The summit began a day after Garcia, Colombia's Virgilio Barco
and Bolivia's Jaime Paz Zamora agreed to invite President Bush to a
drug summit in Latin America that would take place within 90 days.
Bush accepted immediately.
   The three Andean nations are the source of nearly all of the
world's cocaine.
   Perez and the other presidents made clear Wednesday they did not
share Bush's focus on police action as the best way to fight the
drug trade.
   ``The more demand grows in the North, the more production will
grow in the South. Police actions will be useless unless demand is
reduced,'' Perez said.
   ``The problem is not only in Medellin,'' said President Julio
Sanguinetti of Uruguay, referring to the Colombian city that is
home to the world's largest cocaine cartel. ``It is also in the
streets of New York City.''
   The Medellin cartel has virtually been at war with the Colombian
government since suspected drug assassins killed the country's
leading presidential candidate Aug. 18.
   Perez, Sanguinetti, Garcia, Barco and presidents Jose Sarney of
Brazil, Menem, and Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico took part in
the third summit of the Group of Eight, which was founded in 1987.
   Other topics on the summit agenda were Central America's
conflicts, the regional foreign debt burden and environmental
damage to the Amazon.

   A veteran big game hunter was gored to
death by an elephant after a group of people he was escorting
disturbed a herd of the beasts, officials said Thursday.
   The body of Alan Lowe was found in the northeast Zimbabwe bush
Oct. 6.
   Lowe, a Zimbabwean in his 50s, had ordered the party of hunters
into their vehicle for safety during an encounter with the herd of
elephant cows and calves, government wildlife officials said.
   Lowe then crept back to see when it would be clear to travel on
through the bush. That was the last the other hunters saw of him.
   When he didn't return, a tracker went looking for him and found
the body, gored in the back.
   ``The jumbo must have sneaked up on him from behind while he was
watching the rest of the herd,'' the wildlife official said. ``Alan
was a very experienced hunter.''

Candidates' semifinal with Jan Timman of the Netherlands until
Saturday.
   After six rounds of the eight-game series Timman leads 3{-2{. A

   Speelman is expected to use the free days to sharpen his opening
preparation and go all out for the victory he needs in the last two
games.
   With their time outs all taken, the fifth game between former
world champion Anatoly Karpov and fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov will
be played Thursday.
   Karpov leads 2{-1{ after four games.
   The winner of the candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov of the Soviet for his title in a 24-game
match starting in October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face
off in the candidates' final in March.
   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two more games will be
played, followed, if necessary, by sudden death tie-breakers.

<TEXT>
   The City Opera, New York's No. 2 company behind
the Metropolitan, canceled its fall season today and threatened to
scratch its spring program unless its striking musicians agree to a
contract by next month.
   The 69-member musicians union has been without a contract since
June 1 and struck on Sept. 13, opening night of the fall season. On
Saturday, the union voted 56-4 to reject a pact, and the opera said
at the time that the season, scheduled to end Nov. 19, would be
canceled if the orchestra members did not return.
   ``Obviously, we are extremely saddened by this development
because it puts out of work hundreds of innocent people who rely on
these jobs for their livelihood and whose representatives have
urgently requested these parties to avoid this result,'' Martin
Oppenheimer, the company's vice chairman and lead negotiator, said
today.
   John Glasel, president of the union local, said that the
cancellation is regrettable and that the opera management's
deadline for reaching a contract ``exemplifies the Neanderthal
negotiating style of the company.''
   The opera and its musicians have been divided over wages and the
number of work weeks that orchestra members are guaranteed
annually. Musicians earned $755 a week under the old contract.
   Established in 1943, the non-profit City Opera stages a Broadway
musical revival in the spring and begins its summer opera season in
July.

   The memoirs of the man who marched beside the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. depict him as a leader of outstanding
moral character but who had a weakness for women, even on the night
before his assassination.
   ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' published this month by
Harper &amp; Row, chronicles the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy's life as a
preacher and civil rights activist, including his many years as
King's closest friend and confidant.
   Abernathy reveals that King had encounters with various women on
the night before his April 4, 1968, assassination at a Memphis,
Tenn., hotel.
   The revelation corroborates longstanding reports that King had
extramarital affairs.
   But in an advance copy of the book, Abernathy staunchly defends
his friend's morality, without condoning his activities. He
explains that he felt compelled to write of ``my friend's weakness
for women,'' and devotes part of one chapter in the 610-page book
to King's private affairs.
   King ``believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside
of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time
with that temptation,'' Abernathy wrote. ``We all fall short of the
mark. ... Sexual sins are by no means the worst. Hatred and a cold
disregard for others are the besetting sins of our time.''
   Abernathy said he might have avoided the matter had others not
dealt with it in detail.
   He said he wanted ``to make some attempt to render justice to
the dead without causing too much unnecessary pain to the living.''
   Abernathy names none of the women with whom King allegedly was
involved. He said extended travels during the civil rights movement
were one reason, but not the main one, for King's extramarital
liaisons.
   ``He was ... a man who attracted women, even when he didn't
intend to, and attracted them in droves,'' Abernathy said. ``He was
a hero _ the greatest hero of his age _ and women are always
attracted to a hero.''
   Abernathy praised his friend for courage, saying had King ``been
a coward rather than a truly brave man ... we might still be riding
in the back of buses and eating in segregated restaurants.''
   He also said he felt other King aides saw him as ``no more than
an appendage to Martin, someone who served as a part companion,
part bodyguard, but who never played an important role in the
decisions that affected the direction of the movement.''
   Abernathy said those people did not realize how much King
depended on him for advice and counsel outside the limelight.
   Detailing the night before King's assassination, Abernathy wrote
that after King's ``I have been to the mountaintop'' address, King,
Abernathy and a colleague went to the home of ``a `friend' of
Martin's.''
   Abernathy saw King and the friend come out of the bedroom after
1 a.m., according to the book's advance copy.
   Later that night, back at the Lorraine Motel, King got together
with ``a black woman ... a member of the Kentucky Legislature''
with whom he shared a ``close'' relationship, Abernathy wrote. He
added that King did not return to the room he shared with Abernathy
until after 7 a.m.
   That morning, King asked Abernathy to mediate a dispute between
King and a third woman _ ``another young woman Martin knew well'' _
who apparently had come looking for King in the middle of the night
and couldn't find him. In an ensuing argument, King shouted at the
woman and ``knocked her across the bed,'' Abernathy wrote.
   The Kentucky Legislature had two black women members in 1968,
Sen. Georgia Powers and Rep. Mae Street Kidd, Democrats from
Louisville.
   Powers, who participated in civil rights demonstrations with
King, was at the Lorraine Motel the night of his assassination. On
Wednesday she said she had not read the book and was advised by her
lawyer not to comment until she had.
   She did not immediately return a call to her home today.
   Kidd, who also is no longer in the Legislature, said King was
``a great man ... but he was not a personal friend of mine. I did
not participate in any of the marches, nor was I in Memphis,
Tennessee, at the time he was there.''
   Abernathy also wrote he saw no evidence that King was disturbed
by FBI audio tapes of one of his sexual encounters or the knowledge
that FBI agents were spreading tales about his activity.
   ``In fact, he seemed less concerned about public exposure than I
was,'' Abernathy wrote. ``At that particular time, he was bearing a
lion's share of the burden and he felt he couldn't do so without
this source of strength.''
   Stoney Johnson, a spokesman at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, said he believed King's
widow, Coretta Scott King, and other family members had not yet
read Abernathy's book.
   A call to Mrs. King's office at the center was not immediately
returned.

   The Legislature's flat-out rejection of
new abortion curbs may give women their best political springboard
since the '60s, feminists say. But anti-abortion activists say
they, too, will be galvanized.
   ``It has fanned the fire,'' said Florida Right to Life President
Ken Connor. ``It's one thing to disappoint people. It's another
thing to slap them in the face. That's what the Legislature has
done.''
   In the nation's first major attempt to take advantage of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in July allowing new curbs on abortion, the
Legislature adjourned Wednesday without passing any of the measures
pushed by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``Florida has just sent a message to the nation,'' said Eleanor
Smeal, president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority and a former
president of the National Organization for Women.
   More than 10,000 demonstrators descended upon Florida's capital
as the Democratic-controlled Legislature shot down 14 proposals to
curb abortion.
   Martinez, appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
insisted today that most Floridians wanted certain restrictions on
abortions but that a handful of legislators kept colleagues from
voting on measures he had proposed.
   ``They were rejected by killer committees. They didn't get to
the floor, unlike the action taken by Congress,'' he said.
   The proposals would have banned use of public funds for
abortions, required a husband's consent, made women wait a week and
undergo counseling before the operation, created a statewide center
to promote adoption and required viability tests of the fetus if a
woman was believed to be 20 weeks pregnant.
   Other measures killed would have toughened clinic regulations,
an idea lawmakers had given the best chance of approval after three
south Florida clinics were closed by the state for unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.
   The defeat had been predicted by Democratic leaders who said the
first-term Republican governor knew it would happen.
   ``He wasted taxpayers' money to make a political statement that
he felt was going to help him,'' said Democratic state Chairman
Simon Ferro. ``We ought to be embarrassed that the governor put us
through this whole fiasco.''
   Opponents said the special session, which began Tuesday, cost
more than $145,000.
   Martinez, who faces re-election in 1990, conceded his initiative
had faltered badly.
   ``I don't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' said Martinez.
``If anything, it's a moment of sadness.''
   But Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way
Action Fund, a liberal political group, said the Legislature's
actions would make politicians across the country pay attention to
their constituents.
   ``Today's victory will be a rude wake-up call for politicians
hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive
freedom,'' Kropp said. ``Legislators in other states should take
heed: Pro-choice politics is winning politics, even in conservative
states.''
   Patricia Ireland, vice president of NOW, said the whole exercise
had the possibly unintended result of energizing younger,
previously apathetic women to fight for their rights.
   ``This is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had
since the 1960s,'' Ireland said. ``This is one of those junctures
where the political climate has clearly changed.''
   Smeal said abortion rights' organizations hoped to turn the new
interest into political gains by recruiting more women to run for
national, state and local office.
   State Rep. Elaine Gordon, a leader of the abortion-rights forces
in the Legislature, said the Florida experience can serve as a
blueprint elsewhere.
   ``I think that it encourages pro-choice movements in other
states,'' she said. ``We will be able to provide them the incentive
and the encouragement.''
   Anti-abortion activist Carole Griffin had similar thoughts.
``Our people are angry at what we've seen,'' she said. ``We are
preparing for the 1990 elections, and now we know more of our
targets.''
   For his part, Florida Right to Life's Connor said: ``What's next
is we go back to work. We field new candidates who affirm the
sanctity and dignity of human life. We explore the potential for a
constitutional amendment.''

   The hard-line Communist Party chief of Beijing
intensified the assault on political reforms with a call for direct
party decision-making in universities and local government, reports
said Thursday.
   Political principles should be the key factor in making
decisions, the Beijing Daily quoted the city's party secretary, Li
Ximing, as telling a local committee meeting.
   Party branches also should be involved in all decisions in
factories, even such small matters as firing and allocating staff,
Li said.
   It was the second attack in as many days in the Beijing Daily on
the political reform program endorsed by the party in 1987 that
called for separating the functions of the ruling party and
government, and reducing interference of party officials in
business and other non-party matters.
   A major commentary in the paper Wednesday charged that such
separation weakened the party, and blamed the reform program on
ousted party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang even though it
originally was backed by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The Communist Party long has maintained a shadow bureaucracy in
government and business, with party officials supervising and
frequently taking charge of all decisions.
   In the reform atmosphere of the past decade, however, excessive
party inteference was condemned and the power of party branches
were weakened in many units.
   In a major speech endorsed by the party in 1987, Zhao said
separating party and government roles and letting factory managers
take charge of production was essential for China's development.
   But since Zhao's ouster in June for allegedly supporting massive
pro-democracy protests, strengthening the party has become the
leadership's No. 1 goal.
   The Beijing Daily quoted Li as saying the party must ``bring
into full play the powerful fighting force of the party branches.''
   ``In universities ... street party committees that function as
district organs and party committees at village level and below,
the party will not participate in decision making but make the
decisions,'' he said.
   Street committees and village committees are the most basic
level of local government, and have wide powers over job and
housing assignments.
   Enterprise managers should get agreement of party officials
before hiring or firing personnel, Li added. ``In dismissing
(enterprise) officials the party organization should act based on
political ideology, but should fully respect the administrative
leaders' views regarding ability.''
   ``Organizations at all levels of a ruling party must shoulder
the responsibility of managing (non-party) officials,'' he said.
   He also called for closer party involvement in the work of
China's many ``mass organizations,'' including labor unions and
women's assocations, ``so that they can follow the right political
direction.''

   A slender burglar tried to slide into a
restaurant through its rooftop ventilation system and got so hung
up on protruding screws that he had to scream for help, police said.
   ``He was scuffling up there trying to get out, cussing and
carrying on,'' said David Potter, manager of the Horn &amp; Horn
Smorgasboard.
   When the intruder began to yell, Gail Shank of the restaurant's
cleaning crew called the authorities. Officers and firefighters
could hear the screams as they arrived early Wednesday, Fire Chief
Paul L. Schaefer said.
   Police said Michael Charles Miller, 23, of York was extracted
from the foot-wide ventilation system and charged with burglary and
criminal trespassing.
   Between the burglar's cutting and lifting the exhaust system to
gain entry, and firefighters' dismantling of ductwork to free him,
about $500 to $600 in damage was done, Potter said.
   As for the burglar, Potter said, ``he needed a bath and new
clothes.''

<UNK>Judge Limits Airline's Ability to Collect From Plane Manufacturer</UNK>

   Northwest must show that McDonnell Douglas Corp.
knowingly sold it a defective plane if the airline is to collect
damages from the manufacturer in a jet crash that killed 156
people, a federal judge ruled.
   The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Julian Cook limits
the airline's ability to collect from the maker of the MD-80 that
crashed in 1987 on takeoff from Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Only
Cecelia Cichan, then 4, survived.
   Cook is presiding over the trial on a lawsuit by relatives of
crash victims that will determine who was at fault in the crash.
Jury selection began Oct. 2 and continued today.
   Northwest has claimed the plane had a faulty circuit breaker and
warning system that failed to warn the crew that the flaps had not
been set for takeoff. McDonnell Douglas has denied any problem with
the plane.
   The judge sided with the company's argument that the purchase
agreement for the $15 million aircraft absolved the maker of
liability unless Northwest could prove the knowing sale of a
defective product.
   Attorneys involved wouldn't comment. Cook has issued a gag order
for the duration of the trial.

   Jiang Zemin, a technocrat plucked from relative
obscurity to head the world's largest Communist Party, is being
remolded by party propagandists into a brilliant leader and man of
the masses.
   The glorification of the 63-year-old former mayor and party boss
of Shanghai follows Deng Xiaoping's decision to make Jiang his
successor as China's top leader.
   Some Chinese and foreign observers compare the laurels being
heaped on Jiang to the treatment given Hua Guofeng after a dying
Mao Tse-tung purportedly told him in 1976: ``With you in charge,
I'm at ease.''
   Hua, like Jiang a local administrator untested in national
politics, was hailed as China's ``wise leader'' until Deng
consolidated power in the late 1970s and Hua was unceremoniously
consigned to political oblivion.
   Jiang was the surprise choice to head the 48 million-member
Communist Party after the faction-riven party on June 24 ousted
Zhao Ziyang, a relative reformist accused of aiding the
pro-democracy student movement crushed earlier that month.
   Deng was believed to have picked Jiang because he supported
Deng's open-door policies while being ready to comply with the
party hard-liners' tough crackdown on domestic dissent.
   Despite the nature of his rise to power, the party has worked
hard to dispel the impression of dissension in the ranks by
declaring national unity behind Jiang's astute leadership.
   The party Propaganda Department on Sept. 30 called on all
Chinese to study Jiang's address to mark the 40th anniversary of
Communist rule on Oct. 1, saying it will have ``an important
bearing on the unity of the whole party, the whole army and people
of all nationalities.''
   The turgid 80-minute address summed up the party's stance on the
correctness of crushing the pro-democracy movement, or
``counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' the supremacy of socialism and
the inviolability of Communist Party rule.
   Since then, official newspapers and television news programs
have been filled with reports of schools, factories and local party
groups meeting to read and discuss Jiang's speech. The words of
praise are universal and remarkably similar.
   Yang Baibing, head of the General Political Department in the
People's Liberation Army, said the speech is the ``crystallization
of the collective wisdom of the party Central Committee.'' Party
members in Hubei province said Jiang's words ``embody the firmness,
clarity and continuity of the party's theory and line.''
   Deng, 85, and reportedly in failing health, is said to have
anointed Jiang in a closed-door speech this June by referring to
him as the ``core of the new leadership.''
   Premier Li Peng, a likely rival in any future power struggle,
chimed in last week by telling foreign businessmen that Jiang had
``rich experience in political and economic work'' and ``we support
him as the core of our leadership.''
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, in a commentary in the party's
official People's Daily this week, also confirmed the ``third
generation'' of Communist Party leadership was firmly in control,
with Jiang as ``the core.''
   Jiang, a cosmopolitan man who speaks varying degrees of English,
Japanese and Russian and appears at ease in Western attire with
Western businessmen, is also being remade into a folksy, Mao-suited
man of the masses.
   On National Day, Oct. 1, Jiang made a ``surprise'' stop at the
Fuxingmen intersection, scene of many deaths during the June 3-4
military attack on dissidents in the city, to chat with the people.
   Much like Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's flesh-pressing
tours, Jiang chatted with soldiers and children, congratulated
newlyweds, posed for pictures and, as he left, shouted: ``Comrades,
see you again. Let us work with one heart to build up the country.''
   The People's Daily in August pictured Jiang, in shirtsleeves,
sharing a factory cafeteria meal with a worker, and reported that
while touring a Shanghai steel factory he led the workers in the
song ``We Workers Have Strength.''
   When a worker at a textile factory showed reluctance to shake
with his oil-covered hand, Jiang grabbed his hand and said: ``Never
mind. From now on we must rely on you'' workers.
   Since taking office Jiang has traveled to Yenan, the Red Army's
former revolutionary base in dusty northwestern China, and talked
with farmers in rural Hubei and Shaanxi provinces.
   Jiang's square, black-rimmed glasses, gray hair and ready smile
have helped convey an avuncular image, and, when the occasion calls
for it, he has shown a knack for appearing broad-minded.
   In a meeting with students who had returned from abroad, Jiang
said it was understandable that some Chinese students overseas were
misled by the Western press and engaged in pro-democracy protests.
Those who correct their mistakes will be welcomed back, he said _
``Men are not saints, so how can they be free from faults?''
   Yet when asked at a recent news conference about the crackdown
on the protesters, which followed weeks of protests in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square, smiles were quickly replaced with a sharply
worded recitation of the party's uncompromising stance.
   The military suppression of the student movement during which
hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed ``was not a tragedy,''
Jiang said.
   ``Tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the
Communist Party leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist
system,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fight Breaks Out in Front of Pope's Altar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DILI, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A melee of flying chairs and swinging
sticks broke out in front of the altar Thursday as Pope John Paul
II was finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 in Dili,
capital of East Timor.
   Four women were reported hospitalized with injuries suffered
after being crushed in the surging crowd during the battle between
plainclothes police and chanting youths who oppose Indonesian
control of the former Portuguese colony.
   No arrests were reported and the pope did not appear to be in
danger at any time.
   The trouble began when about 20 young men shouting ``Viva
independence!'' and ``Viva il papa!'' unfurled a banner in front of
the altar and hurled chairs at policemen.
   Plainclothesmen flogged the youths and seized their banner. The
crowd scattered and about 100 more young man joined the fray.
   Police confiscated the film of some photographers after the
fighting ended about 15 minutes later.
   One banners read, in Portuguese, ``Fretilin Welcomes You.''
Another said: ``John Paul, Savior of East Timor.'' Fretilin is the
independence movement that has fought Indonesian rule since
annexation in 1976.
   A non-Indonesian priest said it was clear the protesters
respected the pope because they did not act until the Mass was over.
   In a similar incident in April 1987, leftists opposed to the
Chilean government threw rocks at police during a papal Mass in
Santiago. Security forces responded with tear gas, some of which
wafted toward the alter.
   On Thursday, white-cassocked priests and seminarians moved
quickly to calm the crowd and the pope was escorted to his car,
surrounded by Vatican and Indonesian security men. John Paul is on
a 10-day tour of South Korea, Indonesia and Mauritius.
   During four days in Indonesia, the pontiff has urged the
government of the world's most populous Moslem nation to protect
human rights in East Timor. The local Roman Catholic church and the
human rights group Amnesty International say violations include
mass arrests, torture and ``disappearances.''
   The protesters, supporters of Fretilin, got to within 100 feet
of the steps of the altar, where the pope watched in sweltering
heat that reached 100 degrees.
   Girl Scouts, who had acted as ushers in front of the altar, wept
as they were caught up in the melee.
   In his homily, John Paul made no direct mention of Indonesian
rule over East Timor, which neither the Vatican nor United Nations
recognizes, but referred instead to ``those who have responsibility
for life in East Timor.''
   ``Respect for the rights which render life more human must be
firmly ensured: the rights of individuals and the rights of
families,'' he declared.
   John Paul urged Indonesia to ``act with wisdom and good will
toward all'' in the search for a peaceful solution to East Timor's
problems.
   On his arrival from the island of Flores, the pope did not kiss
the ground, a gesture that would have been viewed as acknowledging
East Timor was a separate country.
   He did kneel and kiss a crucifix lying on a pillow on the ground
beneath the altar, however, and the crowd applauded. A Vatican
spokesman called that a ``purely pastoral'' gesture, meaning it had
no political significance.
   Monsignor Carlos Belo, bishop of Dili, told reporters the Mass
site had been the scene of killings by the Indonesian military,
which used it as an interrogation center at the height of the
rebellion after annexation.
   Belo, an outspoken prelate who has proposed a referendum to
determine the island's political future, said the ground would be
``sanctified'' by the papal Mass.
   The pontiff said the East Timorese had ``experienced destruction
and death as a result of conflict.''
   ``You have known what it means to be victims of hatred and
struggle,'' he said. ``Many innocent people have died while others
have been prey to retaliation and revenge. For too long, you have
been suffering a lack of stability which had rendered your future
uncertain.''
   A military garrison officially estimated at 13,000 is stationed
in East Timor. The army admits to thousands of casualties in
guerrilla warfare since annexation, but claims only about 200
guerrillas now operate in the hinterland.
   Indonesia has 157 Moslems and only 5 million Catholics, but 80
percent of East Timor's 590,000 people are Catholic.
   Navy landing craft transported thousands of Catholic villagers
to Dili, but the turnout was far lower than expected. Foreign
priests said people feared the roadblocks set up for identity
checks about every 12 miles.

   About 24 million tiny tourists have
taken up temporary residence in this bedroom community outside Fort
Lauderdale and they're driving the locals nuts.
   Some unknown beekeeper dropped off more than 600 hives brimming
with bees in the middle of the fast-growing town.
   ``This is driving us crazy,'' said Donna Kaszanek, owner of the
Jumping Springs riding ranch. ``There are bee droppings everywhere,
and they're buzzing all over the place.''
   Beekeepers like to bring their hives to Broward County when the
Florida holly is in bloom, then pick them up a few weeks later when
they are loaded with honey.
   ``This whole thing is incredible,'' said Al Tholl, a Margate bee
exterminator who was called in to count the hives and survey the
scene.
   ``I've had calls all day,'' said John Bastianelli, a state
agricultural inspector who handles bee complaints.
   The city is putting out the word to whoever owns the bees that
they've worn out their welcome and had better be gone by the
weekend.

   How many quarters does it take to wash a
pair of llamas at a car wash? (Never mind why anyone would want to.)
   Randy Cipriano of Garland said it took about $12 worth to wash
the animals with dish soap and rinse them with fabric softener at a
car wash Tuesday.
   Cipriano, who raises the South American natives as a sideline to
his marketing firm, stopped at the car wash to prepare two of the
five llamas he plans to take to the fifth annual Llama Harvest Show
and Sale, which begins Friday at Omaha.
   He got into the business a few years ago after a hunting trip
with a friend who suggested he should raise llamas, popular as pets
and also as pack animals for long camping trips.
   ``I thought he was crazy,'' said Cipriano, who now has 13 of
them.
   So how do llamas like being bathed in a car wash?
   ``They tolerate it,'' Cipriano said. ``They have a great
disposition.''

   A terminally ill Defense Department employee
whose request to be flown to his Massachusetts home on an Air Force
plane was turned down has died, his doctor said Thursday.
   The Air Force said last month that Avram Brody did not meet the
criteria needed for such a government-paid flight, which it
estimated would cost $30,000.
   The 25-year-old man died of a brain tumor Wednesday night at his
home in Palmdale, Calif., Dr. Abdallah Farrukh said in a telephone
interview.
   ``This one's a real sadness for the family. It's a heartbreaking
time,'' said Brad Pearson of the Massachusetts Office For
Handicapped Affairs, who lobbied for the Brody family.
   ``I'm going to wonder probably for the rest of my life if we
didn't do too little too late on this one. I wish we could have
gotten them home.''
   Pearson said the Air Force regulations ``ignored a very sad and
simple reality.''
   The Air Force had said it would allow such a flight for
uniformed personnel, for someone whose illness had been caused by
his work or if the flight would save a life. Brody, the Air Force
said, did not meet any of those criteria.
   Also intervening in Brody's behalf were Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., several members of the House of Representatives and White
House aide Andrew Card, a Massachusetts native.
   After publicity about the Air Force refusal to provide an air
ambulance, several private companies and individuals offered to
provide a free flight. However, Brody's condition had deteriorated
to the point where he could no longer be moved.
   Brody, whose tumor was diagnosed a year ago, had been cared for
at home by his wife, Amy, and a nurse. There was no answer at the
Brody home Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Lebanese lawmakers reached preliminary
agreement today on a peace plan for their country, but Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun rejected the plan and vowed to continue his
war with Syrian troops.
   Radio stations said the plan calls for at least a partial
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and a limit on the powers
of the Christian president.
   Conference sources said a Parliamentary committee led by house
speaker Hussein Husseini agreed on the phrasing of the plan after a
round-the-clock debate attended by the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.
   The committee broke up in the morning and was scheduled to meet
again later to present its draft agreement to the 63 legislators
meeting in Taif.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not
elaborate on the tentative accord. But Najah Wakim, an Orthodox
Christian, and Hassan Rifai, a Moslem, told reporters they were
``optimistic'' after the overnight session.
   But Aoun said later: ``We cannot rebuild our country under the
shadow of an occupying force.''
   ``Let those deputies understand that our Lebanon's sovereignty
and independence are not a matter for bargaining and negotiation,''
he said in a speech carried on Voice of Lebanon radio. He vowed to
pursue his ``war of liberation'' against Syria, which has 40,000
troops stationed in Lebanon.
   Lebanese radio stations earlier quoted deputies as saying
differences over presidential powers and the issue of Syria's
military presence in Lebanon had been resolved.
   The radio stations attributed the progress to the mediation of
the three foreign ministers supervising the talks _ Prince Saud
al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Morocco's Abdel-Latif al-Filali, and
Algeria's Ahmed Ghozaly.
   The three countries are grouped in an Arab League committee
entrusted with finding a settlement to Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war.
   The Voice of People, a pro-Syrian station in Beirut, and the
Voice of Lebanon, said the committee today approved a timetable for
a ``limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. They gave
no details.
   Voice of the People said that although the president will
continue to be a Maronite Catholic, his powers will be curtailed.
   He will no longer have the power to issue general amnesties or
dissolve Parliament at will. A head of state will be able to
dissolve the 99-seat Parliament only once during his six-year term,
it said.
   He also will no longer be the commander in chief of the armed
forces. Instead, the military command will report directly to the
Cabinet, traditionally headed by a Sunni Moslem.
   Once a new head of state is elected, a committee grouping the
president, prime minister and Parliament speaker, usually a Shiite
Moslem, will be formed to work on abolishing the sectarian system
of government, the radio said.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since former President
Amin Gemayel's term ended Sept. 22, 1988.
   Under the sectarian system in force since independence from
France in 1943, Christians, mainly the Maronites, have dominated
Lebanon's Parliament, government, army and judiciary.
   Christians were once considered the majority in Lebanon. Now,
Moslems make up 55 percent of the 4 million people.
   The meeting in Taif began Sept. 30.
   The Arab committee had first proposed that Syria complete a
phased withdrawal from the Beirut area within two years.
   It offered no timetable or guarantees for a complete withdrawal
of the Syrian contingent, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
mandate. It linked it to an Israeli pullout from south Lebanon and
the conclusion of a Lebanese-Syrian security pact.
   The Christians, who fought the Syrians this year for six months
until an Arab League cease-fire halted the bloodshed Sept. 22,
rejected the proposal.
   They conceded a quick pullout would leave a security vacuum and
allow unruly militias to take over but insisted two years was too
long for a withdrawal from Beirut. They demanded a timetable for
withdrawal from northern and eastern Lebanon.
   Moslems rejected any pullout of their Syrian protectors until
political reforms curtailing the domination of Christians in
Lebanon have been enforced.

<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court today threw out the
conviction of a career criminal accused of fatally shooting Prime
Minister Olof Palme three years ago. Hours later, the defendant was
freed from prison.
   Judge Birgitta Blom of the Svea Court of Appeals said the court
ruled there was not enough evidence to show that Christer
Pettersson stalked and killed Palme as the Swedish leader left a
movie theater with his wife Feb. 28, 1986.
   Pettersson was sentenced to life in prison and had been jailed
in isolation since December.
   ``I'm surprised. I never really believed I would be acquitted,
although I am innocent,'' Pettersson, 42, told the national TT news
agency after leaving the Kronoberg Prison with his lawyer and a
police escort.
   Ms. Blom, the president of the appellate court, told Swedish
radio the decision to overturn the conviction was unanimous.
   The decision is the culmination of a sensational case that
authorities have been accused of bungling since its inception.
Police for a year pursued a series of vastly different conspiracy
theories before prosecuting Pettersson, a drug and alcohol abuser
with a long and varied criminal record.
   Pettersson was convicted in July even though no motive was
established, no weapon was found and no witnesses testified to
seeing the Swede fire five shots at the dynamic leader on a
darkened street.
   The appellate court judgment may be referred to the Swedish
Supreme Court. But because the high court usually agrees only to
hear cases that could form legal precedent, legal experts have said
it probably would not hear Pettersson's case.
   In addition, experts had said if the conviction were overturned
it would be virtually impossible to find Palme's killer, since all
the witnesses police could find pointed to Pettersson as the man
they saw at the crime scene.
   Pettersson's three-week appeal hearing was presided over by a
jury of three laymen and four professional jurors. The hearing
ended Monday.
   The court had set Nov. 2 for announcing its verdict, but the
national news agency TT said the jury concluded in only three days
that ``the investigation into the case was insufficient for a
conviction.''
   The written verdict will be released Nov. 2.
   Palme was a four-term prime minister and a dominant figure in
the international socialist and disarmament movements. He also was
a U.N. mediator in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The conviction by a tribunal of six laymen and two professional
judges was based largely on the identification of Pettersson by
Palme's widow, Lisbeth Palme, who was walking home with her husband
when he was shot from behind at close range.
   Mrs. Palme said she saw Pettersson standing a few feet away
after her husband was shot. She was grazed by a bullet and slightly
wounded.
   Several other witnesses said they saw Pettersson apparently
waiting for the Palmes to emerge from the theater.
   But no one saw Pettersson with a gun, and police failed to
produce any forensic evidence to link him to the shooting.
   Pettersson denied shooting Palme and said he was not in central
Stockholm when the killing took place at 11.21 p.m.
   One witness testified to seeing Pettersson at a train station
far from the shooting scene at the time of the slaying.
   The two judges in the trial voted for acquittal, but the six
laymen voted to convict.
   The initial investigation into the slaying focused on a series
of conspiracy theories. Most centered on Kurdish militants, others
centered on Iranian or Iraqi government assassins and still another
focused on a secret cadre of right-wing police officers upset with
Palme's leftist politics. All were dismissed as essentially
groundless.
   Four hours before Palme was shot, the files of a tax
investigation against him disappeared in a break-in at the county
administrative appeals court. All computer files were obliterated
and all documents were stolen. No connection with the killing was
ever established.
   The botched probe resulted in a series of resignations and
firings. The befuddling case has developed an aura of mystery that
has been likened to the doubts that still haunt the assassination
of former President John F. Kennedy.
   Several top police officials and Justice Minister Anna-Greta
Leijon eventually were forced to resign because of their
involvement in an unauthorized, privately led investigation into
the case.

<TEXT>
   President Bush took time out today from
affairs of state to boost a Republican candidate involved in a
tough battle to keep a Mississippi congressional seat held by the
GOP for 16 years.
   In his return to the campaign trail, Bush echoed themes that
served him well in the 1988 presidential election, citing
Republican Tom Anderson's devotion to ``traditional values.''
   The president also emphasized Anderson's long experience as a
congressional aide and his service as ambassador to Barbados, which
Bush said made him ``a point man in the drug interdiction effort.''
   Bush also noted that he has accepted the invitation of the
presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru _ the source countries for
cocaine sold in the United States _ to attend a drug summit within
90 days.
   ``I've instructed my administration to prepare for a summit that
will bring us to a new level of international cooperation in this
war we must win,'' Bush told an audience of several thousand. ``As
long as I am president, I will give as much support as he needs to
President (Virgilio) Barco (of Colombia), who is waging an all-out
fight'' against drug lords.
   Later Bush was attending a reception and dinner for GOP mayoral
candidate Rudolph Giuliani in New York.
   He also was flying to the Newark, N.J., airport to meet briefly
with Rep. James Courter, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, and
then attend a New York reception for Rep. Guy Molinari, who is
running for borough president of Staten Island.
   Bush told an outdoor rally in Gulfport that as a longtime aide
to former congressman and now-Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., Anderson
``knows the back roads of the Fifth District ... just as he knows
the corridors of Capitol Hill.''
   Anderson, 43, is running against Democratic State Sen. Gene
Taylor for the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Larkin Smith,
R-Miss., in an August plane crash. Taylor bested Anderson in the
Oct. 3 open primary and is the favorite in Tuesday's special
election.
   ``You know Tom, and all of you know what makes southern
Mississippi what it is. Mississippi values. Traditional values. Tom
Anderson's values,'' Bush told the hometown crowd.
   Bush also used the event to echo what aides said Tuesday: he
will attend a drug summit with leaders of the Andean nations of
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   He praised the citizens of Gulfport, themselves hit by Hurricane
Camille 20 years ago, for their relief efforts in the wake of
Hurricane Hugo.
   The Mississippi race is seen as a tough one for Anderson, a
longtime aide to Trent Lott, the state's Republican senator who
served in the House before his 1988 election to the Senate.
   The runoff election between Anderson and Taylor is a high-stakes
contest for both Democrats and Republicans, who have held the seat
for 16 years. It is the latest in a handful of special elections
around the country this year that serve as opening skirmishes for
the 1990 national elections and the GOP's perpetual battle to wrest
control of Congress away from the Democrats.
   Anderson has spent heavily, reporting $447,700 in spending by
the end of September, not including large television advertising
buys just prior to the Oct. 3 primary election in the 5th
Congressional District.
   But Taylor, who spent $88,606 through Sept. 27, outpolled
Anderson and a third candidate in the primary election indicating
what Democrats say is a shift away from the Republican habit.
   Anderson has touted his longtime experience in the district as
Lott's aide, and Taylor is relying on his legislative experience.
   In New Jersey, White House advance aides said they were setting
up today's planned meeting with Courter at the airport. Recent
polls showed Courter lagging 14 to 23 points behind Rep. James
Florio, the Democratic candidate for governor.
   In New York, Bush appears tonight for Giuliani, whose bid to
beat Democrat David Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough president, in
the mayoral contest is lagging.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans 5-1 in the city and Dinkins is
widely considered a shoo-in although Giuliani began the race well
ahead of both incumbent Mayor Ed Koch and Dinkins in the polls.
   A series of missteps and revelations have led to his slide,
including disclosure that his law firm was on retainer for the
government of Panama and incidents that agitated the Jewish
community. Most recently, comedian Jackie Mason, a key supporter,
was accused of making ethnic slurs against Dinkins and stereotyping
Jews.
   Dinkins also ran into ethnic criticism, leading to his
announcement Wednesday in Washington that campaign aide Jitu Weusi
would leave in the wake of criticism by the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith.
   The B'nai B'rith said Weusi once referred to Jews as ``vile
money-changers'' and ``shylocks'' and also wrote ``scores of
anti-Semitic articles.''
   Dinkins toured Capitol Hill on Wednesday, receiving a warm
welcome from congressional leaders and meeting also with Bush's
Secretary of Housing and Urban development, Jack Kemp, on housing
issues.
   Giuliani met with Kemp earlier in the month.
   Asked if Bush's visit to New York would help Giuliani, Dinkins
said, ``I assume it will help him raise some money but I don't know
that it will do him much good beyond that. New York is not a
Republican town.''
   Bush's appearance for Molinari is intended to help Molinari's
bid for borough president against Democratic incumbent Ralph
Lamberti.

   Shrapnel or projectiles fired from a Navy
cargo ship during an Atlantic gunnery exercise killed an officer
aboard the amphibious assault vessel USS Iwo Jima and injured a
second sailor, the Navy said today.
   In the Pacific, two crewmen fell off the San Diego-based frigate
Downes during exercises. One was rescued and the other was missing
today, officials said. The accident occurred about 300 miles off
Tokyo on Wednesday morning.
   The gunnery accident occurred Wednesday evening as the Iwo Jima
took part in an exercise with the amphibious cargo ship USS El Paso
about 80 miles southeast of Norfolk, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd,
Navy spokesman.
   Lloyd said the two sailors were struck by objects fired from the
El Paso.
   ``They were both on the bridge,'' Lloyd said. ``The projectiles
apparently struck the bridge and the flight deck.''
   The El Paso was firing at a target being towed by a plane, he
said. Lloyd said the Iwo Jima sustained no apparent damage.
   The injured man, a petty officer first class, was treated on
board and then flown to Portsmouth Naval Hospital, where he was
listed in stable condition today, Lloyd said.
   He said the Navy is investigating.

   Ground has been broken for a ``Space
Mirror'' monument to memorialize the 14 astronauts who have died
while pursuing the goals of the space program.
   A member of each of their families was on hand at a ceremony
Wednesday at Kennedy Space Center to place a star on the
cornerstone of the Astronaut Memorial, inspired by the explosion of
the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``To Those Who Gave Their Lives To Bring The Stars A Little
Closer,'' read a plaque unveiled on the cornerstone for the $5
million memorial, to be completed next year.
   ``We honor their courage, because so few of us are courageous.
We honor their knowledge, because so few of us can understand the
unknown. We honor their quest, because it is the way to the
future,'' said Alan C. Helman, founder of the Astronauts Memorial
Foundation.
   The ``Space Mirror'' will be 42{ feet high by 50 feet wide,
constructed of mirror-finished granite with the names of the 14 cut
through its surface like a stencil. The entire memorial will track
the sun throughout the day, enabling mirrors behind the cut-out
names to reflect sunlight back through the image of the sky
reflected on the polished granite.
   Listed will be Challenger crew members Dick Scobee, Michael J.
Smith, Ronald E. McNair, Ellison S. Onizuka, Judith A. Resnik,
Gregory B. Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe; Apollo 1 crew members Gus
Grissom, Edward H. White II and Roger B. Chaffee who died in a 1967
launch pad fire; and astronauts killed in T-38 training accidents:
Theodore C. Freeman, Charles A. Bassett, Elliot M. See Jr. and
Clifton C. Williams.
   Grissom's son, Gary Mark Grissom, said it was ``about time''
they got around to building a memorial.
   ``When I was younger, I thought NASA would do something. It's a
shame that it has taken this long,'' Grissom said. His father was
the second American in space.
   Grace Corrigan, mother of Mrs. McAuliffe, the teacher who died
on the Challenger, told a reporter she doesn't believe NASA's
teacher-in-space program and others involving civilians should
resume, ``not since what has happened.''
   ``We believed everything was going to be all right when Christa
went up,' she said. ``We never thought they would take any chances.
We learned the hard way. They are never going to do that again.
They can't.''
   Most of the funds were provided by the sale of Challenger
license plates in Florida.

   The writing was on the wall, but not the
bathroom wall, and now Arthur Hill High School's open-stall policy
is history.
   The Saginaw Board of Education agreed last week to add doors to
the school's toilet stalls after pleas from two students.
   The doors were removed in 1974 because of vandalism, but
Superintendent Foster B. Gibbs said malicious damage is no longer a
problem.
   Student council president Randon D. Morford cited a 1987 case at
another school in which state Department of Civil Rights lawyers
threatened to go to court.
   ``We are prepared to do whatever it takes to get doors on those
stalls and to protect our rights of privacy,'' he said.
   Senior Martin Schreader said students have been known to fake
illness so they can leave the building and find a restroom with
doors on the stalls.
   The board agreed to have a plan in place within three weeks.
   ``If there is not a safety or security factor, I recommend that
the doors be put on in all haste,'' said Trustee Michael L. Kiefer.
``There is a matter of personal dignity and privacy.''

<HEAD>Shamir Dismisses U.S. Proposal for Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday a
meeting of the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers to revive
Middle East peace efforts, proposed by the United States, was an
``inflated'' and unnecessary idea.
   It was his first response to the suggestion last week by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in connection with the
Egyptian proposal for a meeting in Cairo between Israel and a
Palestinian delegation.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, PLO sources said chairman Yasser Arafat would
be under pressure from other Palestinian leaders at a meeting next
week to take a tough line on Palestinian-Israeli talks.
   Shamir said in a speech in the Raanana suburb of Tel Aviv that
Israel wants to meet with Palestinians to discuss procedures for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a key element
of an Israeli peace plan set forth in April.
   He added, however: ``We don't need to involve ... ministers,
foreign ministers or heads of state. It should be a technical
discussion. This has been turned into, inflated into something
politically big, into some big event.''
   His remarks were broadcast on Israel radio.
   Shamir, who leads the right-wing Likud bloc, repeated Israel's
refusal to involve the Palestine Liberation Organization, a serious
obstacle to starting negotiations. Israel defines the PLO as a
terrorist group.
   Israeli media, quoting sources in Washington, said American
leaders were growing impatient with Israel's failure to respond to
the latest peace proposals.
   The daily Haaretz said State Department officials sent ``sharp
messages,'' citing the latest pronouncements of hardliners in
Shamir's party who oppose meeting with Palestinians in Cairo.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told Israeli reporters Thursday,
however, that he ``does not have the impression Baker has run out
of patience,'' Israel radio reported.
   Egypt proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting as a way of
bridging differences between Israel and the PLO over Israel's plan
for elections to choose Palestinians to negotiate with the Israelis.
   The PLO objected that the Israeli plan did not guarantee
Palestinians an independent state after a proposed five-year period
of Palestinian self-rule in the territories, which Israel has
occupied since the 1967 war.
   Israel's Cabinet leadership rejected Egypt's proposals Oct. 6 on
a tie vote of six Likud members and six from the Labor Party, which
is the other partner in the coalition government and supports the
Egyptian approach.
   Baker subsequently telephoned Arens and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the
Egyptian foreign minister, and proposed they meet in Washington to
find a compromise way of choosing a Palestinian delegation.
   The sources in the Iraqi capital said the Palestinian Central
Council, to begin meeting on Sunday, will put pressure on Arafat to
reject any attempt to exclude the PLO from peace talks with Israel.
   A senior council member told The Associated Press privately that
radical factions called the meeting to stop Arafat from accepting
Egyptian and U.S. efforts toward a Middle East peace effort that
might not include the PLO.
   ``We haven't endorsed the so-called Mubarak plan and we will
never accept a plan short of full PLO participation in any peace
process,'' he said.
   The Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the largest PLO
factions after Arafat's own Fatah, have denounced the Egyptian
proposals.

   A truck loaded with 6,000 bottles of
liquor fell off a ferry, and police had to post a 24-hour guard to
keep people from diving into the fjord for the liquid treasure,
reports said Thursday.
   ``Three eager local scuba divers were there first to help
themselves. They filled plastic bags with bottles but surfaced
right into the arms of police,'' Birger Monsen of the state liquor
monopoly Vinmonopolet A.S. told the Dagbladet daily.
   The cargo, mostly vodka, was worth more than $150,000, reports
said. Vodka costs at least $27 a bottle in Norway, where liquor is
heavily taxed.
   The truck started rolling when the ferry set sail, and it
plunged into 38 feet of water. No one was injured.
   Police remained on duty through the night.

<HEAD>Chancellor Says British Interest Rates Stay High, However Unpopular</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's chancellor of the exchequer
said Thursday he will continue a policy of increasing interest
rates to curb inflation, and he brushed aside fears the economy is
heading into recession.
   Addressing the annual conference of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative Party, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson ignored pressure to link the pound to other major European
currencies through the European Monetary System.
   ``Inevitably people ask whether there is an alternative to high
interest rates at the present time,'' said Lawson. ``Bluntly, the
answer is that there is no alternative and the policy will work.''
   The four-day conference, which ends Friday, has been
overshadowed by Lawson's decision last week to raise interests
rates to an eight-year high of 15 percent, hitting businesses and
millions of home buyers.
   Lawson's tactic of using high interest rates to curb inflation
and to try to keep the pound steady against the West German mark,
has prompted renewed demands to put the British currency into the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The European Monetary System links the currencies of eight of
the 12 Common Market nations in order to prevent wide swings in
exchange rate movements.
   Lawson made no mention of the issue in his speech, but later, in
broadcast interviews, he repeated the Conservative government's
position that it would join the mechanism when it felt the time is
right. He wouldn't be drawn on what the timetable might be.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who was seated alongside Lawson as he addressed
the 9,000 delegates, has set stringent conditions for British entry
to the European currency-stabilizing system. They include a
lowering in Britain's 7.3 inflation rate and that other member
countries must _ like Britain _ allow totally free movement of
capital.
   The financial markets were soothed by Lawson's speech. The
markets were watching it closely because of a recent sharp drop in
the pound despite last week's interest rate hike.
   The pound rose to $1.5520 from $1.5425 late Wednesday, and
dipped slightly to 2.9597 West German marks from 2.9632 marks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 19
points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 2,237.8.
   Lawson, who was loudly applauded, said he has ``no easy
answers.''
   ``But I give you this pledge. I will continue to take whatever
action is needed, however unpopular it may be, to keep our economy
sound and strong,'' he added.
   The Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main business
group, said Lawson's approach was ``exactly what the situation
demanded.''
   The opposition Labor Party jibed that Lawson merely ``rehashed
failed policies'' and the Trades Union Congress, the national labor
federation, accused him of complacency.
   General Secretary Norman Willis urged British membership in the
exchange rate mechanism.
   Foreign Secretary John Major said Britain should not be
defensive about its ``common sense'' approach to the 12-nation
European Economic Community.
   ``For it is we who have breathed new life into it (the
community),'' Major said. ``It is our show. The community is
carrying out our program.''
   In another development, Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson said
Britain will build a $310 million air traffic control center. He
said the facility, to be completed in the 1990s, will enable
Britain to handle 50 percent more flights.

<TEXT>
   About 45 law officers were assigned to
keep the peace at racially tense Minor High School today after a
melee in which the principal and a teen-ager were stabbed and six
students arrested.
   Students had to pass through a metal detector and go directly to
class, bypassing their usual gathering places, including the
lunchroom that white and black students turned into a battleground
Wednesday.
   During the brawl, a teacher fired shots into the air to restore
order, teen-agers sprayed Mace on schoolmates, and some teachers
and coaches fought students, authorities and witnesses said.
   ``There was mass confusion, running and screaming everywhere,''
said police Sgt. Ronald Benson, who was knocked down and sprayed
with Mace.
   Officers today arrested two teen-agers outside and confiscated
beer, a BB gun, crowbars and spiked gloves and wristbands.
Sheriff's Lt. Earl Patterson said the two did not appear to be
students at Minor.
   Principal Judson Jones, who suffered a two-inch knife cut to his
abdomen, said a biracial committee of parents will look for
solutions to the problems.
   ``We want to address them and get back to the real job of being
here. That's to educate the kids. We seem to have lost that,'' he
said.
   Some students and police said conflict among the school's 967
students stemmed partly from black gang activity and what blacks
viewed as taunting by whites. The school northwest of Birmingham is
about 25 percent black.
   William James, a 17-year-old black senior, said the fight broke
out when a white dressed like the black rock guitarist Jimmy
Hendrix ``with dirt on his hands to make them look black.''
   He said blacks were sent to the lunchroom and whites to the gym,
but as many as 50 whites entered the lunchroom ``in a straight line
with all these wepaons _ Mace and forks. It just went off. They
jumped all these black people who were eating.''
   ``There's always been racial trouble here,'' he said. ``They
didn't want us here anyway.''
   David Doren, a 16-year-old white, said when the whites went into
the lunchroom, blacks started hollering ``and started walking
around us. We stood up and everybody started fighting.''
   Doren said that when a white student walks down a hall alone,
``four or five blacks will jump on him. They will find a person
walking down the hall and run and jump on him.''
   ``It's going to keep on going,'' he said. ``We've got to get rid
of the gangs to stop it.''
   A black senior, 17-year-old Bellamy Johnson, said blacks had
objected to the suspension of blacks for cutting their names into
their hair.
   Johnny Drummonds, a 17-year-old white, was stabbed in the
shoulder. He received stitches at a hospital and returned to school.
   Six students were arrested, said Frank Rogers, chief sheriff's
deputy. He said five were to be charged with rioting and the sixth
was to be charged with assault with intent to murder.
   A teacher who fired shots into the air in an attempt to quell
the disturbance was sent home and faces disciplinary action, said
Nez Calhoun, spokeswoman for the school board. The teacher had
carried the gun because of earlier problems, an unidentified
witness told the Birmingham Post-Herald.

   Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States is
pleased that Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N. special representative in
Namibia, has pursued the allegations made against the rebels of the
South-West Africa People's Organization, known as SWAPO.
   Ahtisaari said at a news conference in Windhoek, Namibia, on
Wednesday that he has been unable so far to verify reports that
SWAPO members imprisoned, tortured and killed hundreds from their
own ranks since 1977.
   In visits to SWAPO camps in Angola and Zambia, the U.N. team
said it could not find a single detainee among the 1,100 cases it
is investigating.
   But Tutwiler said 315 people of the 1,100 have not yet been
found.
   ``We note that his report ... states categorically that the
investigation will continue,'' Tutwiler said. ``We are concerned at
this large number of persons unaccounted for and encourage UNTAG
(the United Nations Transition Assistance Group) to pursue their
cases and any others that may come to its attention as aggressively
as possible,'' she said.
   SWAPO leaders, she said, have ``admitted their organization
detained certain persons it regards as spies sent by South
Africa.'' SWAPO must ``provide a full accounting for those persons
immediately,'' Tutwiler said.
   SWAPO is expected to win a majority in the Nov. 7 elections in
which Namibians are to elect an assembly to draft a constitution
for the independence of their country, a former U.N. trust
territory governed by South Africa.
   SWAPO waged a guerrilla war against South Africa for 23 years.
That ended last April, when the parties agreed to a U.N.-sponsored
plan that spells out steps that are to lead to independence for the
mineral-rich country.

   Members of the World Psychiatric
Association gathered Thursday at a conference to decide whether to
readmit colleagues from the Soviet Union.
   The international professional body for psychiatrists, meeting
for the first time in six years, is taking up the Soviet question
during its weeklong congress amid allegations that political
dissidents are still being punished in Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
   In a preliminary meeting Wednesday, the group's executive
committee, led by its president, Kostas Stefanis, recommended
re-entry for the Soviets, known officially as the All-Union Society
of Psychiatrists and Narcologists.
   The Soviet state-sanctioned society was forced to withdraw from
the world body in 1983 after allegations surfaced that dissidents
were being certified as insane.
   ``The Soviets admit that some excesses took place in their
country in the past, and say that these will not be repeated in the
future,'' Stefanis said.
   Three dissident Soviet psychiatrists who have been interned in
psychiatric hospitals and now live in the West said before the
congress opened that admitting the official Soviet group would be
``tantamount to condoning abuse.''
   One of the men, Anatoly Koryagin, said the Soviet psychiatric
establishment has admitted individual instances of wrong diagnosis
but continues to deny the systematic abuse of psychiatry.
   The congress opened in a tense atmosphere after the
association's general assembly clashed in the preliminary session
over voting procedures that will affect the ballot on the Soviet
issue.
   Delegates from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Canada
and Australia alleged that changes to voting statutes proposed by
the association's executive committee were aimed at facilitating
re-entry for the Soviets, according to sources at the meeting.
   The association's general assembly is scheduled to vote on the
Soviet question Tuesday.
   The association's executive committee executive came under fire
from some of its members in March when it gave provisional
membership to the official Soviet group, pending a final decision
at the Athens congress.
   A U.S. delegation led by a State Department official went to the
Soviet Union in February to check claims that psychiatry was no
longer being used as a political weapon. The U.S. psychiatrists
said that despite some progress, more legal safeguards were needed
to prevent the hospitalization of dissidents.
   On the basis of the U.S. report, the American Psychiatric
Association, a member of the international body, decided to vote
against full membership for the Soviet society at the Athens
congress.
   Robert van Voren, the leader of a Netherlands-based human rights
group that is campaigning against re-entry of the Soviets, said the
use of psychiatry for politcal reasons is still common in the
Soviet Union.
   ``We have evidence of 40 dissidents who are being held in Soviet
Psychiatric institutions for political reasons,'' van Voren said in
an interview.
   Van Voren's pressure group, the International Association on the
Political Use of Psychiatry, will brief delegates on allegations of
psychiatric abuse in the Soviet Union before the vote.
   The main group will also decide on whether to admit a second
Soviet society of psychiatrists, the Independent Psychiatric
Association. That association, which does not have the backing of
the Soviet government, also maintains that the political use of
psychiatry is still continuing in the Soviet Union. The
international group can admit both Soviet associations.
   The congress also will discuss about 3,400 research papers on
psychiatry written by members of the world organization.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will visit
striking coal miners Friday in southwest Virginia for a first-hand
look at the six-month walkout involving Pittston Co. mines in three
states, a department official said Thursday.
   ``She's frustrated and wants something to happen. Obviously, she
wants to see the strike resolved,'' said spokeswoman Dale Tate,
adding that Mrs. Dole isn't taking sides in the dispute.
   Mrs. Dole met earlier in Washington with Pittston chief Paul
Douglas and Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers.
   ``We think that's a tremendous step in the right direction,''
Trumka said Thursday about Mrs. Dole's trip.
   The UMW official spoke at a news conference during which several
international labor leaders expressed strong concern over the coal
strike.
   ``Let's not beat around the bush _ this is a union-busting
dispute,'' said John Vanderveken, general secretary of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
   Vanderveken said his Brussels, Belgium-based organization, which
represents unions with 88 million members around the world, was
preparing to file a formal complaint with the International Labor
Organization citing ``flagrant worker abuses'' involved with the
Pittston strike.
   ``We have no double standards,'' he said. ``If something is
wrong in Poland, in the Soviet Union, we say so. And if something
is wrong in the United States, we say so also.''
   Vanderveken said the handling of the coal miners' strike by
state and federal authorities demonstrated that the enforcement of
labor law in the United States is ``heavily stacked in favor of
management.''
   The delegation of foreign labor leaders met earlier Thursday
with Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, and spent Wednesday in the
southwest Virginia coalfields after meeting with Pittston chairman
Douglas.
   Contract talks resumed Thursday in suburban Washington after a
six-week break, but neither the company nor the union expected any
breakthroughs. They cannot even agree to meet in the same room and
have been using a federal mediator to relay messages.
   The strike involving Pittston's 1,695 union employees in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky began April 5 and has become a
rallying point for the U.S. labor movement.
   Peter Michalzik, general secretary of the Miners International
Federation, also based in Brussels, told striking miners at a rally
Wednesday: ``The Pittston strike is the No. 1 priority in our
organization.''
   Jacek Merkel, an official of Poland's Solidarity union who
directed shipyard strikes in Gdansk, said Solidarity won its
eight-year battle for recognition with support from labor around
the world. Now, he said, he wants to stand with the UMW.
   ``My boss, Lech Walesa, appealed to our government, `Let's start
negotiating.' I wish that here, Pittston would start negotiating,''
Merkel said.

   Ten years ago, Giorgio Armani introduced his
liningless jacket and the ``moda Milanese'' was born.
   Now at the start of a new decade, it looks like Milan's favorite
son will continue to be the mainstay of Italian ready-to-wear,
after the success of his new spring-summer 1990 collection
presented Wednesday night.
   ``He's simply the best,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, vice-president
of fashion for Bloomingdale's.
   The Italian fashion industry breathed a sigh of relief this
month when Armani, whose annual sales are valued at $350 million,
turned down a tempting offer to become artistic director at Lanvin
in Paris.
   The once-united front of the Milanese designers has suffered
some major upsets in the past year.
   The rising star of Italian ready-to-wear, Romeo Gigli, whose
waif-like styles received mixed reviews, in March took his show to
Paris, where he was hailed as the greatest thing to hit the runway
since Christian Lacroix.
   At the beginning of the summer, Gianfranco Ferre accepted the
post of designate designer at the famed house of Dior, and his
first couture collection in July was a success.
   Ferre still designs his own label out of Milan, but whereas
optimists see the Dior job as a feather in Italian fashion's cap,
others _ including Armani _ view it as a French victory in the
eternal fashion battle between the two countries.
   In a recent interview in Italy's weekly L'Espresso magazine,
Armani commented wryly: ``Does anyone really think the French are
stupid enough to promote an Italian name?''
   For the moment, Armani is satisfied to launch his fashion
fantasy from Milan, and his new collection is proof that things are
calm in the Armani empire, which includes more than 100 Emporio
shops in Europe and the United States; 200 stores in Japan that
carry his line; and his own stores in such major capitals as Rome,
Paris, London and New York.
   The new Armani style for the spring-summer 1990, presented to a
select crowd of 1,000 fashion followers in Milan's elegant Palazzo
Senato, is long and languid. Airy fabrics and loose styles which
often draw their inspiration from Morocco give the collection a
soft, serene look.
   His new jacket is extra long, either double-breasted, with three
buttons or no buttons at all. Sleeves are often over-long, and the
newest jacket is closed over the front to button at the shoulder.
   Although the look is of natural simplicity, almost too simple
for its $1,000 price tag, the workmanship is Armani perfection, and
the fabrics are luxuriously light raw silks and feather-weight
wools.
   These jackets are worn over short, seemingly hemless skirts or
baggy trousers.
   From Morocco, Armani brought back the harem pant, which he puts
under sporty jackets by day, under tunics and lavish evening gowns
by night.
   His favorite harem pant lightly sweeps the floor in silk chiffon
or georgette, often worn with an Indian embroidered strapless top.
   For that special evening, Armani embroiders his softly draped
gowns with myriads of crystals and pearls. His new evening look is
a short embroidered gown with a puffed-out skating skirt over airy
harem pants.
   Colors match the soft warmth of a Mediterranean summer night,
twilight blue, sunset red, dusk white, pine green, burnt yellow and
terracotta orange. Prints copied the designs of delicate oriental
porcelain and Middle Eastern pottery.
   Armani is not one for ornate accessories. In keeping with the
simplicity of the collection, he displayed only large drop
earrings. Footwear is soft and flat, allowing his models to steal
down the runway like thieves in an Arabian night.

   A House panel Thursday authorized Federal
Communications Commission spending of $231.3 million for fiscal
years 1990 and 1991.
   On a voice vote, the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee approved the $109.8
million the FCC had sought for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, and
$121.5 million for 1991.
   The House panel earlier had proposed the agency receive $117.8
million for fiscal 1991. But in Thursday's hearing, Reps. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., and Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., offered an amendment
to provide nearly $4 million more.
   They said the extra money was to cover the costs of moving and
consolidating FCC offices in late 1991 and to add staff and
facilities to help the FCC regulate an increasingly complex
telecommunications industry.
   The increase also will help the agency ``regain the strength
that has been sapped in recent years,'' Rinaldo said.
   The FCC's 1989 budget was $99.6 million, the same amount it
received in 1988.
   Former FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick told the panel earlier this
year the agency's backlog of licensing applications was soaring
because of budget restraints.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee last
week authorized $109.8 million in 1990, but only $119.8 million in
fiscal 1991.
   In other action, the House subcommittee, on voice votes:
   _Approved a section of the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act
that would require telephone companies to provide two-way
communications, at no additional charge to individual users, to
speech or hearing impaired people who utilize telecommunications
devices for the deaf (TDDs).
   TDDs are typewriter-like devices that permit written messages to
be sent by telephone. A telephone operator then relays either a
spoken or written message to another person.
   _Authorized National Telecommunications and Information
Administration spending of $14.6 million in fiscal 1990 and $14.7
million for fiscal 1991. The NTIA, a Commerce Department agency,
advises the White House on telecommunications policy and
administers the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program, which
makes matching capital grants to aid non-profit communications
projects.

   Four American scientists reacted with delight Thursday at being
named Nobel Prize winners for their work in physics and chemistry,
and one said it was time to ``go back to the lab and do more work.''
   The physics award was given to Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard
University for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic
clock, and to Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington and
Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for a method to isolate single atoms
and make exacting measurements of them.
   The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech, 41, of
the University of Colorado, and Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale
University. They showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s
that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic messenger inside the
cell, could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions.
   Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey, 74. The other half
will be shared by the German-born Dehmelt, 67, of the University of
Washington in Seattle, and Paul, 76, of the University of Bonn.
Each Nobel Prize is worth $469,000.
   ``I am obviously excited about it,'' said Cech, who was visiting
Boston to receive a prize for genetic work from Massachusetts
General Hospital. ``It was something that everybody has been
telling me would happen, but I had no way of knowing when.''
   While Nobel Prize celebrations may be relatively common in the
Boston area, Cech pointed out they are rarer elsewhere.
   ``My main emotion is that this is a great thing for the
University of Colorado and the state of Colorado,'' he said. ``This
is not the sort of thing that happens annually in the mountains the
way it does in Boston. That gives me a really good feeling.''
   Asked about his plans for the money, he said: ``I have two young
daughters who are very good at spending money.''
   Dehmelt said he didn't mind being awakened at 4 a.m. by a caller
from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to be told of the award.
   ``I'm elated,'' Dehmelt said from his Seattle apartment
overlooking Lake Washington. The prize and its prestige should make
his work easier, he said.
   One of the applications of his research is to make an atomic
clock thousands of times more accurate than any before.
   ``The clocks are very universally useful. They can be used in
navigation and missiles, and of course the military loves them.
They didn't give me any money, though,'' Dehmelt said.
   Ramsey said he was ``pleased and delighted and surprised'' to
learn he was awarded half the prize for inventing a precise method
for measuring time, by measuring the frequency of radiation from
atoms.
   ``Basically, I'm interested in all the laws of nature,'' said
Ramsey, who attributed his long interest in science to the fact
that ``it's fun.''
   Ramsey said he may use his prize money to defray the cost of
traveling to Grenoble, France, where he conducts research. But he
mentioned his wife would like him to buy a new car.
   Altman, at a news conference in New Haven, Conn., thanked U.S.
taxpayers, who he said provided the funds that the government
appropriated for research. The native of Canada held up a Yale
pennant that contained a small replica of the Canadian flag.
   ``I'll just go back to the lab and do more work,'' he said.
``And just try to understand the things I'm trying to understand.''
   Altman, a member of the Yale faculty since 1971, is now a
professor of biology. He was dean of Yale College from July 1986
through June 1989.

   Four American scientists and a West
German won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Thursday for
discoveries that have given the world exact measurement of time and
could help explain the origins of life.
   Canadian-born Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale University and Thomas
Cech, 41, of the University of Colorado in Boulder, won the
chemistry prize for their ``discovery of catalytic properties of
RNA,'' the citation said.
   Bertil Andersson of the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said their work has forced ``the rewrite of
whole chapters'' in chemistry textbooks and could help reveal how
life began.
   It changed dogmas from the turn of the century on how living
cells function, he said.
   The discovery also will ``probably provide a new tool for gene
technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral
infections'' and virus-resistant plants, the academy said.
   Norman F. Ramsey, 74, of Harvard University, was given half the
physics prize for inventing a method for measuring time on which
the current standard of time is based.
   Since 1967, because of Ramsey's discovery, time has been
measured by the movement within the smallest particle of matter
rather than the rotation of Earth. Ingvar Lindgren, chairman of the
awards committee, said the atomic clock deviates by just 1,000th of
a second in 300 years.
   German-born Hans G. Dehmelt, 67, of the University of Washington
in Seattle, and Wolfgang Paul, 76, of the University of Bonn, West
Germany, shared the other half of the $469,000 prize for developing
ways of trapping particles to study a them with extreme precision.
   They realized ``a long-felt dream'' of scientists in the field,
the academy declared.
   Lindgren said the three laureates ``have developed exact methods
of measurement which has made it possible to conduct experiments
that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws,
especially regarding time and space.''
   Paul heard the news on his car radio and joked later that his
ion trap was an invention ``to measure every speck of dust.'
   ``This is a surprise for me,'' he said. ``I never saw, myself,
the practical relevance of it.''
   Ramsey said at his home in Massechusetts: ``It feels great. I'm
just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people with whom I'm
sharing the prize.''
   Cech was reached in Boston and said: ``I am obviously excited
about it. It was something that everyone has been telling me would
happen, but I had no way of knowing when.''
   Asked about plans for his half of the chemistry prize money, he
replied: ``I have two young daughters who are very good at spending
money.''
   Altman said from New Haven, Conn., ``I'm very happy. I'm very
grateful to all my colleagues and co-workers, teachers and family.''
   Ramsey developed a way to study the structure of atoms by
exciting them to different energy levels, using two oscillating
electromagnetic fields.
   That led to development of the hydrogen maser, a laser-like
device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed
determination of their internal structure.
   It has been used to test Albert Einstein's general theory of
relativity and in measuring the continental drift, the academy said.
   Another application was the cesium atomic clock, in which cesium
atoms are excited to higher levels.
   ``I was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and
nuclei, and ... it was apparent this was a very, very stable
clock,'' Ramsey said. ``It gets used in radio astronomy,
navigation, satellite navigation, many other purposes.''
   Dehmelt and Paul were recognized for developing the technique
for trapping single ions, electrically charged atoms, according to
weight. Lindgren said ``ion traps'' could provide even more exact
time measurement in the future.
   Cech and Altman showed independently that RNA, or ribonucleic
acid, could be a catalyst, or trigger, for chemical reactions in
the cell.
   Their discoveries disproved a 75-year-old dogma that enzymes, or
the triggers of reactions inside cells, are always proteins. They
proved RNA also can be a catalyst, not just the messenger of
genetic codes from DNA, said Andersson, the Nobel committee member.
   When Altman discovered in 1978 that RNA could produce catalytic
reactions in the cell, the discovery was met with disbelief and
``he could hardly believe it himself,'' Andersson said.
   Four years later Cech, demonstrated that the RNA molecule was
not only necessary to the reaction but could trigger the reaction
by itself, without associated proteins previously thought essential.
   Andersson said Cech and Altman worked independently, but ``like
a Ping Pong match, the ball went from one to the other.''
   Their discoveries may provide a method to destroy harmful RNA
molecules that cause infections, such as the common cold, and
eventually also provide cures for hereditary diseases, the academy
said.
   Cech, born in Chicago, has been at Boulder since 1983. He
received his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley.
   Altman, born in Montreal, earned his doctorate at the University
of Colorado, studied at Harvard and Cambridge and moved to Yale in
1971.
   Ramsey has been at Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., since 1947.
Dehmelt, a U.S. citizen, was born in Goerlitz, now in East Germany,
went to Duke University in North Carolina as a student in 1952 and
has been at the University of Washington in Seattle since 1955.
   Paul was born in Lorenzkirch, Germany and became professor of
experimental physics at Bonn in 1952.

   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the
1989 Nobel Prize in physics for contributions of importance for the
development of atomic precision spectroscopy, with one half to
Professor Norman F. Ramsey, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.,
USA, for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method
and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks, and one
half jointly to Professor Hans G. Dehmelt, University of

   Summary:
   The work of the Laureates in Physics has led to a dramatic
development in the field of atomic precision spectroscopy in recent
years. The resonance method of Professor Norman F. Ramsey, Harvard
University, USA, using separated oscillatory fields forms the basis
of the cesium atomic clock, which is our present time standard.
Professor Dr. Wolfgang Paul, University of Bonn, Federal Republic
of Germany and Professor Hans G. Dehmelt, University of Washington,
USA, have introduced and developed the ion trap technique which has
made it possible to study a single electron or a single ion with
extreme precision. Ramsey and co-workers have also developed the
hydrogen maser, which is at present our most stable source of
electromagnetic radiation. The methods have been used in testing
fundamental physical principles such as quantum electrodynamics
(QED) and the general theory of relativity. Another application is
in space communication and for measuring continental drift. The
techniques have reached an unprecedented level of precision, and
the development does not yet seem to have culminated.

   Summary:
   This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to Sidney
Altman, USA and Thomas Cech, USA for their discovery that RNA
(ribonucleic acid) in living cells is not only a molecule of
heredity but also can function as a biocatalyst. This discovery,
which came as a complete surprise to scientists, concerns
fundamental aspects of the molecular basis of life. Many chapters
in our textbooks have to be revised.
   Many chemical reactions cannot occur without a catalyst. A
catalyst is a molecule which can facilitate a chemical reaction
without being consumed or changed. Virtually all chemical reactions
taking place in a living cell require catalysts. Such biocatalysts
are called enzymes. For example in saliva there is an enzyme which
converts starch to glucose, in the liver there is another enzyme
which breaks down alcohol. There are also enzymes that enable
plants to convert the carbon dioxide in the air to sugar and
starch. Until the results of Altman and Cech became known, all
enzymes were considered to be proteins.
   The specific properties and functions of a protein are
determined by hereditary characters, or genes. Genes are composed
of deoxyribonucleic acid, better known as DNA. The genetic
information in DNA is arranged as a string of codes which determine
the design of the proteins. However, before this information can be
used for protein synthesis, the code must be transcribed into
another type of nucleic acid, RNA. Altman and Cech have now
independently discovered that RNA is not only a molecule of
heredity but can also serve as a biocatalyst. In addition to this
conceptual influence on basic natural sciences, the discovery of
catalytic RNA will probably provide a new tool for gene technology,
with potential to create a new defense against viral infections.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Supports Disabled Rights Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration declared its
unqualified support Thursday for Senate-passed civil rights
legislation to protect the estimated 43 million disabled Americans.
   The Americans With Disabilities Act is ``fair, balanced
legislation'' that ``does not place undue burdens on Americans who
comply,'' Attorney General Richard Thornburgh told the House
Judiciary Committee.
   The Senate passed the legislation Sept. 7 by a vote of 76-8. The
bill was the result of negotiations between senators and the White
House to soften some of the impact on business.
   During testimony last June before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, Thornburgh had expressed administration
support but with some reservations. He said Thursday those concerns
had been resolved in negotiations.
   The bill guarantees the disabled equal access to public
accommodations _ restaurants, shops, movie theaters and doctors
offices, for example _ and to employment opportunities. As a result
of the compromise, the requirements will be phased in and punitive
damages will be disallowed.
   Thornburgh defended the bill against claims by the business
community that its provisions are vague. Thornburgh cited previous
laws, including civil rights requirements for companies that
receive government grants or contracts.
   Thornburgh declined to support a request by the business
community that it be allowed tax credits for architectural
modifications needed to meet the requirements of the law. Existing
law allows for tax deductions for those alterations.
   ``That has been suggested and examined,'' Thornburgh said. ``It
has an equitable appeal. But because of the fiscal situation and
restraints, the administration does not support such a credit.''
   Thornburgh also defended the administration's support of the
measure against challenges by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif.,
who suggested that most people infected with the AIDS virus should
be excluded from protection.
   Referring to people who acquired the virus through homosexual
contact or drug use, Dannemeyer asked whether someone should be
covered who had a ``communicable disease'' as a result of
``misconduct.''
   Thornburgh replied that Bush has pledged to support legislation
forbidding discrimination against HIV-infected people, a
recommendation made by the AIDS commission headed by now Energy
Secretary James Watkins.
   ``It's not always easy to prove how the AIDS was acquired,''
Thornburgh added.
   AIDS is also acquired through heterosexual contact and blood
transfusions.
   Also Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce telecommunications
and finance subcommittee approved a portion of the act that
requires telephone companies to provide a special relay service to
the speech or hearing impaired.
   The service would be available at no additional charge.
   The service involves use of typewriter-like devices that permit
written messages to be sent by telephone. A telephone operator then
relays either a spoken or written message to another person.
   The bill is before seven subcommittees of four House committees.
Supporters, including Thornburgh, have said they hope to have a
bill passed and ready for Bush's signature before the end of the
year.

<HEAD>House OKs Arms Control Agency Budget, Sends Bill to Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Thursday that
authorizes $73 million for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
and, in a concession to the White House, softens language on treaty
verification and inspection.
   By a vote of 400-11, the House adopted a bill suggesting that
President Bush form a working group to study verification for a
strategic arms reduction agreement and to assess the pact's effect
on the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   The bill earmarks $73 million for the arms control agency in
fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, and fiscal 1991. The agency
implements arms control agreements, studies questions of arms
control compliance and oversees the On-Site Inspection Agency.
   The legislation also includes $95 million for the On-Site
Inspection Agency in fiscal 1990 and fiscal 1991.
   The bill requests that the director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency report on whether to establish an Arms Control
Implementation and Compliance Resolution Bureau.
   The bureau would manage the implementation of existing and
future arms control agreements, and provide analyses and policy
reports on resolution of arms control compliance questions.
   Last month, the House failed to get the two-thirds vote required
for a similar arms control bill that included the stronger
language. The vote was 247-170.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, cited the Bush administration's objections to
some of the provisions as the reason for the vote.
   On Thursday, Fascell introduced an amendment that revised those
provisions and had the backing of the administration. The measure
was approved by voice vote.
   The final bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.

   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said
Thursday that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact assures ``a certain form
of military stability'' in Europe.
   Woerner also predicted both military alliances would survive the
1990s, even amid political change in the East and West. NATO,
according to the former West German defense minister, guarantees
peace and peaceful change.
   ``I have no doubt if you were an East European you would see it
as the main source of stability,'' Woerner said at a news
conference.
   Similarily, he said, the Warsaw Pact serves a useful purpose.
   ``It guarantees a certain form of military stability,'' Woerner
said. ``As you can see, it does not prevent change'' in Poland,
Hungary and in a ``mild form'' in East Germany.
   ``It's not our role to make a settlement guaranteeing the
existence of both or one pact,'' Woerner said. ``That would be a
major mistake. That is not the question.''
   But, he said of the Warsaw Pact: ``I only think that being
interested in military stability for the foreseeable future, the
next decade where we have to ensure a peaceful change, I think it
can and might play a useful role.''
   Woerner said the two alliances would operate in the future with
fewer weapons and in a posture of defense. However, he stressed
NATO should not be dissolved.
   ``Even in a landscape of political change we need the solid and
sound defense,'' he said. ``Turmoil is in the air every time there
is change.''
   Besides, he said, if Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev failed
in his program to restructure the Soviet Union ``someone could look
for a military solution to their problems.''
   Woerner appeared before a session of the Atlantic Council of the
United States, a private research group that promotes U.S. ties
with Western Europe.
   He was in Washington for meetings with President Bush,
administration officials and members of Congress.

<HEAD>Communist Party Resolves Better Environmental Protection</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with passage of resolution.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party passed a
resolution Thursday for better protection of the environment, and a
leading party official told dissidents not to use environmental
issues for political purposes.
   The offficial news agency CTK said the resolution, passed at the
end of a two-day Central Committee meeting, specified reductions in
heavy industry and metallurgy, lower energy consumption and
introduction of new technologies.
   On Wednesday, Politburo member Ivan Knotek told the committee:
``We must act resolutely against unrealistic, destructive and ...
anti-socialist attitudes manifested in the actions of the so-called
informal or illegal groups,'' CTK reported.
   ``They abuse the justified interest of our people in improving
the environment. ... Their demagogy stops at nothing.''
   Police dispersed 300 activists Sept. 13 who were protesting
construction of a coke plant at Stonava, near the Polish border.
Environmentalists also oppose a joint Hungarian-Czechoslovak dam
project on the Danube River.
   Talks between Premier Ladislav Adamec and his Hungarian
counterpart, Miklos Nemeth, on Wednesday brought little progress in
resolving the deadlock over the dam project, which Hungary wants to
halt. It ``temporarily suspended'' construction May 13, citing
environmental concerns.
   Nemeth and Adamec agreed to meet again before the end of the
month, when Hungary's parliament is to decide whether to continue
the Hungarian side of the project at Nagymaros, CTK said.
   Unlike Hungary, one of the most liberal East bloc nations,
Czechoslovakia tolerates little dissent.
   ``We should not give in to manifestations of negativism and
inconclusiveness,'' Knotek said, blaming the ``industrial
development of capitalism'' for the world's poor environmental
situation.
   ``We cannot agree with the abuse of this (ecological) process .
.. (used) as political pressure against socialist countries,
including Czechoslovakia,'' CTK quoted him as saying.
   Czechoslovakia has been plagued by pollution from coal-fueled
power plants, excessive use of pesticides resulting in high
nitrogen content in the soil, and frequent oil leaks into its
rivers.
   The daily Lidova Demokracie said Thursday the ``sickness rate''
in Prague had doubled in 15 years because of air and water
pollution.

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The status of press freedom in the
Americas is grim because of the danger journalists face in such
countries as Colombia and Panama, the Inter-American Press
Association concluded Thursday.
   The IAPA is an organization of 1,300 newspapers from the United
States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean whose main goal is
to guarantee press freedom throughout the Western Hemisphere.
   About 400 IAPA members attended the four-day assembly in this
industrial center in northeastern Mexico, 150 miles from the Texas
border.
   ``Even as representatives of the Western Hemisphere's free press
met in Monterrey, Mexico, the sound of gunshots fired by enemies of
that free press echoed off the assembly's wall,'' the report said.
   Three Colombian newspaper employees and the wife of a Salvadoran
journalist were gunned down Tuesday.
   ``While some advances are being made in nations throughout the
hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must
be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are
subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by
assassination,'' the organization said in a report issued on the
final day of its 45th general assembly.
   ``Nowhere is the struggle between the forces of darkness and the
forces of light more clearly drawn than in Colombia,'' the IAPA
said.
   ``There, at least 10 journalists have been murdered this year by
henchmen of the cocaine cartel, at least 40 in the past 12 years,''
the report said.
   Although the Colombian government is attempting to fight the
drug cartels, Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, ``is in league
with the traffickers,'' the IAPA charged.
   Noriega, who heads Panama's Defense Forces, has closed every
independent newspaper, radio and televion station and arrested,
tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters, according
to the association.
   ``In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the
hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is
worse than ever,'' the organization concluded.
   Meanwhile, promises of press reform by Nicaragua's Sandinista
government ``have not materialized,'' the IAPA said.
   The organization listed Mexico, Chile, Paraguay and the
Dominican Republic under the ``good news category.''
   Mexico ``has witnessed large steps'' toward press freedoms under
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, it said, citing the
government's pledge to sell its newsprint monopoly. In the past,
the government censored independent newspapers by withholding
newsprint.

   Alfred A. Knopf Inc. said Thursday it will
publish the memoirs of Katharine Graham, chairman and chief
executive officer of The Washington Post Co.
   Mrs. Graham, one of only three female chief executive officers
of Fortune 500 companies, is writing the book herself, said her
editor, Elisabeth Sifton, executive vice president of Knopf, a part
of the Random House publishing organization. No date has been set
for completion of the manuscript.
   ``I am just delighted. Kay Graham and I have been discussing her
memoirs for several years,'' Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and
president of Random House, said in a statement. He declined to say
how much Mrs. Graham was being paid.
   Mrs. Graham is one of the foremost figures in American
journalism, as publisher of The Washington Post from 1969 to 1979,
and as head of The Washington Post Co., whose media operations
include Newsweek magazine as well as broadcasting systems.
   Her father, Eugene Meyer, a banker, bought the Post at public
auction in 1933 for $825,000.
   Mrs. Graham was publisher of the Post when the newspaper made
the decision to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers and to
pursue the Watergate scandals.
   The Washington Post reported that Mrs. Graham, 72, declined
Wednesday to give details of the forthcoming book.
   However, Knopf said it will cover her childhood; her marriage to
Philip Graham and her subsequent career, after his death, as
publisher; and ``a life that has been rich in association with some
of the most prominent people of our time.''

   Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markovic said
Thursday that he wants $1 billion for his communist country's
banking system to cushion the anticipated blows of economic and
political reforms.
   Markovic, whose plan to institute a market-oriented economy has
been blocked by Communist Party conservatives, said he would meet
with U.S. bankers and World Bank officials to promote his request.
   Yugoslavia is asking the 152-member World Bank for a loan of
$300 million to $350 million, and has reached an agreement in
principle with one European country for a large loan, he said.
Markovic declined to name the country, but sources said it is
believed to be Italy.
   Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club, the Yugoslav
leader said he had discussed his country's banking needs with
American bankers and would bring up the problem in talks with
administration officials. He meets Friday with President Bush.
   Markovic, an engineer named to his post in March, is urging the
development of private enterprise and an end to government
interference in the running of businesses, including a halt to
subsidies of money-losing ventures.
   He also wants to reshape the banking system along Western lines
and to introduce a stocks and bonds market.
   The proposed changes are designed to stem the country's
staggering inflation rate, which has reached 1,200 percent
annually, to lower the $19 billion foreign debt and the 17 percent
unemployment rate and to ease ethnic tensions among provinces.
   Markovic advocates a multiparty system to help solve
Yugoslavia's economic problems, but the Communist Party has blocked
the democratic reforms being embraced by Poland and Hungary.
   Unlike Poland and Hungary, Yugoslavia is not seeking direct U.S.
aid, Markovic said. Rather, it wants to promote joint ventures with
American businesses and to encourage foreign ownership in
Yugoslavia.
   Markovic said his meetings here are designed to explain new
Yugoslav legislation that enables foreign investment and to attract
the same kind of interest in Yugoslavia shown by European
businesses.
   He warned, however, that ``changes are bound to bring social
problems,'' including an increase in unemployment to about 20
percent.
   ``To reduce social tensions, we have to act as fast as
possible'' to develop the private sector and the banking system, he
said.

   Miller Brewing Co. has filed a copyright
infringement lawsuit against a group of physicians that mocked
Miller Lite beer with ``Killer Lite'' T-shirts at a huge,
company-sponsored charity event last month.
   The suit contends the organization, Doctors Ought to Care,
should be forced to turn over profits from the sale of T-shirts and
other items because they included a facsimile of the Miller Lite
logo.
   The items were sold at a Miller-sponsored party Sept. 3 that
drew more than 120,000 people to the Astrodome. The event,
featuring a concert by The Who, raised $1 million for the Texas
Special Olympics.
   Houston physician Alan Blum, a member of the group who is named
as a defendant, said the lawsuit is a ``malicious'' attempt to
quiet the Augusta, Ga.-based organization.
   The physicians' group has a long history of ridiculing Philip
Morris Tobacco Co., corporate parent to the Milwaukee-based Miller.
   The lawsuit filed Sept. 28 in U.S. District Court in Houston
contends the T-shirts infringed on the Miller trademark for the
purpose of damaging the company's reputation and diluting its good
will.
   The company also is asking the court to permanently halt
distribution of the T-shirts.

<HEAD>NASA Says Ozone Depletion Over Antarctic Equals Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Depletion of ozone in the stratosphere over
the South Pole has equalled the record level that scientists found
in 1987, NASA reported Thursday.
   Scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
said that satellite measurements show that ozone density over the
Antarctic has declined by about 45 percent since early August, a
drop of about 1.5 percent a day.
   Arlin Krueger, Richard Stolarski and Mark Schoeberl, scientists
monitoring the south polar ozone levels, said the ozone depletion
recorded Oct. 5 matched the record low measured in 1987.
   The depletion occurs in what scientists call a ``hole'' that is
formed by a high altitude formation of clouds, extreme cold and
certain wind patterns over the South Polar area. Such a hole can
remain undisturbed for months. The the ozone depletion appears to
correct itself in the polar summer, but then reappears in the cold
months.
   ``It's becoming clear that the ozone hole is not going away in
the near future, although the depth will vary from year to year,''
Krueger is quoted as saying in a news release from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the
southern hemisphere using an instrument on board the NIMBUS-7
satellite for more than 10 years.
   Last year, ozone concentrations over Antarctica dropped by about
15 percent in September, about a third of the current depletion.
   Other studies have found some seasonal thinning of the ozone
layer above the North Polar region.
   Ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the ultraviolet
radiation from the sun. When intact, the ozone layer, in effect,
prevents damaging levels of UV radiation from reaching Earth. An
excess exposure to UV radiation is thought to be a major cause of
skin cancer, and some studies have shown that an increase in the
radiation also can harm plants and the human immune system.
   Depletion of the concentration of ozone is thought to be
increased by the interaction of certain manmade chemicals,
principally cholorfluorocarbons, or CFCs, a chemical used for
refrigerants and in the manufacture of some plastic products.
   Some U.S. manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans
to stop making the chemical compound or to guard against releasing
the chemicals into the atmosphere.
   Though it is a major component of smog and an atmospheric
pollutant at ground level, ozone forms an important part of the
radiation protection belt surrounding the Earth in the
stratosphere, which begins about 9{ miles above the Earth and
extends upward to about 39 miles.
   Ozone is a substance composed of three atoms of oxygen. It is
created naturally during thunderstorms. Common atmospheric oxygen
is composed of two atoms.

<HEAD>Survey: Smoking Decline Not Fast Enough for Federal No-Smoking Goal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The rate of smoking among Americans continues to
decline slowly but steadly, but the nation isn't likely to reach a
federal goal of 75 percent non-smokers by next year, federal health
officials said Thursday.
   A face-to-face survey of adult Americans, conducted in 1987,
shows that 28.8 percent are cigarette smokers, the national Centers
for Disease Control reported.
   That's down from 30.1 percent in a similar 1985 survey, but the
decline is apparently not enough for government researchers to
project meeting the official federal goal of less than 25 percent
by 1990.
   ``We're getting pretty close,'' said Dr. Ron Davis, director of
the CDC's Office of Smoking and Health. ``We're making progress,
and we're heading in the right direction.''
   CDC officials believed two years ago that the 1990 goal _ one of
several federal health targets set as this decade began _ could be
reached, partly because of a 1986 survey showing a national smoking
rate of 26.5 percent.
   But that survey, conducted by telephone, probably wasn't as
precise as the face-to-face survey reported Thursday, Davis said.
   The CDC said Thursday that smoking rates continue to fall by a
steady half percentage point a year as they've done since 1964 _
the year of the surgeon general's landmark warning that smoking
causes cancer and heart disease. At that time, 40 percent of the
country's adults smoked.
   The number of Americans who smoke will continue to drop,
possibly until just a small ``hard-core'' band of smokers is left,
Davis predicted.
   ``So far, we haven't seen any evidence of a leveling off (in
smoking's decline),'' he said.
   ``We need to intensify our efforts. ... Smokers tomorrow may be
more resistant to our message than smokers today,'' Davis said.
``We still have almost 400,000 Americans dying every year because
of smoking-related disease. We can't be complacent about smoking
rates going down.''
   The CDC's report, based on a survey of about 44,000 people,
showed that one in three adult Americans _ 39 percent of men and 27
percent of women _ uses tobacco of some sort, including cigarettes,
pipes, cigars and chewing tobacco. Among men, 31 percent smoke
cigarettes, compared to 27 percent of women.
   The report said young people are more likely to smoke cigarettes
than are older people; 33 percent of Americans age 25-44 smoke,
compared with 19 percent age 65-74 and 9 percent 75 and older.
   Five percent of U.S. adult men smoke cigars, while 3 percent
smoke pipes. Four percent use chewing tobacco and 3 percent use
snuff. The percentage of women using such alternate forms of
tobacco was well below 1 percent.
   The margin of error in the survey is 1 percent for all adults,
somewhat higher for subgroups.

   The farmer who found the 400-pound engine part
suspected of causing a jet crash that killed 112 people learned
today she will get a reward of more than $100,000 from General
Electric Co.
   ``It's just a shock,'' said Janice Sorenson, who found the piece
while harvesting corn Tuesday with a combine.
   GE had offered a $50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from
the rear engine of United Airlines Flight 232, which crashed July
19 in Sioux City, killing 112 people of 296 people on board. GE
manufactured the engine.
   Investigators suspect the fan disk came apart, causing the
engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jet's
hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to control.
   GE spokesman David Lane said the company would not give the
amount of the reward. But a source close to the matter said it
would be about $130,000, and Mrs. Sorenson today said GE told her
it would be more than $100,000.
   ``I'm just in shock. I can manage $20,000, but this?'' she said.
   The amount being given is more than $50,000 because of all the
fan blades and other parts still attached to the disk and because
some other small parts found in the ground with the disk.
   Mrs. Sorenson said she had no immediate plans for the money. She
and her husband, Dale, have lived on the farm since 1953.
   GE established a reward fund totaling $271,000 to pay for parts
recovered from the crash, Lane said; less than half that amount has
been paid.
   The disk, which looks like a windmill, was flown to a GE plant
near Cincinnati for analysis.
   ``We don't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're
looking for,'' said Jim Burnett, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board. ``But we're glad we found it.''
   Mrs. Sorenson found about two-thirds of the fan disk assembly,
and 100 searchers hired by GE will look for the rest of the disk
and its hardware over the weekend.

   Torn between humanitarianism and trying
not to offend East Germany, the non-communist government of Premier
Tadeusz Mazowiecki has sent conflicting signals on its policy
toward illegal East German refugees.
   A Foreign Ministry statement Thursday and a televised interview
with a government spokeswoman stressed that Poland has not
abandoned its treaty obligations to East Germany to send back to
its communist neighbor any East German citizens caught trying to
enter Poland illegally.
   But in practice, the policy appears to apply only to those East
Germans apprehended while trying to cross the border, not East
Germans who make it deeper into Poland.
   Foreign Minister Krysztof Skubiszewski said in an interview
published Thursday that he opposes deportations, whether the East
Germans are legal or illegal, while a border commander said earlier
that if East Germans make it to the interior of Poland, then that
is their ``luck.''
   Nevertheless, the government reacted quickly to an article in
the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza suggesting that Poland
will no longer oppose East Germans entering the country illegally.
   Both government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska and the
Foreign Ministry said Poland still opposes illegal entries. Ms.
Niezabitowska made the statement in a television appearance
Wednesday night, while the Foreign Ministry published its statement
Thursday.
   According to the Foreign Ministry statement, troops guarding
Poland's frontiers have the duty of ``counteracting illegal border
crossings.''
   It added that repeated and widely publicized promises by
Skubiszewski that no refugees would be deported against their will
``concern people who find themselves in Poland legally.''
   The Foreign Ministry statement, apparently designed to assuage
East German concerns, was conveyed to the East German public by
East Germany's state news agency ADN.
   For practical purposes, however, East Germans who successfully
cross the border area by swimming the Oder and Neisse rivers or
walking across the frontier are not being interfered with by Polish
officials, one border commander said.
   ``Obviously if someone succeeds in crossing the border and gets
deeper into Polish territory, then it is his luck and we do not
care about him,'' said Gen. Feliks Stramik, of the Military Border
Guard, interviewed by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Skubiszewski, in an interview Thursday in Gazeta Wyborcza, noted
that all over the world people who enter a country illegally are
liable to deportation.
   ``But that is not the point,'' the foreign minister said. ``I
still believe that deportations should not be taking place. I have
tried hard to prevent them.''
   Without specifying his efforts, he said his aim was to solve the
problem ``in accordance with Poland's duties in the field of human
rights but also in accordance with the interests of the state.''
   He said state interests ``should be handled so as to avoid
harming the individual.''
   Mazowiecki's government has several reasons to be sensitive to
the concerns of East Germany.
   When it took power as the first non-communist government in the
East bloc, it gave assurances that Poland would continue to respect
foreign policy commitments within the Warsaw Pact.
   Also, East Germany spans the direct roads between Poland and
Western Europe, and East German authorities could easily play havoc
with Polish tourism and commerce.
   Skubiszewski pointed to the fact that many Poles are employed in
East Germany ``and we must also take their interests into account.''
   Poland has taken a tolerant view to the 600 East Germans who
have made their way to the West German Embassy in Warsaw in the
past week. Unlike their counterparts in Czechoslovakia, the
refugees have not been forced to reside on the embassy grounds but
instead in vacation hotels.
   Both the Roman Catholic church and the Polish Red Cross have
been active in caring for the refugees.
   Two trainloads carrying more than 1,400 refugees were allowed to
leave Poland for West Germany last week with the agreement of the
East German government.

   ``Billy Bathgate,'' E.L. Doctorow's tale about
the 1930s underworld, and ``The Joy Luck Club,'' Amy Tan's account
of four Chinese women and their daughters, were among the 10
finalists for National Book Awards announced Thursday.
   Doctorow's earlier novel, ``World's End,'' captured a 1986
National Book Award.
   His ``Billy Bathgate,'' published by Random House, and Tan's
``The Joy Luck Club,'' by G.P. Putnam's Sons, are nominees in the
fiction category along with:
   _``Spartina,'' (Knopf), John Casey's study of a fisherman's
struggle to become master of his life.
   _``Geek Love,'' (Knopf), Katherine Dunn's novel about freaks in
a traveling carnival.
   _``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux), Oscar Hijuelo's portrait of brothers from Havana who
become minor celebrities as musicians in New York nightclubs.
   Last year's finalists in the non-fiction category included four
biographies. But this year, all of the non-fiction finalist books
deal with public policy. They are:
   _``Parting the Waters,'' (Simon and Schuster), the first volume
of Taylor Branch's history of the American civil rights movement in
the 1950s and '60s.
   _``Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First
Fifty Years,'' (Random House, Inc.), McGeorge Bundy's political
history of the nuclear bomb.

(Farrar, Straus and Giroux), William Pfaff's analysis of American
foreign policy since World War II.
   _``Mother Country,'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), Marilynne
Robinson's investigation of environmental policies in Great Britain.
   The winners will be announced Nov. 29 at an awards ceremony in
Manhattan. Each will receive a $10,000 prize. The second annual
National Book Award Medal for Distinguished Contribution to
American Letters also will be presented that evening.
   A record 328 books, all of them published between Nov. 1, 1988,
and Nov. 1, 1989, were submitted by publishers for consideration.
   The National Book Awards, established in 1950, are presented by
the National Book Foundation, a nonprofit institution.

   Cable News Network pulled the plug on
unchallenged commentaries, including the wry observations of Linda
Ellerbee, in an unexplained ``management decision,'' CNN spokesmen
said Thursday.
   Commentaries on CNN's discussion programs, and the opposing
views expressed on them, will continue on the 24-hour schedule.
Those programs are ``Crossfire,'' ``Evans &amp; Novak'' and the
``Capitol Gang.''
   CNN gave no reason for the end Monday to free-standing
commentaries, including those of Ellerbee, Robert Novak, Marty
Schramm, weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster Jim Huber.
   Steve Haworth, a spokesman at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, said
``it was just a management decision.''
   All of the commentators but Ellerbee do other work for CNN.
   ``We hope to keep her on the air in some capacity,'' said CNN
spokesman John Bianchi in New York.
   A recent editorial in The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.,
criticized a Spiceland commentary in which the weatherman said
women's logic ``is one of those contradictory terms like military
intelligence.''
   Haworth would not comment on reports that Ted Turner, who owns
CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System, ordered the end of
unchallenged commentaries after the editorial.
   Of the major network evening newscasts, only the ``NBC Nightly
News'' still regularly airs commentary, by John Chancellor. ABC's
``World News Tonight'' does it on an irregular basis with George
Will, said Elise Adde, an ABC News spokeswoman.
   CBS, whose ``CBS Evening News'' commentaries in recent years
were by Bill Moyers, discontinued them after Moyers quit in 1986
and returned to public TV. CBS, however, still has the only network
humorous commentator working in prime time television _ Andy Rooney
of ``60 Minutes.''

   Outgoing Mayor Edward I. Koch announced Thursday
he'll join WNEW-AM this January so he can continue to give New
Yorkers a piece of his mind five days a week.
   Koch, whose term ends Dec. 31, will provide a daily spot taking
``a light and humorous look at life in New York,'' said WNEW-AM
General Manager Michael Kakoyiannis. Koch is due to begin the week
of Jan. 2, and most of his appearances will be live phone-ins, said
Kakoyiannis.
   ``I'm very excited to officially join the WNEW family,'' Koch
said in a statement. ``The station is such a part of New York, it's
really a natural outlet for me.''
   Kakoyiannis said he wasn't worried about how the mayor would
stack up with his morning drive time competition like ``shock
radio'' personality Howard Stern. ``I think he's funnier, cleaner
and more New York.''
   Others are also vying for Koch's time. New York Post Editor
Jerry Nachman denied reports in The Wall Street Journal that the
Post has an agreement with the mayor to write a column after his
term ends. But he said they're talking about it.
   ``The newspaper stories are further along than the
negotiations,'' Nachman said.
   The lame-duck Democrat, who lost the party's mayoral nomination
to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins in September, already
has accepted a one-year post as a visiting fellow at New York
University.

   Federal safety investigators said today they
had found an apparently pre-existing crack in the engine disk
discovered in an Iowa corn field nearly three months after the
crash of an airliner that killed 112 people.
   James Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said the precise ``size, nature and reason for the
crack'' has yet to be determined.
   ``There has been no determination on whether this crack was
detectable before the accident, nor has there been a determination
whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure,'' said
board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. He said it had not been
determined whether the crack should have been caught in the last
engine inspection before the crash
   He and Kolstad said, however that preliminary evidence indicates
the crack existed prior to the July 19 United Airlines crash at
Sioux City, Iowa.
   The middle engine in the DC-10 disintegrated in flight, severing
hydraulic lines and making the plane almost impossible to steer.
The craft cartwheeled out of control as the pilots were trying to
make an emergency landing.

   The light illuminating the huge red

the state news agency MTI reported.
   The announcement was preceded by a decision to gradually remove
the red star emblem from all public buildings and replace it with
national symbols.
   The removal of the red star from parliament would take place in
the first half of 1990 and will cost a considerable sum of money,
``since safe removal will be a complicated technical operation
requiring specific arrangements,'' MTI said. It did not elaborate.
   The decision followed a last weekend's vote to disband the
Communist Party and form a Western-style Socialist Party advocating
political pluralism and private enterprise.

   A short circuit, lasting about 1 1@2 seconds,
caused some sparks and smoke on the middeck of the space shuttle
Columbia on its flight in August, NASA said Thursday.
   ``There is no ndication the astronauts were ever in any
danger,'' said NASA spokeswoman Sarah Keegan.
   The space agency confirmed a report, broadcast by Cable News
Network, that the crew handled the short circuit by unplugging a
teleprinter. The cause, NASA said, appeared to be damage to
insulation on a cable that connected the printer to the spaceship's
electrical system.
   A redesigned cable has been installed aboard Atlantis for the
Galileo space probe mission next week. The covering has been
changed to Teflon to make it more flexible, Miss Keegan said.
   The shuttle, with five astronauts aboard, was on a military
mission on the Aug. 8-13 flight and the crew maintained radio
silence throughout.
   ``The crew reported seeing some sparks and some smoke was
recorded by one of the cabin smoke detectors,'' NASA said in a
response prepared for questions that were raised about the incident
in late August.
   ``While the detector recorded the smoke twice, it was not enough
to sound the alarm aboard the orbiter,'' NASA said. ``There is no
evidence that the short was caused by the teleprinter in any way.
The most likely cause is physical damage to the cable conductor
insulation material.''

<HEAD>King Urges U.S. Pressure On South Africa To Give Safe Passage To
ANC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Moshoeshoe of Lesotho on Thursday urged
the Bush administration to press South Africa to allow leaders of
the outlawed African National Congress to attend power-sharing
talks hosted by his tiny kingdom.
   Lesotho, a small landlocked enclave within South Africa, is
exploring a plan to host talks between the black majority and the
white minority government of the larger nation, he said.
   ``Lesotho is well positioned to play a role in the process of
facilitating reconciliation between the people of South Africa,''
he told reporters.
   In his meetings with Vice President Dan Quayle and top State
Department officials, Moshoeshoe said he would ask that ``pressure
be brought to bear'' on South Africa to allow safe passage into
Lesotho of the exiled ANC leadership from neighboring African
states.
   South Africa blockaded Lesotho in 1986, saying it was trying to
prevent the smuggling of ANC guerrillas and weapons into the
kingdom. The strained relations with South Africa resulted in a
military coup that overthrew the left-leaning prime minister Leabua
Jonathan later that year.
   Moshoeshoe governs in consultation with the military council,
which holds most of the power and is on better terms with South
Africa than he is.
   ``Our opposition to apartheid is without compromise,'' he said.
While recent steps announced by newly elected President F.W. de
Klerk to release political prisoners and allow blacks more freedom
are welcome, he said, ``apartheid cannot be reformed.'' The
government must free all political prisoners, legalize opposition
movements and allow banned black leaders to return from exile, he
said.
   Moshoeshoe also said international pressure on South Africa must
be kept up, but he cautioned that economic sanctions are also
damaging to the economies of Lesotho and other so-called front-line
states that border South Africa.
   Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa and totally
dependent on it for its survival. The British-educated monarch said
he was seeking foreign investment in the kingdom so that its 1.5
million people could shake off their dependence on South Africa.

   A ship carrying 152 Vietnamese refugees arrived
Thursday at the Japanese island of Iriomote Shima, 125 miles east
of Taiwan, Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said.
   An official of the agency, which is Japan's coast guard, said an
agency patrol boat would tow the ship to Naha, Okinawa, for
questioning of the boat people because engine trouble had left the
ship unable to sail under its own power.
   The ship is to arrive in Naha on Saturday, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   One of the boat people told authorities the group left Vietnam
on Sept. 10 and visited China's Hainan Island and Taiwan before
arriving at Iriomote Shima, the official said.
   With the new arrival, 3,371 Vietnamese boat people have arrived
in Japan this year, compared with 219 in all of 1988, Justice
Ministry officials said.
   At least 754 of the recent arrivals, however, were Chinese
nationals trying to enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees,
they said.
   On Sept. 13, Japan began a policy of screening boat people and
accepting those deemed to be fleeing political persecution but
refusing permission to stay for those who came to seek economic
betterment.
   On Monday, Vietnamese Ambassador to Japan Vo Van Sang said his
goverment would take back economic migrants only if they wanted to
return home.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Soviet Bloc Aid to Nicargua Increasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union apparently ``approved and may
be orchestrating'' delivery of Soviet bloc weapons and equipment to
Nicaragua despite pledges to halt its own shipments of weapons,
Pentagon officials said Thursday.
   ``If present trends continue, 1989 could exceed 1988 in total
tonnage and dollar value of Sovet bloc military shipments to
Nicaragua,'' the Pentagon said in a report.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told President Bush in May
that the Soviet Union had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaragua
at the end of 1988.
   However, the Soviet Union has sent the leftist government in
Managua some $500 million in various other forms of military aid
this year, U.S. officials have said.
   ``Evidence is circumstantial, but we believe the Soviets have
approved and may be orchestrating the delivery of Soviet block
lethal aid to the Sandinistas through Cuba,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``It is unlikely that either the Eastern bloc nations or Cuba
would act on their own _ in contravention of clearly articulated
Soviet policy _ to boost military shipments to Nicaragua.''
   The Pentagon said that during the first nine months of this
year, Soviet military deliveries are ``down by about 50 percent,
but Eastern bloc deliveries have increased by about 35 percent,
essentially offsetting the decrease.''
   In addition, deliveries from Cuba to Nicaragua _ primarily of
small arms and ammunition _ are ``almost double the amount
delivered in the same period in 1988,'' the report said.
   The Pentagon said it doesn't believe Cuba has the capability of
producing the quantities of weapons being shipped to Nicaragua.
While some could be from Cuban stocks, the report said, ``we judge
that for the most part these arms and ammunition are being
transshipped from the Soviet Union through Cuba.''
   Since the Central American peace accords were signed in August
1987, the report said the Sandinistas have received ``some 36,500
metric tons of Soviet bloc military aid valued at $1.045 billion,''
allowing Managua to field the ``largest and most powerful armed
force in Central America.''
   The Eastern bloc shipments include surface-to-air missiles,
armed transport helicopters, a MI-25 HIND attack helicopter, North
Korean patrol boats and ``a record number of vehicles, including
radar and communications trucks,'' the report said.
   The study strikes a discordant note amid the thaw in U.S.-Soviet
relations, which appeared particularly upbeat after the Wyoming
meeting last month between Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``Our problem has to do with an increase in Soviet bloc weapons
and military equipment going into Central America, going into
Nicaragua, quite frankly, and from Nicaragua to the FMLN
(guerrillas) in El Salvador,'' Baker said after the meeting.
   ``Most of that is coming from Cuba, and we would simply like to
see the Soviet Union do as much as it possibly could with Cuba to
stop that flow.''
   Shevardnadze went to Nicaragua and Cuba after the Wyoming
session, and U.S. officials said they understood he tried to use
his influence to reduce the flow of weapons and equipment.
   The Pentagon report reflects a review of shipments from 1979
until Oct. 1, and would therefore not reflect any change since
Shevardnadze's visit.
   Nicaragua continues to arm ``far in excess of its legitimate
defensive needs'' and apparently intends to beef up its military
stores and use the supplies against Contra forces, as well as to
support rebels in El Salvador and Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the report said.
   The United States halted its shipments to the Contras in
February.
   In 1988, the report said, there were 68 Soviet bloc and Cuban
arms shipments to Nicaragua, amounting to 19 metric tons at an
estimated cost of $515 million. In the first nine months of this
year, there were 55 such shipments, amounting 14 metric tons valued
at $414 million.
   Since 1979, the Soviet bloc, Cuba and North Korea have provided
Nicaragua with some 152,500 metric tons of military equipment at an
estimated value of $3.16 billion, the report said.

<HEAD>Remains of Shakespeare's Globe Under Parking Lot &amp; Hazelnuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to ADD location.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beneath a parking lot, under a mulch of hazelnuts
perhaps left by snacking drama patrons, archaeologists believe they
have found the remains of William Shakespeare's Globe Theater.
   ``Certainty is a scarce commodity in archaeology but the
probability is very high,'' said Harvey Sheldon, a senior
archaeologist at the Museum of London. ``Essentially, this is the
site where the Globe ought to lie.''
   A plaque put up nearby in 1909 by the Shakespeare Reading
Society of London identified the likely site of the most famous
Elizabethan theater on the south bank of the River Thames. The site
is by Southwark Bridge and two-thirds of a mile east of the
National Theater.
   On Thursday, the hopes of Shakespeare lovers were rewarded with
the first glimpses of three chalk and brick foundation walls that
Sheldon said were part of the back of the theater.
   ``Finding the theater as a marker is very important,'' he said.
``Clearly, the importance in terms of scholarship can only come
from investigation.''
   The Globe was built in 1599 by Cuthbert and Richard Burbage and
a company of actors, including Shakespeare. Little was known about
the shape except that it was described as ``this wooden O'' in the
prologue to Shakespeare's ``Henry V.''
   Sheldon said: ``If you look at the outline (of the remains) from
the top, you'll see it is actually beginning to make the O shape or
the polygonal shape.''
   A second piece of evidence was the discovery of a large quantity
of crushed hazelnut shells near one wall, he said.
   Hazelnuts were the Elizabethan equivalent of popcorn, and
Sheldon said the shells appear to have been used as a building
material, possibly to level the theater's floors.
   The Globe became one of the most popular theaters of its day and
saw the first performances of Shakespeare's great tragedies
``Hamlet,'' ``Othello,'' ``King Lear'' and ``Macbeth.''
   During the first performance of Shakespeare's ``Henry VIII'' on
June 29, 1613, a cannon that discharged set fire to the theater and
it was destroyed. The only injury, according to a contemporary
account by Sir Henry Wotten, was to a man whose breeches caught
fire but had the ``provident wit (to) put it out with bottle ale.''
   The Globe was rebuilt the following year on the old foundations,
and again was a hit with audiences who paid 1 pence for the pit, 2
pence for the gallery and 3 pence for a seat. The most privileged
members of the audience sat on stools on the stage.
   But the Puritans, who were against public displays, helped push
an ordinance through Parliament in 1642 banning stage plays, and
the Globe was closed, along with other theaters. It was demolished
two years later.
   Archaeologists knew the general location of the Globe but it was
the sale three years ago of the Courage brewery by owners Imperial
PLC to the British conglomerate Hanson PLC that led to the
excavation of the brewery's parking lot this summer.
   Sheldon said the remains were discovered in the northwest corner
of the lot, the last section on the 21,500-square-foot site to be
cleared of concrete reinforced with metal.
   To the untrained eye, the corner site near the south end of
Southwark Bridge looks like a deep hole with the remains of
concrete pillars and rows of bricks.
   With help from Sheldon, one can spot an outer brick wall. A
middle wall 3 yards long and made of gray-white chalk blocks is
believed to be part of the first Globe theater, while an inner
brick wall, 1 yard long and with a layer of crushed hazelnuts, may
be part of the second Globe, he said.
   The three surviving wall foundations cover an area 10 yards by 6
yards and form the eastern part of the theater. But archaeologists
say most of the theater lies beyond the edge of the parking lot
excavation under early 19th century row houses also owned by
Hanson, which are under historic preservation orders.
   Earlier this year, archaeologists excavated a sister Elizabethan
theater, the Rose, less than 100 yards away. Actors and historians
campaigned against a developer's plans to cover it up and it is
being partially preserved.
   Lord Hanson, whose company contributed $390,000 to support the
latest dig, said the Globe's remains would be preserved for public
display.
   Asked whether the row houses might be torn down to excavate the
rest of the Globe, Hanson spokesman Michael Shea said: ``I think
that's very much for the conservationists to argue over and I think
we'll stand back and watch them decide.''
   American film actor-director Sam Wanamaker, who is building a
$31 million reconstruction of the Globe about 200 yards away,
watched the archaeologists work and said: ``We're absolutely
thrilled.''
   He said the reconstruction was suspended in hopes that
discoveries by the archaeologists will help him build a more
faithful replica of the Bard's playhouse.

   A bar fight exploded into a brawling
rampage involving hundreds of American and British seamen that left
cars overturned, windows smashed and more than 100 people injured,
police said Thursday.
   Police said they arrested 121 U.S. and British sailors after an
estimated 500 seamen and scores of police brawled Wednesday night
along Lisbon's seedy, bar-dotted dockside.
   The sailors were released to their ships Thursday morning and a
British aircraft carrier cut short a courtesy call and left for
home because of the fighting.
   U.S. Embassy officials insisted that most if not all injuries
were caused by police. Portuguese police said sailors fought among
themselves, then turned on officers trying to break up the melees.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said 142 U.S.
sailors were treated for injuries. He said 40 sailors had to be
hospitalized for injuries such as damaged spleens or possible
concussions.
   Williams said the brawl was being investigated but that there
were several versions of what he called ``a very confused
situation.''
   Portuguese police said four police officers and three civilians
were among the injured.
   Paulino Cardoso, duty officer at Lisbon's security police, said
the melee broke out after three black American seamen attacked a
white U.S. sailor at the Passport Bar in the gaudy, neon-lighted
Cais do Sodre area. That account could not be confirmed.
   A Pentagon official who asked not to be identified said the
injured included officers, a chaplain and intelligence officers who
were trying to calm a confrontation that arose when police tried to
clear an area of sailors following some type of disturbance.
   The official said there were reports that indicated police were
responsible for ``severe indiscriminate beatings.''
   U.S. Embassy information officer Arthur Liefkowitz said: ``All
the 142 injuries treated seem to have resulted from clashes with
the police.''
   A Lisbon public security police force spokesman, Lt. Pereira
Chumbinho, did not deny force was used. But he said sailors
``maltreated'' the first two police crews to arrive on the scene,
then surrounded a third vehicle.
   ``Then we had to send in three more cars and more forces, but it
is sure that the sailors were fighting among themselves and then
turned on the police,'' he said.
   Fighting spread from bar to nightclub along the narrow, cobbled
streets of the riverside area about 9 p.m., Cardoso said.
   He said British seamen from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal,
which arrived in Lisbon on Wednesday on a five-day goodwill visit,
joined in the brawling.
   Ark Royal Commander Christopher Thomas said only a few British
sailors had been ``caught up'' in the fighting.
   ``There is no evidence of fighting between American and British
sailors ... and I am confident my men were not involved in any
drunkenness, damage or trouble of any kind,'' Ark Royal Capt. John
Brigstocke later told reporters.
   Cardoso said British sailors had been arrested with the
Americans.
   Shore leave was canceled from the Ark Royal and aboard the U.S.
assault craft Nassau, Barnstable County and Shreveport.
   The U.S. ships were in Lisbon during a break from NATO exercises
off the Portuguese coast and slated to leave Oct. 20.
   Brigstocke said the Ark Royal was cutting short its courtesy
call to Lisbon and departed today for Portsmouth, England.
   ``It was very confused _ there were police cars driving one way,
and sailors running the other, but we had no trouble,'' said an
employee at the nearby Hatari Bar, who asked not to be identified.
   ``It was just like Hill Street Blues,'' said a shopkeeper.
   Cars were turned over, windows were smashed and about 40 sailors
were arrested when they stormed the local police station, Portugese
police said.

   The federal government lacks an overall
strategy for handling the huge amounts of scientific and technical
information generated by government agencies, the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment said Thursday.
   An OTA study observed that in the earth and space sciences
alone, it is estimated that federal agencies are managing a data
archive of roughly 100,000 gigabytes, the equivalent of about 45
billion pages of text.
   Developing an overall strategy for scientific and technical
information is needed, the congressional office said, if the
potential of new electronic technologies is to be fully realized.
   It said technologies such as online electronic databases or
high-density optical disks and magnetic cartridges offer ``great
promise'' for timely, cost-effective storage and dissemination of
the federal government's information.
   ``Electronic technologies offer the only real hope for managing
the already massive federal archives of scientific data and
documents,'' the OTA report said.
   It noted that federal science agencies and interagency
coordinating groups have made some progress in a variety of areas
related to handling scientific and technical information.
   ``While these modest achievements were adequate for the earlier
stages of the transition to a competitive, electronic environment,
bolder initiatives are now necessary,'' the congressional agency
said.
   It recommended expanding the role of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy in dealing with scientific and
technical information, as well as improving coordination between
that office and the presidential Office of Management and Budget.

<TEXT>
   The House voted final, overwhelming approval
Thursday for a federal ban on flag burning, just four months after
a Supreme Court decision allowing destruction of an American flag
as political protest.
   ``This is the least we can do to protect the sanctity of the
flag,'' Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said before the House voted,
371-43, to approve the bill.
   However, President Bush and many Republicans say Congress must
do more than pass a mere statute, and they have been pressing for a
constitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration.
The Senate will take up that issue next week.
   Still, 154 Republicans joined 217 Democrats in supporting the
statutory ban on Thursday, while only 18 Republicans and 25
Democrats opposed it. The bill passed the Senate 91-9.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House had not yet received the bill but when it arrives ``we'll
have to have a legal review take place.''
   Fitzwater declined to say whether Bush would veto it or sign it.
However, administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the president was expected to let it go into effect without
his signature.
   ``The president obviously agrees with its general purpose but
feels a constitutional amendment is required to survive legal
challenges,'' Fitzwater said of the bill.
   Bush said last week that a new statute would not be adequate to
get around the Supreme Court decision, which threw out the
conviction of a Texas flag burner.
   Bush backed earlier congressional proposals for a constitutional
amendment but Congress scrapped them in favor of the legislative
approach.
   The bill on its way to Bush would revise existing federal law
and provide up to a year in a jail and a $1,000 fine for anyone who
``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns,
maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the
United States.''
   The one-sided votes in Congress reflected the power of the flag
as a political symbol, as demonstrated by a public outcry following
the Supreme Court decision in June.
   Derrick told the House that the court's decision, throwing out
the conviction of Texas flag burner Gregory Lee Johnson on grounds
that his right to free speech was violated, hit Americans like ``a
slap in the face.''
   Bush joined the call for a constitutional amendment, but
Democratic leaders said changing the Constitution would be too
drastic an action in response to an isolated case.
   ``Amending the Constitution as some would advance should be a
last resort and not a first resort,'' said Rep. William J. Hughes,
D-N.J. He said the issue should ``be addressed in a much less
dramatic manner.''
   However, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said, ``To
those who believe we can overturn a Supreme Court decision at this
time by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words of the farmer
who, asked directions, said, `you can't get there from here.'''
   Supporters of the bill approved Thursday said the wording had
been carefully fashioned to withstand court challenges, banning
flag defacement regardless of whether it involved political protest.
   ``It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag
rather than any message that the action might convey that is to be
punished,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, told
the House.
   Brooks said the bill has been framed in a ``content neutral
manner.''
   But that idea drew scoffing from some Republicans, who said that
any bill to ban flag burning by simple statute would be overturned
for the same reasons as the Texas case.
   ``Approval of this bill will send a fatally flawed statute ...
to the president of the United States,'' said Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
   Sensenbrenner pointed in particular to an amendment attached by
the Senate last week at the urging of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. It
added the words ``physically defiles'' to the list of prohibited
acts.
   Critics said anyone who physically defiled the flag would
obviously have an attitude toward it and thus the measure would end
up punishing political protest, no matter how carefully sponsors
may have sought to avoid it.
   As in the Senate, many House lawmakers clearly planned to vote
for both the bill and the constitutional amendment, a strategy
considered politically safe.
   A number of Republicans who voted against the bill, calling it
inadequate, were joined by a smattering of Democrats who said that
neither the amendment nor the bill should be approved.

<HEAD>AP Board Approves 4.9 Percent Assessment Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Associated Press
approved a 1990 general assessment increase of 4.9 percent for
newspaper and broadcast members.
   The increase takes effect Jan. 14, 1990, for AP's 1,705
newspaper and 5,800 broadcast members.
   William J. Keating, AP board chairman and chief executive
officer of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, said the increase was
needed to help pay for new services for the members, necessary
staff additions and election year expenses, as well as other new
costs.
   Keating noted that for the fourth year in a row, the increase
was less than next year's predicted rate of inflation.
   ``Tight cost controls and growing revenues from non-traditional
sources enabled the board to limit the increase and continue to
improve service,'' Keating said. ``Those other sources now
contribute 22 percent of our revenue.''
   Keating said the AP's proposed operating and capital budgets
were examined by the board on a detailed, line-by-line basis.
   The budgets provide for launching of AP's high speed photo
delivery system, PhotoStream; expansion, installation and training
for the new SelectStocks market services; and other new products
for AP members.
   The general assessment increase will be combined with another
step in the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for
those members that have not yet reached their appropriate
assessment level. The 1990 assessment will also reflect any
circulation changes at the member newspaper.
   Each member will receive exact figures on the assessment change
by Nov. 1, Keating said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker, Experts Criticize Grain Reserve Depletion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A North Dakota lawmaker and food-supply
experts said Thursday that the Bush administration's depletion of
grain reserves has artificially held down prices and taken away the
nation's buffer against shortages.
   ``It appears to me ... that the USDA has intentionally used our
reserve programs to soften the price of wheat,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., told the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans
and feed grains.
   Prices, he said, are shaped by supply and supply is determined
by the amount of grain in the fields, granaries and the pipeline.
   ``USDA used the reserve grain to keep the pipeline full, so even
though the supply in the granaries is dwindling, the pipeline
remains full and millers and exporters don't have to look far for
wheat,'' Dorgan said.
   But with reserves dwindling, the price-stabilizing buffer is
nearly gone, said Rodney Leonard, executive director of Community
Nutrition Institute, a consumer group.
   ``Grain and food prices in the U.S. and the world have been
relatively stable over the past three years only because the U.S.
had unintentionally built an enormous stockpile of wheat, corn and
feed grain,'' Leonard said.
   The United States' emergency grain reserve of 4 million tons of
wheat, or about 170 million bushels, will be gone by next spring,
he said.
   ``Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, who is guardian of
this reserve, released it last month, but under circumstances that
hardly qualify as an emergency for which the reserve was
designed,'' Leonard told the subcommittee.
   On Sept. 13, Yeutter gave wheat farmers permission to increase
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish wheat
reserves. The next day, President Bush announced Yeutter would have
the authority to take grain out of reserve for food aid.
   Leonard said that in the past food-aid needs have been supplied
by the open market and benefited farmers by causing prices to go
up. The administration's action, however, kept prices from rising.
   ``It is our judgment that the flexibility in the management of
reserves has been overdone,'' said Don Reeves, a Nebraska farmer
and policy analyst for Bread for the World, a 40,000 member
Christian organization that wants to help alleviate world hunger.
   ``We are distressed at the more recent drawdown of reserve
stocks to levels we regard as risky, if not dangerous,'' he said.
   Dorgan, Leonard and Reeves were among witnesses called by
subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., in his effort to
formulate a policy for use of grain reserves that could become part
of the 1990 farm bill.
   Neither Congress nor the White House has determined the specific
purpose of withholding grain, leading the reserves to be used for a
variety of things, such as emergency aid to foreign countries, feed
for livestock in time of drought, export subsidies or manipulation
of market prices.

<HEAD>House Wants CIA To Hand Over Classified Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Thursday asserted a right to delve
into CIA classified investigation reports as part of its
responsibility to oversee the agency.
   The action came in a bill authorizing activities of the nation's
intelligence agencies for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. The
overall bill, most of which is classified, was approved on a vote
of 369-31.
   While the total amount the United States spends on intelligence
activities is secret, reports put the figure at somewhat more than
$25 billion. Most of the money is tucked away in various Pentagon
accounts and covers everything from personnel and spy hardware,
such as satellites, to covert operations overseas.
   Language in the bill would require the CIA to submit to the
House and Senate intelligence committees twice a year a list of all
investigation and audit reports prepared by the agency's inspector
general and to turn over any report requested by either committee.
   The Bush administration contends the requirement is an
unconstitutional intrusion on its authority and could jeopardize
the confidentiality of investigative reports. Administration
officials say the provision would be cause for a veto.
   The provision is the result of a long-running dispute between
the spy agency and the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Dave
McCurdy, D-Okla., said the committee voted unanimously to slap the
new requirements on the CIA, ``not so we can mount a fishing
expedition, but to assess the adequacy'' of the agency's own
internal controls.
   House access to CIA investigative reports has been ``a matter of
some sensitivity'' to Director of Central Intelligence William
Webster, McCurdy said.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is at work on its own version
of the bill, which would make the agency's inspector general more
like the independent auditors at other federal agencies, including
a requirement that the person be confirmed by the Senate. That
version of the bill is expected to be sent to the full Senate next
week, and differences in the two bills will ultimately have to be
worked out in House-Senate negotiations.
   The Senate panel has not had the same difficulties as its House
counterpart in gaining access to investigation reports, according
to a committee aide.
   Dealing with another issue that has been contentious, the
committee built safeguards into the bill to prevent the Bush
administration from funneling any covert aid to political opponents
of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   No money could be used for such an effort unless the CIA first
seeks permission from the Intelligence and Appropriations
committees in the House and Senate. The administration is
separately seeking $9 million in above-board aid to strengthen the
election process and enhance the opposition's chances in next
February's elections.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., also used the occasion to question
continued U.S. support for the Angola's UNITA rebels, which now
amounts to $40 million.
   Wolpe alleged that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has sought to
torpedo efforts to foster peace between his forces and the Marxist
Angolan government, and said the United States has failed to adopt
a new policy that recognizes shifting conditions in Southern Africa.
   ``The African heads of state involved are showing less and less
confidence in American intentions,'' Wolpe said.

   Farmers are harvesting a corn crop estimated
at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51 percent from last year's
drought-plagued harvest of 4.92 billion bushels, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Moreover, the latest estimate, based on Oct. 1 field surveys,
was almost 2 percent more than the 7.32 billion bushels forecast a
month ago.
   At 7.45 billion bushels the harvest would be the largest since
the 8.25 billion bushels of 1986. The record was the 1985 crop of
nearly 8.9 billion bushels.
   ``The crop is being harvested at a slower rate than normal due
to the lateness of the crop in some states,'' the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service reported. ``By Oct. 1, 16
percent of the crop had been harvested in the 19 major producing
states, compared with 34 percent last year and the average of 22
percent.''
   Corn yields were estimated at 114.4 bushels per acre harvested,
up from 112.4 forecast in September and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but
still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is an essential ingredient for the production of
meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in
1988, are expected to go up 5 percent to 7 percent this year,
according to department economists.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.93 billion bushels, up 24 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 2 percent above the
September estimate of 1.89 billion bushels.
   Yields were estimated at an average of 32.6 bushels per acre
this year, compared with 26.8 bushels in 1988 and the September
forecast of 32 bushels. The record was 34.1 bushels per acre in
1985.
   Despite the greatly improved yields of major crops, parts of the
country still suffer from long-term effects of the 1988 drought.
And that raises questions about future harvests.
   ``We always start looking ahead to next year, and we're not out
of the woods yet, in the sense that in lots of places the subsoil
moisture is not normal,'' said private analyst William C. Motes of
Sparks Commodities Inc.
   But he added that ``the only thing that it really means at this
point is that the risk is a little higher than in a normal year,
the risk of a shortfall'' in 1990.
   The revised estimates showed total wheat production at 2.04
billion bushels, up 13 percent from last year, but 1 percent below
the September forecast of 2.06 billion bushels.
   Wheat yields were estimated to average 32.9 bushels per
harvested acre, compared with 34.1 bushels in 1988. The October
yield was unchanged from September but the acreage for harvest was
reduced 1 percent. The record yield was 39.4 bushels in 1983.
   Winter wheat production, which accounts for about three-fourths
of the total, was estimated at 1.45 billion bushels, 1 percent less
than the previous forecast made in August and repeated in
September. That was down 7 percent from 1988. Yields averaged 35.1
bushels per acre, up from 35 bushels indicated previously but down
from 39.2 last year.
   Production of durum wheat, which is planted in the spring, was
indicated at 92.9 million bushels, up 107 percent from last year's
drought-ravaged harvest but down 1 percent from the September
estimate.
   Other spring wheat was shown at 497 million bushels, up 142
percent from the 1988 harvest but down 1 percent from September.
   Cotton production was indicated at 12 million bales, down 22
percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September
estimate of 12.3 million bales. The yield was estimated at 603
pounds per acre, down 16 pounds from 1988 and 15 pounds below the
September forecast.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that
began on Sept. 1 is still expected to be around 7.5 billion
bushels, including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a
further drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.88 billion bushels
left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year.
   Even so, that represents only a slight dip in the U.S. corn
stockpile, compared with last season's decline, when it plummeted
from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988 to the 1.93 billion
bushels on hand this Sept. 1.
   The report said corn prices may average in the range of $1.85 to
$2.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $2.54
last season, unchanged from the September report.
   Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared
with 1988 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 656.7 million bushels and an average yield of 62.4
bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988.
   _Rice, 155.1 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,649 pounds
per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511.
   _Peanuts, 4.34 billion pounds and a yield of 2,639 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445.
   _Tobacco, 1.48 billion pounds and a yield of 2,122 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160.
   _Sugarbeets, 26.6 million tons and a yield of 20.1 tons per
acre, compared with 24.8 million and 19.1.
   _Sugarcane, 30.5 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per acre,
compared with 29.9 million and 35.4.

<HEAD>Small School Buses Could Be Safer, Board Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More safety features are needed on the
nation's 41,000 small school buses to protect children in
accidents, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board
said Thursday.
   James Kolstad, acting board chairman, said an 18-month
investigation into the buses that make up 10 percent to 15 percent
of the total school bus fleet shows that injuries to students in
accidents generally have been minor.
   ``But the board believes that improvements can be made,''
Kolstad said in discussing the report adopted by the board
Wednesday night.
   Crash-sled tests and federal standards are needed to increase
protection of children in front-row seats of smaller school buses,
the board concluded.
   The report found small buses to be generally safe but called for
improved front-door latches and windshield retention and several
tests to determine whether tough standards for larger buses should
be extended to those built to carry between 10 and 24 children.
   The board said that although school buses remain one of the
safest of all forms of transportation, some smaller buses have been
modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash,
particularly to children sitting in the front row.
   ``In some cases, passenger lapbelts and other restraints had
been installed ... in a manner inconsistent with federal standards
for seatbelts, diminishing crash protection and increasing the
potential to induce injury,'' the board said in its findings.
   ``In multi-vehicle crashes and other crash scenarios, small
school buses lack the built-in crash advantage of superior size and
weight provided by large school buses,'' the board concluded.
   But it said investigation of 24 accidents involving the smaller
buses showed that they ``generally provided good crash protection
to both restrained and unrestrained passengers.''
   Safety belts are customarily provided for passengers in small
buses, but the NTSB staff said not all students are using them, and
lap-only belts in the front seat may add to the danger of injury in
some crashes.
   The board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger
buses, preferring that seats be designed so they, in effect, form
padded compartments around youthful riders.
   The board rejected earlier staff recommendations for full-scale
crash tests on small school buses. Some officials argued that the
low level of injuries and relatively small number of deaths _ about
two a year _ in small bus crashes does not require such a complex
study.
   The tests proposed would be conducted by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and include computer simulation and
crash sleds.
   The sled tests involve seats, barriers and dummies attached to a
sled that approximates conditions in a crash.
   Board spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said the tests could not
duplicate conditions in an entire bus but would show the effects on
children in the front seat and test the effectiveness of various
seatbelt and barrier designs.
   The board also voted to call for testing to determine the need
for stronger roofs and joints. It said roofs in the smaller buses
are less able to withstand rollover forces and body joints are
exempt from federal joint strength standards that pply to larger
buses.
   The board in August sent back the staff study for revisions
after failing to resolve questions over testing of front-seat
barriers and seatbelt use in the buses.

<HEAD>NYNEX Phone Company And Striking Unions Agree To Mediation</HEAD>

   NYNEX Corp. and union officials agreed Thursday to
have mediators intervene in a 10-week-old strike involving 60,000
telephone workers.
   ``We're looking optimistically on this since we've been asking
for months and months to have (a mediator),'' said Adele Stacy, a
spokeswoman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   She said unions first requested an independent mediator Aug. 3
but telephone company officials had resisted the idea until
reversing their stance Thursday.
   ``All parties acknowledge that it is in the best interest of
employees and customers to bring the strike to a conclusion as
quickly as possible,'' the company and unions said in a joint
statment.
   Officials for both sides said further details regarding
scheduled meetings and progress in the mediation process would be
jointly announced. It was not immediately clear whether discussions
would be conducted on a state or federal level, officials said.
   Negotiators had arrived at a standoff Wednesday after talks
abruptly broke off under conditions each side blamed on the other.
   IBEW spokesman Robert Silva said union officials were developing
a counterproposal to the latest offer by New England Telephone Co.,
a NYNEX subsidiary, when they were told the company would not
consider an alternative.
   But Peter Cronin, a spokesman for New England Telephone, offered
a different version. He said union officials had been
``unresponsive to the needs of its striking members'' and failed to
show up for talks Wednesday on the ``improved'' proposal offered by
the company.
   That proposal was laid on the table Tuesday in the first
bargaining session held this month.
   Workers walked off the job Aug. 6 after contract discussions
broke down over salary and health care issues. The Communications
Workers of America, which represents 40,000 workers at NYNEX's New
York Telephone subsidiary, and the IBEW, whose 20,000 workers are
at New England Telephone, struck over NYNEX's insistence that the
workers pay up to $1,500 a year in health care costs.
   Negotiations have progressed slowly or not at all since
employees walked off the job, leaving customers throughout New
England and New York with delays in directory assistance, repairs
and installation.
   Strikes that broke out in several other regional telephone
companies were settled in relatively quick order. The regional
companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph.

<HEAD>Bush Nominee Admits Mishandling Drug Use Probe at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee to head the
government's nuclear weapons program acknowledged Thursday he had
mishandled an allegation of illegal drug use at a New York atomic
power plant during his tenure as a nuclear regulator.
   Victor Stello defended his record as chief of staff at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and denied allegations that he was
more interested in carrying out personal vendettas than ensuring
safety at nuclear plants.
   ``I am convinced that I acted in the best interest of safety and
responsible management,'' he told the House Interior subcommittee
on oversight and investigations.
   Under intense questioning by Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., the
panel chairman, Stello said he now believed he had waited too long
to act on an August 1988 allegation by a former worker at the Nine
Mile Point nuclear station near Oswego, N.Y., of illegal drug use
there.
   Stello admitted he did not order an investigation of the charge,
which eventually was dismissed, until late March 1989, despite the
serious safety issues it raised.
   ``We should have pursued that earlier,'' Stello said, adding
that he kept the allegation secret because he feared the disclosure
would compromise an internal NRC investigation based on other
allegations from the same informant, Douglas Ellison.
   Some of those other allegations were targeted at Roger Fortuna,
a former NRC criminal investigator, whom Ellison accused of failing
to fully investigate his earlier allegations of criminal violations
at Nine Mile Point.
   Kostmayer claimed Stello's goal in the internal investigation
was to press the allegations against Fortuna as a way of
discrediting him and curbing the independence of Fortuna's Office
of Investigations. At the same time, Kostmayer said, Stello was
hindering the separate probe of safety conditions at the plant.
   ``You are so wrong,'' Stello said. ``I stand by what I did and
accept full responsibility for it.''
   Stello acknowledged, however, that he should have acted on the
drug charge more quickly because one of the two reactors at Nine
Mile Point was operating at the time. The allegation was of drug
use at the idled reactor, but Stello acknowledged that many
employees at the station perform work in both reactor buildings.
   Stello said he was willing to accept Kostmayer's accusation that
he had acted ``stupidly.''
   Some environmental groups are vigorously campaigning on Capitol
Hill to block Stello's Senate confirmation as assistant energy
secretary for defense programs, whose main responsibility is to
manage the troubled nuclear arms program.
   The Senate has not yet scheduled a committee hearing to consider
Stello's nomination, which was announced by the White House July
24. Stello is now on loan from the NRC to Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins as a special adviser and has been heading up efforts to
restart the Savannah River (S.C.) nuclear reactors, which make a
gas vital to production of nuclear warheads.
   Kostmayer did not mention Stello's nomination to the Energy
Department post during Thursday's hearing, but the ranking
Republican on the panel, Rep. Barbara F. Vucanovich of Nevada, said
later she believed the main purpose of holding the hearing was to
attempt to discredit Stello and block his Senate confirmation.
   Instead of inquiring about whether Stello was carrying out
personal vendettas at the NRC, ``it seems to me it's more of a
vendetta on Mr. Kostmayer's part,'' Mrs. Vucanovich said in an
interview. ``It's certainly against Mr. Stello.''
   Stello said in an interview during a break in his testimony that
he, too, suspected that Kostmayer's committee was mainly interested
in derailing his nomination.
   ``It looks that way,'' he said, noting that committees in both
the House and the Senate have already held extensive hearings on
his role in the allegations involving Nine Mile Point.

   The U.S. Roman Catholic Church should drop its
qualified support for teaching about condoms in public schools as a
way of preventing AIDS, and should urge that youngsters be taught
chastity instead, a committee of bishops said Thursday.
   ``There is no such thing as safe, or safer, sex. That's an
illusion,'' said Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman
of the Ad Hoc Committee on the HIV Statement. HIV is the virus that
causes AIDS.
   The committee's draft statement, which was criticized by an AIDS
activist who said keeping information from children would be
``abandoning them to death,'' revises an earlier document released
by the church's 50-member Administrative Board in December 1987.
   The 1987 document said the church could tolerate public schools'
providing information about condoms as long as sexual abstinence
outside of marriage was presented as the ``only morally correct and
medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   After it was released, it was criticized by some conservative
U.S. bishops who said it would be misinterpreted as condoning sex
outside marriage and artificial birth control. Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, head of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, also chastised the administrative board for not consulting
with the Vatican.
   In spring 1988, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
decided to draw up a new statement.
   The revised statement _ ``Called to Compassion: A Response to
the HIV-AIDS Crisis'' _ will be presented to the conference at its
fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in Baltimore. The committee drafting the
statement was made up of Mahony, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin of
Chicago, Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston, Archbishop William H.
Keeler of Baltimore and Bishop Raymod W. Lessard of Savannah, Ga.
   The wide-ranging statement also opposes universal mandatory AIDS
testing, calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and
denounces violence and discrimination against AIDS victims as
immoral.
   ``We are called to be a people of compassion, after the
teachings of Jesus,'' Mahony said.
   Where the new statement differs from the earlier document,
titled ``The Many Faces of AIDS: A Gospel Response,'' is mainly in
its stand on condom education in public schools, and in a larger
sense the role of Catholic bishops in public policy debates.
   The first document approached condom education as the lesser of
two evils in reducing the risk of AIDS in students who are unlikely
to remain chaste. It said the bishops did not approve of condom use
but were willing to join with others in a society of diverse
religious beliefs in a dialogue on how sexuality ``might be
communicated in our public schools and elsewhere.''
   Bishop William A. Hughes of Covington, Ky., chairman of the task
force that drew up the original statement, said at the time:
``We're offering to work with members of other faiths and people of
good will on moral values that we can make part of the presentation
(on AIDS).''
   Hughes was not available Thursday afternoon to respond to the
new report, his office said.
   Mahony said many bishops believed that when the church indicated
a willingness to compromise on Catholic teaching to become more
influential in public policy, it was ``terribly confusing'' to
Catholics.
   ``That's never been our role,'' Mahony said. ``Even to start
down that road is fraught with difficulties.''
   Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, criticized the proposal, saying ``to deny these children
this information is abandoning them to death. I don't see anything
moral about that. If the church intends to save its kids, they're
going about it entirely the wrong way.''
   Richard McCormick, a professor of Christian ethics at Notre Dame
University, said the new document ``may well be an attempt to
achieve some kind of political peace within the (bishops')
conference.''
   McCormick said telling students who refuse to be sexually
inactive to use condoms to try to save lives is not an invitation
to immoral behavior, any more than telling students not to drive
drunk is an invitation to insobriety.
   But the bishops' revised document said condom education is a
``quick-fix'' solution to the AIDS crisis.
   ``The `safe-sex' approach to preventing HIV-AIDS, though
frequently advocated, compromises human sexuality and can lead to
promiscuous sexual behavior,'' the bishops said. ``Not only is the
use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the spread of HIV
technically unreliable; promoting this approach means, in effect,
promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable.''
   On similar grounds, the bishops said it was wrong to supply
clean needles to drug addicts to prevent them from acquiring AIDS
by sharing contaminated needles. The committee said that approach
could encourage more drug abuse and discourage abusers from seeking
treatment.
   But the bishops rejected the idea that AIDS is a direct
punishment from God.
   ``Recall that unborn children can be infected in the womb and
that people can acquire HIV from transfusions with contaminated
blood. To suppose that HIV is God's punishment implies that God is
vindictive and capricious,'' the bishops said.
   Within the church, the bishops called on dioceses to develop
pastoral programs to care for people with AIDS and to be an
advocate for ensuring their civil liberties, ``while also
promulgating its own non-discrimination policies in employment,
housing, delivery of medical and dental care, access to public
accomodations, schools, nursing homes and emergency services.''

   Zimbabwe's chief delegate to a
world conclave concerned with protecting Africa's elephant
population said Thursday, ``If they trample on your fields and on
your crops, you don't feel sentimental about them.''
   The 103-nation meeting of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species, or CITES, was deeply divided over how to
tighten control of ivory sales worldwide.
   Statements from supporters and foes of a total ban suggested
both sides were standing firm despite strong behind-the-scenes
efforts to reach a compromise solution.
   Conference sources said a decision was not likely to come before
the windup phase of the meeting, which ends Oct. 20.
   The conference is to act on proposals concerning more than 200
species but discussions focused on the proposal by seven states,
including the United States, Kenya and Tanzania, amounting to a
worldwide ban of trade in ivory.
   It formally calls for CITES to transfer the elephant from
Appendix II of the convention, where limited trade of products is
allowed, to Appendix I, which would prohibit all commerce in ivory
tusks, skin or elephant meat.
   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana are opposed. They argue they
have maintained their elephant populations by careful management
and that sales of elephant products finance conservation efforts.
   Victoria Chitepo, Zimbabwe's chief delegate, told a news
conference Thursday that any worldwide ban would ``guarantee the
extinction of the elephant'' because there would be no more
economic interest in protecting them.
   She gave her country's elephant population as 52,000.
   Estimates of the global herd vary from 700,000 to 400,000,
compared with a reported 1.3 million a decade ago, but Zimbabwe
says its numbers are on the rise.
   U.S. chief delegate Constance Harriman reaffirmed she will press
for a sweeping prohibition. She criticized a proposal by CITES
Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe of Canada that the three southern
African nations be allowed limited trade under Appendix II, termed
``split listing.''
   ``I think he has exceeded his authority and showed poor
judgment,'' she said of Lapointe.
   Private comments by several delegates indicated growing support
for a similar compromise formula advanced by Martin Holdgate,
British director general of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature.
   Holdgate also favors split listing. In addition, he proposed
that southern African countries benefiting from it commit
themselves to a new tight control mechanism and accept a voluntary
moratorium on the sale of ivory until that system is in place and
promises to be effective.
   ``We have not fully discussed it yet but I think it is a
reasonable approach,'' said delegate Pieter Mulder of South Africa,
which estimates its elephant population at 9,300. Delegates from
smaller African nations also voiced sympathy for Holdgate's
proposal.
   Delegates clamoring for a total ban said they were confident
they would get the two-thirds vote required to have the elephants
listed under Appendix I.
   Some African countries with large elephant populations have kept
a low profile so far, including Zaire, with almost half of the
estimated African total.
   Disclosure that CITES activities are partially financed by ivory
traders have not created much of a stir at the Lausanne meeting.
   The issue has not been formally raised in the plenary meetings
of about 800 delegates.

<TEXT>
   The prosecution in the lengthy McMartin
Pre-School molestation trial began his closing argument Thursday,
telling jurors the school's young students were snared in a web of
gradually escalating abuse.
   The chief defendant, Raymond Buckey, 31, appeared calm and
relaxed when Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson began his
summation of the case, which at 2{ years is the nation's longest
criminal trial.
   Buckey said in the courthouse hallway he felt ``OK'' and added:
``I'm relieved. It's now down to just weeks, and we're finally
getting to a jury.''
   Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged
with a total of 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of
conspiracy involving 11 children at the family-owned Manhattan
Beach preschool.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who has worried aloud
about completing the trial because no alternate jurors are left,
said each side would have 6{ days for arguments and he expects a
lengthy deliberation.
   Gunson sought to explain how crimes were committed by people who
have been portrayed in court as not being like molesters, and how
they went unreported.
   ``Although parents would expect their child to tell them if they
were abused, they don't,'' Gunson said.
   Referring to expert testimony, Gunson said this was because it
was not a case of a stranger molesting and injuring a child, but
rather a gradual entrapment and web of secrecy growing up around
the defendants' actions.
   The web tightened by means of gifts and games, and benefited
from children's fears of being blamed and not being believed,
according to the theory.
   Expert testimony also showed that molesters often feel genuine
affection toward children who return that affection, the prosecutor
said.
   ``We have Mr. Buckey saying he loved children,'' he said.
   Gunson told jurors they should not assume that some stories
changed because children had talked with prosecutors and therapists
from Children's Institute International, a child-abuse detection
and treatment center.
   The defense has argued that the children were, in effect,
brainwashed.
   Gunson launched into a detailed summary of events, focusing
first on a girl who testified she was molested and made to play a
``naked movie star'' game.
   The girl was 2 years, 8 months old when she entered the school
in September 1977 and was 5{ years old when she left in 1980. She
was 9 years old when she first talked to therapists at Children's
Institute International and was 12 by the time she testified at the
trial.
   More than 1,000 pieces of evidence have been entered, $15
million has been spent, 124 witnesses have testified and every one
of the six alternate jurors has been used because of illness and
employment problems. Court proceedings have produced 60,000 pages
of record.
   The case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation
prosecution ever. Authorities said hundreds of children were
molested over five years. Seven teachers were arrested and charged
with 207 counts.
   Prosecutors said children were molested during rituals with
satanic overtones, then terrified into silence by teachers who
mutilated animals and threatened to harm the pupils' parents.
   After an 18-month preliminary hearing, District Attorney Ira
Reiner dismissed charges against five defendants, saying there was
too little evidence to try them. The hearing alone cost the
government $6 million.
   The trial became the longest criminal trial in U.S. history in
April, surpassing the two-year record of California's Hillside
Strangler case.

<HEAD>Democrats Urge Bush Not to Veto Abortion Legislation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders in Congress pressed
President Bush on Thursday not to veto legislation that would end a
ban on federally financed abortions for the ``most vulnerable
American women'' _ the poor who are victims of rape or incest.
   They acknowledged that supporters of the relaxed Medicaid
abortion limits do not have enough votes to override Bush's
threatened veto but urged him to reconsider.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he had not heard from
Bush on the possible abortion veto, but told reporters, ``I've
never known him to go back on his word.''
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, in a joint
statement with House Speaker Thomas Foley, said, ``The president's
position is wrong. It is harsh _ terribly harsh _ on the poorest,
most vulnerable American women.''
   ``Not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the
House of Representatives, Democrat and Republican, and the United
States Senate, but the American people as well,'' said Foley,
D-Wash.
   ``The president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor
women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances,'' he said.
   Bush threatened in August to veto the bill. ``Our signal's out
there and he believes in it strongly, but will review the bill when
it gets here,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday.
   In an outcome that surprised even the victors, the House voted
216-206 on Wednesday to reverse a decade of restrictions on
Medicaid abortions. The vote was in favor of permitting federal
money to be used to terminate pregnancies for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest and who report it promptly to authorities.
   The provision would extend current law permitting Medicaid
abortions only in cases where a woman's life was endangered by
pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion.
   It is part of a $156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health
and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been
approved by the Senate but remains subject to final agreement on
unrelated issues.
   Although many abortion-rights lawmakers said they expected a
veto, Bush has been been dogged by controversy on the abortion
issue for a decade, and some anti-abortion groups have questioned
his commitment.
   As recently as Tuesday, the White House's Office of Management
and Budget said in a policy statement sent to Congress that it
would recommend the president reject legislation permitting those
relaxed regulations on Medicaid abortion.
   But Bush had supported the broader language as a presidential
candidate in 1980, and although he altered them as vice president,
he has made seemingly conflicting statements on the issue. In an
appearance Oct. 7, 1987, at an Iowa high school, while campaigning
for president, Bush told a student who questioned him that while he
opposes abortion, ``I would make the exception ... rape, incest,
and the life of the mother.''
   The new provision is narrowly drawn, permitting abortion when
the victims report the rape or incest ``promptly,'' and officials
said the change might affect only a small number of cases.
   But it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for supporters of
abortion rights and came as pro-choice forces were benefiting from
an apparently changed political climate on abortion since the
Supreme Court's ruling in July. That ruling opened the way for
increased state regulation of abortions and, according to
pro-choice forces, politically energized those who oppose limits on
the right to an abortion.
   Michel suggested there might be room for a compromise if both
sides could agree to a provision permitting Medicaid abortions when
the rape or incest victim reported that act within 48 hours of its
occurance.
   The House vote came on the same day abortion rights groups
enjoyed another symbolic victory, this time in Florida. The state
legislature, in a special session called by Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, rejected all the governor's proposed abortion
restrictions.
   ``Certainly Florida and the vote yesterday in Congress are
reflective of a new political movement,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
``The climate is changing.''
   The league, the political arm of the pro-choice movement,
announced its plans for a nationwide effort to oppose anti-abortion
political candidates around the country in 1990, in races ranging
from the Senate to the statehouses.
   The group also unveiled television and newspaper advertising it
is running in Virginia aimed at defeating the anti-abortion
Republican, Marshall Coleman, and electing the Democratic nominee,
Douglas Wilder, who supports continuing legal abortions.

   The nation's orange harvest for the 1989-90
crop season is forecast at 194.4 million boxes, down 6 percent from
last season, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   ``This decline is due mostly to Florida's 11 percent decrease

Florida during late February killed most of the open bloom and
damaged new growth.''
   In its first forecast for 1989-90, USDA estimated Florida's

season.
   California production was forecast at 61 million boxes, up from

million boxes, up from 1.85 million.

   Most people realize the chances of getting AIDS
from an infected doctor are remote, but nearly 45 percent believe
physicians with the disease should not be allowed to practice
medicine, according to a survey.
   More than half _ 55.7 percent _ said if they learned their
doctor had AIDS, they'd change doctors, according to survey results
published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   There have been no documented cases in the United States of a
patient contracting AIDS from his physician, a spokesman for the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said Thursday.
   The AMA said the survey results indicate Americans need to be
better educated about AIDS, and it cautioned that doctors must be
afforded the same civil liberties as other citizens.
   ``Education alone is not enough,'' said AMA board member Dr.
Nancy Dickey. ``While education is necessary, we must reaffirm the
rights of physicians.''
   The survey of 2,000 people was conducted by telephone during the
summer of 1988. Half of the respondents, who were selected at
random, lived in areas with a high number of AIDS cases while the
other half were chosen from all areas of the United States. The
authors said there was no significant difference in the two groups'
responses.
   Two-thirds of those polled said they believe the chance of
contracting AIDS from an infected doctor is unlikely or
non-existent, while 11 percent said they consider the chance of
infection very likely and 22 percent considered it somewhat likely.
   Eighty percent of the respondents said a physician with AIDS
should be obligated to tell his patients and 32 percent felt they
should be told if their doctors were even treating patients with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``There is a generalized fear of AIDS that's not just related to
concern about getting infected,'' said Bryan Maguire, co-author of
the article.
   ``I think it shows that AIDS education is not the solution to
the whole problem,'' said Maguire, a research associate at the
University of California, San Francisco's Dentistry School.
   ``That's why we need anti-discrimination legislation. Just
having the knowledge isn't enough to counteract'' fears, Maguire
said.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dickey said physicians
have the right to confidentiality in matters that are not pertinent
to their practice.
   ``There is no ethical obligation'' for a doctor to tell his
patients he has AIDS, the editorial said.
   ``It is imperative that physicians be extended at least the
simplest of civil liberties that are extended to all other citizens
_ the right to privacy and the right to work so long as others are
not at risk.''
   The editorial reiterated the AMA's ethical position that
physicians who run even a minimal risk of infecting their patients
must refrain from practicing. Doctors who carry the AIDS virus must
consult with their own physicians to establish any limits necessary
to ensure the disease is not passed on, the editorial said.
   The CDC, however, recommends that AIDS-infected surgeons with
open lesions who run the risk of direct contact with patients
refrain from work, said CDC spokesman Charles Fallis.
   ``That's the only case in which the CDC recommends that any
health-care worker refrain from practice.''
   AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease, leaving a
person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers. The
fatal, incurable disease is caused by a virus that is spread mainly
through sexual intercourse, sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during
birth.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported on
Wednesday that Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., was among a group of House
members who voted in favor of looser restrictions for federally
funded abortions for poor women after voting against a similar
provision a year ago.
   The error resulted from a mistake in the Congressional Record
listing of votes from Sept. 8, 1988.
   Ms. Martin was listed on a roll call vote from Sept. 8, 1988 as
being ``paired'' against a proposal to expand Medicaid abortion
coverage to women who are victims of rape or incest.
   But in the Congressional Record of Sept. 13, 1988, Martin said
her vote of four days earlier had been paired incorrectly, and she
should have been recorded as favoring the broader coverage.
   A paired vote means a member was not in the chamber, but was
matched with another lawmaker who voted the opposite and both were
recorded as voting accordingly.

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp ran into opposition Thursday from members of Congress to some
of the measures he is recommending for cleaning up his
scandal-ridden department.
   Both Republicans and Democrats on the House Banking Committee
sharply criticized Kemp's proposal to target more of the
politically popular Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program to strict antipoverty efforts.
   ``That was not the original intent of that program _ a targeted
war on poverty,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking
Republican on the banking panel, which has oversight
responsibilities for HUD.
   ``To stifle the certain degree of flexibility that CDBG has with
its intentions would be absolutely outrageous to me,'' echoed Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland. ``I don't want to see
some guidelines changed to inhibit my city's opportunity to use
that money.''
   Under current regulations, only 60 percent of the $3 billion
that HUD funnels annually to state and local governments through
CDBG grants for downtown revitalization projects must directly
benefit poor people.
   As part of a 58-point plan to address widescale fraud,
mismanagement and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan
administration, Kemp last week proposed raising poverty-related
targets for CDBG grants and housing subsidy programs to 75 percent.
   ``To avoid both the appearance and reality of favoritism,'' Kemp
also proposed eliminating as political ``slush funds'' the
discretionary programs that allow HUD to ignore merit and
competition requirements in awarding community development and
housing grants.
   ``I want to kick politics out of those decisions,'' he said
Thursday. ``There would be no decision at HUD by Kemp, staff,
assistants or anyone based on who you know, what political party
you belong to, how many consultants you hire or how much you pay
them.''
   While generally praising the thrust of Kemp's proposed reform
measures, members of Congress as well as several mayors have
fidgeted the last week over the prospect of removing politics
entirely from the process.
   ``Since the loss of revenue sharing, many mayors have used this
as revenue sharing,'' Wylie told Kemp. ``The implication that if a
congressman calls about a project in his district there's something
wrong is most unfortunate.''
   Citing a litany of well-publicized past abuses, Kemp said the
discretionary funds and community development grants had often gone
toward financing golf courses, swimming pools, high-rise hotels and
scores of other projects with little or no benefit to the poor.
   ``If I don't have criteria, you're going to haul me before this
committee and have my head for doing things that are not figthing
poverty, building houses, taking care of the poor ...,'' Kemp said.
   However, Ms. Oakar and other members of the panel expressed
fears that past abuses will be cited as a reason to allow an
erosion in many of the programs.
   ``I'm not responsible because somebody in New York got a
swimming pool,'' she said. ``My city operates that program well. I
get the impression what we're going to do now is have this fortress
built up as an overreaction and as a substitute for programing.''
   Just two weeks ago, HUD rejected Cleveland's application for a
$6.9 million Urban Development Action Grant for a $48 million rock
'n' roll museum. Ms. Oakar said then she still hoped to get the
federal aid through one of the so-called ``discretionary'' accounts
that Kemp wants abolished.
   At Thursday's hearing, she repeatedly voice irritation.
   ``If I want housing for downtown Cleveland and I have some
phoney baloney regulations put up as a smokescreen so that our area
does not get housing, you better believe I'm going to fight you on
that,'' she told Kemp.
   ``Good, I'm a fighter,'' Kemp retorted. ``I want to be a
successful HUD secretary. ...But I have to call them as I see them,
and we don't think a UDAG grant for a rock 'n' roll museum was
necessary. It did not fit the criteria.''

<TEXT>
   Physicists trying to mimic the birth of the
universe inside an atom smasher said Thursday they found strong
evidence that the building blocks of matter belong to only three
families, a discovery that ``puts a lid on the complexity of
nature.''
   ``This brings us closer to really understanding the physical
universe and how it's put together,'' said Burton Richter, a 1976
Nobel laureate in physics and director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Experiments on the 3-mile-long, $125 million Stanford Linear
Collider showed the odds are 25-to-1 that there are only three
families or ``generations'' of fundamental particles that make up
matter, physicist Michael Riordan said by telephone from Stanford.
   ``It means that somehow the universe is comprehensible, that
it's not a total mystery, that it can be grasped by the human
mind,'' Riordan said. ``It puts a lid on the complexity of nature
at its most fundamental level.''
   Until now, atom smasher experiments indicated only that there
were no more than five or six families of fundamental particles
such as electrons and quarks, Richter said.
   The universe contains more matter than antimatter. If there were
fewer than three families of basic particles, the universe would
contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter, said David Schramm,
a University of Chicago astrophysicist.
   Because matter and antimatter destroy or ``annihilate'' each
other, existence of fewer than three families means ``we wouldn't
be here,'' he said. ``The whole universe would be filled with
radiation and very little else.''
   On the other hand, if the building blocks of matter belonged to
more than three families, the universe would contain more helium
gas than it does, Schramm said.
   Everyday matter is made of four particles belonging to the first
family. They are up quarks, down quarks, electrons and electron
neutrinos. Electrons and electron neutrinos are both classified as
``leptons.''
   Protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are made of the
two types of quarks. Electrons orbit the nucleus. Electron
neutrinos are produced by exploding stars.
   The second family of particles can be found today only in atom
smashers and cosmic rays from space. The particles are the strange
and charmed quarks, and two leptons named muons and muon neutrinos.
   Particles in the third family _ first discovered in the
mid-1970s _ are the bottom quark, the yet-undetected top quark, the
tau lepton and the tau neutrino.
   They can be created today only in atom smashers but, like the
other families of particles, existed naturally in the first few
seconds after the ``big bang'' that scientists believe created the
universe roughly 15 billion years ago.
   If there were more than three families of particles, experiments
in Stanford's particle smasher should have produced evidence of
more than the three known types of neutrinos and possibly evidence
for other quarks and leptons, but no such evidence was found,
Riordan said.
   The machine, shaped like a giant tennis racket, includes a
2-mile-long linear accelerator that speeds up electrons _ the
particles that create television pictures _ and their antimatter
counterparts, called positrons.
   In the 1-mile-long part of the machine that looks like the head
of the tennis racket, the particles are smashed together,
annihilating each other in a way that comes close to re-creating
the incredible temperatures and pressures that existed during the
big bang.
   The collisions produce Z particles, which are so heavy they
existed naturally only for moments after the big bang. The Zs
produced in Stanford's machine then decay into lighter particles
such as quarks and leptons, which are studied with an 1,800-ton
detection device.
   The atom smasher has produced nearly 500 Z particles since it
made its first one last April, without yielding signs that more
than three families exist.
   Cosmologists _ scientists who study the universe _ predicted in
1977 there should be only three or four families of fundamental
particles.
   That was based on the amount of helium gas produced by the big
bang and observed in the universe, which contains about 74 percent
hydrogen, 24 percent helium and only 2 percent other elements,
Schramm said.
   ``The big bang in some sense was a big hydrogen bomb turning
hydrogen to helium, and the amount of helium made in that big bang
depends on the number of families,'' Schramm said.
   He said he was very pleased with Stanford's findings because
``it's the first time an accelerator experiment has confirmed a
theoretical prediction made from cosmology.''

<HEAD>At Least 18 People Killed in Fighting Between Extremists, Soldiers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals and troops fought
in southern Sri Lanka and at least 18 people were killed, the
government said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, President Ranasinghe Premadasa convened a conference
of Sri Lanka's political parties in the hopes of finding a
negotiated means to end the ethnic violence that has wracked this
island nation for six years.
   The killings were reported over the past 24 hours, during which
the radicals burned at least 39 government buildings, the
government said in a statement.
   It said the victims included nine civilians, two policemen and a
soldier in the Sinhalese-dominated south. Six unidentified burned
bodies also were found in the region, said the statement, which
gave no further details.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters that more
Indian peacekeeping troops will leave Ampara district on Monday.
Ampara is about 125 miles east of Colombo. India has withdrawn
about 3,300 soldiers this year and promised to pull out the
remaining 39,000 troops by Dec. 31.
   ``Details of the exact numbers leaving cannot be revealed. ...
But the whole withdrawal process ... will keep to the Dec. 31
deadline,'' Wijeratne said.
   The government has worked out a plan to replace the withdrawing
Indian soldiers with Sri Lankan troops, said Wijeratne, also the
deputy defense minister.
   Sri Lankan soldiers have been confined to barracks in the
northeast under terms of a 1987 accord that allowed Indian troops
to police the region.
   The accord aimed to end the ethnic Tamil insurgency for a
separate homeland by giving them limited autonomy. It also allowed
Indian soldiers to be deployed in the northeast to supervise an
arms surrender by Tamil guerrillas and to maintain law.
   The accord sparked a violent backlash by Sinhalese in the south
that was led by the People's Liberation Front, an anti-government
Sinhalese guerrilla group.
   The government says more than 5,000 people have been killed in
two years of fighting between the People's Liberation Front and
government forces.
   The front said the 1987 peace plan gave too many concessions to
the minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. It also said the presence of Indian troops
compromised the country's independence.
   Asked about the continued violence in the south, Wijeratne said
the ``backbone of the (front) has not been broken yet, but we will
begin operations against them in a day or two.''
   In yet another attempt to end the fighting, Premadasa hosted an
inter-party conference Thursday that was attended by 90 delegates
from 22 political parties. Premadasa said he would accept until the
end of the month suggestions on how to end the violence.
   The People's Liberation Front had not accepted an invitation to
participate in the conference, but delegates, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Premadasa's latest offer was aimed at them.
   Tamil militias, including the largest Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, are attending the conference.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died in the 6-year-old Tamil separatist war, which grew out of
complaints of discrimination in jobs and education by the majority
Sinhalese.
   Sinhalese who are mostly Buddhists make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military. Tamils are
mostly Hindus.

   A masterpiece from Pablo Picasso's ``blue period''
long thought to have disappeared is expected to become the world's
most expensive painting when sold at auction on Nov. 30, an
auctioneer said Thursday.
   ``Les Noces de Pierrette'' (``Pierrette's Wedding''), executed
in 1904-05 in Montmartre, is expected to bring $46 million to $61
million, said auctioneer Jean-Claude Binoche.
   ``It's going to shatter the world record not only for Picassos,
but for all paintings,'' Binoche said.
   The record paid at an auction for a Picasso was $48.7 million
for a 1901 self-portrait titled ``Yo Picasso,'' sold on May 9.
Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' became the most expensive painting in
the world when it sold two years ago for $53.9 million.
   Binoche said he was hopeful Culture Minister Jack Lang would
allow ``Les Noces'' to leave France. The painting is considered
part of France's national heritage and must receive an official
authorization to leave the country.
   With its hauntingly beautiful pink and blue tones, the work
straddles Picasso's best-loved early periods. Six figures _ their
pale pink faces illuminated by an eerie light _ sit around a table
with the newlyweds. The bride wears a Spanish-style mantilla. Her
husband sports a top hat.
   Though experts are familiar with dozens of sketches Picasso drew
for ``Les Noces,'' the final work dropped from sight years ago.
Many thought it was lost in a fire.
   It surfaced in 1988 as part of a Picasso show in Stockholm.
Binoche said the work was long the property of a Swedish family
that does not want to be identified.
   ``The family considered the painting to be a private treasure,
and now it's for sale, that's all,'' he said.
   The sale has been hailed as the major event of the auction
season.
   Sotheby's in New York has said the family of Joan Whitney
Payson, the sellers of van Gogh's ``Irises,'' hope to fetch a
similar price on Nov. 15 for an early Picasso self-portrait titled
``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a tavern frequented by the artist.

<HEAD>Tank Sale Will Not Damage Israel's Security, Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pending $3 billion sale of tanks and other
equipment to Saudi Arabia will have little effect on Israel's
security because the Saudis have indicated the weapons will be
deployed far from Israel's borders, an administration official said
Thursday.
   The Saudis have told U.S. officials that the threats to their
security come mostly from the country's neighbors to the northeast
_ Iran and Iraq _ and from South Yemen, along Saudi Arabia's
southern border.
   The main items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the price
tag reflects the cost of equipment and ammunition, including huge
trucks to transport any tanks that break down. The deal is roughly
equivalent to one year's U.S. assistance to Israel.
   The Bush administration on Wednesday informally notified
Congress of the intended sale, setting in motion a 50-day period in
which Congress either kills the deal by majority votes in the
Senate and House or lets it go through. Deliveries will begin in
about 1993.
   Israel has registered disapproval of the proposed sale of the
M1A2 tank as a matter of principal but thus far has not raised
serious objections, the official said. The sale also faces little
apparent opposition from Israel's supporters on Capitol Hill.
   The official, briefing reporters on the condition he not be
identified by name, said he expects some of the tanks will likely
be deployed at a military training school in northwest Saudi Arabia
not far from the Israeli border.
   This should not be a concern to Israel because ``you need only
to look at a topographical map of Saudi Arabia to realize that
tanks have a very difficult time indeed getting from Saudi Arabia
to Israel in combat situations,'' the official said.
   A pamphlet on the tank sale, published by the State and Defense
Departments, said the M1A2 will give the Saudis improved mobility
over severe terrain. The M1A2 would replace French-built tanks
designed 30 years ago.
   The U.S. will benefit from the sale because the M1A2 will
enhance the deterrent value of Saudi forces that guard natural
resources of ``critical strategic importance'' to the United States
and the West, the pamphlet said.
   It added that the tank will provide a $3 billion boost to U.S.
exports, tens of thousands of man-years of employment for American
workers and over $680 million in savings and revenues to the U.S.
Treasury.

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Harvest Higher Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's 1989 grain harvest is
turning out larger than previously forecast, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Production is now estimated at 205 million metric tons, up 5
million tons from the previous forecast. Officials said the upward
revision was due mostly to preliminary yield results published by
Moscow.
   The latest estimate includes 89 million tons of wheat, an
increase of 2 million tons, and 103 million tons of coarse grains
such as corn and sorghum, up 3 million tons. The balance is made up
of pulses, rice, buckwheat and ``miscellaneous'' grains.
   Officials also said the USDA's estimate of Soviet grain imports
have been reduced 2 million tons to 35 million tons for the trading
year that runs through June 30, 1990.
   In a related report, the USDA announced an additional sale to
the Soviet Union of 100,000 tons of U.S. corn for delivery in
1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement.
   Orders announced the last two weeks now total 3.8 million tons
of corn and 325,000 tons of soybean meal. In addition, 143,700 tons
of soybeans that had been sold for delivery earlier were carried
over into the seventh year of the agreement between the two
countries, which began Oct. 1.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Announces Swiss Flight Attendant Abducted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss woman was kidnapped in northern
Lebanon Sunday, two days after the abduction of two Swiss Red Cross
workers, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
   Ministry spokesman Clemens Birrer said the part-time flight
attendant was kidnapped by armed civilians during a visit to the
Mediterranean port of Tripoli.
   The woman's name and age were withheld at the request of her
parents, Birrer said.
   Her disappearance brings to 19 the number of Westerners missing
in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Most are believed captives
of Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.
   Birrer said the woman's parents asked authorities not to
publicize the case, but he confirmed the kidnapping after being
asked to comment on unattributed news reports.
   Switzerland requested help from Syria because Syrian troops
control much of northern Lebanon, he added.
   Last Friday, two Swiss International Red Cross workers, Elio
Erriquez and Emmanual Christen, were abducted in southern Lebanon.
   There have been no demands and no claims of responsibility in
the kidnappings so far, and Birrer said Swiss officials did not
assume the woman's abduction was connected to the most recent
kidnappings.
   Lebanese police said Monday that Erriquez and Christen are being
held by radical Palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal, whose group denied taking part.
   PLO spokesmen last week accused Abu Nidal's group of the
kidnappings, linking them to a Shiite Moslem militant, Mohammed
Hariri, who is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijacking
an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.
   Longest-held of the Western hostages is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Pediatrician Discloses Sex Change, Desire to Change Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEDALIA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A respected pediatrician is causing a stir
with the disclosure of sex change surgery to become a woman 11
years ago, and her desire to change back to a man.
   ``I was born male and I was raised male and I feel like that's
the way I'll feel most contented,'' said Dr. Janis Ashley, one of
Sedalia's two practicing pediatricians.
   Ashley, 38, has refused to talk to reporters after she disclosed
in an interview published Tuesday in The Sedalia Democrat that she
was a man until her 1978 sex change operation _ and wanted to be a
man once again.
   The disclosures surprised Ashley's patients, but many have
rallied around her. Some residents of Sedalia, a town of 21,000
people in central Missouri, are making fun of the physician.
   ``Some people are saying some really crude things, making jokes
behind her back,'' said Asha Lees, whose twin, 10-month-old sons
are Ashley's patients.
   ``I figure she's been through a lot of pain and I hope that
Sedalia won't run her out of town, that they'll let her stay,'' Ms.
Lees said.
   Ashley apologized to the town and said she wanted to continue
her practice in Sedalia.
   ``This topic has the potential to be a flare point. ... I'm
sorry for that and for giving this town or any part of the
community any unwanted notoriety,'' she said.
   Ashley has a 4-year-old adopted son, Michael, and said he might
be confused about her changing sexuality. She is taking male
hormones and said she would not undergo reconstructive surgery
right away.
   ``I tell Michael I am his mommy and I will always be his mommy,
but I'm also his daddy,'' Ashley said. ``I am his mother, his
parent _ whatever you call it _ (but) that emotional attachment
will be the same.''
   Ms. Lees said she sent Ashley flowers, a balloon and a card with
her prayers after learning of the baby doctor's background and
plans. Ms. Lees said she wants Ashley to continue to care for her
twins.
   ``I think she is an excellent doctor,'' Ms. Lees said. ``(A sex
change) doesn't bother me at all. Her thoughts will be the same
whether she's a male or a female.''
   Ellen Cable, who heads the Sedalia PTA, said she also was not
disturbed by Ashley's disclosures.
   ``I've heard nothing but good things about her as a doctor, and
I don't think a sex change is going to make any difference,'' she
said.
   Dr. Robert Stockwood, chief of staff at Sedalia's Bothwell
Regional Health Center, where Ashley occasionally tends patients,
said her sexuality will not affect her status at the hospital as
long as she continues to provide good medical care.
   Ashley said she consulted a child psychologist on how to deal
with questions, and any confusion of her son and young patients as
she changes back to a man.
   ``I'm going to be direct and honest ... and answer their
questions, and emphasize to them that I'm still the same and will
still doctor them the same,'' she said. ``But, gradually, I will
begin to look more like their daddy than their mommy.''
   Ashley was married before deciding at age 25 to become a woman.
The marriage ended in divorce.
   A woman who answered the telephone Thursday at Ashley's office
and refused to give her name said said all calls from the media
were being referred to Ashley's Kansas City lawyer, Pat White.
White was in court Thursday and did not return a reporter's
telephone call.

   The State Department said Thursday that blind
candidates will be allowed to join the U.S. Foreign Service and
serve as diplomats abroad.
   The policy reversal was announced by Ivan Selin, undersecretary
of state for management, at a joint hearing of the House Foreign
Affairs and Civil Service subcommittees after Rep. Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., said the State Department had a history of discriminating
against the blind.
   Selin said State Department officials had reconsidered their
stance since Sikorski, chairman of the Civil Service subcommittee,
first aired complaints about discrimination against the blind at a
February hearing.
   ``We decided you were right all along,'' Selin told Sikorski,
adding that details about the policy change will be released later
this month.
   ``After over a decade of discrimination against blind people, I
am glad the State Department has changed its policy and opened its
door to all qualified people who wish to serve our country
abroad,'' Sikorski said after the hearing.
   Sikorski noted that in testimony in February, witness Avraham
Rabby said he had been denied admission into the Foreign Service
despite the fact that he holds degrees from Oxford and the
University of Chicago, is fluent in French, Spanish and Hebrew, and
had five times passed the service's oral and written examinations.
   ``Mr. Rabby is also blind and was denied access to the Foreign
Service simply because of his blindness,'' Sikorski said.
   The department said last year that the blind could not serve as
diplomats because they can't work independently with original
documents without readers or Braille translations.
   Selin told the hearing that the department is reviewing its
entry procedures, including its written Foreign Service exam, ``to
eliminate any trace of bias which may in fact exist,'' including
bias against minorities and women.

   A high East German official rejected the
democratic reforms some Soviet bloc allies have embraced and said
Thursday that communism will continue to dominate society.
   Another said the government will listen to ``all parts of the
population'' clamoring for change as long as they do not insist on
scrapping the current social order.
   There were signs of strong differences within the leadership
over how to deal with the flight of tens of thousands of citizens
to the West and growing demand at home for a freer society. Reports
persisted that 77-year-old Erich Honecker, the nation's hard-line
leader, was in trouble.
   Bild, a mass-circulation West German newspaper, quoted Communist
Party sources it did not identify as saying Honecker would be
replaced Oct. 18.
   Eduard Lintner, inter-German affairs spokesman for Christian
Democrats in the West German parliament, was quoted in the daily
Passauer Neue Presse as saying Honecker's departure was
``immediately at hand.''
   Communist Party sources in East Germany said an increasing
number of ranking party figures are displeased with how Honecker
handled the exodus of young, skilled workers and recent
pro-democracy protests.
   The official news agency ADN carried a routine dispatch Thursday
that omitted his title as head of the Communist Party, the more
powerful of his two posts. ADN usually refers to him as both
Communist Party leader and head of state.
   Honecker's picture has not appeared on the front pages of party
newspapers for two days. It usually appears daily.
   Der Tagesspiegel, a West Berlin paper, said Thursday ``a strong
majority'' in the ruling 21-member Politburo favored Honecker's
departure.
   After what sources said was a volatile meeting, the Politburo
promised on Wednesday to examine the causes of the flight and the
protests. It said the government would be willing to discuss
reforms.
   Lutheran Church sources in East Berlin said late Thursday that
Leipzig officials were preparing to release all those arrested in
protests there since Sept. 11. The number was not immediately
known, but up to 500 people are believed still to be in jail.
   Whatever the hints of a more liberal attitude, a commentary in
the Berliner Zeitung newspaper Thursday by Central Committee member
Otto Reinhold emphasized ``the leading role of the party'' in
bringing about any change.
   Reinhold said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in
East Germany from the ``ever-increasing variety'' of changes in
other Socialist countries.
   The statement was obviously a reference to East Germany's
previously sharp repudiations of the dramatic democratic reforms
sweeping East bloc allies Hungary and Poland.
   ``Reforms for the sake of reforms aren't in demand, but rather
changes which will serve the further development of socialism,''
Reinhold said.
   Kurt Hager, East German Communist Party ideology chief and
another influential Politburo member, offered a more conciliatory
line.
   He was quoted by West Germany's ZDF television as saying that
there was no ``differences of opinion'' in the party leadership. He
said leaders had agreed it was necessary to open a dialogue ``all
parts of the population.''
   But Hager strongly indicated that he did not include the growing
opposition movement among them.
   ``If they want to question our social order, then that's not a
basis for discussions,'' said Hager.
   Hager's remarks came during a trip to Moscow for the opening of
a culture exhibition. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during
a visit to East Berlin last week, urged Honecker to undertake
reforms.
   Meanwhile, reaction was cautious Thursday to the statement the
day before by the Politburo, which is trying to appease somewhat
the forces of unrest while still presenting a unified front
committed to socialism.
   Manfred Stolpe, a top Lutheran Church official in East Berlin,
welcomed the government's commitment to dialogue as ``an important
step.''
   But Baerbel Bohley, co-founder of the opposition group New
Forum, described the Politburo statement as a ``verbal shift that
does not take into account real life.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
welcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said ``dialogue
should be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve
domestic and international pressure.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf
Seiters, said Kohl was optimistic.
   ``This could be the first positive signal to the populace that
the East German leadership has given,'' Seiters said of the
Politburo statement. ``But we must wait to see what concrete
measures it carries.''

<HEAD>Army Chief of Staff: No Surprise Manpower Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono said
Thursday that he would prefer to have long-term cuts in armed
forces personnel worked out through the arms control process than
have them ``dropped on us right now'' during budget negotiations on
Capitol Hill.
   Vuono, in a meeting with reporters, noted that Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney has already proposed a cut of 8,000 Army personnel in
the 1990 fiscal year.
   Out of the more than 2.1 million people on active military duty,
a cut of 16,800 positions was proposed by Cheney in May.
   Some 8,000 were to come from the Army, 5,600 from the Navy and
3,200 from the Air Force, while the Marine Corps was untouched.
   But in current House-Senate negotiations on the Pentagon budget,
lawmakers have eyed cuts of up to 40,000 individuals to meet
spending limits in the 1990 fiscal year.
   ``I would hope that we can see our way clear in '90 and '91
without taking any major end strength reductions and enable us to
shape that (Army) figure based on the president's proposal right
now on the arms control table. That gives us a better opportunity
to shape it, rather than piecemeal in '90 and piecemeal in '91,''
Vuono said.
   The Army chief of staff said that if an arms control proposal is
signed in 1992 or beyond, ``we'll have to take some additional
number out of the Army. We can plan for that. We are planning for
that.''
   Vuono said he didn't care for the idea of ``a cut dropped on us
right now in addition'' to the cuts currently proposed on Capitol
Hill.

<HEAD>Shamir Appeals For Calm Over Syrian Defection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday
appealed for calm and for trust in the military, despite failure to
detect a Syrian warplane flown by a defector into northern Israel.
   The seven minutes the Syrian air force pilot spent over Israel
before landing the MiG-23 supersonic fighter-bomber caused a public
uproar over possible flaws along one of Israel's most sophisticated
defense lines.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, International Red Cross
official Ulrich Lenhartz said the Geneva-based organization was
trying to arrange the return of pilot and plane at Syria's request.
   Israeli radio stations and most newspapers said the air force
failed to scramble inteceptors before the plane landed near Haifa,
a city of 250,000.
   ``There is a question that people justly ask: how and why it
happened that a plane came in without being detected immediately,''
Shamir told high school students in Raanana. ``There is an
investigation regarding this. ... I think that people of Israel,
with their experience of many years, can certainly trust and give
full confidence to its air force.
   ``Let's not turn an event that should be joyful into a cause for
arguments and worries. It's good for Israel that such an important,
significant, valuable plane ... abandoned Syria and came to us.''
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron appointed a team to
investigate, the army command said in a communique. It will look
into control, anti-aircraft and command operations and report by
Monday.
   Whether the investigators had power to recommend action against
individuals who may have failed in their duties was not clear.
   Israel's eight leading dailies asked on their front pages how
the pilot, Maj. Adel Basem, 34, managed to land without
interference on a crop-dusters' airstrip at Megiddo, 57 miles north
of Jerusalem, and spend 20 minutes on the ground before security
officials arrived.
   Davar newspaper said the plane crossed the Golan Heights at an
altitude of 100 feet at about 780 mph.
   Syria is Israel's implacable foe. Israel annexed the Golan
Heights after capturing them from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Yaakov Abudi, an airfield official who was the first to meet
Basem, quoted the pilot as saying one major reason he defected was
being beaten after asking for better housing.
   A Syrian official in Damascus said the pilot did not defect but
had to make an emergency landing. Israeli officials denied the
plane had technical problems.
   An Israeli army spokesman said a Red Cross request to meet Basem
would be examined but added the Red Cross ``routinely visits
detainees in Israel, and he is not a detainee.''
   Officials refused to say where or under what conditions Basem
was staying.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Reopens Week after Fatal Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nursing home ravaged by a fire last week
that killed 12 residents reopened Thursday after passing state and
local inspections.
   State Health Commissioner Dr. C.M.G. Buttery said the Hillhaven
Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center was authorized to let
residents back on the third and fourth floors.
   The second floor, where the fire started, is being renovated and
was not approved for patient care. The first floor houses services
such as the dining room and therapy rooms.
   Lori Peacock, regional marketing director for Hillhaven Corp.,
said the first resident returned Thursday afternoon.
   ``We've only heard about a half a dozen residents who are not
planning to return,'' she said.
   The city fire marshal said earlier this week that a blown fuse
prevented an alarm from being relayed to authorities when the blaze
broke out shortly after 10 p.m. on Oct. 5.
   The alarm system also releases magnets holding fire doors open.
Had the system functioned properly and closed the doors, smoke
would not have filled part of the second floor, where most of the
deaths occurred, officials said.
   Fire inspectors cited the nursing home for failing to ensure the
alarm system worked, and for failing to notify the fire department
when the alarms were shut down for three days in September to
fumigate the building.
   Assistant City Fire Marshal William D. Beisch said Thursday that
the nursing home had repaired the alarm system and that fire
officials were satisfied that the home complied with the city fire
code. The city building inspector also gave the home permission to
resume operations.
   Authorities said the fire started when a patient who was
smoking, in violation of regulations, accidentally tossed a lighted
match onto a bed. The fire was contained to one room on the second
floor, but smoke poured through the building.
   Nine people were killed in the fire and three other residents
died Monday and Tuesday in hospitals. Those three were among 98
injured in the fire. The home had 161 residents.
   In another development, a resident of the nursing home filed a
$3 million lawsuit against the home's owner Wednesday in Norfolk
Circuit Court.
   Edna D. Carroll, 88, who is in stable condition at a hospital,
alleges that her injuries resulted from negligence and breach of
duty by the nursing home.
   Pete Moore, the Hillhaven Corp.'s director of operations,
declined to comment on the lawsuit.

   President Bush will nominate Robert W. Sweet
Jr., who stirred controversy in the Reagan administration as acting
head of an Education Department branch, as administrator of the
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the White
House announced Thursday.
   Sweet clashed with then-Secretary of Educaton T.H. Bell during
Sweet's tenure as deputy director and acting director of the
National Institute of Education in 1982-83.
   Sweet was aligned with conservatives who wanted the Education
Department abolished, as former President Reagan had promised in
his 1980 campaign. Bell opposed its abolition.
   Sweet, 52, subsequently served as a Reagan White House aide and
deputy executive secretary of the Domestic Policy Council until
this year, when he became an education analyst for the Senate
Republican Policy Committee.
   He would succeed Verne L. Speirs at the juvenile justice post.
   The announcement was made by the traveling White House as Bush
campaigned for Republican candidates Thursday in Mississippi and
New York.

<HEAD>Walesa: Can Solidarity Save Poland Again?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said Thursday that Solidarity
saved Poland from civil war, but he wonders whether the independent
trade union movement can now lead the country out of economic chaos.
   The Solidarity leader predicted the worst of the process of
rescuing the economy, which is beset by inflation, product
shortages and low industrial productivity, could be over in a year,
but he said the government will have to do a better job of
explaining its policies to a restless populace.
   Walesa also said that if the first non-communist government in
the East bloc, led by Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki as
prime minister, fails, ``We will have the moral right to accuse the
world of not helping us.''
   The Bush administration is supporting a $119 million, three-year
package of economic aid and $100 million in food aid to Poland.
Congressional critics are calling for more.
   
   Walesa made the comments at his weekly news conference at
Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk, a forum he has used to make a
series of dramatically worded commentaries on worsening conditions
in Poland.
   ``I claim that it was Solidarity that saved this country from a
civil war. Is it capable of saving it now? That's a question I'm
asking myself,'' he said.
   ``I'd like to emphasize that we avoided civil war and there is a
chance for rescue in the nearest future. If society understands
this maneuver and joins in, it will all take not more than a year.''
   Solidarity, banned after martial law was declared in December
1981, was re-legalized this year after a wave of strikes in August
1988 brought a series of talks and sweeping reforms in April. The
Solidarity-led government came to power in August after free
elections in June.
   The new government proposes a rapid shift to a market-oriented
economy but acknowledges the situation _ inflation is 600 percent
annually _ will likely worsen before it gets better.
   Walesa said the new government is not explaining its changing
policies well enough.
   ``When I don't understand something, it means that at least 60
percent of the society doesn't understand it,'' the union leader
said.
   Walesa also said local government elections, expected to
challenge the last bastion of communist control, should not be held
too soon.
   ``It will only divide the nation, which will concentrate on
electoral struggle and not on the reforms that must unite us,'' he
said.

   A cold front chilled the north-central section of the nation
Thursday, but a broad area had summer-like temperatures. There was
relatively little rain.
   Morning temperatures in the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley were only in the 30s and 40s Thursday, about 10
degrees cooler than the day before. Temperatures dropped into the
freezing range around the northern Rockies.
   Thursday's low in the Lower 48 states was 14 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Strong wind accompanied the cold front, with gusts to 50 mph,
the National Weather Service said.
   But temperatures rose into the 80s from the central Plains to
the Southeast and parts of the Southwest, with some readings in the
90s.
   In Florida and the Southwest, morning lows early Thursday only
went down into the 60s and 70s.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed over the northeastern Gulf
of Mexico during the afternoon, with a few showers over central
Florida.
   Elsewhere, a few showers moved over the Pacific Northwest and
the lower Great Lakes region.
   Dense morning fog was reported in central Georgia, southern
Louisiana and the coastal region of Texas during the morning, as
well as in the Los Angeles basin.

<HEAD>Human Rights Official Estimates 77 Dead After Failed Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian human rights official
said Thursday that 77 people were killed and 200 arrested following
last week's coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Raul Escoffery, executive director of the Panamanian Human
Rights Committee, said the casualty figure was based on sketchy
evidence but challenged the Panamanian Defense Forces to disprove
it.
   ``If it's not true, we will say it publicly,'' Escoffery said.
``But until the government cooperates with us, we presume our
information to be true.''
   Robert Troncoso, the rights committee's vice president, said he
believed the information the committee has is too sketchy to give
any estimates.
   The day after the Oct. 3 coup attempt, the Defense Forces issued
a communique that said 10 rebels were killed and 37 detained in the
uprising.
   Troncoso and Escoffery said the rights group had received dozens
of telephone calls, most of them anonymous, from people who said a
relative, friend or neighbor in the military had not been seen
since the uprising.
   ``We presume there are many more than this,'' Troncoso said. But
he said repeatedly that the evidence was too sketchy to be precise.
   The committee wrote to Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Forces
and therefore leader of the country, three days after the failed
coup asking permission to visit imprisoned mutineers.
   ``We are still awaiting a reply,'' Troncoso said.
   The rights officials and family members contacted by The
Associated Press said they did not know where prisoners were being
held.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela has accused the
Defense Forces of carrying out summary executions.
   Defense Forces spokesmen have denied reports an enraged Noriega
personally shot the coup leader minutes after the uprising was
quashed. That was one question foreign journalists permitted to
interview Noriega were forbidden to ask.

   Reports Thursday from the Soviet Caucasus region
said Armenia's railroad woes were easing but political tension rose
anew in Georgia.
   The Azerbaijani rail blockade that left Armenia critically short
of basic supplies and Georgia hurting for fuel was all over, the
Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform said Thursday.
   ``Freight traffic from Azerbaijan to Armenia has been fully
restored,'' it said, but admitted fewer trains than expected
arrived in the two republics.
   The unrelenting conflict in the Caucasus, a jigsaw puzzle of
nationalities set among the mountains between the Black and the
Caspian seas, is proving one of the Kremlin's most intractable
ethnic problems.
   In the Nagorno-Karabakh region, two men were killed this week in
clashes with authorities, the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
said Thursday.
   In Georgia, activists said a mass meeting in the capital,
Tbilisi, drew thousands Wednesday night to support calls for
Georgian independence and against the Soviet draft.
   ``Fifty people have declared a sit-in near the Sports Palace
against the occupying army,'' Tea Daraselyan, a member of a
Georgian independence group, said Thursday in a telephone interview
from Tbilisi.
   She said the meeting Wednesday asked Georgian youths to refuse
to serve in the Soviet army and asked all Georgians to boycott
upcoming elections.
   Nationalist fervor has run high in Georgia since spring, when 19
Georgians died in a clash between pro-independence protesters and
Soviet troops. Ethnic unrest also turned bloody in the Georgian
enclave of Abkhazia this summer.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been the source of a vicious territorial
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan for 18 months. The ethnic
Armenian majority wants the region taken from Azerbaijan and
annexed to Armenia. Kremlin officials imposed direct rule there
trying to calm tensions.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said S. Akonyan of the region's main city
Stepanakert was killed late Tuesday in a clash between soldiers and
local residents. It said R.E. Sadikov, another resident of the
area, was killed Monday.
   It quoted military officials as saying they arrested Sadikov and
took a rifle from him, but he then attacked a soldier and was
killed trying to escape.
   In both cases, soldiers were injured, said the report.
   Akonyan apparently was killed in a clash reported Wednesday by
Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri M. Arshenevsky. Independent
Armenian reports identified the victim as 38-year-old Spartak
Hacobian.
   Arshenevsky said a crowd attacked a convoy of firefighters with
stones and firearms, and they were forced to defend themselves.
   He reported eight people hurt, two critically.
   Rail shipments through Azerbaijan to Nagorno-Karabakh and
Armenia were cut off late this summer. The blockade also affected
Georgia.
   The Azerbaijan People's Front political movement, which
organized a general strike that included the rail tieup, decided
this week to end the blockade.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said freight began arriving in
Nagorno-Karabakh, but not food or fuel shipments, the two most
needed items.
   In Armenia, the blockade halted much reconstruction work in
areas devastated by December's earthquake, which left 25,000 dead.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday
that he's encouraged by advances in the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
component of Star Wars, but that he would recommend President Bush
veto the Pentagon budget bill unless Congress improves funding for
the program.
   Cheney, locked in negotiations with Congress in an attempt to
stave off cuts in the program's billion-dollar budget, acknowledged
he's got a tough battle ahead.
   ``We've got to convince people that it's necessary,'' Cheney
said of the Strategic Defense Initiative in a speech to the
National Security Industrial Association.
   House and Senate conferees hammering out the Pentagon's budget
for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are at loggerheads over
the program.
   The Senate approved $4.5 billion for Star Wars in its
authorization bill last month, while the House adopted a funding
level of $3.1 billion. President Bush had requested $4.9 billion.
   If the House recommendation prevails, Cheney said he would be
forced to eliminate some technology options, cancel contracts and
scale back research.
   ``Should the Congress produce legislation with inadequate
funding levels for SDI, I will recommend to the president that he
veto the bill,'' he said.
   Cheney, holding up a camera that would be used in the Brilliant
Pebbles program, lauded scientists for developing a ``lighter,
smaller and cheaper'' system he said would save ``enormous sums of
money.''
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' Cheney said. ``We are using mostly
off-the-shelf technology. No scientific breakthroughs have been
necessary to create Brilliant Pebbles. We are basically using what
we have.
   ``We haven't yet settled on a final design ... but the work is
going well, and, most important, we see no major scientific
roadblocks to the program.''
   Brilliant Pebbles refers to the swarm of thousands of small
computerized rockets that would be put in space to locate, track
and smash enemy missiles by bumping into them rather than through
explosive force.
   It is only one possible component of Star Wars, which has gained
greater opposition as budget cuts soak up scarce defense funds.
Some critics contend Star Wars experiments could derail U.S.-Soviet
advances in arms control.
   Cheney spoke positively about other aspects of Star Wars,
including research in laser-beam technology and ground-based
interceptor systems. He repeated assertions that the Soviet Union's
strategic defenses have improved, not weakened, under Mikhail
Gorabachev.

   The Senate began plowing through a $14.1
billion deficit-reduction bill Thursday as Democrats claimed enough
votes to block Republicans from tacking on a cut in the
capital-gains tax.
   Unless Congress completes action before Monday on the
eight-inch-thick bill _ which is almost impossible _ automatic,
across-the-board reductions will be triggered in most federal
spending programs. But Congress has left itself an out: Even if the
automatic cuts take effect, they can be restored as soon as the
bill is enacted.
   The sheer size of the bill and the fact that it was put into
final form barely two hours before debate began were enough to
cause some senators to view the automatic spending cuts as the
lesser of two evils.
   ``If somebody wanted to manufacture a piece of legislation
absolutely confirming the worst suspicions they have about the
budget process, it would be this piece of legislation,'' said Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo. ``It is impossible as a practical matter
for any senator to have more than a general idea of what's in this
bill.''
   He lodged his complaint as the Senate Budget Committee, voting
9-7, approved the bill, which was written by eight other committees.
   Members of both parties expressed concern because the bill is
laden with amendments that have nothing to do with reducing the
deficit.
   During the first four hours of debate on the bill, Republicans
criticized Congress for not being conscientious in cutting the
deficit; Democrats lambasted President Bush for pushing the
capital-gains cut, and the Senate approved its first amendment of
the day _ spending an extra $40 million for hospitals.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Budget Committee,
acknowledged the bill ``does not boldly address a deficit problem
that appears to have drifted from under the spotlight of public
scrutiny.'' But it does restrain the deficit and it meets
guidelines the administration and Congress agreed on last spring,
he said.
   Sasser and Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican
on the Budget Committee, promised an effort on the Senate floor to
strip away some of the extraneous provisions.
   Although the major purpose of the spending bill is to reduce the
deficit in the current budget year to about $110 billion, most of
its bulk is attributable to hundreds of pet projects. These range
from a child-care initiative to repeal of a law designed to prevent
discrimination in employer-paid health care to scores of tax breaks
for various special interests.
   More important to the Bush administration and Republican
senators, the bill does not contain the capital-gains tax cut that
President Bush promised during the campaign last year. The Senate
Finance Committee rejected the cut in favor of a Democratic plan to
liberalize tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Republicans and a handful of Democrats have been considering
trying to add a capital-gains cut to the bill, but there was no
certainty they would make the effort. The reason is that while a
majority of senators favor some kind of capital-gains reduction,
backers apparently cannot muster the 60 votes required under Senate
rules to attach the reduction to the deficit bill.
   ``Without a doubt'' Democrats can block the capital-gains cut,
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters.
   However, a capital-gains cut is likely to end up in the
deficit-reduction bill when negotiators from the Senate and the
House produce the final version of the legislation. That is because
the House bill contains a reduction that was approved by a lopsided
majority of representatives.
   About $5.3 billion of the $14.1 billion worth of deficit
reduction in the bill would come from a package of mostly minor tax
increases. The one with the most impact on the most people would
make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service, due to expire at the end of 1990.
   A freeze in increased Medicare reimbursements for doctors, a
reduction in payments to hospitals and other Medicare changes would
produce an additional $3 billion. Removing the Postal Service _ and
its own deficit _ from the budget would ``save'' $1.77 billion.
Extending the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to
charge a 1 percent fee on guaranteed housing loans would bring in
$169 million.
   The string of special-interest tax breaks in the bill stretches
from owners of tuxedo-rental stores to farmers with annual receipts
under $5 million to small taverns to rich grandparents who give
their grandchildren up to $2 million.

<HEAD>Study Says Deficiencies in Adhering to Code Widespread</HEAD>

   Several countries, health professionals and
manufacturers are violating an international agreement regulating
the marketing of infant formula, according to a church study
released Thursday.
   Sara Shingler, head of the United Methodist Church Infant
Formula Task Force, said that in all 16 countries studied,
``researchers found that the major manufacturers of breast-milk
substitutes _ Nestle, Abbott, American Home Products and
Mead-Johnson _ were deficient in some degree with requirements of
the code.''
   The World Health Organization's Code on the Marketing of Breast
Milk Substitutes was adopted by member countries, major formula
manufacturers and international distributors in 1981.
   A spokesman for Nestle, Greee Chaffee, said officials had not
seen the study and had no comment on it.
   A representative of American Home Products, Carol Emering, said
that ``in developing countries, we comply fully with the WHO
code.'' She said the company has had no more than four complaints
annually since the company adopted the code.
   Cathy Babington, a spokeswoman for Abbott, declined comment,
saying company officials had not received the report. Efforts to
reach Mead-Johnson were unsuccessful.
   The WHO code sets gives national governments primary
responsibility for distribution of nutritional information and
prohibits government or manufacturers' use of pictures of infants
or written materials idealizing or promoting use of infant formula.
The code also stipulates that product labels must include
instructions on proper preparation and use of the formula and must
emphasize the nutritional superiority of breast feeding.
   In addition, retail outlets cannot use distributors' displays,
advertisements or employees. Nor can doctors or health facilities
distribute manufacturers' samples or formula information.
   In practice, Shingler said, ``The study, which involved 2,108
interviews in hospitals, clinics, retail outlets, foreign
government agencies and with individual physicians, revealed
problems of compliance in all the countries studied.''
   The three-year study concludes that:
   _More than half of the mothers interviewed had received no
nutritional information about themselves and their children from
government health agencies.
   _Information provided by both governments and formula makers
didn't let people know the financial implications of using formula
or the difficulty in reversing a decision to bottle feed.
   _Manufacturers, retailers, doctors, health-care facilities and
governments violated prohibitions or restrictions in their
promotion, advertising and marketing procedures.
   _Fewer than a third of the labels on formula cans included an
expiration date.
   However, ``where the governmental agencies responsible for
health care made a firm effort to comply with the code, the
manufacturers improved their level of compliance,'' said Shingler.
   ``The companies will do as much as they are required,'' said
Douglas Johnson, task force researcher at a news conference
Thursday.
   But Johnson said governments defend lax enforcement because
``their argument is that they do not have enough people and that
the government needs money also.''
   The countries included in the study were: Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, Ghana,
Swaziland and South Africa.
   Members of the United Methodist Church's General Board of Church
and Society and independent infant formula experts serve on the
six-member church task force, which has studied infant formula
usage and marketing since 1980.

<HEAD>Poland Demands Soviet Murder Investigation of Katyn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's prosecutor-general asked the
Soviet Union on Thursday for a murder investigation into the 1940
killings of 15,000 Polish army officers at Katyn and other Soviet
sites.
   Prosecutor-General Jozef Zyta also asked Soviet authorities to
clear the names of 16 military and political leaders of Poland's
World War II anti-Nazi resistance convicted as ``bandits'' at a
1945 show trial in Moscow.
   The Soviets were asked to ``carry out an investigation of murder
at Katyn, and other places still unknown, of Polish officers
interned in the fall of 1939 in camps at Kozielsk, Starobielsk and
Ostaszkow,'' said a communique carried by the state PAP news agency.
   The killings, one of the most painful issues in Polish-Soviet
relations, had long been blamed by the Polish and Soviet
governments on Nazi German troops. But most Poles and Western
historians concluded the Polish officers interned in the Soviet
Union were executed on orders of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in
1940 before war broke out between the Soviets and Germany.
   More than 4,200 bodies of Polish officers were found at Katyn,
near Minsk, in 1943. The bodies of an additional 11,000 officers
have never been found.
   Poland and the Soviet Union began rewriting the official account
of the deaths in 1987 when they agreed to form a joint commission
to review ``blank spots'' in history.
   Zyta's communique noted that the Polish historians on the
commission concluded more than a year ago that security officers of
the Soviet NKVD, predecessor of today's KGB, carried out the
killings.
   The Soviet historians never issued a concurring report and
complained of being denied key archival material in the Soviet
Union. Lack of Soviet action raised calls in the Polish press for a
formal legal investiation.
   ``In light of international commitments binding both on Poland
and the Soviet Union, the Katyn crime has the feature of a homicide
and is not subject to expiration,'' Zyta's communique said _
meaning those responsible might still face trial.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Polish Communist First
Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski reportedly discussed an
investigation in talks Wednesday.
   ``Soviet comrades have taken up many problems which are more
difficult and more painful to them than this one,'' Rakowski said
later, according to Polish media reports. ``I am sure they are
going to find an answer to this, our tragedy, too.''

<HEAD>Ireland Says It Won't Try Ex-Priest Britain Wants as IRA Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republic will not prosecute an
Irish former priest accused by Britain of plotting IRA violence, a
government legal officer said Thursday.
   Eamonn Barnes, director of public prosecutions, said material
submitted by Britain to bring Patrick Ryan to trial, as well as
Irish police inquiries, were ``not sufficient to justify a
prosecution.''
   Ryan, 59, still wears clerical garb although the Roman Catholic
leader in England, Cardinal Basil Hume, archbishop of Westminster,
has said he is no longer a priest.
   Britain last year failed to secure Ryan's extradition on charges
of murder and bombing conspiracy and explosives possession on the
British mainland between 1975 and 1988. Irish Attorney General John
Murray said press coverage in the case was prejudicial to a fair
trial.
   Murray indicated Ryan might be tried in Dublin on the explosives
charges but Barnes decided against it.
   In London, Barnes' decision was described as a ``most
disappointing outcome'' in a statement by Allan Green, British
director of public prosecutions.
   Delegates to Britain's governing Conservative Party annual
conference in Blackpool said the decision would strain Anglo-Irish
relations. Ivor Stanbrook, a lawyer and Conservative Party
legislator, said, ``Clearly, there was enough evidence to prosecute
Ryan. The decision was made on political grounds.''
   Peter Brook, the government's Northern Ireland secretary,
commented: ``I think we necessarily have to consider it as a
disappointing decision but it is a decision the Irish government
took on the papers before them.''
   A long history exists of British failure to extradite suspected
members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army from the republic.
   The guerrillas, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland
and unite the partitioned island, are often regarded as fighters
for a political cause.
   Belgium returned Ryan to the Irish Republic early in 1988 after
refusing a British request for his extradition.
   Ryan denies British allegations that in addition to being an IRA
activist he collected money for the IRA in the United States and
Europe.

<HEAD>Coach: Academies Canceling Football Games Because of Black Player</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private school official says other
academies are refusing to play scheduled football games against his
team because he recently added a black player.
   ``They haven't actually said that. I don't know that that's the
reason they're not playing, but all indications point that way,''
Ray Wooten, headmaster and head football coach at Heritage Academy,
said Thursday.
   Scott Fuller, a 15-year-old black student, transferred to
Heritage from nearby West Point High School four weeks ago.
   Wayne Pinkerton, headmaster at Sharkey-Issaquena Academy, said
Wednesday his school would forfeit Friday night's game against
Heritage because his Mississippi Private School Association Class A
team was plagued with injuries and needed time for players to heal.
   Frank Drake said Wednesday that East Holmes Academy, where is
headmaster, would likely forfeit an Oct. 20 game at Heritage, but
added: ``If we don't (play), it won't be because of that black.''
   Drake refused to elaborate and neither he nor Pinkerton returned
telephone calls Thursday from The Associated Press.
   Wooten said Sharkey-Issaquena officials had told him they wanted
their players fit for the remainder of the school's games against
Class 1A schools in the MPSA. The association divides schools into
classes of 1A, 2A and 3A with 3A being the largest schools.
Heritage, with 540 students, is a 2A school.
   Wooten said Sharkey-Issaquena ``has as many people on the roster
as we do.
   ``East Holmes is in our conference and they really haven't given
me any particular reason. We only have a 2-5 record, so it's not
like we're awesome and beating everybody to death because we're
not.''
   Wooten said his athletes were disappointed.
   ``Other than that they're taking it very well. They know what
the problem is,'' he said.
   Fuller said he was ``just a kid who likes to play sports. I'm
not trying to change the world.''
   The sophomore is the first black football player in the MPSA
North Central AA Conference.
   He said he wasn't bothered by the attitudes of the other schools.
   ``You can't be upset with them. It's like their religion. If
that's what they believe, there's nothing I can do,'' he said.
   Scott has two younger brothers who attend West Point public
schools. His father, Julius Fuller, said he wanted his eldest son
in a school with a strong academic program that could provide more
individual attention, knowing his son would be the only black team
member.
   ``I think our students see him as another kid in school,''
Wooten said. ``He's mature and likable. His teammates like him.''
   Fuller, at 5 feet 5 and 130 pounds, returns kicks and is a
substitute at tailback and defensive back. He isn't a starter.
   Wooten said he expected to hear a final decision from East
Holmes by the end of the week.
   Lloyd Lindsey, president of the Academy Activities Commission,
the governing body of the MPSA, and headmaster at Wilkinson County
Christian School in Gloster, said there were about 80 to 85 blacks
enrolled in the MPSA.
   He said several academies have or have had black athletes. The
association has 99 member schools.
   MPSA director Don Souder did not return telephone calls to his
office in Jackson.

<HEAD>China Blames Britain For Immigrant Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said Thursday its refusal to let Hong Kong
return illegal Chinese immigrants is Britain's fault, and refused
to say when it would start accepting them again.
   China suspended the repatriations Sunday, apparently in
retaliation for Hong Kong's decision to let Yang Yang, a Chinese
swimmer who sought asylum after participating in pro-democracy
demonstrations in Hong Kong, to leave for the United States.
   Cooperation on returning mainland Chinese who flee to the
British colony ``was damaged by the British-Hong Kong government
unilaterally,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said at a
weekly briefing.
   ``We hope Britain and the British-Hong Kong government will
express their sincerity in cooperation so that the agreements'' on
border issues can be implemented, he said.
   Asked by a Hong Kong reporter about reports that China may stop
supplying water and non-staple food to Hong Kong, Li said Beijing
``has always been very concerned about the compatriots in Hong Kong
and Macao.'' He described such reports as ``irresponsible and with
ulterior motives.''
   China has not directly linked the swimmer to the immigrant
matter, but the official news agency Xinhua said the Yang case
``will for sure adversely affect the normal contacts between the
residents of the mainland and Hong Kong.''
   Li said, without elaborating: ``Recently, the British government
did something that was harmful to the prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong.''
   Hong Kong authorities have intercepted nearly 50 illegal
immigrants a day since Sunday.
   The crushing of pro-democracy dissent in China this spring has
seriously damaged the confidence of Hong Kong's 5.5 million
residents in the 1984 British-Chinese agreement to return the
colony to China rule in 1997.
   Li denied knowledge of a reported slowdown of repatriation of
Chinese illegals in the Portuguese colony of Macao, near Hong Kong.
He said cooperation between China and Portugal over Macao, which is
to revert to China in 1999, was going ``very well.''

   Ghana's 7-year-old military government

to Lagos.
   ``We don't have plans on paper for a return to civil rule like

   Quainoo said the West African nation had made economic progress

He said the gross national product increased 5 percent last year.
   Quainoo served as chief of the armed forces until last month,

   A program to give away a drug for AIDS-linked
pneumonia to poor patients is still being worked on, Lyphomed Inc.
said Thursday, a day after reporting that free distribution had
already begun.
   The company in February first announced its intention to develop
a program to distribute the drug pentamidine to indigent patients
through local AIDS clinics and community organizations, spokeswoman
Melissa Marsden said.
   The suburban Rosemont-based company received final government
approval to market the substance in June, Ms. Marsden added.
   Gary Nei, Lyphomed's president and chief executive officer, and
Ms. Marsden said Wednesday that distribution already had begun.
   However, on Thursday, Ms. Marsden backtracked, saying there
still were details to be worked out.
   She said no target date has been set for getting the drug into
the hands of patients. Ms. Marsden also said she did not know the
cost of the program or what quantity of the substance the company
expects to distribute free.
   ``The mechanism is being worked on,'' she said. ``The company is
in the process of working closely with the various community-based
health groups ... to determine the needs of their neighborhoods.''
   The drug would go to the health groups for redistribution to
patients who couldn't afford the drug or whose insurance wouldn't
cover its purchase.
   The aerosol drug approved in June is used to ward off
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the leading cause of death among
AIDS patients.

<HEAD>Up To 50,000 Gallons Of Fuel Spilled At U.S. Antarctic Air Field</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 50,000 gallons of gasoline and other
fuels leaked from tanks at a depot near an American research
station on the South Polar ice this week, officials said Thursday.
   Technicians are working in minus 40-degree temperatures are
attempting to clean up the mess.
   Jack Renirie, a spokesman for the National Science Foundation
which directs the U.S. Antarctic research, said Thursday that
experts have not ruled out sabotage as a cause.
   He said the leaks occurred ``in as many as seven'' of 10
rubberized bladders used to store jet fuel, diesel fuel and
gasoline at Williams Field, an aircraft landing strip five miles
from McMurdo Station, the principle U.S. research and supply
station in the Antarctic.
   ``We've used these tanks at several locations in the Antarctic
and we've never had leaks from seven tanks simultaneously,'' said
Renirie.
   ``Nobody has used the word sabotage,'' he said. ``Not yet.''
   The summer reasearch season is just beginning at McMurdo, and
about 400 people are now working there. At the peak of the season,
about 800 scientists, engineers, technicians and workers will live
at the station for the warmer months of the Antarctic year.
   Renirie said the leaky tanks are in a storage area that is
surrounded with protective dikes made of ice. He said the fuel is
thought to have leaked and then filtered down through snow to an
ice layer about 30 feet below the surface, forming a subsurface
pool of about 180 feet long by 60 feet wide.
   The estimate of the amount of fuel leaked comes from records
that indicate a shortage of about 50,000 gallons, he said.
   McMurdo and Williams Field are located on the Ross Ice Shelf, a
deposit of ice several thousand feet thick that forms a large part
of the apparent surface of the Antarctic continent. Williams Field
is used as a major supply depot for all of the U.S. operations in
the South Polar area, including stations at the South Pole and at
Palmer Station on the Ross Sea.
   The ice where Williams is located is considered stable and
Renirie said it will not move to the sea for years. As a
consequence, he said, there is little danger that the spilled fuel
will end up in the ecologically fragile ocean waters around the
Antarctic.
   ``We expect that the environmental impact will be minimal when
we get it out of there and tanked up,'' he said. ``It (spilled
fuel) could be confined to the area just under the tanks for some
time.''
   Renirie said workers are attempting to dig snow away from the
tanks to find and repair the leaks. They then will start the
cleanup.
   ``They will pump out the fuel and slush and put it on a tanker
sled and take it back to McMurdo for disposal,'' he said. The
tanker sled holds about 3,000 gallons, he said, which means a
number of trips will be required.
   The clean up workers must contend with temperatures dipping
regularly to a minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the spokesman said.
   No method has yet been chose for disposal of the fuel, said
Renirie.
   The fuel spill is the second in recent weeks at U.S.
installations at Antarctica. Earlier, personnel at the
Amundsen-Scott Station at the South Pole found that several
thousand gallons of diesel fuel had leaked from a pipe that carried
the fuel to a generator. Officials said then that the fuel drained
down though the porous snow covering the South Pole and pooled deep
under the surface. No attempt was made to clean up that spill.
   On Jan. 28, an Argentine ship called the Bahia Paraiso ran
aground near Palmer Station and spilled about 200,000 gallons of
fuel and lubricants into the ocean. About 64,000 gallons remain
aboard the Bahia Paraiso. The ship was abandoned and remains
aground, leaking small amounts of fuel.

   Technicians worked six at a time in
a cramped engine compartment Thursday to remove a flawed computer
in time to meet a Tuesday target for launching the shuttle Atlantis
and its Galileo space probe.
   The workers had to stand on platforms to unhook the computer so
it can be replaced Friday with a spare that will be tested for
about 16 hours.
   ``The odds are still 50-50 that we'll be able to make a Tuesday
launch,'' said NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson. Space agency
officials said they would decide Saturday whether to delay liftoff
until Wednesday.
   Liftoff on Tuesday is scheduled for 12:57 p.m., the start of a
24-minute period in which the planet Jupiter will be in the proper
position to nearly cross paths with the Galileo spacecraft in 1995.
Wednesday has a 27-minute launch window, and Nov. 21 is the last
day Jupiter will be in the proper position until mid-1991.
   After launch, Atlantis' crew of five astronauts is to release
the 6,700-pound probe for the six-year journey to Jupiter.
   The launch originally was scheduled for Thursday, but NASA
postponed the flight Tuesday after the engine computer, called a
master controller, gave a false fuel pump pressure reading.
   Similar computers are located in the shuttle's other two main
engines. They each weigh 230 pounds, cost $6 million and control
all functions of their individual powerplant during the climb into
orbit.
   Had NASA tried to launch Atlantis Thursday as originally
planned, the effort would have been halted by bad weather,
officials said. Clouds and high winds prevailed throughout the day,
with intermittant rain.
   The astronauts were at their main training base in Houston on
Thursday, rehearsing in a shuttle simulator.
   A federal judge rejected a request by environmental groups to
halt the flight for fear the nuclear-powered probe could scatter
plutonium over Florida if the shuttle exploded.
   The groups filed a notice with the judge Thursday that they were
going to appeal his ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The West German Green Party, which focuses on environmental
issues, is asking to join in legal actions to delay the launch. It
hopes to gain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclear
cargo before the world court.
   ``Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we represent
them,'' said Lanny Sinkin, a lawyer for the Christic Institute, one
of three U.S. environmental groups that tried to stop the launch.

   Lebanese legislators reached tentative
agreement on a peace plan Thursday, but the Christian army
commander said their actions were irrelevant and he would renew his
``war of liberation'' against Syrian troops.
   ``We cannot rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying
force,'' Gen. Michel Aoun told a meeting of bank employees in
Christian east Beirut, referring to the 40,000 Syrian soldiers
stationed in Lebanon.
   He spoke hours after a committee of 17 Lebanese parliament
members meeting in Taif, Saudi Arabia, approved a tentative plan
for ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has cost more
than 150,000 lives.
   Conference sources said the committee met again in the evening
to prepare for a full session of the 63 deputies, who must approve
the agreement.
   The evening session ended abruptly when Christian deputy George
Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange Party, objected to
``crippling'' demands and stormed out. He did not elaborate, and no
word emerged on when committee meetings would resume.
   Committee members would not give provisions of the plan. Beirut
radio stations well connected with various factions said it
provided for ``limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal and curtailed
the powers of the president, traditionally a Christian.
   Aoun said in Beirut: ``We want radical reforms of this system
from the roots, and not the patching up of a rotten system the way
they are trying to patch it up.'' He did not specifically mention
the Taif agreement.
   ``Either there is reform in a free land where a free people
lives, or there isn't,'' Aoun said. ``I hope everyone will be aware
of this reality and always remember that a war of liberation
erupted in Lebanon for this purpose.
   ``It will continue until it achieves its goals. A meeting trying
to abort the goals of this war will not stop it. Let those deputies
understand that Lebanon's sovereignty and independence are not a
matter for bargaining and negotiation.''
   Zaher al-Khatib, a Sunni Moslem deputy from the pro-Syrian
National Front alliance, said Aoun ``is the number one enemy of the
nation ... trying to affect the course of the conference and abort
its mission of salvaging the country and ending the suffering of
its people.''
   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate issued in 1976, the year after fighting began. Aoun
considers them an occupying force. He vowed to drive them out after
an artillery war began March 8 between his Christian army units and
a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians.
   At least 930 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded,
nearly all of them civilians, before a cease-fire sponsored by the
Arab League stopped the shelling Sept. 22.
   On Sept. 30, those of the 99 Lebanese parliament members who had
survived the long civil war met in Taif to seek a settlement.
   After an overnight session, deputies Najah Wakim, an Orthodox
Christian, and Hassan Rifai, a Sunni, said Thursday they were
optimistic.
   Voice of the People, a pro-Syrian radio station, said Christians
would continue to fill the presidency but would have fewer powers.
   It said the president no longer would be able to issue general
amnesties, could dissolve the parliament only once in his six-year
term and would not be supreme military commander. The station said
the military would rpeort to the Cabinet, traditionally led by a
Sunni as prime minister.
   The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems, who have
become the majority since Lebanon gained independence from France
in 1943.
   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri, leader of the
Shiite Moslem militia Amal, have dismissed the Taif deliberations
on grounds the proposals being considered do not give Moslems
enough power. Both are allied with Syria.

<HEAD>Federal Government To Pick Up Greater Share Of Virgin Islands Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday ordered the federal
government to pick up a larger share of the recovery costs from
Hurricane Hugo in the Virgin Islands.
   Bush earlier had taken similar action for Puerto Rico and South
Carolina.
   The traveling White House announced the action before Bush's
appearance at a fund-raiser for Republican New York mayoral
candidate Rudolph Giuliani.
   The change that Bush ordered in the federal disaster relief
formula should save the Virgin Islands more than $69.3 million,
according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   State and local governments normally must pay 25 percent of the
costs of debris removal, road repair and other public assistance in
disaster areas.
   Bush ordered FEMA to pay a 100 percent share of relief under the
Individual and Family Grant program once the Virgin Islands pays
$500,000.
   FEMA estimated that the disaster will cost $25 million for
grants to individuals and $254 million for aid to local governments.
   Bush acted in response to a request from Gov. Alexander A.
Farrelly.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's two leading daily newspapers
on Thursday denounced the idea of government talks with narcotics
traffickers after assassins working for drug barons killed two
newspaper employees.
   Because of fear on the part of truck drivers and delivery boys,
one of the newspapers, El Espectador, suspended home delivery in
Medellin, where the employees were killed Tuesday, a newspaper
executive told The Associated Press.
   Many kiosks in Medellin were not selling El Espectador, hotel
employees and employees of other newspapers in Medellin said by
telephone. Vendors who were selling it kept it stashed beneath
counters and were slipping issues to customers like contraband,
they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million people in northwestern Colombia,
is the headquarters for the world's biggest cocaine cartel.
   El Espectador said in a lead editorial that drug traffickers'
suggestion of talks ``under their irrevocable threats of
extermination and continuing their injustices if they are not not
heard out would resemble a veritable surrender.''
   The newspaper, whose publisher was murdered by drug traffickers
three years ago, said it is too late to forgive and forget.
   El Tiempo, also in a leading editorial, said El Espectador is
experiencing ``the gravest threat against the freedom of the press
in the entire history of our republic.''
   On Wednesday a letter signed by Pablo Escobar, godfather of the
Medellin cartel, asked for mediation by the press, political and
church leaders and the judicial branch in a ``direct dialogue''
between the government and drug traffickers.
   The letter, addressed to Juan Carlos Pastrana, director of La
Prensa newspaper in Bogota, was read over the Caracol radio network.
   Drug traffickers claimed responsibility for the slayings Tuesday
of the El Espectador workers and threatened the kill the
newspaper's 11 remaining employees in Medellin.
   El Tiempo and El Espectador are fierce competitors in Bogota but
have joined forces in the fight against drug traffickers and
traditionally have supported each other in times of threats to the
free press. El Tiempo has a daily circulation of 350,000 and El
Espectador 285,000.
   Both papers have called for government action against drug
cartels, but El Espectador has been more outspoken, calling the
Colombian congress cowardly for not getting involved in the fight.
   There have been accusations that some congressmen have been
elected with contributions from drug traffickers.
   Escobar was a backup member of the congress from 1982 to 1986.
Each congressman is elected along with a backup member to vote when
the real congressman is not present, which is frequent.
   On Sept. 2, a car bomb exploded alongside the El Espectador
building, seriously damaging the building and forcing the newspaper
to suspend advertising and cut back on the size of the paper.
   The newspaper closed its office in Medellin on Wednesday and
said it will remain closed until the newspaper can figure out what
to do about security.
   The government said Thursday it had captured two more suspected
drug traffickers and was holding them while the United States
decides if it wanted to extradite them.
   The suspects were identified by Colombia's federal
Administrative Scurity Police as Manuel Palma and Leonidas Vargas.
   Palma, according to the U.S. State Department, is wanted in
Miami on charges of participating in a money laundering operation.
   Vargas was described by El Espectador as chief of operations for
the Medellin cartel's vast operation of jungle laboratories in
southern Colombia.
   U.S. authorities have not said if he is wanted in the United
States.
   Colombia has extradited one suspected trafficker to the United
States during the 8-week-old war on traffickers.

   Israeli security forces killed four
Palestinians in the occupied territories Thursday and wounded 18,
including a 3-year-old whose skull was shattered, Arabs and the
army reported.
   The shrapnel-riddled body of another Palestinian was taken to
Ramallah hospital in the West Bank. Israel radio said he apparently
was killed while preparing a bomb.
   Nuhzu Mabruka, 35, was found hacked to death in an alley in the
Nablus central market. Arab reporters said she was killed because
she was a prostitute. Israel radio described her as a collaborator
with the Israelis.
   Military spokesmen said an Israeli patrol encountered
Palestinian guerrillas in south Lebanon before dawn and fired,
killing one. Army radio said the two other guerrillas in the group
escaped.
   Much of Thursday's violence occurred in Nablus, a West Bank town
that has been a center of rebellion during the 22-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Arab journalists reported many confrontations between
Palestinians and soldiers. Hospital officials said 13 Arabs from
Nablus and nearby refugee camps were treated for gunshot wounds.
   Border police patrolling Jenin refugee camp fatally shot a
20-year-old man who tried to hurl a cement block down on them, the
army said.
   In the Gaza Strip, army gunfire reportedly killed one
Palestinian and wounded five. Doctors at Shifa Hospital said
3-year-old Atiyyah el-Ghurani of Shati refugee camp was hit in the
head by a rubber bullet that shattered his skull.
   Army spokesmen said the child was taken to Tel Hashomer Hospital
near Tel Aviv in critical condition and circumstances of the
shooting were being investigated.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have slain at least 591
Palestinians since the uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987. Forty
Israelis have been killed.
   Fellow Arabs have killed 128 Palestinians, most of them on
suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities or for
prostitution or drug dealing.
   The encounter in south Lebanon took place in Israel's
self-declared security zone, near Markabe, a village 1{ miles north
of the border, the army said.
   Israel radio said the guerrillas had planned an ambush in the
security zone, which is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and a
surrogate militia of Lebanese Christians.
   Military sources said the dead man belonged to the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed faction of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The army said 71 guerrillas and two Israeli soldiers have been
killed in the border area this year.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will nominate acting Chairman
James Kolstad to run the National Transportation Safety Board
rather than Jim Burnett, the candidate chosen by President Reagan,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Atlanta Constitution quoted congressional and administration
sources as saying Burnett, an ardent critic of government and
industry safety practices, will not get the nomination.
   Burnett, whose term on the board expires in December 1990, was
renominated as chairman by Reagan in 1988, but Kolstad became
acting chairman when the Senate failed to act on Burnett's
nomination.
   Burnett had served as chairman of the NTSB since 1982.
   Kolstad, contacted in Washington, said he had heard no word of
an appointment but he was ``hopeful and encouraged'' by the
reports. Both Kolstad and Burnett have said they want the job and
have deplored the delay in appointment of a permanent chairman.
   Last week, Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., said chances of
Burnett's reappointment were not good because he is opposed by Sen.
Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., chairman of a Senate aviation subcommittee
that regularly deals with the NTSB.
   Kolstad, former head of corporate communications for Frontier
Airlines, has Ford's backing for the job, the newspaper said.
   John Galipault, president of the non-profit Aviation Safety
Institute, rated Burnett among the board's best chairmen and said
he was worried that the agency could lose some of its independence
without his leadership.
   ``Without an effective leader, the board could lose its
independence and be owned by somebody else _ the airlines or
whoever,'' he said.
   Kolstad has been acting director since August 1988, after
Burnett failed to win senatorial approval for a fourth two-year
term.
   Burnett, who acquired a reputation as a strong, independent
safety advocate, is believed to have angered Ford and the chairman
of the Senate aviation subcommittee, with a speech blasting Ford's
proposal to separate the Federal Aviation Administration from the
Transportation Department.

<HEAD>Discovery of New Green River Victim Part of Routine for Investigators</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of a new victim in the Green River
serial-killing case gave detectives some fresh leads, but few hopes
were raised with 40 other deaths unsolved, the chief investigator
said Thursday.
   The skeleton of Andrea Marion Childers, who was 19 when she
disappeared in 1983, was found Wednesday by a worker cutting brush
just 50 yards from where three other victims had been uncovered six
years ago near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   Police believe the killer in the nation's worst unsolved
serial-murder case has not operated in the Seattle area since 1984.
In addition to the 41 known victims, eight young missing women are
listed as presumed victims.
   Ms. Childers had not been on that missing list, but the Green
River Task Force had information about her because she was reported
missing in 1983, said King County Police Capt. Robert Evans, the
task force commander.
   Investigators weren't surprised that she turned out to be a
Green River victim and that her skeleton was found in an area
heavily searched previously, Evans said.
   ``If you go back to our experience with recovering bodies _
waiting two years before a family member calls and says, `I think
you ought to look at this' _ it's just not unexpected anymore. ...
Everything has some sort of a bizarre twist.''
   Few personal details about Ms. Childers were available, but
Evans said she fit the profile of other Green River victims. Those
killed were young women, most with links to prostitution.
   Seattle police had at least one contact with Ms. Childers, when
they arrested her on March 14, 1983, on a prostitution charge,
Seattle police spokesman Mark Amundson said.
   One month later, Edmonds, Wash., police received a missing
person report about Ms. Childers. She was last seen by her
boyfriend as she was on her way to a shopping area frequented by
prostitutes near the airport, police said.
   Many Green River victims were known to frequent the ``Sea-Tac
strip'' near the airport south of Seattle.
   ``The time of disappearance, what little we know now about the
background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims,''
Evans said. ``The location ... the circumstances of the found
victim, those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a Green
River victim.''
   The missing person report on Ms. Childers was among hundreds
that Green River investigators had collected as they strove to
identify several victims found earlier.
   However, Edmonds police later withdrew the missing-person
report, saying a witness had reported seeing Ms. Childers crossing
the Canadian border.
   The Green River killings occurred from the summer of 1982 to
early 1984. The killer operated primarily in the Puget Sound area;
the bodies of the first five victims were found near the Green
River, giving the case its name.
   No arrests have been made, but William J. Stevens II, 38, of
Spokane, has been described by task force investigators as a
``viable suspect.'' He has been jailed in Spokane on federal
weapons charges but he has not been charged in connection with the
Green River killings.

<HEAD>Brothers Convicted In Drug Case Ordered To Read Five Books Each</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two brothers pleaded guilty to drug
charges, the judge didn't throw the book at them _ he just told
them to read 10 books.
   Circuit Judge John E. Rochester ordered Henry McQueen, 31, and
Isaac McQueen, 30, of Montgomery to read five novels each, write
reports on them and keep a weekly diary on what each is doing with
his life and what he's learned from his experience in the judicial
system.
   Henry McQueen was ordered to read ``The Grapes of Wrath'' by
John Steinbeck, ``Lie Down in Darkness'' by William Styron,
``Animal Farm'' by George Orwell, ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' by
Tom Wolfe and ``The Reivers'' by William Faulkner.
   Isaac McQueen was ordered to read ``Lord of the Flies'' by
William Golding, ``Crime and Punishment'' by Feodor Dostoevski,
``The Trial'' by Franz Kafka, ``Confessions of Nat Turner'' by
Styron, and ``East of Eden'' by Steinbeck.
   The McQueens, who pleaded guilty Wednesday to cocaine possession
charges, were given a suspended sentence of one year and a day, in
addition to five years supervised probation, which the judge said
could be revoked if they failed to do their book reports or keep
their diaries.
   He also said the sentences would remain suspended so long as
they hold jobs and obey the law.
   Rochester, a Clay County jurist serving in the Montgomery
circuit as a visiting judge, said he has been imposing book-reading
sentences for about nine months to a year in his rural circuit.
   He said generally he sentences defendants to read books or keep
diaries ``for the educational value. I don't think corrections is
doing enough.''
   The judge startled the courtroom when he imposed the novel
sentence.
   ``As the sentence was being read, I looked around the courtroom
and people's eyes were getting big,'' said David Belser, the
assistant district attorney who handled the case. ``People were
nodding in the affirmative, `That's great.'''
   Given the normal course of criminal justice system proceedings,
he said, the sentence was ``a breath of fresh air.''
   But Elna Reese, defense attorney for Henry McQueen, said
Thursday the judge would be asked to reconsider the sentence. She
said five years probation for first offenders was too harsh.

   A small fire near a 900-gallon acid vat at a
suburban aerospace complex Thursday prompted the evacuation of
about 1,000 workers, officials said.
   There were no significant injuries reported at the Rocketdyne
plant in Canoga Park, but about 40 people who were in the area of
the fire were given emergency showers and six were taken to
hospitals for precautionary checks.
   The aerospace company, a division of Rockwell International
Corp., makes main engines for the space shuttle.
   The fire broke out on wooden grating near a 900-gallon vat of
hydrofluoric acid and was extinguished by company employees at
about 9:30 a.m., said city Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   None of the acid spilled, he said.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   ``We manufacture the space shuttle main engines in this
particular building and there are about 1,000 people in the
building,'' said Rockwell spokesman Pat Coulter. Hydrofluoric acid
is used to clean parts for the reusable main engines, he said.
   Hydrofluoric acid can damage the eyes, respiratory system and
skin, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
hazardous chemical guide. The chemical is so strong that it is
incompatible with metal, glass, ceramics and concrete.

<HEAD>Court Blocks Parental Consent Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court refused Thursday to
allow enforcement of a California law that would require an
unmarried minor to get consent from a parent or a judge before
having an abortion.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal did not decide if the law was
constitutional, but upheld a San Francisco judge's decision that
abortion-rights groups had shown a likelihood of overturning the
law on privacy grounds.
   Enforcement of the law is to remain blocked at least until the
case goes to trial, unless the ruling is overturned by the state
Supreme Court.
   Among other things, the court said, abortion-rights supporters
offered evidence ``which indicates that all but a very few
adolescent minors have the capacity for exercising mature judgment
concerning the wisdom of an abortion,'' and that the
parental-consent requirement would cause potentially dangerous
delays.
   If that evidence proves true, the court said, it would tend to
show that the law invaded minors' privacy without being justified
by a ``compelling state interest.''
   ``Since (the law) will severely impair, or totally deny, the
exercise of an intimate and fundamental constitutional right, the
burden at trial will be upon (state officials) to prove they have a
compelling interest in the regulation of unemancipated minors'
consent to an abortion,'' said Justice William Stein in a 3-0
decision.
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were doctors, individual minors
and abortion-rights supporters.
   The ruling continues a ban on enforcement of the law, which was
scheduled to take effect in January 1988 but was blocked a few days
earlier by a Superior Court judge.
   The appellate decision relied on California's constitutional
right of privacy, passed by voters in 1972. The court followed
previous rulings that the state constitutional right is broader
than federal privacy rights, and rejected the state's arguments
that privacy protections do not extend equally to minors.
   The ruling comes after a recent Florida Supreme Court decision
overturning that state's parental consent law, also on state
privacy grounds.
   The use of the state Constitution is important because similar
laws in other states have been upheld by federal courts under U.S.
constitutional standards.
   The California law would prohibit an unmarried woman under 18,
living at home, from getting an abortion without the consent of one
parent. As an alternative, she could go to a judge, who would allow
the abortion based on a conclusion that the minor was mature enough
to make the decision or that it was in her best interest.
   State officials have said 34,000 women under 18 got abortions in
California in 1985, the most recent figures available.
   The case could give the state Supreme Court's new majority,
appointed by anti-abortion Gov. George Deukmejian, a chance to
re-examine the scope of state privacy rights.
   Deciding what he described as the only issue before the court,
Stein said the lower court judge did not abuse his discretion in
deciding that opponents of the law had met the standard for an
injunction blocking its enforcement: that enforcement would cause
``irreparable harm'' and that they had a likelihood of proving at
trial that the law was unconstitutional.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, the lead defendant in the
case, had argued that an invasion of a minor's privacy could be
justified by a ``significant state interest.'' Stein and his
colleagues disagreed, saying the state must show a ``compelling
interest,'' the standard that also applies to adults.
   ``There is no argument that the protection of minors from
physical, psychological and emotional harm manifests a comeplling
state interest,'' Stein said.

   Seven Latin American presidents pledged
Thursday to fight international drug trafficking and condemned the
regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama.
   In a declaration issued at the end of a two-day summit, the
Group of Eight presidents also urged that Cuba be readmitted to the
Organization of American States. It did not elaborate.
   The OAS expelled Cuba in 1961 after accusing Fidel Castro of
openly exporting revolution. The communique issued by the Latin
American presidents marked the first formal suggestion that Cuba be
allowed to rejoin the group.
   The ``Declaration of Ica'' was issued by presidents Carlos Menem
of Argentina, Alan Garcia of Peru, Carlos Salinas de Gortari of
Mexico, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, Virgilio Barco of
Colombia, Jose Sarney of Brazil and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay
after the meeting in this remote desert city 180 miles southeast of
Lima.
   The communique expressed the presidents' regret over ``the
violation of human rights and the absence of democracy'' in Panama
and said they would ask the OAS to send a commission to that nation
to investigate.
   The presidents said Panama would remain suspended from the Group
of Eight, formed two years ago as a regional consulting
organization, until it ``respects once again the democratic
guarantees that today are absolutely ignored.''
   Noriega foiled a coup attempt last week.
   The declaration also said the presidents will use ``all
resources available'' to help the coca-producing Andean nations of
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia in their battle against the region's
cocaine cartels. The three nations produce nearly all of the
world's cocaine.
   ``The elimination of these activities requires an integral
focus, the coordination between producing countries and consuming
countries, and the elaboration of special proposals,'' the
declaration said.
   It did not specifically mention U.S. drug policy, but the
presidents said repeatedly during the meeting that President Bush's
emphasis on using police and the military to stop cocaine smuggling
in the Andean countries was insufficient to halt the drug traffic.
   ``We won't get anywhere putting the brakes on production of the
raw material in countries like Peru, Colombia and Bolivia if the
United States does not provide help and resources for substituting
this type of product in the producing countries,'' Menem said at a
news conference earlier Thursday.
   In his welcoming address, Garcia said: ``The origin of this
problem is in the demand in the large industrialized nations.''
   Perez was even stronger in his criticism of the focus of Bush's
strategy, which provides for $261 million in aid, mainly in the
form of helicopters and weapons, to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   ``The more demand grows in the North, the more production will
grow in the South. Police actions will be useless unless demand is
reduced,'' Perez said Wednesday.
   Garcia, Barco and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia met here
Tuesday before the beginning of the Group of Eight gathering and
agreed to invite Bush to a drug summit, to be held within three
months in a Latin American nation. Bush accepted immediately.
   The three presidents said that drug trafficking could not be
halted until production and consupmtion are curbed.
   Peru, Bolivia and Colombia have urged greater U.S. economic
development aid to generate alternative sources of income for the
hundreds of thousands of peasants who make their living from
growing coca, the raw material for cocaine.
   ``The best allies that Bush could have in his fight against drug
addiction would be the campesinos themselves,'' Garcia said at a
news conference Thursday. ``Ours is not a military war. It's an
economic war.''

   Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife, spoke
at a fund-raiser for breast cancer prevention and tearfully
recalled her mother's death from the disease.
   Mrs. Quayle said Wednesday that her mother's death 16 years ago
at age 56 could have been prevented with early detection and
treatment.
   She spoke to about 2,000 people at the annual luncheon of the
Susan G. Komen Foundation, which since 1982 has raised more than $6
million for breast cancer research programs, education and
awareness projects and screening centers across the country.
   ``My mother lost her battle. ... I'm resolved to help win her
war ... in the name of Susan Komen and in the name of my mother,''
said Mrs. Quayle.
   She sobbed for several moments as she embraced Nancy Brinker,
founding chairwoman of the Komen Foundation. The organization was
named for Mrs. Brinker's sister, who died of breast cancer at age
36.
   Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women ages 35 to
50.
   Many in the audience were in tears by the time Mrs. Quayle
finished her 18-minute keynote address.
   ``Fear is the greatest obstacle to early detection and treatment
of breast cancer,'' said Mrs. Quayle. ``We are here today to vanish
that fear.''
   She said her mother, Mary Alice Tucker, had always been ``too
busy'' to properly care for her medical needs. Mrs. Quayle said her
mother was told by a family doctor that a lump on her breast was
probably benign.
   However, when surgery was performed six months later, the cancer
had spread to her lymphatic system.
   ``The woman died a few months later. She was 56 years old. She
was my mother,'' said Mrs. Quayle. ``My mother's story does not
have to be repeated.''

<TEXT>
   Eighty-eight percent of voters
dotted about this remote South Atlantic archipelago chose a
legislative council this week, undeterred by lack of roads and
helped by one overworked pilot hopping islands to collect ballots.
   In Stanley, the capital and only town of this British colony of
1,800 people, 82 percent of registered voters cast ballots in a
4-day election that ended with a vote-count Wednesday night.
   The numerous islands cover 4,700 square miles, 300 miles east of
Argentina and 8,000 miles from Britain.
   Because of the almost total absence of roads in the farm areas
of this sheep-raising community, election officials visited sites
outside the capital by plane and Land Rover so farmers could vote.
   The government air service, crippled by recent resignations, had
to rely entirely on veteran pilot Andy Alsopp, who was recruited on
an emergency basis from the Shetland Islands of Scotland.
   Ninety-four percent of the total farm electorate of 553 voted.
   Eighteen candidates stood for the eight council seats _ four to
represent Stanley and four the farming community.
   All the candidates stressed their total opposition to resuming
any contacts with Argentina, let alone any discussions of
Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands, the issue that
brought Britain and Argentina to war for six weeks in 1982.
   However, a general feeling of support was shown for improved
relations between Britain and Argentina.
   The first substantive talks between the two former combatants
are to take place in Madrid Oct. 17-18.
   Winning candidate Terence Peck, decorated for bravery in
assisting the British forces that drove out the Argentine
occupation, cautioned against forging economic links with Argentina.
   ``We are content to trade with other Latin American countries,
but we want nothing to do with Argentina,'' he said.

   Leftists shouting anti-government slogans
protested at Mexico City's monument to Christopher Columbus on
Thursday, Columbus Day, and tore away wreaths laid by city
officials.
   About 300 protesters began the demonstration at midday at the
statue of Cuauhtemoc, the last of the Aztec emperors, who were
conquered by the Spaniards in the 16th century.
   After dancers in colorful indigenous costumes and feathered
headdress paid tribute to the native chief, the protesters walked
the two blocks to the Columbus statue, where they chanted slogans,
threw flowers at a few dozen police officers and desroyed the
wreaths.
   There were no violent incidents during the protest, which lasted
only a few minutes. Protesters called Columbus a killer and shouted
that the police should stop harassing citizens.
   Some marchers handed out handbills alleging government
repression of peasants.
   ``We call on the public not to let our dignity be trampled,''
the leaflets said.
   Mexico observes Columbus Day as ``Dia de la Raza,'' Day of the
Races, honoring the nation's racial mix. The majority of Mexicans
have indigenous and European blood.
   Last year's celebration resulted in a melee, when leftist
protesters at the Columbus statue threw rocks at police.

<TEXT>
   President Bush beat the drum for Republican
candidates from the Mississippi Gulf Coast to Gracie Mansion
Thursday, ending up by urging New Yorkers to vote for ``America's
greatest crime-fighter'' _ mayoral hopeful Rudolph Giuliani.
   Bush capped a day of campaigning with an effusive speech at a
fund-raising dinner in Manhattan expected to reap upwards of $1
million for Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor. Polls indicate
he is trailing badly in his bid to keep Democrat David Dinkins from
becoming New York's first black mayor.
   Painting a bleak picture of a city beset by ``neighborhood
tensions,'' crumbling bridges, homelessness and a declining school
system, Bush said, ``Rudy's the one to turn around New York City.''
   Earlier, Bush was in Gulfport, Miss., to rally support for
Republican Tom Anderson, fighting uphill for a congressional seat
that has been in GOP hands since 1973.
   While Bush extolled Anderson, a longtime aide to Mississippi
Sen. Trent Lott, as a sorely needed House vote for his war on drugs
and fight against tax increases, the endorsement paled in
comparison to the accolades he showered on Giuliani.
   Bush said New York ``isn't the city it used to be. But Rudy
holds out the hope that it can again become the city it once was.''
   ``Most of us know him as America's greatest crime-fighter,''
Bush said, likening Giuliani to such ``larger than life'' crime
busters as Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas E. Dewey and Elliot Ness.
   ``In the war on drugs, no man in America has a better chance of
succeeding. Let's take back the streets. Let's bring back New
York,'' said Bush.
   ``Rudy may be an underdog, but New York loves an underdog,''
said the president.
   ``So take your polls and do what you want with them,'' Bush said.
   Bush quipped that the candidate ``knows that when he becomes
mayor he'll have the second toughest job in America. The first, of
course, is managing the New York Yankees.''
   Bush also attended a reception for Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y.,
who is running for borough president of Staten Island, and shook
hands for the cameras with Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., who is seeking
the governorship of New Jersey, at the Newark Airport.
   Bush went first to Mississippi, with Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater in tow, to try to help the GOP retain the seat
left vacant by the death of Rep. Larkin Smith in a plane crash in
August.
   In Gulfport, Bush said he hopes the drug summit he will attend
with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru ``will bring us
to a new level of international cooperation in this war we must
win'' against narcotics. No time or place for the summit meeting
has been announcecd.
   Anderson, who trailed Democrat State Sen. Gene Taylor in the
Oct. 3 open primary, was not shy in making party comparisons
between himself and Taylor.
   ``There is a difference between the two candidates,'' said
Anderson. ``The party of Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale and Ted
Kennedy belongs to Gene Taylor. My party is the party of President
George Bush.''
   Anderson, who was ambassador to Barbados from 1984 to 1986, also
vowed to ``do everything we can to make drugs eradicated from this
country.''
   Bush said that as ambassador, Anderson was a ``point-man in the
drug interdiction effort and he knows what it (takes) to stop the
drug runners from reaching our shores.''
   He said he also needs Anderson's vote in Congress to enact a
crime package and on the environment and to push ``more
accountability'' in education.
   Bush said Anderson ``won't be your average freshman in Congress
because he's already ahead of his class.,
   Bush's campaign appearances followed criticism from some fellow
Republicans for failing to campaign personally for Republican Bob
Lanier, who narrowly lost a bid for the Fort Worth, Texas, seat of
former House Speaker Jim Wright last month.
   Bush also saluted Sheila Smith, widow of the freshman
congressman killed in an August plane crash, who was also at the
Gulfport rally.

<TEXT>
   Police and firemen used electric prods
and water cannon Thursday to disperse about 500 people preparing to
march on congress to demand land for landless peasants.
   The marchers, organized by peasant organizations and labor
unions, gathered in a downtown plaza in preparation for the
10-block march. Witnesses said hundreds of police and firemen
blocked streets out of the plaza and used force when marchers tried
to break through police lines.
   ``We are complying with ministerial orders,'' Gen. Francisco
Sanchez, chief of Asuncion police, told reporters at the scene.
``There is a regulation that prohibits demonstrations in the city's
downtown area.''
   An Interior Ministry decree issued in April bans all large
gatherings downtown on grounds they hinder traffic.
   After initial police efforts to contain the marchers, officers
and march organizers agreed 30 marchers could walk to congress to
present a petition. Many more people tried to join the procession,
however, and this time police responded with clubs and blasts from
water cannon to disperse them.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez ousted former dictator Alfredo Stroessner
in a Feb. 3 coup and was installed as president after winning May 1
elections.
   Peasant organizations want his government to distribute free
land to thousands of poor farmers in the interior of the country.

   The widow of the officer who led the failed coup
against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said Thursday that
U.S. officials were notified of the attempt and agreed to help,
then caused a fatal delay.
   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, 36, took refuge at a U.S. base during
the coup and later fled the country after her husband, Maj. Moises
Giroldi, was executed by Noriega loyalists.
   On Oct. 1, two days before the coup, Mrs. Giroldi had a friend
arrange a meeting with a U.S. army colonel at the friend's house to
inform them and ask for help in isolating Noriega's downtown
headquarters.
   ``What my husband wanted was for them to overfly (Panamanian)
air force bases ... so that no one could leave,'' she said. ``And
also to close off the roads'' around the headquarters.
   The colonel made arrangements with two civilian-clad U.S.
officials, who then met privately with her husband, she said. After
the meeting, without revealing details, her husband said everything
had been agreed and that the coup would be Oct. 3, according to
Mrs. Giroldi, who did not attend the meeting.
   ``My husband told me they made an agreement,'' she said. ``He
told me there were no problems, we were going ahead, and that
everything would turn out well.''
   The U.S. officials gave him a number, she said, telling him to
call them any time during the coup to request help.
   But during the coup, when the rebels seized temporary control of
the headquarters and imprisoned Noriega, her husband's ally, Capt.
Javier Licona, had little success when he picked up the phone.
   ``When the call was made to tell them that Capt. Licona wanted
to talk to them, to report, they didn't believe the call,'' she
said. ``He had to go to Fort Clayton to assure them he was himself.
A lot of time was lost.''
   By the time Licona reached the U.S. base and convinced them of
his identity, he could no longer reach Giroldi. Noriega
sympathizers apparently had retaken control of the headquarters.
Because of the confusion, Licona survived, the highest-ranking
officer to do so, and is now in hiding in the United States.
   Mrs. Giroldi, however, did not place all the blame on the United
States. the worst betrayal came from other Panamanian officers,
especially Maj. Federico Oleochoa, head of Battalion 2000, she said.
   She said he intially cooperated with the coup, letting Licona go
to Fort Clayton, then switched sides.
   Mrs. Giroldi strongly disputed statements made by Noriega in
interviews published Thursday saying that the plotters had received
large sums from the United States.
   ``If they had paid the sum of $1 million, where is it?'' she
said. She denied that any of the officers involved in the coup had
been promised money by her husband or the United States.

   You can't always get what you want when you
ask the government.
   Cleveland, Ohio, wanted $6.9 million to help build a rock 'n'
roll Hall Of Fame. But the Department of Housing and Urban
Development said the museum will have to rock without the federal
bankroll, and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Thursday there's no way
he'll change his mind.
   ``My children love rock 'n' roll. I love rock 'n' roll. But I
have no discretion,'' Kemp told The Associated Press.
   ``The rock 'n' roll museum is a worthwhile project for Cleveland
and rock 'n' roll but it couldn't meet the criteria for a UDAG
grant,'' Kemp said. ``There is no possibility of a UDAG grant for
the rock 'n' roll museum.''
   HUD two weeks ago rejected the request for an Urban Development
Action Grant to build an 18-story glass pyramid to display rock 'n'
roll memorabilia.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat whose district includes part of
Cleveland, had hoped to persuade Kemp the project was worthy of
discretionary funds.
   She was visibly annoyed Thursday when Kemp brought up the
request during a House Banking Committee discussion of unrelated
HUD grant programs.
   Later in the day Kemp called Oakar to clear the air. ``He
apologised for misunderstanding what I was getting at,'' Oakar said.
   Kemp confirmed that he apologised to Oakar. He said he expressed
his friendship and desire to work with Cleveland on housing
programs. But Kemp stressed that he made no promises and held out
no hope for the music museum.
   ``I have no discretionary money,'' Kemp said. ``I don't want
people to be calling me for discretionary political decisions.
   ``There is nothing that I can do about the rock 'n' roll museum
aside from urging the private sector and the rock 'n' roll
musicians and the music industry to put up some more money,'' he
said.
   Oakar sees the $48 million project as the city's best hope for
putting 600 people to work while turning a decaying warehouse
district into a glistening tourist draw. Hall of Fame officials
have estimated that the museum will attract as many as 700,000
visitors and up to $85 million in revenue each year.
   The New York-based Rock And Roll Foundation has set a Nov. 15
deadline for the city to raise $40 million in construction money.
HUD's denial cast doubt on whether the city would be able to meet
the deadline.
   Cleveland is where late-night disc jockey Alan Freed introduced
a generation of teeny-boppers to the term rock 'n' roll.
   The city has approved the sale of $18 million of tax-exempt
bonds to pay for construction, the state promised to kick in about
$4.4 million, Cuyahoga County committed $5 million and corporations
and other donors pledged $7.4 million.

   Fire ravaged a six-story downtown building
Thursday and spread to neighboring buildings as firefighters
contended with exploding fireworks and low water pressure.
   There were no reports of serious injuries. John Fasana, chief of
Emergency Medical Services, said four firefighters suffered minor
injuries and two bystanders were treated for mild smoke inhalation.
   Fire Department spokesman William Murphy said the fire broke out
about 11:45 a.m. in a brick building with a food store on the
bottom floor a section of the congested Chinatown neighborhood. It
was brought under control by 5 p.m.
   More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene as thick
smoke sailed over the city's skyline.
   The fire spread to a commercial building next door and ignited
fireworks stored there, setting off as many as 29 explosions, said
Leo Stapleton, the city fire commissioner. Firefighters had to be
evacuated from the second building, he said.The blaze also spread
to a third building.
   Deputy Fire Chief Paul Christian said firefighters had trouble
getting adequate pressure in their hoses, and might otherwise have
stopped the flames from spreading to other buildings.
   He said fire officials would check with the city's water
department to determine the source of the trouble.
   Stapleton said the fire appeared to have started on the second
floor of the six-story building, where it was reported people might
have been using welding equipment.

money laundering.
   They were arrested on May 25, along with Karl Erick Nissen, 62,
of Norrkoping, Sweden. All were charged with scheming to ship
millions of dollars in aircraft parts and weapons to Iran.
   An Oct. 23 hearing has been set for Nissen, who is accused of
sending 13 heating tubes from F4C fighter jets to Iran. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Robert Berg said the Arabs have agreed to testify
against Nissen as part of a plea bargain.
   Nissen and the Arabs were arrested after an 18-month
investigation by Customs Service agents, who posed as arms
suppliers.
   Sentencing for the couple has been set for Dec. 18. Each of the
Arabs faces a maximum of 15 years imprisonment and $1.5 million in
fines.
   Nissen's attorney, Bill May, said the Arabs' plea comes as no
surprise, but that his client will go to trial.
   ``It's frequently the case that people who are clearly guilty
make agreements to testify against people not so clearly guilty so
they can get off,'' May said. ``I think that's what you see
happening.''

   A Iowa farmer received $116,000 for finding a
400-pound engine disk that may hold the key to July's DC-10 crash
in Sioux City, while a neighbor discovered the disk's missing part
Thursday, officials said.
   ``I'm just in shock. I can manage $20,000, but this?'' Janice
Sorenson said after General Electric Co. officials sent a check to
her two-story farmhouse about 10 miles north of Alta. She said
company officials told her another check for $3,225 will follow.
   GE had offered a $50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from
the rear engine of United Airlines Flight 232 that crashed July 19
while trying to land at Sioux City, killing 112 of 296 the people
on board. GE manufactured the engine, and experts believe the disk
could have caused the crash.
   Alta is 50 miles northeast of Sioux City.
   The amount given to Mrs. Sorenson is more than $50,000 because
GE had said it would pay extra for the 25 fan blades and other
parts still attached to the disk and because some other small parts
were found nearby.
   Mrs. Sorenson discovered about two-thirds of the fan disk
assembly while harvesting corn on her farm Tuesday. On Thursday
afternoon, Harold Halverson, who farms about a half mile north of
the Sorensons, found the missing third while driving a tractor in
his corn field.
   ``I wasn't looking for it at all. I just happened to hit the
disk with it,'' Halverson said. ``It wasn't buried deep 'cause the
disk tipped it right up.''
   Halverson said he contacted GE officials, who carted the part
away. The part weighed about 100 pounds and had 10 fan blades or
parts of blades attached to it.
   ``They said it would fit right into what is missing,'' he said.
   Steve Gadd, an Iowa lawyer hired by GE to assist in the search,
confirmed that Halverson had found the missing portion of the fan
disk. He said the company was deciding whether to call off the
search effort.
   ``I know there are a number of small pieces still missing,'' he
said. ``The reward system will continue in effect, there's no
question about that. But it's whether or not GE will continue a
concerted search, that decision is being made right now and will be
made quite promptly.''
   GE established a reward fund totaling $271,000 to pay for
airplane parts recovered from the crash, but had paid only about
$6,000 before Mrs. Sorenson's discovery, said company spokesman
David Lane.
   Mrs. Sorenson said she had no plans on how she would spend the
money, and Halverson said he does not know yet how much he has
coming.
   The main part of the disk, which looks like a windmill, was
flown Wednesday to a GE plant near Cincinnati for analysis.
   Investigators suspect the fan disk came apart in midair, causing
the engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jet's
hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to
control. The crippled airliner made it to the nearby Sioux City
airport, where it crashed during an emergency landing.

   A physician Thursday warned
swimmers and surfers to beware after a shark reportedly 4 feet long
attacked a 12-year-old surfer about 100 yards offshore.
   The boy, Jason Largent, was in stable condition Thursday at a
nearby hospital with three bites on one foot and leg.
   ``He was hurting a lot and lost a lot of blood, but he wasn't
screaming in pain,'' police Officer Frank Black said. ``If it had
been me, I'd have been screaming bloody murder. I guess the kid's
pretty brave. He's got guts.''
   Jason was attacked Wednesday as he sat on his surfboard in
neck-deep water on a sandbar in the Gulf of Mexico. The shark began
biting his leg, but he managed to get to shore, said Dr. Anselmo
Unite at Brazosport Memorial Hospital.
   Friends with Jason told police the shark was about 4 feet long.
Black said witnesses were not sure of the shark's species.
   ``The shark may still be out there tomorrow who knows?'' Unite
said. ``We just want to warn people. If anyone else goes out there,
well, they need to know about this.''
   The last reported shark bite in Texas was July 9, when a
9-year-old girl was bitten in nearby Sargent Beach.
   Jason underwent surgery for his wounds and was in no danger of
losing his foot or leg, Unite said.

<HEAD>`Bullwinkle' Creator Jay Ward Dies At 69</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cartoon creator Jay Ward, whose Rocky the
Flying Squirrel and Bullwinkle Moose brought hip humor and
sophisticated satire to television cartoons, died Thursday of
kidney cancer. He was 69.
   Ward died at home with his wife, Ramona, and three children
present, said Ward's longtime publicist and friend Howard Brandy.
   With his partner Bill Scott, who died four years ago, Ward
created a world of memorable cartoon characters whose adventures
delighted children without condescending to them and kept adults
amused with witty wordplay.
   The quirky pantheon Ward and Scott created included the plucky
Rocket J. Squirrel and sidekick Bullwinkle Moose; bumbling spies
Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale; smarmy Dudley Doright of the
Mounties and overacting villain Snidely Whiplash; Way-Back Machine
inventor (and dog) Mr. Peabody, and his boy, Sherman.
   The characters were savvy, dumb, well-meaning, brave, flawed,
and uttered atrocious puns as they helped or chased each other
through unlikely situations in a series of cartoon shows by Ward
and Scott.
   Their first effort was ``Rocky and His Friends'' for ABC, which
ran from 1959 through 1961. Rocky and Bullwinkle's adventures,
breathlessly narrated by William Conrad, gleefully spoofed
cliffhanging serials.
   From 1961 to 1962, Ward and Scott produced for NBC ``The
Bullwinkle Show,'' believed to be the first prime-time cartoon
segment for network television. The show ran until 1964, and its
last network appearance, in reruns, was in 1982.
   The show featured ``Fractured Fairy Tales,'' ``Peabody's
Improbable History,'' ``Aesop and Son,'' and ``Adventures of Dudley
Doright,'' which eventually became its own series.
   A Berkeley native, Ward went to the University of California as
an undergraduate studies, then attended Harvard Business School for
a Master's Degree.
   He returned to his hometown and opened a real estate office, but
on the first day of business a truck lost its brakes, rolled down a
hill and into his office. He was pinned to a wall and both his legs
were broken.
   ``Anybody who is in real estate in California and can't run,
better get out of the business,'' Brandy said Ward joked with
friends while he was recovering.
   During that period Ward and friend Alex Anderson invented the
character of Crusader Rabbit, and decided to produce it for
television.
   ``They were so untutored that the first show they shot was done
upside down (on the film)'' said Brandy.
   ``Crusader Rabbit,'' the first cartoon show developed expressly
for television, had Ward's trademark puns and word play and was a
hit after its introduction in 1949.
   After Anderson left the cartoon business for advertising, Ward
teamed with Scott, to create the first ``Rocky and His Friends.''
   Among the writers and creators who worked with the production
company during the early 1960s were film director Paul Mazursky and
Allen Burns, later the Emmy-winning co-producer of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' said Brandy.
   Ward and his associates also produced the Cap'n Crunch breakfast
cereal commercials. His last cartoon series, ``George of the
Jungle,'' ran from 1967 to 1970.
   ``He saw humor in everything and had one of those contagious
laughs, a wonderful rolling laugh that had everyone laughing around
him,'' said Ward's daughter, Tiffany Fabregas, 42, who said her
father loved impulsive wit.
   ``He got the name Bullwinkle from a car dealership,'' she said.
``He just drove by a car dealership in Berkeley and said, `That's
it. That's the name!''
   ``He felt very good about the shows he created, and that even 30
years later people were watching them,'' she said.
   Ward always picked the clips for the numerous film festivals he
was invited to, his daughter said.
   ``There have been a lot of film festivals in last four or five
years. He knew exactly what pieces he wanted. He had an
unbelieveably sharp brain, and a fabulous memory,'' she said.
   ``For all us kids, he was our fearless leader, and he was almost
always right. He was a super father,'' she said.
   Besides his wife and daughter, Ward leaves sons Ron and Carey.
Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   More than 100,000 people jammed the
country's largest soccer stadium Thursday in a raucous show of
support for pro-government presidential candidate Hernan Buchi.
   Earlier in the day, thousands of supporters of opposition
candidate Patricio Aylwin filled a downtown street in a rally
organized by the country's most powerful labor federation.
   Both demonstrations were largely peaceful and no injuries or
arrests were reported. As the end of the opposition rally ended,
some small groups clashed with police but were quickly dispersed
with water cannon.
   The young crowd in the National Stadium cheered, chanted and
waved banners for Buchi, 40, who was finance minister under
right-wing military President Augusto Pinochet for four years
before resigning in April to campaign for the Dec. 14 elections.
   ``We are the future and we are going to win,'' Buchi told the
crowd.
   The event appeared to provide badly needed momentum for Buchi,
the underdog who has trailed Aylwin by as much as 30 points in
opinion polls. An independent, Buchi is backed by the conservative
political groups.
   He reiterated a charge that Aylwin, a Christian Democrat backed
by a coalition of 17 centrist and leftist parties, is allied with
violent Marxist groups and hinted that a labor activist killed in a
hit-and-run accident in southern Chile this week was run down
because he backed Buchi's campaign. Aylwin denies soliciting
Marxist support. Police say they have no evidence of a political
motive in the accident.
   The street rally for Aylwin, about 15 blocks from the city's
center, also drew a youthful crowd. Over loudspeakers an organizer
read a statement from Manuel Bustos, leader of the Workers' United
Central, in which he declared that the organization would
faithfully back Aylwin.
   Bustos and his vice president, Arturo Martinez, were unable to
attend because they are serving 541 days in internal exile in small
towns. They were convicted of violating national security laws by
calling a violence-marred general strike against the right-wing
military government in 1987.
   Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity free trade movement in
Poland, plans a Sept. 26-28 visit to Chile to meet with Bustos and
lobby for his freedom.
   Aylwin, a 70-year-old statesman, told the crowd he would fight
for greater social justice. He said the workers' cause suffered
severely during Pinochet's 16 years of military rule.
   Also running is Francisco Errazuriz, a populist businessman who
trails the other two candidates in the opinion polls.
   Pinochet, 73, seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled
an elected leftist government. In October 1988, voters rejected a
referendum proposal that he remain in power eight more years. He
was obliged to call elections. The new government will take over
next March 11.

   Screen legend Bette Davis was buried Thursday
morning at the family sarcophagus during a private ceremony
attended by 25 close friends and relatives in the Hollywood Hills,
a cemetery spokesman said.
   A graveside service was conducted at Forest Lawn Memorial Park
by the Rev. Robert M. Bock of the First Christian Church in North
Hollywood, said Forest Lawn spokesman Dick Fisher.
   The actress, who died Oct. 6 in Paris, was buried in a marble
sarcophagus bearing a statue of a woman. Flowers adorned the grave.
   Fisher said Miss Davis' mother and sister are also buried at the
tomb in the Courts of Remembrance.
   A public memorial service will be held in about 10 days, Fisher
said.
   Miss Davis, whose big-eyed looks and haughty, chain-smoking
style epitomized big-screen glamour, died at the American Hospital
in Paris after a long battle with cancer. She was 81.
   A two-time Academy Award winner, Miss Davis made 86 movies in a
career that spanned more than 50 years. In 1977, she became the
first woman to receive an American Film Institute Life Achievement
Award.

<HEAD>Congress Shares Blame for Coup Failure, Lawmakers Say</HEAD>

   Members of Congress barred at least one covert
operation in Panama proposed by the administration, intelligence
sources said Thursday.
   One member of the House Intelligence Committee alluded to the
congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill
for intelligence agencies, saying President Bush's cautious
response to the coup was justified in part by interference from the
Democratic Congress.
   ``Who could expect this administration or any administration, or
any intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we have
lashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them they
better not do anything?'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.
   In an apparent allusion to remarks made earlier this week by
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
Shuster noted that some on Capitol Hill have claimed Bush has
received ``everything he wanted with regard to Panama.''
   ``And yet we know there are those who have gone to the White
House and threatened them with exposure (of) classified
information, and said, `You dare not engage in covert
operations,''' Shuster said.
   Other knowledgeable congressional sources said members of the
House Intelligence Committee had specifically barred the
administration from exercising unspecified options that could have
yielded better inside knowledge of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The administration had notified Congress of the options in an
intelligence ``finding,'' a document required to be given to
Congress before undertaking covert actions, the sources said.
   Shuster mentioned no lawmakers by name, but House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., later called Shuster's remarks
significant.
   Referring to lawmakers critical of Bush's inaction _ a group
that includes Boren _ Michel said there is ``plenty in the
(classified) record ... to know that some of these people are going
far beyond what they've got the right to say about the
administration's requests in the past, what was granted and what
was denied.''
   In another development, the Bush administration denied Noriega's
allegations the United States paid $1 million to rebel officers to
launch last week's failed coup.
   ``That's nonsense,'' said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   ``Absurd,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``The State Department says it's absurd, the National Security
Council says there's nothing to it and I say we don't believe
anything Noriega says,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said in Gulfport, Miss.
   Noriega told reporters for The Los Angeles Times and The Boston
Globe in an interview Wednesday night that Panamanian investigators
discovered a bank account in the name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo,
one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than $1 million.
   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,''
Noriega was quoted as saying. ``Six zeroes. It was a million dollar
account.''
   Noriega said: ``The United States was involved before, during
and after the coup. They had to make the contacts, woo them,
convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish.
But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.''
   He also said Nicaraguan Contras delivered money and relayed
messages between U.S. officials and coup plotters.
   The Bush administration has said previously that U.S. officials
were notified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but
did not play a part in planning it.
   According to a remarks Thursday at Wichita State University in
Kansas by Robert Blackwill, a National Security Council staff
member and 1962 graduate of the university, the coup plotters said
they didn't want U.S. help.
   ``Indeed they said they didn't wish for their effort to be
tainted by American intervention,'' Blackwill said in answering
questions after a speech.
   He said the Noreiga troops that crushed the coup arrived through
the honeycomb of streets in the densely populated center of old
Panama City. U.S. intervention would have been difficult, he said.
   ``This is not putting a log over a tow path,'' he said. ``This
would have been the deployment of American forces in the center of
a foreign country, perhaps igniting a fight in which many civilians
would have been killed.''
   The United States has admitted blocking two other routes to the
coup site.
   As for the accusation that the United States used the Contras as
go-betweens, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``That's the first I've ever heard
of something like that.''

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban Ozone-Depleting Chemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The labor government introduced
legislation Thursday that would phase out the use of most
ozone-depleting chemicals within six years.
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said the legislation would make
New Zealand a world leader in environmental protection.
   ``It is essential to act quickly but not to panic,'' said
Palmer, who also has the environment portfolio. ``We do not want to
cause unnecessary disruption to industry but we must protect our
environment.''
   The Ozone Layer Protection Bill would ban 95 percent of harmful
chemicals by 1995 and that they would be phased out depending on
the availability of alternatives available to industry.
   Palmer said all but a few essential uses of such chemicals would
be banned by the year 2000. He did not elaborate.
   The chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and halons _ are
damaging the ozone layer above Earth.
   Scientists say a thinner ozone shield allows more ultraviolet-B
radiation to reach the earth's surface and poses a global
environmental threat through skin cancer and changes to the marine
life ecosystem.
   Palmer said the legislation anticipated tougher international
protocols that he expected by next year.
   ``With these measures in place, New Zealand will be leading the
way in action,'' he said.
   But opposition National Party conservation spokesman Denis
Marshall accused Palmer of grandstanding and said the legislation
was ``wimpish.''
   ``In spite of claims by the Minister for the Environment that we
are leading the world in saving the ozone layer by banning CFCs
from spray cans, CFCs were banned from spray cans in the USA,
Canada, Sweden and Finland 10 years ago,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas on Thursday claimed to have
killed 190 Moroccan soldiers and wounded 150 during its attack near
a desert outpost in the disputed Western Sahara.
   The Moroccan High Command claimed 101 Polisario Front fighters
died in the ``suicide attack'' Wednesday on the defense line at
Hauza, 30 miles south of the Moroccan border, and that 11
Moroccans, including an officer, were killed.
   Moroccan officials said the guerrillas' casualty claims were
propaganda.
   ``This is their habitual tactic,'' said one Moroccan army
officer. ``They claim an impossible number of Moroccan casualties
to conceal their own serious losses.''
   A statement issued in Algeria by the Polisario Front said among
those killed in Wednesday's pre-dawn battle was Lt. Ahmed
Charboudi, while 36 Moroccans, including Capt. Abdel Hadroui, were
taken prisoner. Polisario said nothing about its own casualties.
   Wednesday's raid followed a bloody tank battle Saturday in which
Morocco said a colonel and 13 other soldiers were killed at Guelta
Zenmour, a town central Western Sahara near the Mauritanian border.
   The new Polisario offensive coincides with a pending vote in the
United Nations General Assembly on whether to hold a referendum
among the 80,000 inhabitants registered as living in the Western
Sahara before Spain pulled out in 1975.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has been seeking
a solution to the 14-year-old struggle between Morocco and the
Polisario for control of the vast mineral-rich territory.
   The Polisario had observed a self-imposed cease-fire since
February which was intended to allow peace talks with Morocco's
King Hassan II a chance to succeed. Hassan later broke off the
talks, calling them ``pointless.''
   A Polisario official in Algiers said the king's decision forced
the guerrillas to ``reluctantly take up arms again.''
   But the official Moroccan news agency said the king had canceled
a new round of talks to have been held in Morocco because of the
latest Polisario attacks.
   Moroccan officials in Rabat said the Polisario no longer enjoys
the strong Algerian backing it once had, and as a result has been
forced to move its main military supply base from the Algerian
oasis of Tindouf, near the Moroccan border, to the Mauritanian
outpost of Bir Moghrein.
   Bir Moghrein lies south of Hauza and east of Guelta Zemour.
Moroccan military officials believe attacks on both points were
launched from Bir Moghrein, an area of northern Mauritania with
virtually no government troops.
   Moroccan press reports earlier in the week warned that Hassan's
troops might exercise ``hot pursuit'' into Mauritania unless the
neighboring nation takes action against the Polisario forces.
   Most of the 10,000-strong Mauritanian army is deployed in the
south facing Senegal.
   Most of Polisario's military supplies from various leftist Third
World sources presently arrive at the Mauritanian port of
Nouadhibou, where they are unloaded there by Polisario
sympathizers, diplomatic sources said.

   A Baptist minister shot to death in his church
was among 13 people who died violently in New York during a 24-hour
period that ended early Thursday, city police said.
   Crime statistics released later the same day showed the city was
close to equaling or breaking last year's record, when 1,896 people
were slain.
   There were 1,019 homicides committed in the city during the
first seven months of the year. In the first seven months of 1988,
1030 people were slain.
   ``It's not a good sign,'' said Assistant Chief Raymond W. Kelly,
who heads the police Office of Management Analysis and Planning.
``We could still go over last year's number.''
   The body of the Rev. Irving Wilson, 52, was found at 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday, inside the King Emanuel Baptist Church by two members of
his congregation, police said.
   The clergyman, a resident of Freeport, had been shot twice in
the head; six shell casings from a .25-caliber handgun were found
nearby. Investigators speculate that Wilson was killed when he
interrupted a burglary.
   The other 12 people whose lives ended violently Wednesday and
early Thursday included a Manhattan doorman shot near his Brooklyn
home; a man who was shot to death by an off-duty U.S. Customs
undercover agent during an attempted robbery at a subway station;
and a 23-year-old Brooklyn man who was shot for no apparent reason.

   The Republican candidate for governor is
airing advertisements on issues of interest to women, including a
commercial portraying his Democratic opponent as insensitive to
rape victims.
   Former state Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman's ad, first
aired Wednesday, says Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder introduced a bill
in 1972 that would have allowed defense lawyers to interrogate rape
victims ages 13 and under about their sex lives.
   Wilder's campaign calls the commercial Coleman's ``most vicious
and untruthful ... to date.''
   The 30-second commercial, produced by nationally prominent
Republican advertising consultant I. Robert Goodman, shows a court
scene in which a supposed rape victim is questioned by a defense
attorney.
   The female announcer says: ``Remembering, after the rape. The
ordeal of questioning by the rapist's lawyer. It was Doug Wilder
who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and under to be
interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused
rapists. So, next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women,
ask him about the law he tried to pass.''
   Coleman also released an ad emphasizing his commitment to tax
credits for child care and expanded day care for working parents in
state government.
   Coleman accused Wilder during a televised debate Monday night of
being insensitive to women by trying to spread fear that the
Republican would seek to restrict abortions if he wins the Nov. 7
election.
   Published polls show the majority of voters share Wilder's view
that the state's abortion laws should be left alone following a
U.S. Supreme Court decision freeing the states to enact new
restrictions on abortion.
   Polls on the governor's race show Coleman about even with
Wilder, who is trying to become the nation's first black elected
governor.
   Wilder press secretary Laura F. Dillard said the bill, which
failed, was intended to broaden the age category for statutory rape.
   At the time Wilder introduced the bill in the state Senate,
Virginia law said a defendant could not be convicted of the
statutory rape of a girl between the ages of 14 and 16 if the judge
or jury determined she had consented or was lewd or of bad moral
repute. The bill submitted by Wilder extended the age category to
include girls under age 14.
   Dillard said that defense attorneys, in rape cases involving
minors, had already been free to question victims about their
sexual history.

   Radical students armed with firebombs
and tear gas briefly occupied part of U.S. Ambassador Donald
Gregg's residence early Friday before riot police dragged them out,
officials said.
   A U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington said Gregg and
his wife were not injured in the attack.
   Police said six male students belonging to an ``anti-U.S. death
squad'' scaled the walls of Gregg's residential compound and hurled
tear gas at guards who tried to stop them from rushing the home.
   The students locked themselves inside one building and held off
riot police for about 30 minutes before troops firing tear gas
smashed down a door and seized them, police said.
   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' the students screamed as police
hustled them away.
   Gregg and his wife, Meg, said at a news conference they were in
bed about 6:30 a.m. when they heard a blast and a guard warned them
by telephone that intruders had entered the compound, which is
about one mile from the U.S. Embassy.
   The Greggs said they heard the intruders on the other side of
their locked bedroom door, but were able to escape the house by
another entrance and avoid an encounter with the students.
   The students however caused extensive damage in the living room,
smashing artwork and pottery, Gregg said.
   He said though that the incident would have no impact on
U.S.-South Korean relations and that the students represented a
vocal minority.
   ``This was the act of six people who broke into our house,''
Gregg said.
   Police said the intruders were armed with firebombs, tear gas
and steel bars. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the
protesters also carried paint thinner and what it described as a
crude homemade explosive.
   Police said the intruders did not use any weapons except for one
tear gas grenade they detonated when forcing their way into the
compound in central Seoul. Damage from the tear gas grenade, which
were apparently captured police equipment, was described as minor.
   The students, who came from three colleges in the Seoul area,
demanded a meeting with Gregg to press for an end to U.S. trade
pressure on South Korea, police said.
   They shouted ``Punish Gregg!'' and ``We oppose U.S. trade
pressure!'' At least one student was draped in a South Korean
national flag.
   The students also demanded South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
call off his proposed trip Sunday to Washington for talks with
President Bush and other U.S. leaders.
   Radical students have opposed Seoul's close ties with the United
States, demanding Washington stop pressuring Korea to accept more
U.S. products. The United States has been seeking greater access to
South Korean markets to help correct its huge trade imbalance with
Seoul.
   The radicals opposed Gregg's appointment as ambassador because
he was a former CIA station chief in Seoul in the 1970s. They claim
Gregg, who arrived in Seoul last month, was sent to help bolster
the conservative South Korean government.
   The attack on his home came two days after U.S. trade
representative Carla Hills left Seoul after talks with South Korean
officials. Hills and other U.S. officials have demanded South Korea
drop its import barriers.
   Radical students have attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities in the
past, but most of the incidents have been minor and no Americans
have been seriously hurt.
   The radicals are demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea, but they have little public support
because of their extreme political views. Their support has
declined further in recent months because of their sympathy for
rival communist North Korea.
   Gregg served as Bush's national security adviser when Bush was
vice president.
   He was one of Bush's first ambassadorial nominations, but met
significant opposition in the Senate because of disputes over his
role, if any, in the Iran-Contra affair. He was not confirmed until
September, nine months after the nomination, and the vote was only
66-33 in his favor.

<HEAD>Yusupov Scores Victory Over Karpov to Level Match at 2.5-2.5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artur Yusupov scored a 37-move victory over fellow
Soviet Anatoly Karpov in the fifth round of the World Chess
Championship Candidates' semifinal Thursday to even the match at
2.5 points apiece.
   In a frantic time scramble, Yusupov, playing white, unleashed a
dramatic bishop sacrifice that tied black's pieces in knots and
helped win Karpov's queen seven moves later.
   When Karpov resigned, the audience in the Sadler's Wells ballet
theater rose for a standing ovation punctuated with cheers and
cries of ``bravo.''
   ``It was a truly godlike performance. Really courageous,'' said
International Master Jonathan Tisdall.
   ``I've never been so excited watching the end of a game,''
exclaimed British grandmaster Nigel Short. ``Fantastic. What a
glorious move.''
   Karpov, 38, held the world championship crown for 10 years until
1985 and it was widely predicted he would crush his 29-year-old
opponent in the eight-game contest.
   The winner of the Candidates cycle will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game match starting October
1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the Candidates'
final next March.
   A win scores 1 point and a draw one-half.
   In the other semifinal, Jon Speelman of England took a timeout
Thursday postponing his seventh game against Dutch grandmaster Jan
Timman until Saturday. With two games remaining, Timman leads
3.5-2.5.
   Karpov's problems began early in the opening, when a faulty
fourth move let Yusupov gain an enduring positional edge.
   Several commentators said Karpov had suffered a lapse of memory.
   Karpov has ``a memory like a sieve, that's all,'' said Gennady
Sosonko, a Dutch grandmaster who emigrated from the Soviet Union in
1971 and is on good terms with the former world champion.
   Yusupov entrenched a knight on a fine outpost in the center of
the board, which he later replaced with a bishop.
   But Karpov gradually battled his way out of difficulties and by
the 22nd move, experts were predicting the game would end in a draw.
   But at move 30, with only eight minutes' thinking time left to
play 10 moves, Yusupov flashed out his brilliant sacrifice.
   Karpov tried desperately to unravel his pieces, but after a weak
34th move, playing with less than a minute left to make seven
moves, he was unable to prevent a decisive penetration by Yusupov's
queen and a rook.
   With Friday a free day, the sixth game will be played Saturday
with Karpov scheduled to play with the advantage of the white
pieces.
   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two more games will be
played, followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers at
increasingly high speeds.

<HEAD>Investigators Find Pre-Flight Crack in DC-10 Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS grafs 7-8 bgng: ``The farmer,'' to reflect payment of
reward to Ms. Sorenson. ^By DAVID BRISCOE ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators said Thursday
they had found a pre-flight crack in the DC-10 engine disk
recovered from an Iowa corn field nearly three months after the
crash of United Flight 232.
   James Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said the precise ``size, nature and reason for the
crack'' were not yet determined.
   But he said investigators are hopeful further examination of the
engine part will lead to a cause of the July 19 crash that killed
112 of 296 people aboard as the plane was landing at the Sioux
City, Iowa, airport.
   ``There has been no determination on whether this crack was
detectable before the accident, nor has there been a determination
whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure,'' said
board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   However, he and Kolstad said preliminary evidence indicates the
crack existed prior to the flight. He did not say what led
investigators to that conclusion.
   Investigators believe the middle engine in the DC-10
disintegrated in flight, severing hydraulic lines and making the
plane almost impossible to steer. The craft cartwheeled out of
control as the pilots were trying to make an emergency landing.
   The farmer who found the engine part, Janice Sorenson, Thursday
received a reward check for $116,000 from engine builder General
Electric Co., and was told to expect another $3,225.
   Ms. Sorenson found the piece, about a third of it broken off,
while harvesting corn Tuesday with a combine near Alta, Iowa. GE
had offered a $50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the
rear engine of the United Airlines jetliner and several thousand
dollars more for other parts attached to the disk, including fan
blades, which were included in her discovery.
   ``After nearly three months of intensive searching ... we are
hopeful this engine part will lead us to the cause of the failure,
so that we can ensure that an accident such as this never happens
again,'' Kolstad said in a telephone interview.
   He said the first examination of the engine part indicated a
crack ``on the surface (that) emanates both axially fore and aft
and radially toward the rim'' of the disk. This means it appears
along the interior surface of the doughnut-like disk, running from
the front to the back of the engine, and penetrates into the rim
itself.
   The portion of the disk that has been recovered includes
two-thirds of the fan disk itself, along with 25 of the 38 fan
blade roots in the engine.
   A pie-shaped third of the 86.4-inch diameter disk and fan blades
is still missing, Kolstad said.
   The partial disk assembly was examined Wednesday and Thursday at
the Evendale, Ohio, GE jet engine plant.
   Kolstad said a team including two safety board metallurgists and
other government and industry investigators on the crash
investigation's power plant team were examining the disk.
   Investigators have said explosive failure of the aircraft's
tail-mounted No. 2 engine severed or damaged all three hydraulic
control systems which control flight. Pilots managed to maneuver
the plane down into the Sioux City airport by using thrust from the
two remaining engines.
   The crash-landing killed 111 people at the scene and one
passenger died a month later from injuries.

   Voters turned out by the thousands on Thursday to
elect new high school councils, taking the first step in an
ambitious experiment in grassroots control of the city's ailing
school system, officials said.
   Board of Education officials said they were pleased with the
two-day turnout to elect members to 71 city high school and 469
elementary school councils.
   An early tally of ballots show that 104,000 people voted
Thursday to elect members to the 71 high school councils, said
school board spokesman Bob Saigh.
   ``There are some close races, but there are no major disputes,''
Saigh said late Thursday. ``It's been a terrific success in that
it's been so trouble free.''
   Turnout for the elementary vote was below projections made by
some activists, and officials said less than 5 percent of the
eligible parents had voted in the high school elections.
   School board officials estimate about 300,000 people voted in
both high school and elementary school elections _ twice the vote
turnout in New York City's most recent election.
   ``We have nothing to compare it with,'' said Maxey Bacchus, an
election organizer at the Board of Education offices. ``You know at
one time we thought there wouldn't be contested elections. Every
school had contested elections.
   ``That was the first benchmark, and we are absolutely pleased
that people signed up in the numbers they did to vote and the
numbers they did to run as candidates,'' he said.
   The elections were part of a reform package passed last year by
the Illinois General Assembly that also called for cutting
administrative jobs and shifting money in the $2.26 billion school
budget to target low-income students.
   The 17,256 candidates in the two-day election sought 5,400
unpaid positions on the 540 councils, each of which will include
six parents, two teachers and two community residents without
schoolchildren. School staffs will elect the teacher members. The
11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or
schools the council oversees.
   The councils, scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within
in a week of the elections, will have authority to hire and fire
principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend money.
   Enrique Munoz, who was elected as a community representative to
an elementary school, said one of the first steps of his council
would be to ``build a relationship with the principal and the
teachers, rather than them looking at us as the enemies.''
   A tally of votes cast Wednesday showed that 175,275 people cast
ballots at the system's elementary schools. Officials said 85,102
parents of school students voted in the election, with 64,863
ballots cast by community residents and 25,310 ballots cast by
Chicago Public School staff members.
   Officials said there were a number of reports of irregularities
in Wednesday's balloting, most of them caused by inexperienced
election judges and ballots that had more than 20 candidates at
some schools.

   The House voted final, overwhelming approval
Thursday for a federal ban on flag burning, just four months after
a Supreme Court decision allowing destruction of an American flag
as political protest.
   ``This is the least we can do to protect the sanctity of the
flag,'' Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said before the House voted,
371-43, to approve the bill.
   However, President Bush and many Republicans say Congress must
do more than pass a mere statute, and they have been pressing for a
constitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration.
The Senate will take up that issue next week.
   Still, 154 Republicans joined 217 Democrats in supporting the
statutory ban on Thursday, while only 18 Republicans and 25
Democrats opposed it. The bill passed the Senate 91-9.

   An appeals court on Thursday freed a
42-year-old career criminal convicted of killing Prime Minister
Olof Palme, ruling there wasn't enough evidence to blame him for
the crime that traumatized Sweden.
   Christer Pettersson, who maintained his innocence throughout his
sensational trial, walked away from Kronoberg prison hours after
the Svea Appeals Court threw out his July conviction.
   Prosecutors had charged that Pettersson, who has a long criminal
record and a history of drug and alcohol abuse, gunned down the
popular and dynamic Swedish leader on a Stockholm street in 1986.
   Pettersson had been sentenced to life in prison and had been in
solitary confinement since his arrest in December.

   Four American scientists and a West
German won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Thursday for
discoveries that have given the world exact measurement of time and
could help explain the origins of life.
   Canadian-born Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale University and Thomas
Cech, 41, of the University of Colorado in Boulder, won the
chemistry prize for their ``discovery of catalytic properties of
RNA,'' the citation said.
   Bertil Andersson of the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said their work has forced ``the rewrite of
whole chapters'' in chemistry textbooks and could help reveal how
life began.
   It changed dogmas from the turn of the century on how living
cells function, he said.

   The U.S. Roman Catholic Church should drop its
qualified support for teaching about condoms in public schools as a
way of preventing AIDS, and should urge that youngsters be taught
chastity instead, a committee of bishops said Thursday.
   ``There is no such thing as safe, or safer, sex. That's an
illusion,'' said Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman
of the Ad Hoc Committee on the HIV Statement. HIV is the virus that
causes AIDS.
   The committee's draft statement revises an earlier document
released by the church's 50-member Administrative Board in December
1987, which said the church could tolerate public schools'
providing information about condoms as long as sexual abstinence
outside of marriage was presented as the ``only morally correct and
medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   The board's document was criticized by some conservative U.S.
bishops who said it would be misinterpreted as condoning sex
outside marriage and artificial birth control. Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, head of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, also chastised the administrative board for not consulting
with the Vatican.

   Beneath a parking lot, under a mulch of hazelnuts
perhaps left by snacking drama patrons, archaeologists believe they
have found the remains of William Shakespeare's Globe Theater.
   ``Certainty is a scarce commodity in archaeology but the
probability is very high,'' said Harvey Sheldon, a senior
archaeologist at the Museum of London. ``Essentially, this is the
site where the Globe ought to lie.''
   A plaque put up nearby in 1909 by the Shakespeare Reading
Society of London identified the likely site of the most famous
Elizabethan theater on the south bank of the River Thames.
   On Thursday, the hopes of Shakespeare lovers were rewarded with
the first glimpses of three chalk and brick foundation walls that
Sheldon said were part of the back of the theater.

   Another said the government will listen to ``all parts of the

   There were signs of strong differences within the leadership

   Physicists trying to mimic the birth of the
universe inside an atom smasher said Thursday they found strong
evidence that the building blocks of matter belong to only three
families, a discovery that ``puts a lid on the complexity of
nature.''
   ``This brings us closer to really understanding the physical
universe and how it's put together,'' said Burton Richter, a 1976
Nobel laureate in physics and director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Experiments on the 3-mile-long, $125 million Stanford Linear
Collider showed the odds are 25-to-1 that there are only three
families or ``generations'' of fundamental particles that make up
matter, physicist Michael Riordan said by telephone from Stanford.
   ``It means that somehow the universe is comprehensible, that
it's not a total mystery, that it can be grasped by the human
mind,'' Riordan said. ``It puts a lid on the complexity of nature
at its most fundamental level.''

   Civil rights leaders such as Jesse Jackson and

   The leaders said they objected to the controversial passages in

   Jesse Hill, chairman of the board of the King Center in Atlanta,

   The Soviet Union apparently ``approved and may

Nicaragua despite pledges to halt its own shipments of weapons,
Pentagon officials said Thursday.
   ``If present trends continue, 1989 could exceed 1988 in total
tonnage and dollar value of Sovet bloc military shipments to
Nicaragua,'' the Pentagon said in a report.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told President Bush in May
that the Soviet Union had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaragua
at the end of 1988.
   However, the Soviet Union has sent the leftist government in
Managua some $500 million in various other forms of military aid
this year, U.S. officials have said.

   Robert Leonard sees the impact of the
state's faltering economy each day at his Union Market Station
restaurant. He sees it in the empty seats and in the regulars who
still show up.
   ``I have clients come in every day and talk about layoffs,''
said Leonard, whose 180-seat eatery offers burgers, salads and
sandwiches for lunch.
   Leonard's restaurant, built around an old railroad car, is a
short ride from Route 128, where the high-tech industry that fueled
a boom economy of the 1980s is running out of steam.
   ``I can tell you business is lousy,'' said Leonard, who can also
see it in his family. His 24-year-old daughter, who studied to be a
teacher, can't find a job and is living at her parents' home in
Arlington.
   ``She hasn't got an inkling of a job anywhere,'' Leonard said.
   That's not surprising, since school systems in Massachusetts may
lay off as many as 5,000 teachers due to budget cuts.
   Layoffs, cutbacks and the politics of penny-pinching were once
alien concepts here. But this is the new Massachusetts _ not the
miracle state Gov. Michael S. Dukakis ballyhooed during his
presidential campaign. It's the state where some towns are turning
off street lights to save money and others are asking kids to pay
to play high school sports.
   This is the Massachusetts where just two years ago the economy
was so strong that Leonard and other merchants had to practically
drag people off the street to work for them. Now, Leonard fields
two to three applications a day.
   State officials say that September's unemployment rate of 4.4
percent was higher than before but still was third lowest among the
11 largest industrial states. And 1988 per capita income was the
third highest in the nation.
   However, the slowdown in the high-tech industry _ the result of
more companies in the field and slower sales and growth _ prompts
regular reports of belt-tightening, such as Wang Laboratories'
recent layoff of 2,200 people.
   And the real estate market, once one of the hottest in the
country, has gone ``mushy,'' said James Howell, a Bank of Boston
economist. ``I would look at this as a flattening out.''
   In the cycle under way, people are spending less, and the state
is reaping less from sales taxes. Budget cuts are hurting,
especially the poor and sick.
   ``There is a mean spirit out there about the poor,'' said Michal
Regunberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Welfare.
``When times get tough, the poor become the easiest target. We are
seeing that all over the state.''
   Karen Rock, who lives in Pelham in the western part of the
state, said she already has trouble feeding two children on a
welfare check of $178 every two weeks. ``I don't have enough as it
is. The last week of every month is a real struggle for me,'' she
said. Rock has epilepsy and her doctor has advised her not to
drive. Her 18-year-old son has bone disease.
   Meanwhile, the Legislature, which agonized over budget deficits
through most of the spring, must still cut or raise $500 million in
a $12.3 billion budget this year, because revenues are falling
short again.
   Taxes have haunted Dukakis since his presidential campaign. He
originally supported taxes to save state programs, but a wave of
anti-tax sentiment left him nothing but budget-cutting, and he's
pledged to eliminate 2,300 jobs.
   Dukakis did manage to get through an 18-month income tax
increase that would shave about $85 off a $20,000 income this year
and $170 next year. But an anti-tax group has started a petition
drive to halt that measure.
   The anti-tax sentiment is so widespread that Dukakis is
considering endorsing a more palatable revenue-raising measure _ a
bill to allow betting on professional football. Normally he
``wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole.''
   But cuts in the past year, especially in aid to cities and
towns, have been severe. There is little left.
   In Middlesex Superior Court, officials have asked for volunteers
to help with mounting paperwork. ``We need clerk typists and
stenographers and filing clerks,'' said Edward J. Sullivan, the
clerk magistrate. There are four junior clerk vacancies at the
county's superior courthouses in Cambridge and Lowell.
   ``We can't fill these positions. They're frozen,'' Sullivan
said. ``This place is going to fall apart if we don't get some
funds.''
   Essex, a town of 3,000 north of Boston, has turned off street
lights to make ends meet. The town had already stopped garbage
collection and its turn-of-the-century town hall may have to close
because repairs are impossible as long as residents refuse to
override a statewide 2{ percent property tax limit. The Town Hall
bell no longer is rung for fear it may fall through the steeple.
   Samuel Hoar, the town's chairman of selectmen, describes the
building as ``a DC-10 with a bomb in the luggage compartment.''
   What's left to cut next year? ``Nothing. We may find a few towns
going bankrupt,'' Hoar said.
   The state's economic future is ``a mixed bag,'' said Anthony
Ferrara, commissioner for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in
Boston. He pointed out that the state is still in better shape than
many others. Ironically, he said, anger and fear about the state's
economic future may continue to cause damage as people refrain from
spending that could keep the economy moving.
   ``There seems to be a lot of negative psychology out there,''
Ferrara said.
   While the state's economic future is in doubt, there's no
question that a political change is coming soon. Dukakis won't be
running for re-election in 1990, and candidates from both parties
are lining up in the starting box.
   In the last gubernatorial election, Republican candidates won
more jokes than votes. Now, economic trouble has pumped new blood
into a lifeless GOP.
   Leonard, a lifelong Democrat, sees a political conversion in his
future. ``I favor the Democratic Party, but I wouldn't vote for a
Democrat right now if it was my brother,'' he said.

<HEAD>Retired Priest's Tale of Christ Becomes Inspirational Best Seller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SCHROON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Joseph Girzone's epilogue to the New
Testament, Christ peddles his 2,000-year-old carpentry skills for
chicken recipes, buses tables to pay his way to the Vatican and
quips that he hasn't had kosher in ages.
   And like the Christ who tipped over the tables of the
money-changers in Jerusalem, Girzone's latter-day Jesus has radical
ideas to change humanity's relationship with God.
   A retired Roman Catholic priest, Girzone has just published
``Joshua and the Children,'' his second best-selling parable-novel
about Christ's second comings _ and goings _ in today's world.
MacMillan Publishing Co. published both books.
   ``This is my attempt to present the clear and simple message of
Jesus that's been lost over the centuries,'' Girzone said in an
interview at a Catholic retreat in Schroon, a town in the
Adirondack Mountains.
   The chief persecutors of that simple message have been churches
themselves, more intent on preserving their authority than
spreading truth, Girzone said.
   ``I see the terrible, terrible hurt, the anguish people
suffer,'' Girzone said. ``People are desperately trying to find an
answer, to find a god that makes sense. I want to present them with
a god that finally makes sense.''
   Religions, his own included, have failed their followers,
constructing artificial barriers and rituals Christ wouldn't have
respected, Girzone said.
   ``Christians fighting each other in the name of Christ _ it's so
hypocritical,'' he said. ``My remedy is to plop Jesus, plop Joshua,
right in the middle of it.''
   In the first book, Jesus returns to Earth, takes the name Joshua
and sets up shop as a carpenter and wood-carver. He lives simply,
earning just enough to get by, and captivates people of all faiths
with talk of a God who forgives people's weaknesses, who ``did not
intend to make humans little gods.''
   ``To be perfectly human, as God made us, should be our goal,''
Joshua says. ``If we appear to be religious or pious, we've missed
the point and our piety becomes a caricature and unauthentic.''
   Joshua clashes with the establishment. He advises a troubled
priest to fight the celibacy requirement for priests, offends
religious leaders by attending services at church and synagogue
alike and faces a hostile panel of Vatican inquisitors.
   Joshua tells Vatican leaders that churches are ``ruled by
unfeeling and arrogant shepherds who hurt the flock and do
irreparable damage to God's people with complete immunity. ... To
threaten God's displeasure when people do not follow your rules is
being a moral bully and does no service to God.''
   Girzone, 58, retired from the priesthood for health reasons in
1981 after 26 years at schools and parishes in the New York City
borough of the Bronx, Pennsylvania and the Albany Diocese. Too
young to receive a church pension, Girzone turned to writing and
lecturing.
   ``Joshua,'' which sold 60,000 copies under his own company's
imprint, Richelieu Court Publications, made the Waldenbooks
best-seller list in 1986, a rare achievement for a self-published
book. The sequel, whose first printing totaled 175,000 copies, has
broken in to the Top 10 of The New York Times best-seller list.
   Collier Books, a division of MacMillan, has sold nearly 400,000
copies of ``Joshua'' since issuing a paperback edition in 1987, and
sales are greater today that two years ago, said Barry Lippman,
president of MacMillan's adult trade division.
   ``It's not some slick fad that's caught on,'' Lippman said.
``Within two or three pages, there's something about the book that
really clicks with people. It shows you can have faith without
thinking of yourself as part of a church.''
   Much of Girzone's vision replays Christ's story in modern terms.
Instead of raising Lazarus from a tomb, Joshua restores a rabbi's
son to life after he has broken his neck in a fall. Instead of
making five loaves and two fish feed a crowd after a sermon, Joshua
stretches two sandwiches to feed 25 children on a picnic. Instead
of a last supper with his disciples, Joshua is the guest at a
surprise party before leaving for Rome.
   Between healing the sick and restoring sight to the blind,
Joshua preaches against drugs and ocean pollution, uses TV
evangelism to spread his message and buys gallon jugs of table wine
from liquor stores.
   There are even ascension and resurrection scenes. In the first
book, Joshua escapes a Vatican boarding house where he's been
locked away after telling the pope what he's doing wrong. In the
second book, Joshua vanishes from his coffin after being gunned
down by religious fanatics in Northern Ireland.
   Unlike Joshua, Girzone has drawn few harsh words for his ideas.
Most religious leaders say they see the truth in what he preaches.
   The ``Joshua'' stories are told simply, in simple prose
reminiscent of Christ's New Testament parables. Before ``Joshua,''
writing had been an agony for him, Girzone said. But the words for
the parable came effortlessly, as if a voice whispered the words in
his ear, he said.
   ``I can't help but feel God wanted something done and is using
the book to accomplish it,'' he said.

   Members of the nation's major religious
denominations do not believe AIDS is God's judgment on people
leading immoral lives, said an author who recently completed a
yearlong study of religious attitudes toward the disease.
   ``This was a startling discovery given the almost universal
denouncement of homosexuality both as a sexual preference and a
behavior pattern by American churches,'' said J. Gordon Melton,
author of ``The Churches Speak on AIDS.''
   Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American
Religion in Santa Barbara, said most religious groups have decided
that acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be separated from
the issue of homosexuality, that efforts should be made to serve
AIDS victims and their families, and that the civil rights of
people suffering with the disease should be protected.
   But he also said the churches have done little to fund research,
expand hospital facilities or develop new treatment programs.

   Older Presbyterians are receiving fewer
gifts from their churches, but congregations are working harder to
find volunteer opportunities for senior members, according to a
survey.
   Only 41 percent of the more than 2,500 respondents from the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) said their churches provide gifts to
older members at special seasons of the year. In 1966, 61 percent
reported their churches provided gifts to older members.
   But more than half, or 52 percent, of respondents said their
churches worked to find volunteer opportunities for older members,
up from 30 percent in 1966.
   The survey was conducted in September 1988 to assist the
church's Task Force on Older Adult Ministries.

   Graham devoted an entire sermon of his recent eight-day Arkansas
Crusade to the drug problem, for the first time in his 40-year
ministry.
   ``Jailing drug dealers and detoxifying drug addicts does not get
at the heart and soul of the problem, which is spiritual,'' Graham

   Parents should decide one faith in which to
raise children of Christian-Jewish marriages, according to the
director of an outreach program for intermarried couples of the
Reform Jewish movement.
   The tendency among parents in interfaith marriages is ``to
choose everything for their children except their religion,'' Lydia
Kukoff of Los Angeles said at a recent panel discussion sponsored
by the American Psychological Association.
   ``The reluctance of mixed couples to decide on one faith for
their child, or their announcement that they will `expose the child
to both faiths and let the child decide,' masks a dangerous
ambivalence,'' said Ms. Kukoff, director of the Joint Commission on
Outreach of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the
Central Conference of American Rabbis.
   ``And it places the child in the extremely difficult position of
choosing one parent over the other, something to be avoided
wherever possible.''

<HEAD>Trooper Works To Prevent Teen Suicides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN P. TEATER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fred Davis was particularly disappointed
when the General Assembly adjourned without dealing with youth
suicide.
   The few programs that exist in North Carolina are in mental
health departments, but most young people who kill themselves
aren't ill and those who contemplate suicide are reluctant to call
because of the stigma, Davis said.
   The state Highway Patrol trooper has reason to research the
problem and to know the pain from a young person's suicide. His
daughter, Lee Ann, used his .357-Magnum service revolver to kill
herself in March 1986. She was 15.
   ``On going through our own grief and searching for a way to cope
with our grief I discovered there was very little for suicide
survivors. It was such a dark subject. There's a taboo and stigma
attached to suicide. People feel shameful, guilty and can't talk
about it.''
   Yet the problem of youth suicide is on the rise. As the national
rate of youth suicide increased slowly from 1960 to 1980, in North
Carolina the rate from 5.2 per million people to 12.3 per million.
   Davis, a state trooper for 23 years, decided to do something
about it.
   At his house Clyde in the North Carolina mountains, he had an
extra telephone line installed and started Parents Against Teen
Suicide, a non-profit support group that has 450 paying members and
is 2 years old this month.
   Davis spends most of his off-duty hours working for PATS, gets
up to 40 calls a day from troubled youths and parents and travels
hundreds of miles to speak at churches and schools about youth
suicide.
   ``This thing has grown so rapidly. My wife had to quit her job
to become a full-time secretary'' for PATS, he said.
   ``Last year we were involved with 16 people that had the gun to
their head or the knife in their hands, and we were able to
intervene and stop it.'' Twelve of those were youths.
   A 13-year-old girl with a learning disability wrote that
classmates were making fun of her. The girl's mother found her on
the bathroom floor after an overdose of a pain-killer, and Davis
visited the girl the next day and has provided her with counseling.
   In another case, a deputy sheriff called one night about a young
man who held a bayonet to his own throat. The deputy wanted to know
what to do. After the incident ended, Davis arranged for counseling
for the young man.
   Davis helped develop a suicide intervention class that is being
used mainly in western North Carolina high schools. He has
presented a grant proposal to the state Department of Human
Resources for a suicide crisis center and hotline for western North
Carolina, and hopes the idea will spread statewide.
   The legislation not considered by the General Assembly before it
adjourned in August would establish a Youth Suicide Advisory Board
to coordinate state efforts in youth suicide prevention. The board
also would help educate the public about the problem and provide
training in the schools.
   ``There's a need to help classroom teachers and school personnel
to be aware of the danger signs. Reducing class sizes would help
the teacher to see here's a student that's in serious trouble,''
said state Rep. Coy Privette.
   The measure included $10,000 for pilot projects, but the bill
lost out to a push for improved pay for teachers and state
employees. If it is enacted during the session this spring, the
state will join Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and
Florida in having youth suicide prevention acts.
   Davis said the public doesn't realize the magnitude of the
problem.
   Each year between 1980 and 1987 an average of 130 youths _
between the ages of 15 and 24 _ committed suicide in North
Carolina. Nationally, more than 6,000 young people killed
themselves last year _ one every 90 minutes.
   There are warning signs, but most people don't recognize them,
Davis said. ``They become hopeless, helpless, hapless. They try
getting involved in several things to take away their emotional
pain. ... When these things fail then suicide becomes a solution to
the problem.
   ``One of the things that young people do a lot of times is
romanticize death, but they don't realize that it's final.''
   Broken homes and relationships, problems in school, drugs and
the strain of adolescence are some of the factors that lead to
youth suicide, experts say.
   Davis' daughter _ tall, with dark hair and blue eyes _ was an
academically gifted student at Tuscola Senior High School in
Waynesville and was active in basketball and volleyball. ``She was
always smiling,'' Davis said.
   She didn't have a drug problem, but she had a turbulent
relationship with her boyfriend. For more than a year, Lee Ann
masked her suicidal feelings.
   But on a Sunday night in March 1986, Lee Ann walked into her
parents' bedroom, where Davis kept his revolver by the headboard of
his bed. She hid it under her blouse and, as she passed her mother,
she said she was going to iron some school clothes for the next
day. Lee Ann stepped outside, pulled out the gun, put it to her
head and pulled the trigger. She died immediately.
   ``Now you can look back and see other symptoms _ an irregular
pattern in her eating and her sleeping,'' Davis said. ``In her last
few weeks she seemed to become overburdened.''
   Victims of suicide often send out signals that are cries for
help, he said. ``Most suicidal people don't really want to die.
They are torn between life and death.''
   This was among several poems Davis and his wife, Joyce, found
after their daughter's death that revealed her anguish:
   ``I'm an actress on the stage
   Playing the role of a comedian.
   Laughing, singing, acting dumb.
   Now the show is over,
   The room is clearing out.
   The lights go off, yet I act on.
   I can't let them see me hurt.
   I can't show them the real me.
   I'm in pain, but they can't know.
   So I just have to keep acting.''

<TEXT>
   All right, class, there'll be a pop quiz soon on
tonight's new NBC series, which is set in Washington, D.C. You may
be asked who says:
   _``Senator, that's a smear!''
   _``Mr. Ambassador, Alexandria police are reporting that the nude
body of your secretary was found floating in your swimming pool. .
.. Care to comment on that?''
   _``I was a bachelor until I was 39. I had a lot of women, a lot
of women. That was then, this is now. Now _ I'm married.''
   _``Remember Chappaquiddick? I want the truth, not a paint job.''
   _``I've been through your file, Mancuso. You are a dinosaur. You
are a hangover in a $10 suit.''
   If a key word in all this leads you to believe all this is in
tonight's premiere of ``Mancuso FBI,'' you need not take the test.
Go read Shakespeare.
   The rest of you, watch this show. It will illustrate how even a
fine actor named Robert Loggia can be sandbagged by a script that
gives bad a bad name.
   Loggia plays FBI agent Nick Mancuso, a raspy-voiced,
world-weary, 30-year FBI veteran. He is cynical but unswervingly
believes in the U.S. Constitution, despite all the powerful,
immoral, unethical, scheming, rotten people in Washington,
particularly those who jog.
   Mancuso-Loggia was wonderful last year in NBC's kinky,
sentimental and pretty good ``Favorite Son'' miniseries. That's the
one where the president, apparently of NBC, persuaded him not to
retire but do his own series.
   An unwise move, if tonight's show is typical. Written by two of
the series's producers, Ken Solarz and ``Mancuso'' creator and
executive producer Steve Sohmer, it is of value only to
classic-dialogue collectors.
   Told in brisk, witless fashion, it concerns a scandal brewing
amid Senate confirmation hearings on a nominee for secretary of
defense. The nominee _ stand back, friends and neighbors _ is a
liberal.
   He also a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, a war hero and a
heartless seducer of young women before he married at age 39. He
claims to have given up seducing young women. But there are those,
like everyone, who think that were he a Marine, his motto would be
Semper Infidelis.
   As mentioned in the dialogue, the deceased of tonight's plot is
one of his secretaries. She lived in the guest house of the mansion
the nominee and his wife shared. ``She was a good secretary,'' he
tells Mancuso.
   ``Yeah,'' Mancuso sneers. ``What else was she good at?''
   Why is Mancuso on the case? The FBI has been told to ``quietly''
re-open its background investigation on the nominee for secretary
of defense.
   In Washington, quietly means reliable sources climb to the top
of the Capitol Dome and shout, ``HEY, THE FBI HAS RE-OPENED ITS
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIFE OF THE NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE!''
   Despite this, Washington's reporters learn something's up here.
   Sex, murder and national-security-threat rumors blossom. So do
such dramatic Old Reliables as Mancuso's ambitious yuppie superior,
a smarmy TV anchor lady, and even a shadowy figure who tries to
drive over Nick and an apparently key potential witness at night.
   The plot twists and turns before going into the Pentagon. Near
the finale, in what probably will become a weekly event, Mancuso
passionately rants about his beloved U.S. Constitution and causes a
severe attack of righteousness.
   Loggia's acting is good, likewise that of Charles Siebert, who
plays his best friend, a forensics expert. But most of the other
players give the impression that, on the whole, they'd rather be in
Philadelphia. You can't blame them. It is difficult to be in a
Washington show that is so darn realistic that early on, a key
character up and says:
   ``Senator, I'm going to ask you a question. Is it liberal to
support self-determination in Central America? Is it liberal to
endorse sanctions against South Africa? Civil rights? Tougher
enviromental standards?''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the
Socialist who has eased Westerns concerns about where he would lead
Spain after his unexpected landslide victory seven years ago, is
heading for what polls indicate will be an unprecedented third term
in elections Oct. 29.
   Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer, has since led the
country into an economic boom with policies that upset some of his
own Socialists, labor particularly.
   He also has brought Spain into the European Economic Community
and reaffirmed its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   So far it has been a successful road for Gonzalez, who once had
to slip into Spain from France in the trunk of a car because his
party was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   According to private and government polls, the Socialists are
expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the country's
29.5 million registered voters for their third absolute majority in
the 350-seat lower house of Parliament. They now hold 183 seats.
   Polls also indicate little on the right or left can block the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party, the official name of Gonzalez's
party.
   The main opposition group, the conservative Popular Party, is in
disarray, having struggled in the past two years for coherence
under three different leaders.
   Its current leader and candidate to replace Gonzalez is
36-year-old Jose Maria Aznar. He took the reins of the party less
than two months before Gonzalez, on Aug. 25, issued the call for
this election. The conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats and
are campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of state
industry, sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes.
   Former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of the Social Democratic
Center Party is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office,
mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12-month obligatory
military service. His party now holds 28 seats in the lower house.
   In 1977, two years after Franco's death, the 58-year-old Suarez
formed Spain's first democratically elected government in 41 years.
   The Socialists' response to Suarez on the military service issue
is that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12
from the 18 months that existed during his administration. The
Socialists also ask how Suarez plans to pay for an all-volunteer
army.
   The United Left coalition under Julio Anguita, the 48-year-old
Communist and former mayor of Cordoba, is expected to gain up to
five seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes of
Socialists disillusioned with the Gonzalez government, which they
perceive as having shifted towards the center-right.
   Their slogan, ``We Are the Alternative,'' is aimed at members of
the General Workers Union, the country's largest and historically
Socialist labor movement. The union has not called on its rank and
file to vote Socialist this time, claiming that the Gonzalez
government has failed to promote an equitable distribution of
Spain's new wealth.
   According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, Spain's per capita gross domestic product rose from
$4,192 in 1984 to $7,449 in 1987, the year after Spain joined the
EEC and confirmed its membership NATO.
   Its annual growth rate of 5 percent is Europe's highest.
   In the 1982 campaign, when Gonzalez ran in his first successful
campaign, his anti-NATO stance and populist style made Western
leaders nervous.
   In this campaign, Gonzalez and other Socialist leaders maintain
that opposition parties have failed to come up with serious
platforms and alternatives.
   ``Their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of their
frustration,'' Gonzalez has said. ``They would be better off if
they tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal to
voters.''
   Another issue that has upset the opposition is Gonzalez's wife,
Carmen, who is running for Parliament on the Socialist ticket in
Cadiz.
   Opposition parties have compared her to Eva Peron, who had an
exceeding influential role in Argentina as the wife of populist
dictator Juan D. Peron, and to Imelda Marcos, the wife of former
President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines.
   Gonzalez's only response to those who make the comparisons is
that they lack ``democratic sentiment.''

   One day on the set of ``On Golden Pond,'' Jane
Fonda was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair, when she
felt co-star Katharine Hepburn reach over and tug at her cheek.
   ``How do you feel about this?'' Hepburn asked, peering from
behind. ``This is your box that carries your persona. What do you
want this to be?''
   Image is what Hepburn meant. What kind of a person does a face
suggest?
   Fonda didn't have a ready answer, even though neutrality is
impossible for this self-styled crusader.
   At age 51, she's still in training. Memoirs don't interest her.
A house in Montana will have to wait _ there's too much to do. Her
outlook remains shaped by possibility, and by now her public knows
that it's never too late for a new Jane Fonda.
   ``It literally doesn't occur to people, maybe even women more
than men because women don't have as many options for change, that
you can become very, very different, and it's never too late and it
can be very profound,'' she said in a recent interview.
   ``You just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to
settle in. Anything can happen. I feel fortunate that I have this
characteristic of openness.
   ``People say, `Have you fulfilled your dreams?' I never had any
dreams. My projections of the future were maybe I'd OD at 25 and
end up lonely and self-destructive. I never had dreams, I never
expected anything, so everything was a surprise to me.''
   Relaxed Jane:
   She sat on a sofa at the Regency Hotel in jeans and blue flannel
shirt, occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table
and nibbling chocolates.
   She talked about open participation and activism. Something's
wrong? Well, let's form a committee, organize, protest. Do
something! Get involved! It starts with each of us. We can change
the world!
   No wonder a special screening in New York of her new film, ``Old
Gringo,'' was a benefit for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Foundation. Fonda and co-star Gregory Peck were there. So were the
Kennedys: Ethel, Caroline, John Jr., Kathleen, Robert Jr.
   Wealth, glamour, power and idealism: Fonda and the Kennedys.
Feasts for the tabloids.
   The latest? The drug bust of Vanessa Vadim, the daughter Fonda
had with her first husband, French filmmaker Roger Vadim. The
21-year-old Brown University student was arrested Oct. 6 with a
friend, Thomas Feegal, outside a reputed drug den in lower
Manhattan. At her arraignment, she pleaded innocent to obstructing
governmental administration, loitering for the purpose of
purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct.
   Patrician Jane:
   She was born in New York in 1937, the daughter of a highly
respected film actor, Henry, and his wife, Frances Seymour Brokaw
Fonda, a descendant of Lady Jane Seymour, a wife of King Henry
VIII. She committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told
it was a heart attack. Jane learned the truth a year later from a
gossip magazine.
   Her brother, Peter, also went into movies, leaving a testament
to the 1960s with the haunting ``Easy Rider.''
   Fonda went to private schools on both coasts and wound up
partying at Vassar College. Unsure of a career in acting, her
confidence grew in the late '50s under the guidance of Method
acting guru Lee Strasberg.
   Thespian Jane:
   There was Broadway and Hollywood in the early '60s. She had
great reviews in bad shows, but her career was going nowhere. She
escaped to France and made Vadim's ``La Ronde'' in 1964, a
vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring
Simone Signoret. She and Vadim married a year later.
   Sex Kitten Jane:
   She was dubbed ``La BB Americaine'' by the French press, a
reference to Brigitte Bardot, who was once married to Vadim. Among
Fonda's roles over the next three years: a woman who seduces her
stepson (``La Curee''), a business executive's mistress (``Any
Wednesday'') and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot
and wins (``Barbarella'').
   Hanoi Jane:
   In 1968, around the time of ``Barbarella,'' students in Paris
nearly toppled the government, and opposition at home to the
Vietnam War overflowed. At first, she defended the United States'
involvement, but soon changed her mind _ completely.
   ``I've taken many paths; I've broken all the rules,'' Fonda
said. ``I left Hollywood and went to Europe at the time when I
shouldn't have. I came back, not as an actress, but as an
activist.''
   Nearly 20 years later, her celebrated visit to North Vietnam,
when she appeared on Radio Hanoi and begged American soldiers to
stop the bombings, still isn't completely forgotten.
   Last year, a Waterbury, Conn., vet tried to circulate bumper
stickers that read, ``I'm Not Fond'a Hanoi Jane,'' while the
actress was there filming ``Stanley and Iris'' with Robert De Niro.
   Fonda apologized last year on national television to veterans
who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at
reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   And her name is still invoked by conservatives in political
campaigns: ``Do you want Jane Fonda running this country?''
   ``I'm a good scapegoat,'' she said. ``I can be painted in to an
image which causes a lot of hostility. I may not be that person but
that's irrelevant.''
   Tom and Jane:
   She divorced Vadim in 1970, and met activist Tom Hayden, a
founding member of the radical Students for a Democratic Society.
She married him three years later, and they had a son, Troy, now
16. They separated earlier this year.
   Dick and Jane:
   ``Fun With Dick and Jane'' was a 1976 satire with George Segal.
But in real life ``Dick and Jane'' meant President Nixon and the
``enemies list,'' a collection of actors, authors and activists
deemed subversive by the administration.
   Fonda was in the elite: wiretapping, harassment of friends, a
failed drug bust and agents reporting on Vanessa's kindergarten
class.
   ``Sometimes, I literally feel like somebody who walks through a
field of gunfire and doesn't get hit,'' Fonda said. ``I don't shy
away from ambushes and I don't particularly have any armor. I just
go through it and the shots miss me. It's not like I'm protecting
myself. I just live my life and I don't think about it.''

<TEXT>NEW YORK: ``... about it.''    Oscar Jane:    Politics and all,
Hollywood honored Fonda. In 1969, she earned an Academy Award nomination
for her role as a Depression-era marathon dancer in ``They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?'' Two years later, when she won the best actress Oscar as a
prostitute in ``Klute,'' she gave a surprisingly subdued acceptance speech
and snubbed the traditional Governors' Ball.    ``I have not bought in
to my celebrity,'' she said in the interview. ``I'm not a snob, I don't
just like people who are famous. My friends aren't famous. I don't live
like a Hollywood star.    ``Everybody couldn't believe my father and Katharine
Hepburn didn't know each other _ as if Hollywood is this little community
where everybody knows each other. Very often, father was quite reclusive.''
   She won the actress trophy again in 1978 for ``Coming Home.''    There
were other Oscar nominations for Hollywood's political princess: actress
in ``Julia'' (ting actress in ``On Golden Pond'' (r981).    Capitalist
Jane:    In 1977, Fonda and producer Bruce Gilbert formed IPC, an independent
company that would make ``thought-provoking and commercial'' films. Two
of their projects, ``On Golden Pond'' and ``Nine to Five,'' each grossed
over $100 million.    ``I have an instinct for what's happening,'' Fonda
said. ``I've only had one failure _ `Rollover' was the only film that didn't
work. I don't know, it's timing, timing. `China Syndrome,' then Three Mile
Island. `Nine to Five.' The National Union of Secretaries formed right
after it. `On Golden Pond,' my dad was going to die. `Coming Home,' the
first real film about vets.''    Deltoid Jane:    In the late '70s, the
onetime revolutionary empress became a leotard liberal with her entry into
the fitness market. Today, she has nine videos on the market, and all have
been in the Top 20 selling videocassettes.    It began in 1979 with a
fitness studio in Beverly Hills. Two years later, ``Jane Fonda's Workout
Book'' was in the stores with more than a million copies in hard
cover alone. The video is the biggest seller ever, earning close to $40
million.    Did she worry that her movie career would be forgotten? 
  ``In the very beginning I did, because when I started the workout business
I was not making many movies,'' she said. ``I thought that might overtake
the other. But I realized pretty quickly it wasn't the case. And even if
it did, I am pretty much someone who lives not according to image. I do
what I want.''    Whither Jane?    ``Old Gringo'' was conceived in 1980
when Fonda met Carlos Fuentes, the celebrated Mexican author, and saw herself
for the part of schoolteacher Harriet Winslow, an American spinster whose
life is transformed during the Mexican revolution.    Cary Grant once
said that Ingrid Bergman was the only actress whose name alone could guarantee
a film's financial backing. That's changed over the years, and Fonda was
an actress who helped when she and Oscar-winner Vanessa Redgrave starred
in ``Julia,'' a critical and commercial success.    ``There's certainly
more than one woman now, but it's definitely double-tiered, there's no
question. Forty years ago, it would have been unthinkable,'' Fonda said.
   ```Old Gringo' went through a number of administrations and the first
few just humored me. Sometimes that happens in studios. They want to keep
a star happy.''    Burt Lancaster was supposed to play the role of iconoclastic
author Ambrose Bierce, but couldn't get medical insurance for the strenuous
location work. Peck stepped in.    ``He and my father are the two male
legends I have worked with,'' Fonda said. ``There's a kind of combination
of smoothness of craft, depth of experience, combined with the willingness
to really work hard, probe deep and not take it for granted.    ``You
could expect that at a certain point in someone's life, but not many would
be ready to still do that _ turn themselves inside out. It's very painful;
it's risky. My dad did it in `Golden Pond.' Peck did it here.'' 
  And what's next for the ever-changing Jane? ``Stanley and Iris'' is due
for release later this year. Fonda is also considering an American remake
of the popular Spanish comedy, ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.''
   And the Kennedys pop up once again. Fonda has the rights to Neil Sheehan's
Pulitzer Prize-winning book on Vietnam, ``A Bright Shining Lie,'' a recipient
of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award.    All that money and eight
years of Ronald Reagan have softened Fonda just a little. She's no subversive,
but don't expect a book called ``Second Thoughts.'' Neo-liberals don't
appeal to her. Causes never run out. Retirement is doubtful: After more
than nine lives in the public eye, she has no interest in landing gently
on her feet.    ``I am in the streets, in theaters, in restaurants, in
grocery stores. I run in the park. I run in streets. I talk to people.
I take buses. I won't have it any other way,'' she said.    ``Could I
give it up some day for life on the farm? Yeah, absolutely. But I wouldn't
retire, I'd probably organize the neighborhood.''

<HEAD>Report Says Wheat-Rye Hybrid Has Global Food Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new version of an old grain is raising hopes
it will prove a valuable crop in the continuing global war against
hunger.
   The crop is triticale, a hybrid blend of wheat and rye. Although
grown on several million acres worldwide, triticale is almost
unknown in the United States, where wheat is the No. 1 food grain,
the Agriculture Department says.
   But scientists have been ironing out some of triticale's genetic
problems, and USDA economists James Cole and Stephanie Mercier say
crop yields ``equal or surpass wheat'' grown under similar
conditions.
   ``Triticale has the potential to increase world grain production
because it can be grown under conditions that are inadequate to
consistently grow standard high-yielding grains,'' they said. ``It
is highly drought resistant and thrives in many marginally
productive soils.''
   Cross-pollination of adjacent fields of wheat and rye have
occurred naturally for centuries, but the resulting hybrid seeds
were small, sterile and generally unsuited for use.
   Cole and Mercier, writing in the current issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, said modern studies of triticale began in 1876
with the cross-pollination of wheat and Scottish rye. But the
result again produced sterile offspring seeds.
   Then, in the 1950s, Canadian researchers at the University of
Manitoba became interested in triticale as part of an effort to
combat leaf diseases that were attacking durum wheat.
   ``Rye's natural defenses against such diseases contributed to
triticale's development as a useful crop,'' the report said.
``Triticale's sterility problem was overcome in the 1950s, and
seeds were developed for distribution, though many other
difficulties remained.''
   Research also progressed in Europe and, on a limited scale, in
the United States. A major step occurred in the mid-1960s when the
University of Manitoba and the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center in Mexico joined forces.
   But it was an accident that provided the key breakthrough. In
1967, a portion of the center's test crop in Mexico was
unintentionally pollinated by dwarf bread wheats from nearby fields.
   ``The resulting strain of triticale, known as armadillo,
appeared to solve most of the crop's problems at once,'' the report
said. ``The new crop was high yielding, short-stemmed, disease
resistant and early maturing.''
   Today, the center _ known as CIMMYT _ estimates triticale is
grown on more than 4 million acres worldwide, although U.S. output
is only around 60,000 acres of both spring and winter varieties.
   More than two-thirds of the acreage is planted in winter
varieties in France, the Soviet Union and Poland.
   Thus, most of the current triticale output is grown in developed
countries on ``fairly good'' cropland, the report said. However,
agronomic studies indicate it also ``may outperform wheat and rye
in marginal conditions'' found in some Third World countries
dependent on food aid.
   ``Under neutral or favorable conditions, today's triticale is
able to match or surpass most of wheat's key vitamin, mineral and
protein levels, although its quality is still inconsistent,'' the
report said. ``Protein levels, for example, can vary by as much as
50 percent in a single year, making the crop unreliable for certain
uses.''
   The report added: ``Triticale, however, can produce a crop under
conditions in which many wheat varieties would die.''
   Although there are drawbacks such as low test weights when grown
under marginal conditions, research on new varieties is under way
in Mexico in hopes of producing triticale flour yields equal to
wheat.
   ``Triticale flour has many baking uses,'' the report said.
``These include unleavened specialty breads and other baked goods
that typically rely on soft-wheat flours, such as pastas, cakes and
cookies. Triticale bread, depending on the plant variety, rises to
the same level and consistency as breads made with many soft wheat
strains.''
   Further, it said, triticale has non-baking food uses, including
breakfast cereals, and is being used in some South American
countries as a malting agent for beer.
   ``Triticale is still an unfamiliar crop in most places,'' the
report said. ``Further, its use would require modifying farming and
milling practices. Some growth, nonetheless, could occur soon.
CIMMYT research has found triticale to be more adaptable to
difficult conditions than wheat, particularly in drylands, tropical
highlands and acid soils found in many developing countries.''
   Harvest failures from weather and poor soils could be reduced if
more triticale were planted, the report said. Such failures might
move farmers to include more triticale.
   ``Over time, farmers, particularly in Eastern Europe, Latin
America and Africa, may well place greater emphasis on what is
increasingly considered a reliable, high-yielding crop,'' the
report said.

   Barbara Jackle and her husband think they're lucky. They found a
reliable woman to watch their 5-year-old son for $85 a week, even
though that required getting special permission to enroll him in a
school near the care-giver's home three miles away.
   ``And that's good for only one year,'' said Mrs. Jackle, 37, a
librarian who lives in Upper Darby, Pa., near Philadelphia. ``We're
even contemplating moving, so we could be closer to where she is.''
   The Jackles' scramble to find a trustworthy sitter for their
5-year-old is a product of the growth in two-income families among
the baby-boom generation. That, in turn, has created an enormous
problem for working parents nationwide: who takes care of the kids
and how to pay them?
   ``Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd better
get set up before you get pregnant,'' said Louise Hurst, a licensed
day-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five other
young children in her home.
   ``I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. Hurst, 43. ``I inform
them I'm full until September 1991, so I don't even bother to take
a waiting list.''
   Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have
multiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a
second income. This has crimped budgets of millions of Americans
and created an underground cash economy of unregulated care-givers.
   Historically, American women have been the family care-givers.
But the nation's labor pool is becoming increasingly female. A
Labor Department study by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis
research organization, says women comprise almost half the work
force, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6 percent in 1950.
   Other Labor Department figures say 57 percent of all women with
children under 6 work outside the home, compared with 12 percent in
1950. The Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-based
child-advocacy group, predicts that by 1995, two-thirds of all
preschool children will have working mothers, an increase of 50
percent in a decade.
   ``Only 7 percent of American households now fit the Beaver
Cleaver family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,''
says a policy paper by the Child Care Action Campaign, a New York
coalition that advocates a national system of care. ``As female
labor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand for
child care will grow, too.''
   Many companies, striving to attract or retain valued employees,
offer incentives ranging from flexible work schedules to emergency
sitters. Some have gone further, allowing young parents to work at
home or take years off with full benefits and job guarantees.
Others are building in-house day-care centers, hiring roving
nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash.
   ``Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to get
into this,'' said Antony Ward, director of Child Care Inc., a New
York referral service many companies retain to help employees find
sitters.
   ``A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,''
he said. ``Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care provider
to find a note on the door saying, `I have the flu,' knows what
it's like.''
   First Bank System of St. Paul, Minn., for example, this year
donated space in its office building for a public kindergarten that
doubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given to
children of bank employees. NCNB Corp., a fast-growing bank in
Charlotte, N.C., plans to offer many of its workers a child-care
reimbursement of up to 50 percent.
   Pitney Bowes Inc., a leading maker of business machines in
Stamford, Conn., helped pioneer flexible working hours to
accommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early some
days, leave early on others. Federal Express Corp., the Memphis,
Tenn., overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-day
weeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts.
   Last month, seven large New York-based employers, hoping to cut
absenteeism, announced a pilot program to provide emergency sitters
for workers whose usual arrangements are disrupted.
   ``Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly,
they're losing employees,'' said Lorraine Dusky, a free-lance
writer and co-author of ``The Best Companies for Women,'' a
guidebook to 50 American corporations. ``Companies aren't doing
this to be altruistic. If companies don't do something, we're in
trouble.''
   Child-care activists say, however, that the high-profile
benefits of a few companies mask a potential labor crisis. Most
businesses say child care isn't a work-related issue, despite
evidence that help from the boss lowers turnover, raises morale and
improves productivity. Moreover, the activists say, the federal
government isn't providing much help.
   Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for
child care is working through Congress, it faces a likely White
House veto because of the estimated $22.7 billion cost over five
years.
   President Bush proposes more modest legislation that would cost
$2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits to parents.
Still, that's less than $20 a week or about $1,000 a year, and it
would go only to poorer families.
   Actual costs for out-of-home child care range from $1,500 to
$10,000 a year, according to a study by the Conference Board, a New
York-based business research group. Other studies show much higher
costs for in-home care.
   Because of the costs and the scarcity of day-care openings, the
vast majority of working parents contend with a hodge-podge,
hit-or-miss system for finding help they can trust and afford.
Stories abound of sitters who ignore, abandon, abuse or kidnap
children.
   Most parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives, but
the result can be hiring an unlicensed, untrained care-giver. An
additional aggravation is that these care-givers generally take
only cash to avoid paying income tax. An estimated $7 billion in
day-care income goes unreported annually.
   Beginning this year, parents must give the Internal Revenue
Service the name and social security number of their day-care
provider to qualify for a tax credit to defray child-care costs.
The IRS plans to cross-reference the returns of sitters and
prosecute cheaters.
   Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder for
parents to afford day care, since many providers will raise rates
to compensate for taxes.
   ``Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in this
country. One of the ways people are able to survive is to be paid
without having to declare the income,'' said Barbara Reisman,
executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign.
   ``I don't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said.
``But many parents can't afford to pay the full cost of care.''
   Esther J. Kahn, director of Parent's Place, a San Francisco
counseling and referral service, agrees: ``We have a system that
has not caught up with rapid social change in our society, in which
more women are back in the labor force and need child care. Our
society hasn't provided support for families.''

   Chances are growing that those young women pushing strollers in
the supermarket or nudging toddlers into the playground sandbox are
modern incarnations of that prim English nursemaid, the nanny.
   The increasing number of working American mothers has created a
strong demand for child care. For couples who can afford it,
trained nannies are a popular alternative.
   ``In-home child care is obviously not the cheapest way to go,
but if you consider your child to be the most important factor in
your life, then don't have a Volvo, buy a Chevrolet,'' said Cathie
Robertson, president of the International Nanny Association, a
professional group based in San Diego.
   ``Seriously, a lot of people have a Mercedes and won't spend
more than $85 a week to take care of their children,'' she said.
   Depending on the location, nannies can earn $200 to $500 a week,
plus room and board. They typically work 12-hour days, doing
everything from changing diapers to buying infant formula to
reading bedtime stories.
   ``They're not there to schlep the dog around to the vet or scrub
out toilets,'' Ms. Robertson said. ``They're there for the kids.
That's probably been the hardest thing we've had to do to teach
parents.''
   Interest in hiring nannies has grown so rapidly that schools now
train recruits in this country, mostly women in their 20s who want
to make children part of their careers. Courses range from child
nutrition to family relations.
   Terri Eurich, president of the National Academy of Nannies in
Denver, says her school has graduated dozens of nannies since she
founded it in 1983. Students get nearly five months of training for
$3,500.
   Ms. Eurich pats her school on the back for helping advance
nannying as a legitimate profession and says most of her graduates
quickly find jobs.
   ``We're doing our best to create an appreciation of a valuable
service,'' she said. ``Just because they're not typing into a word
processor doesn't mean they shouldn't be paid $1,200 to $1,500 a
month.''
   One recent graduate, 21-year-old Paige Pessarra, cares for the
11-month-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Stephen McLaughlin in Ladue, Mo.,
outside St. Louis; McLaughlin is a businessman, his wife a
full-time medical student.
   ``I decided I wanted to start with an infant and nurture him,''
said Miss Pessarra, who had read about the nanny profession in
Forbes magazine.
   She said she works 60 hours a week, has her own bedroom and
living room, and gets to use the family four-wheel-drive vehicle
with mobile phone for emergencies. She declined to discuss her
salary.
   ``Personally I'm happy with what I'm getting,'' she said. ``I
get a lot of benefits and extras. I look at my job as a profession.
I'm planning on staying a number of years.''

<HEAD>Leg-Lengthening Procedure Spurs Controversy Among Dwarfs</HEAD>

   Brian Luna doesn't mind that doctors broke
his legs and put him in a wheelchair for 10 months. And the
14-year-old dwarf says he will let them do it again because the
surgery will make him a foot taller.
   ``It's worth it. It's like being on stilts,'' said Brian, who
went from 3-foot-11 to 4-foot-5 during the first stage of the
leg-lengthening procedure.
   ``I can help my mom make breakfast. I can turn on light
switches. I can turn on the radio and reach the top shelf on my
book case. It's real neat. Most little people have extensions in
their car to reach the pedals. I won't have that problem.''
   Brian, of Covina, is one of four teen-age dwarfs undergoing the
process, which costs $40,000 to $50,000, at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.
   Doctors carefully broke Brian's shin bones in November 1988,
then used telescoping metal rods to help 6 inches of new bone grow
in each gap. They will do the same to his thigh bones early next
year, increasing Brian's height to 4-foot-11.
   The procedure is drawing criticism from some members of Little
People of America, who believe dwarfs should accept their physical
characteristics. They say teen-agers under 18 are too young to
decide if they want the surgery, and that parents may pressure them
into it.
   ``Most little people can do anything they want to accomplish,
and their height is not a barrier,'' said Daniel Margulies, the
group's immediate past president. ``The fact you're short doesn't
mean there's anything wrong with you. If you're going to do
something as drastic as surgery, you have to take the position that
short height is something that has to be corrected.''
   Brian replied: ``If they say I don't need to do this, it's not
any of their business. I'm pleasing myself. I'm not doing this for
everybody. You really want to have this operation to go through all
this inconvenience.''
   The procedure was developed in Spain a decade ago, but modified
at Cedars-Sinai to reduce pain and hospitalization.
   ``It does an awful lot for their self-image and outlook on
life,'' said Dr. David Rimoin, director of pediatrics and the
hospital's medical genetics-birth defects center. ``It allows them
to drive cars, reach lights and elevator buttons _ to live in
society without the aid that somebody dwarfed in stature requires.''
   The surgery by Drs. Joseph Isaacson and William Oppenheim is
done in two stages: breaking the tibias, or shin bones, and
lengthening them 6 inches, then doing the same thing to the femurs,
or thigh bones. The fibulas _ the lower leg bones next to the
tibias _ are bowed in dwarfs, so they are straightened and trimmed
a bit when the tibias are extended.
   Before each shin or thigh bone is broken, four screws are
implanted, two on each side of the planned break. They extend at a
right angle to the bone, pointing inward toward the other leg.
After the bones are broken and placed in casts, hollow telescoping
rods are attached to screws, parallel to the leg. A knob allows the
rods to be extended one-twenty-fifth of an inch daily, until the
gap between each end of the broken bone reaches 6 inches.
   Because the membrane sheath around each bone is left intact when
the bones are broken with a small chisel and hammer, new bone grows
in the proper place to fill the gap, Rimoin said.
   Leg-lengthening, first developed for people with legs of unequal
length, involves long hospital stays in Italy and the Soviet Union,
where patients are made to walk sooner after surgery, causing
greater pain, he said.
   Cedars-Sinai's patients remain in casts and a wheelchair for at
least eight months: five to lengthen the bone and three for the gap
to fill and heal. They spend only four or five days in the hospital
after each set of bones is broken.
   ``These kids are in and out of the hospital quickly, and after
the postoperative period of a few days, they are pain-free,''
Rimoin said. ``I call it lengthening with a smile.''
   Patients receive frequent physical therapy to maintain muscle
tone while their legs are being lengthened. Rimoin monitors
patients for impaired blood flow or nerve damage, but so far hasn't
seen serious complications.
   Brian had the screws and telescoping rods removed from his shins
in June and got out of his wheelchair and onto crutches in August.
   When his thigh bones are broken in a few months, doctors also
will cut his groin muscles to straighten his back, Rimoin said. The
entire procedure lasts about two years.
   Rimoin said it also will be used to lengthen dwarfs' arms,
although Brian doesn't want that surgery.
   Brian and others undergoing leg-lengthening at Cedars-Sinai are
achondroplastic dwarfs. The inherited birth defect is the most
common form of dwarfism, characterized by short limbs, a normal
trunk, small hands, a large head, prominent buttocks and curvature
of the spine.
   As he grew up, Brian said, people ``would make fun. It would
hurt. They'd call me shorty, stuff like that.'' He also received
impolite stares, wasn't allowed on amusement park rides, needed
specially tailored pants and had to use stools to reach bathroom
sinks or to help in the kitchen.
   Rimoin said the surgery is best done between ages 16 and 20, and
that he approves it only for dwarfs old enough to consider the
consequences carefully _ Brian made a list of pros and cons and
received psychological evaluation.
   ``It isn't something he did on a whim,'' said Brian's mother,
Barbara Luna, a divorcee who works for a defense contractor.
   Margulies fears the surgery is done because doctors and parents
view dwarfism as a ``defect that has to be corrected'' rather than
``a characteristic such as blue eyes or red hair.''
   ``There's no way I would have said, `Brian, do this,''' his
mother said. ``He's the one who had to undergo the pain.''
   ``Most little people, if they wait until they're about 20 and
are fairly well-adjusted, would not want the surgery,'' Margulies
said. ``Once they get through the teen-age years, which are
traumatic for anybody _ especially if you're different _ the desire
to have the surgery is no longer there.''
   Brian is happy with his taller stature, but said, ``I'll always
be a little person in my genes, and I'll have smaller hands. It is
changing my physical appearance, but I'm always going to be a
little person.''

   Tom Leamon not only tolerates slip-ups in
his basement laboratory, he provokes them.
   It's all for science: Leamon, head of Texas Tech University's
industrial engineering department, is a pioneer in the study of
slipping and falling.
   ``No one has any idea why or how people fall,'' Leamon said.
``You know it's a slip. You don't know why.''
   Leamon slipped into the subject a couple years ago when he
learned that 4,000 Americans die each year as a result of falling
in places like stores, fast-food restaurants and city streets.
Falls are the second-leading cause of accidental death in the
United States, after traffic accidents.
   Before he can figure out how to prevent falls, however, he needs
to find out what makes people slip and how they react when they do.
It's not as easy as it sounds, because walking is an extremely
complex activity.
   With a $300,000 federal grant, Leamon equipped his lab with
three video cameras plugged into a minicomputer that records 200
times a second what people do when they slip and fall.
   Test subjects _ graduate students paid $10 an hour to be fall
guys _ wear a harness connected to a revolving mechanical arm. They
have reflective ping-pong balls taped to their right shoulder,
elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle and foot.
   The subjects walk in circles for two hours at a time, repeatedly
crossing about 15 feet of slick steel plate placed in front of the
cameras. When they slip, the cameras sense where the ping-pong
balls are in three-dimensional space _ in other words, how the body
is moving as it falls.
   A ``force plate'' under the floor _ a distant cousin of a
bathroom scale, but much more sophisticated _ senses how much force
the subject's foot is exerting downward, sideways, forward and back.
   The harness and mechanical arm prevent the subjects from hitting
the ground and hurting themselves, but don't interfere with the
initial stages of the fall, the period Leamon is studying.
   In two years, he has found some facts about slipping that
surprised him.
   ``When people slip forward, they jerk sideways. It's a physical
reaction. We don't know if that makes life better or worse.''
   He also found what he calls ``microslips.''
   ``Every time you put your foot on the ground, there's a slight
slip _ up to a centimeter _ but you usually can't perceive it. One
of the things we're trying to find out is when you start to
perceive it.''
   The answer seems to be that when you notice a slip, you're
already on a collision course with the ground, he said.
   Leamon also wants to know how vision and carrying things affect
falling, and he would like to find a surface that looks and feels
slippery but isn't _ the theory being that people would walk more
carefully on such a floor, which would be a grocer's and
restaurateur's dream.
   A question that dogs him: ``When you walk across a slippery
floor, you can tell. How, without falling?''
   Leamon said he believes peripheral vision helps prevent slips by
orienting walkers to their environment. If so, long corridors with
white, unmarked walls might be disorienting and more dangerous than
those with stripes or designs on the walls. ``Do you want vertical,
diagonal or horizontal marks on long corridors? We don't know.''
   The research could help make hospitals, nursing homes and
offices safer.
   Step by step, he's trying to learn, with an occasional, welcome
slip.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Sleuths Track Down Source of Oil Spills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK SEAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GROTON, CONN. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When millions of gallons of oil blackened
Alaska's Prince William Sound, the whole world knew where it came
from _ a jagged rip in the hull of the grounded Exxon Valdez.
   But when a fisherman finds his fishing grounds befouled or a
beachcomber's favorite stretch of sand is soaked with oil, it's
often a mystery.
   That's where the super sleuths of oil-spill investigations come
in: The U.S. Coast Guard Oil Identification Laboratory.
   The laboratory, often working with dissipated evidence and few
clues, has helped track down those responsible for hundreds of oil
spills nationwide, from one or two gallons to hundreds of thousands.
   The laboratory uses sophisticated tests to identify the type of
oil and pinpoint its source, a task complicated by the fact that
even oils of the same weight have different chemical
``fingerprints,'' depending on where the original crude was pumped
out of the ground and how it was stored.
   ``It's like crime-solving in which all of the pieces of evidence
have to fit together,'' said Martha S. Hendrick, the chief chemist
and the only civilian in a lab that employs nine other
marine-science technicians.
   The Coast Guard was given jurisdiction for determining liability
for oil spills by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,
which created a $6 million to $7 million revolving fund to cover
the costs of cleanups. Additional money is collected from those
found responsible for the spills.
   The lab opened at the University of Connecticut's Avery Point
campus in 1978, moved to Washington in 1980, and returned to the
campus in 1986.
   In that time, the laboratory, which has an annual budget of
about $440,000, has helped investigate more than 3,000 oil spills
and seen its case load grow each year amid heightened concern about
the environment.
   Recent spills it investigated include the 11-million-gallon
spill from the Exxon tanker in March; a 288,000-gallon spill by the
Greek tanker World Prodigy off Newport, R.I., on June 23; and the
306,000-gallon spill from the Uruguayan tanker Presidente off
Claymont, Del., on June 24.
   The lab can also help exonerate those being blamed for a spill.
   Two technicians who assisted in the Alaska investigation helped
save Exxon $97 million in cleanup costs when they found that
several thousand gallons in haddock- and salmon-fishing grounds
didn't come from the Exxon Valdez.
   ``We have been very busy since the Exxon Valdez incident because
everyone has become much more aware of pollution by petroleum
products,'' said Cmdr. Larry H. Gibson, 40, who has headed the
laboratory for two years.
   Most investigations into oil spills, however, have far fewer
clues than the Exxon Valdez disaster.
   In 1987, a 50- to 75-gallon spill fouled the Willamette River
near Portland, Ore., leaving Coast Guard officials with a slick,
but no suspects. A year later, the lab linked the spill to oil
found near an intake valve on the underside of a tanker that was in
dry dock for repairs. The tanker's owner agreed to pay for the
cleanup.
   ``A lot of people are very surprised when they learn that the
oil did come from their vessel or their facility and they
immediately cooperate once they're shown the evidence,'' Gibson
said. ``Some other people fight it tooth and nail.''
   Field investigators take 4-ounce samples from the spill, along
with samples from possible sources in the area.
   Back at the lab, six to eight tablespoon-sized batches are
tested: gas chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, fluorescence
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid
spectroscopy. The combination of tests allows scientists to
cross-check their results.
   The gas chromatograph, for example, separates the chemicals that
make up the oil based on their different boiling points, which in
turn helps scientists determine the oil's ``fingerprints,'' Gibson
said.
   ``We compare the intrinsic chemical traits of the spilled oil
against all of the suspects to pick out the source of the spill,''
he said.
   Spills can consist of dozens of kinds of oil, from the lighter
kerosene and jet fuels to the thick No. 6 oil used in heavy
industry. Oil of the same weight can have slightly different
characteristics.
   ``There are thousands and thousands of compounds in any
particular oil sample and the makeup of the sample depends on the
oil fill it came from and the conditions of formation,'' Gibson
said.
   ``Also it depends on any refinery processes that the oil has
been through. Any time you mix a batch of oil with another batch of
oil, it's going to change the fingerprint a little bit and that's
where we can really get down to pinpointing the source of the
pollution.''

<HEAD>Patients Who Got Radiation Treatment For Acne Urged to Get Cancer
Checkups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who had radiation therapy for acne
should be checked for malignant tumors in the largest saliva gland,
says a scientist who linked the treatment to the rare form of
cancer.
   People who got an average of 12 radiation treatments for acne
were five times more likely than others to develop malignant cancer
of the parotid gland, said Susan Preston-Martin, an associate
professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern
California. The risk of cancer was eight times normal in people who
got 15 or more treatments.
   Radiation was commonly used to treat acne during the 1930s and
1940s.
   ``Treatment of acne with radiation is no longer common,''
Preston-Martin said. ``But our findings suggest that persons who
have received this therapy should be checked periodically for
parotid gland tumors.''
   She and colleagues studied 139 Los Angeles County residents with
malignant parotid gland tumors and 269 with benign tumors. All were
diagnosed between 1976 and 1984. Nineteen had received radiation
treatment for acne. Their tumors were diagnosed as early as six
years and as late as 49 years after treatment.
   The study found radiation's link with malignant parotid gland
tumors was much stronger than with benign tumors.
   In another study, Preston-Martin concluded last year that
excessive exposure to dental X-rays correlated with parotid gland
cancers. She also identified full-mouth dental X-rays given before
1955 _ when doses were higher _ as the cause of meningioma, a tumor
of the membrane covering the brain.

<HEAD>Middle-Age Fathers Feel Better Prepared For Parenthood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men who became fathers when they are
middle-aged feel better prepared for parenthood, but those who were
better off financially said they were less satisfied with the
experience, according to a new study.
   ``I think the reason is because men at the higher socioeconomic
status ... have had good jobs, probably traveled and had the better
things in life,'' said Deborah Ulrich, a researcher who studied 210
Ohio fathers. ``When they compare parenthood to those experiences,
it just doesn't rate as high.''
   Ms. Ulrich, an associate professor of nursing at Miami
University, chose her study subjects from among 5,000 men between
ages 40 and 55 after examining birth certificates to find those who
became fathers in 1986. Nearly 71 percent said they had at least
one year of college, and average annual income was about $25,000 to
$30,000.
   ``The advantages of being a father at mid-life were that they
felt they were more responsible, more ready to father a child and
to be an important part of the child's life,'' Ms. Ulrich said.
   Nearly 90 percent of the men in the study reported being as
fulfilled with fatherhood as they had anticipated. The same number
said they had more money to spend on a child and had reached a
point in their professional lives where they could spend less time
at work and more with the baby.
   Two factors influencing satisfaction the most were the length
and strength of a marriage, she said. Fifty-two percent of the
fathers were on their second marriage. Those with shorter second
marriages said they were happier fathers.
   ``It could be that they wanted their wives _ being that new
wives are usually younger _ to think that they were still young
enough to be a father and enjoy it,'' she said.
   Disadvantages of parenthood reported by the fathers were
physical exhaustion and the knowledge they might not live to see
their child grow up and have children, she said.
   The study asked fathers to rate 17 factors associated with
having a baby, including having it cry at night, not having time to
spend with their wives and financial concerns. Questions on
satisfaction asked how much pleasure the fathers received from such
things as watching the child grow.

radiation exposure and could result in better pictures to diagnose
cancer.
   The concept of extended processing of mammographic film is not
new but it has been available only in new equipment, which runs
upwards of $10,000, said Dr. G.W. Eklund, director of radiation at
St. Francis Medical Center here.
   Eklund and Dale Surratt, a radiology engineer, modified a
Swedish process and applied to existing processors. Conversion kits
marketed by their Advanced Radiographic Technologies cost $1,700 to
$2,200, they said.
   The process involves installing a variable-speed motor to adjust
the time that mammographic film spends in chemical developers,
Surratt said. The kit slows down the processing speed with the push
of a button.
   ``There's about 30,000 of these X-ray film processors out there,
so it's a huge market. We've found other applications than
mammography, including bone studies and tissue density pictures,''
said Surratt. They've sold about two dozen conversion kits in six
months.
   ``Dr. Eklund has come up with a way to switch X-ray processors
back and forth from processing chest film to mammographic film,''
said Arthur Haus, a medical physicist in the health and science
division at Eastman Kodak Inc.
   ``We've found that extended development processing reduces
patient radiation doses by about 35 percent,'' Haus said. ``And the
resulting pictures offer better resolution and more contrast, which
are easier to interpret for diagnostic purposes. Those are very
strong benefits.''
   ``We've been most impressed by our film quality and the Food and
Drug Administration examined it and determined we've reduced our
radiation dose about 38 percent,'' said Jan McPharolin of Salinas
Valley Radiologists in Salinas, Calif. ``We didn't want to buy an
entire new processor so we're very happy with the conversion kits.''
   Eklund said hospitals also can expect to see a 25 percent
increase in the life of the tubes in their X-ray equipment. The
tubes cost about $14,000.
   Dale Stevenson, FDA health physicist in San Francisco, confirmed
the radiation dose reduction and said the extended development of
mammographic film is producing dramatically improved film pictures.

<HEAD>EC Defends TV Plan Against American Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angered by U.S. complaints, the
European Community says its plan to limit U.S. and other foreign TV
programs is ``perfectly compatible'' with international trade rules.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said Tuesday in Washington
that measure was ``blatantly protectionist'' and vowed to file a
complaint challenging the policy with an international trade agency.
   But a spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc, who demanded
anonymity, defended the move Wednesday as legal and said the United
States would do better under the new plan than under the current,
fragmented broadcasting system in Europe.
   European officials consider the measure ``perfectly compatible _
I repeat perfectly compatible _ with the international obligations
of the community,'' he said.
   At issue is last week's decision by European foreign ministers
to press their local television stations to reserve ``where
practicable'' a majority of air time for European-made
entertainment programs.
   The measure is part of the community's campaign to lift by the
end of 1992 the many trade barriers preventing the free flow of
money, people, goods and services among the dozen nations.
   The United States strongly opposed the plan and Mrs. Hills
underscored her disapproval in her statement Tuesday in Washington.
   ``The directive is blatantly protectionist and unjustifiable,
and discriminates against U.S. and other non-EC film goods,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Hills promised to file a complaint with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 97-nation forum and agreement for
removing trade barriers.
   Reacting to her complaint, the community spokesman said foreign
ministers' measure has a ``non-binding character.'' The foreign
ministers agreed last week their decision would be considered a
political commitment, not a legal obligation.
   Moreover, he said, a majority of the community nations already
have some type of restrictions on broadcast content. Therefore, he
said, there would be advantages to the United States and other
countries from the new plan, even if it were not ``100 percent
liberalization.''
   The spokesman also said TV programs were considered services,
not commercial products, and therefore were not covered by the GATT
rules.
   Even so, he said the community would be willing to hold talks
with the United States about the measure.
   The dispute has revived American concerns about the community's
1992 transformation.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher last week told a U.S. House
of Representatives panel that the United States may have to
reassess its position if the European Community moves toward local
content rules in such areas as TV, computer chips,
telecommunications equipment and cars.
   According to industry figures, the United States has a trade
surplus of about $3 billion from its TV and film exports. Europe is
the leading buyer of such programs with about $700 million in
annual sales.
   The surge in American TV programs in Europe, such as ``Dynasty''
and ``Dallas,'' has prompted worries among some politicians about
their impact on European culture.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Drops $100 Million Prop-Fan Jet Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. is
discontinuing development of a revolutionary prop-fan jet engine
because customers have shown no interest in the $100 million design.
   Instead of extending research on the innovative exposed
propeller engine, the aircraft builder will focus on a new
generation of fuel-efficient aircraft, the MD-90 series, which it
previewed Tuesday.
   ``After a number of years of research, this is what the
customers are telling us they want,'' said Walter Orlowski,
McDonnell's MD-90 program general manager.
   McDonnell Douglas introduced the experimental prop-fan engine in
February 1988. It resembles a standard jet engine housing fitted
with external blades similar to aircraft propellers, but with 16
curved blades.
   The novelty and designers' claims about increased fuel
efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry,
officials said.
   Despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel
consumption by 40 percent, McDonnell Douglas failed to get a single
order for the engine type, company vice president John Wolf said.
   ``Our customers indicated they were not interested in buying
it,'' Wolf said.
   The gamble to develop the prop-fan engine was based on the
belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s, but
prices have held steady.
   The MD-90 models, which come in two sizes, are designed to be
more fuel-efficient than the MD-80 models from which the new series
was derived. A 114-seat version is expected to be 13 percent more
fuel-efficient, and a 153-seat version will save 17 percent,
company officials predicted.
   The company declined to say how much it planned to invest in the
new planes, but industry analysts estimate the development cost at
between $300 million and $400 million.
   The MD-90 series will be powered by a V2500 engine produced by
the consortium International Aero Engines. The consortium included
the American manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney and the British firm
Rolls-Royce, and West German, Italian and Japanese companies.
   Wolf would not say how many orders the company needs before it
can begin production of MD-90s but it has already begun its pitch
to airlines. McDonnell Douglas hopes to begin making deliveries as
early as the fourth quarter of 1994.

   Some small business telephone systems and
subassemblies from Japan and Taiwan are being dumped in the United
States at less than fair value, the Commerce Department said.
   The department ruling Wednesday means the International Trade
Commission must decide within 45 days whether the imports, totaling
more than $1 billion last year, injure or threaten the U.S.
industry.
   If the ITC agrees with Commerce, the department will order its
Customs Bureau to collect duties on the products equal to the
unfair price advantage the foreign products have over similar U.S.
products.
   Commerce said the companies involved in the dumping include
Toshiba Corp. and Matsushita of Japan and Taiwan Nitsuko and Sun
Moon Star of Taiwan.
   The dumping charges were filed last December on behalf of the
U.S. industry by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial
Corp.
   The department said the Japanese imports in 1988 totaled $775.7
million and those from Taiwan totaled $341.9 million.

   The U.S. trade deficit in electronics
increased 5.4 percent to $3.9 billion in the first six months this
year, the American Electronics Association said.
   U.S. electronics exports in the first half of 1989 rose to $29.9
billion from the $27.9 billion sold in the first half of 1988, but
imports also grew from $31.5 billion to $33.8 billion in the same
period, AEA said Wednesday. The electronics trade imbalance in
first-half 1988 was $3.7 billion.
   Topping the imports list again was Japan. The U.S.-Japanese
electronics trade imbalance climbed 2 percent to $9.8 billion from
$9.6 billion in first-half 1988, the AEA said, despite improved
sales of U.S. electronics items to Japan.
   Japan increased its U.S. sales to $13.5 billion in first-half
1989 from $12.5 billion in the first six months of 1988.
   U.S. electronics exports to Japan were $3.5 billion in 1989's
first half, up from $2.9 billion in the first half of 1988, AEA
said.
   ``Although our exports to Japan increased, the overwhelming,
virtually constant size of the electronics trade deficit presents
little reason to be optimistic,'' AEA President J. Richard Iverson
said in a prepared statement. ``We want and expect the same trade
opportunities in other countries that are available here.''
   The overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit fell 10.2 percent
from $60.2 billion to $54.1 billion in the same period.
   The AEA represents some 3,400 electronics and information
technology companies in the United States.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A&amp;M Records, founded in a garage 27 years ago by
trumpet player Herb Alpert and partner Jerry Moss, is being sold to
the PolyGram subsidiary of Dutch-based NV Philips for about $500
million.
   The deal, rumored widely for weeks before its announcement
Wednesday, continues a trend toward consolidation in the record
business.
   Company officials said the combination would give A&amp;M more
worldwide marketing muscle while providing PolyGram with greater
access to talent in the U.S. market.
   It also would put under the same corporate roof such popular and
diverse performers as A&amp;M's Sting and Janet Jackson with PolyGram's
Bon Jovi, John Cougar Mellencamp and Vladimir Horowitz.
   PolyGram, which says it is the world's third largest recorded
music group, said it would acquire all of A&amp;M's record operations
plus its music video interests, its Los Angeles offices, including
the former Charlie Chaplin film studios, and the A&amp;M recording
studio.
   The acquisition excludes A&amp;M's music publishing interests.
   ``It's a good deal for PolyGram and A&amp;M,'' said Harold Vogel, an
entertainment industry analyst for the securities firm Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.
   Vogel said PolyGram has a large capital base and a significant
share in foreign markets. The companies already have worked
together for five years, with PolyGram distributing A&amp;M Records in
Europe.
   PolyGram said Alpert, Moss and A&amp;M's president, Gil Friesen,
would continue their day-to-day roles at the company and have ``a
high degree of autonomy.''
   ``We are not seeing the demise of the independent record
company, rather the emergence of a new brand of independent,'' said
David Fine, PolyGram's president. He said the deal would give A&amp;M
``the resources and marketing infrastructure of a major worldwide
group'' while retaining its musical creativity, its culture and
``its street credibility.''
   The record business has seen a wave of consolidation in recent
years.
   Warner Bros. Records is being acquired along with its parent,
Warner Communications Inc., by Time Warner Inc. Japan's Sony Corp.
bought CBS Records in 1988; RCA Records was acquired by Bertelsmann
AG of West German; Thorn-EMI PLC bought a 50 percent stake in
Britain's Chrysalis Records; and a group including MCA Records
bought Motown Records.
   Moss indicated at a news conference that PolyGram and A&amp;M were
not concerned about size stifling creativity. He said A&amp;M's artists
were told about the deal and he said he heard no objections.
   Alpert told reporters he was excited about the merger, which he
said would give A&amp;M ``more visibility and more muscle'' in
competing for new talent.
   ``I think it's the right move at the right time,'' he said.
   Fine declined to state a precise price for the buyout, but said
speculation that it was about $500 million ``is in the ballpark.''
A&amp;M had sales of about $300 million last year.
   Founded in 1962 in Alpert's garage near Los Angeles, A&amp;M's first
release was ``The Lonely Bull'' by The Tijuana Brass. Artists such
as The Carpenters, Carole King, Joe Cocker, Styx and The Police
have recorded for A&amp;M.
   A&amp;M products are distributed in the United States by RCA
Records, and have captured less than 2 percent of the domestic
chart share in Billboard magazine's Top Pop album chart.
   In the United States, Polygram ranked sixth in chart share at
7.6 percent on the Billboard's Top Pop Album list for the six
months ended July 1.
   Worldwide, Polygram said it ranks behind Warner Bros. Records
with its Warner, Elektra and Atlantic labels among others, and Sony
Corp.'s CBS Records.
   PolyGram, 90 percent owned by Dutch electronics giant Philips,
is making its second major deal in three months. It bought Island
Records Ltd., a London-based company that specializes in rap and
reggae music, in August for an estimated $300 million.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Utility Refund Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee killed a
bill that could have been worth an average of $223 per household
for customers of power, gas and telephone companies.
   Consumer groups and utilities had lobbied vigorously on opposing
sides of the issue.
   The 22-13 vote Wednesday probably killed any chance the
legislation would become law this year. It was opposed by all but
one of the committee's 13 Republicans and by 10 Democrats.
   The bill, by Reps. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., was aimed at a $19 billion reserve that utilities collected
from customers and, under current law, are obligated to refund
within the next 30 years. The bill could have resulted in refunds
within as little as three years.
   The excess reserve grew out of the 1986 overhaul of federal tax
law.
   When utilities calculate the prices customers must pay, they
take into account federal taxes they expect to owe and collect them
in advance. Before the 1986 tax changes, utility prices were based
on the assumption they would pay the maximum corporate rate of 46
percent; the new law cut that top rate to 34 percent.
   A separate provision in the 1986 law _ inserted, ironically, by
Matsui _ gave utilities up to 30 years to refund the excess to
consumers. Matsui says now that he was misled into believing
utilities would put the reserve to good use in ways that would mean
lower power and phone rates in the future.
   ``Now, however, I don't believe them,'' Matsui said earlier this
year when he introduced the bill. ``Never before in my 11 years in
Congress has an issue been as crystal clear as this one. It's a
matter of right vs. wrong, good public policy vs. bad special
interests, ethics vs. greed.''
   His bill would have allowed state utility regulators to require
that refunds be made within as little as three years.
   There was little debate before the committee killed the bill.
   Rep. Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., contended that if the pace of
refunds is accelerated to accommodate present customers, it would
boost utility prices for future customers.
   Acceleration ``will affect the credit rating of utilities and in
the end cost customers more,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo.
   The bill was strenuously opposed by major utilities, but it had
the backing of a variety of consumer, labor and environmental
groups as well as the organization that represents state regulators.
   Susan C. Stone, a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission,
estimated earlier this year that a quick refund could be worth an
average of $223 per household.

<HEAD>Congressional Panel Sets Oil Drilling Hearing in Key West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional subcommittee will travel to
Florida this week to begin a series of field hearings reviewing the
federal government's policies on offshore oil drilling.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, said
his hearing Saturday in Key West will focus on a bill that would
permanently ban offshore oil drilling in federal waters off South
Florida and the Keys.
   His subcommittee also will travel to New England, the Pacific
Northwest, California and Texas to review the effectiveness of the
current offshore drilling law.
   ``The federal offshore drilling program has become paralyzed by
political gridlock,'' said Miller.
   He blasted the Interior Department of the Reagan and Bush
administrations for encouraging offshore drilling. He said the
policies have alarmed the residents of coastal states.
   Congress has responded by passing a series of one-year
moratoriums on offshore lease sales in specific areas as part of
the annual Interior appropriations legislation.
   At first, the strategy was used just for California leases, but
in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill, specific sites in Florida,
New England, the Mid-Atlantic and Alaska also were included.
   The legislation affecting Florida to be discussed at the Key
West hearing would prohibit the interior secretary from issuing oil
and gas leases on the portion of the outer continental shelf south
of 26 degrees north latitude and east of 86 degrees west longitude.
   It also would require guidelines to be established for the
buying back by the federal government of existing oil or gas leases.
   Witnesses are expected from Congress, the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, the governor's office of environmental affairs,
the state legislature, local business organizations, the oil
industry and environmental groups.

<HEAD>U.S. Launches World's Largest Private Phone System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government officially launched the
world's largest private telecommunications system with a three-way,
coast-to-coast conference call and electronic mail exchange on the
new FTS2000 network.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., on Wednesday made the first
telephone call, a discussion of day care facilities with a
Department of Veterans Affairs official in Indianapolis and a
Department of Energy official in Spokane, Wash.
   The brief, three-way conversation was piped into a loudspeaker
in the office of GSA's acting administrator, Richard G. Austin,
where a gaggle of relieved telephone and government representatives
applauded the connection.
   Austin, with a bit of fumbling with unfamiliar equipment, then
transmitted and received electronic messages with the two distant
callers that were displayed on a nearby television screen.
   Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee,
which oversaw development of the new Federal Telecommunications
System 2000 long-distance network, told the gathering the
state-of-the art system was a ``daring, innovative, massive leap
into the next century.''
   Austin said that when FTS2000 is fully implemented it will
provide a host of voice, video and high-speed data services to
1,300 federal sites nationwide in what the government says is the
largest network of its kind. The voice part of the system will be
fully in place by mid-1990.
   FTS2000 is expected to slice at least $200 million annually off
the government's $400 million yearly phone bill when it is fully in
place. Austin said savings should surpass $2 billion over the
10-year contract.
   ``We will exceed the $2 billion mark by a considerable
distance,'' Austin predicted.
   Austin, in an interview later, said that as government use of
FTS2000 increases and volume discounts kick in, ``We could see
upwards of $1 billion a year in hard-cash savings when the system
is fully operational.''
   Austin said the network, which actually began operation Friday,
when the first of 31 government sites were tied into FTS2000,
already had carried 150,000 telephone calls.
   He said 17 ``minor'' problems had been reported out of the
150,000 calls _ 10 numbers were reached incorrectly and there were
seven pre-programmed dialing errors.
   The 10-year, fixed-price contract, which GSA awarded last
December following a lengthy contract-letting process and
challenges by failed bidders, could be worth as much as $25 billion
to the two prime contractors, the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co. and US Sprint Communications Co.
   AT&amp;T has 60 percent of the network; Sprint 40 percent.
   Richard J. Lombardi, AT&amp;T vice president for federal systems,
said the contract was a ``model'' for government procurement.
   FTS2000 will serve nearly 1.3 million federal employees and is
expected to handle more than 300 million calls annually.
   The network utilizes digital and fiber-optic technology for
integrated voice, data and video services, including voice and
high-speed data transmission, electronic mail, high-speed facsimile
transmission and full-motion video conferencing.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Warns of Inadequate Prepartions for the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
campaigning anew for increased personal savings and long-term
investments, warned that the United States is inadequately
preparing for the future.
   Noting the high U.S. standard of living and relatively low rates
of inflation and unemployment, Brady said Wednesday that ``we must
not let our pride in these accomplishments distract us from
focusing on whether the united States is adquately preparing to
compete over the long-term in an integrated world economy ... we
are not adquately preparing for the future.''
   As he has previously in recent weeks, the Treasury secretary
called again for lower capital gains taxes and elimination of
double taxation of dividends to stimulate investment, and for ways
to expand tax incentives to encourage individual savings.
   Capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments and
other assets. In remarks prepared for a speech Wedneday night to
the American Council for Capital formation, Brady called for
taxation of only 70 percent of the gains _ which is what a bill
approved by the House would do for many taxpayers.
   Senate Democratic leaders want to replace the House cut with an
expansion of individual retirement accounts.
   Noting that the United States has higher capital gains rate than
most of its trading partners, Brady contended that ``we can't
expect to remain competitive when our tax structure provides so
little incentive for new investment.''
   He also called again for the elimination of double taxation of
dividends, but conceded options here are limited by the federal
budget deficit. At present, companies pay dividends to shareholders
out of after-tax profits and shareholders in turn are taxed on the
dividends as well.
   Brady said the administration continues to examine a range of
options for expanding the individual retirement accounts as a means
of encouraging Americans to increase their private saving.
   Americans' personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of
after-tax income _ fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and
increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year.
   As a result, Brady said, domestic sources of capital are
inadequate, making U.S. industry rely instead on more expensive
foreign investment.
   ``So ultimately, the higher cost of capital endangers the
competitive position of American companies,'' he continued.
   ``And if our capital costs are consistently higher than those of
our competitors over a long period of time, our leadership in the
international economy, and even our standard of living, will be
placed in jeopardy.''

<HEAD>Whitehall Halts Buyout Talks With Integrated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another sign of weakness in the nation's junk
bond market, Whitehall Financial Group has called off negotiations
to buy the core financial services businesses of struggling
Integrated Resources Inc.
   Privately held Whitehall said Wednesday it could not obtain
financing for the planned $310 million transaction, citing
``worsening conditions'' in the junk market and concerns over the
value of the businesses.
   The collapse dealt another blow to tottering Integrated, once a
high-flying real estate concern that is seeking to sell key assets
to pay some of its $1.75 billion in outstanding debt and avoid a
bankruptcy court filing.
   ``We're trying to recapture whatever asset values are in this
company and they're going to the creditors,'' Integrated Chairman
Stephen Weinroth said in an interview. ``We're not exactly trying
to snarf them off for ourselves.''
   Weinroth, who took a leave from the investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. to run Integrated, put the liquidation value
of the company at about $1.1 billion, depending on the price it
gets for the core businesses.
   New York-based Integrated has not paid any principle or interest
to its bondholders since June, when it said it would have to
default because of worsening troubles stemming from its difficulty
in diversifying out of real estate and into financial services.
   ``If the main firm they were talking to didn't have an ability
to finance, it's got to place into question any other potential
deals they have,'' said Tom Fendrich, a managing director at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., an investment-rating firm.
   Integrated stock fell 12{ cents Wednesday to close at $1.75 in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Integrated was trading
above $15 a share in June shortly before it announced it could not
make interest payments on nearly $1 billion in debt.
   Whitehall, a New York-based partnership, had agreed in August to
buy most of Integrated's core financial business.
   But it announced Tuesday it could not find financing for the
transaction and said Wednesday it suspended negotiations because of
``serious concerns regarding the value of the core companies and
the risks associated with the proposed acquisitions.''
   ``These same concerns and the worsening conditions the debt
financing markets made acceptable acquisition financing unavailable
despite Whitehall's willingness to provide substantial equity
funding,'' Whitehall said in a statement.
   The collapse comes amid growing unease in the nation's junk bond
market, which was sent reeling last month by financial woes at
retailer Campeau Corp. Also Wednesday, Ramada Inc. called off a
restructuring because it felt it couldn't complete a planned $400
million junk bond offering.
   Weinroth said Integrated was continuing negotiations with
another party to try to sell the subsidiaries but did not expect
them to fetch the originally hoped-for $450 milion. The company had
said it hoped to complete a sale by Sunday.
   Whitehall had agreed to buy Integrated Resources Life Insurance
Co. of Des Moines, Iowa; Integrated Resources Equity Corp. of
Englewood, Colo., and New York, its principal investment products
distributor; Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.; Resources
Trust Co.; and Financial Clearing Services.
   After the spinoff, Integrated's main business would be
management of existing public and private limited partnerships and
real estate investment trusts.
   Whitehall is half-owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of
the Bronfman family of Canada, heirs to the Seagram Ltd. distilling
fortune, and half-owned by the Moross family of London, which has
extensive financial services interests. Whitehall has holdings in
life insurance and property and casualty brokerage.
   Other Integrated businesses include Capitol Life Insurance Co.
of Denver, its tax-sheltered annuity business, its ordinary life
insurance business and United Resources Insurance Services Inc. of
Santa Ana, Calif.

<HEAD>Two Plans Filed To Emerge From Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. on Wednesday
filed two alternate plans for emerging from Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws.
   The first plan is similar to the proposal the Pittsburgh-based
appliance maker filed in August. The exception is that the latest
plan does not provide for a stock sale to raise $140 million in
cash to pay off some creditors.
   Under the revised plan, those creditors would receive bonds
instead of cash.
   Allegheny International said it will offer its second plan as a
backup if the first one is rejected in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The backup plan calls for the issuance of shares of common and
preferred stock in the reorganized company to pay off most general
creditors. Exceptions would be creditors of Allegheny
International's Sunbeam unit and a secured group of bank lenders,
which will get cash, the company said.
   Allegheny International has a loan commitment of $400 million
from Wells Fargo Bank to make those cash payments and fund
continued operating expenses.
   Robert Sable, an attorney for the unsecured creditors, said his
clients will not support either plan.
   Court hearings on the proposed plans begin next month.

<HEAD>Citing Junk Bond Market Woes, Ramada Halts Restructuring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. said it postponed a restructuring
that includes selling its 825 hotels and giving itself a new name
because of the continuing upheaval in the nation's junk bond market.
   The hotel chain on Wednesday canceled a $400 million debt
offering that was a prerequisite for the restructuring and said it
could offer ``no assurance'' the deal would be completed.
   Ramada earlier this year said it would sell its worldwide hotel
business to New World Hotel Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong for about
$540 million and rename itself Aztar Corp., a company that would
operate its Nevada and New Jersey casinos.
   The deal was conditioned on arranging $400 million in financing
for Aztar. But Ramada said it decided not to proceed because of a
junk bond market tailspin that began when retailer Campeau Corp.
announced financial problems last month.
   Ramada's stock plunged Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
losing $2.25 to close at $11.
   Nicholas Meris, first vice president of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in Phoenix, said difficulties in the market ``have
made it hard to create new financing.''
   ``(Ramada) had a plan that they believed was viable at the time,
and it was, but now they are going to have to sit down and come up
with something new,'' he said.
   Also Wednesday, Whitehall Financial Group cited the junk bond
jitters in canceling a planned $310 million purchase of several
units of struggling Integrated Services Inc. In August, Ohio
Mattress Co. withdrew a $475 million junk bond offering after
investors shunned the securities.
   The Ramada deal included issuing $230 million in subordinated
debt and $170 million in first-mortgage notes secured by the
TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort in Atlantic City, N.J.
   TropWorld is one of three gaming properties Ramada intends to
continue to operate after restructuring. The others are the
Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and the Ramada Express
Hotel Casino in Laughlin, Nev.
   Ramada announced Oct. 3 it would consider issuing warrants for
10 percent of Aztar stock as part of the bond offering to make it
more attractive.
   Ramada said it plans to develop a revised restructuring plan but
said it ``can offer no assurance that a restructuring will be
completed and it cannot specify the timing of the next steps.''
   In a new restructuring, Ramada said it would modify a planned
payment to shareholders of $7 per share and a half-share of stock.
Ramada also plans to seek an extension of a Nov. 30 deadline for
the hotel sale to New World.
   Shareholders and gaming officials in Nevada and New Jersey would
have to approve an amended plan.

<HEAD>Dollar Keeps Rising, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar kept rising against the Japanese yen
today despite central bank efforts to stop it, and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange reacted with a selling wave that caused the second largest
one-day drop this year in its key index.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 445.02 points, or 1.26
percent, to 34,795.05. The decline was second this year only to a
489.90-point drop on June 15 to 32,913.09.
   Today marked the index's first closing below 35,000 since Sept.
25.
   Meanwhile, the dollar gained 0.70 yen from Wednesday's
143.90-yen close, ending at 144.60 yen. It opened at 144.25 yen and
ranged between 143.70 yen and 144.60 yen.
   The dollar had climbed 1.67 yen on Wednesday, the day the Bank
of Japan raised the nation's official discount rate by 0.5
percentage point to 3.75 percent. Higher interest rates usually
tend to make a currency more attractive to investors, boosting its
value.
   ``The hike by 0.5 percentage points was too small to have much
power in the market to reverse the dollar's uptrend,'' said a
trader with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Gaps between Japan's discount rate and those of other
countries with major currencies are still wide, and the dollar
remains a good investment,'' he said.
   Japan's discount rate is the lowest among the Group of Seven
industrial nations. It compares with 6 percent in West Germany and
7 percent in the United States.
   The Bank of Japan also was selling dollars today in an effort to
check the dollar's rise, but the amount was unknown. The central
bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   ``Unless the United States eases its credit, the dollar's
bullish trend will continue,'' the trader said, ``although the
United States would not change its policy just for the sake of
stability in currency exchange.''
   On the stock market, ``the Nikkei plunged partly because of the
discount rate hike yesterday,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a stock
analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``What hit the market most, however, was the fact that it didn't
work,'' he said, noting the dollar had continued to rise.
   Nikko Securities dealer Masaya Hashizume said investors were
afraid of another discount rate hike sometime soon, believing the
central bank could not sell dollars endlessly in its efforts to end
the dollar's rise.
   Other dealers said investors sold issues in anticipation of
further price declines amid uncertainties about interest rate
movements. The discount rate, the fee charged for commercial bank
borrowings from the central bank, in turn affects other interest
rates.
   Trading was moderate, with first section trading estimated at
650 million shares, down from Wednesday's 750 million.
   Prices were lower across the board, dealers said.

<TEXT>
   Executives at many major corporations travel
separately to reduce the risk that top management would be wiped
out in a fatal accident, officials said the day after three Trump
Organization executives died in a helicopter crash.
   On Tuesday, three of developer Donald Trump's highest ranking
gaming executives died when their helicopter crashed en route from
New York City to Atlantic City.
   One of the executives oversaw all casino operations in Atlantic
City for Trump, another headed the $1 billion Taj Mahal casino
under construction on the Boardwalk, and the third was senior vice
president of one of Trump's operating casinos.
   ``In general terms, top executives would not travel on the same
aircraft,'' said Peter J. Peterson, a spokesman for General Motors
Corp. ``In the interest of continuity at the highest levels of
management, you limit your risk.''
   Not all corporations, however, have policies about their
executives traveling together, said Francis H. Goranin, the
immediate past president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
   ``Some companies do; some companies don't. There is no set
rule,'' he said, adding that concern over executive safety and
travel had increased since the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 last
December.
   Trump Organization spokesman Dan Klores said Wednesday that
Trump at one point planned to be on the helicopter that crashed in
a heavily wooded area along New Jersey's Garden State Parkway, but
changed his mind.
   Klores said he was unaware of any travel policy in the Trump
Organization.
   Even those companies with such policies, however, said having
executives part company at the airline terminal is difficult to
enforce unless the officers themselves are concerned.
   A 1988 survey by Runzheimer International Ltd., a Northbrook,
Ill., management consulting firm, found that 56 percent of 108
companies responding to a survey had policies on employee travel.
   Sixty-eight percent of the companies with policies include
limits on executives traveling together. Those limits include air
travel at 93 percent of the companies, and ground restrictions at
27 percent of the companies.
   Fifteen percent of the companies with limitations place
restrictions on executives checking in to the same hotel.
   Bradford Burris, executive vice president with Runzheimer, said
most companies usually can't police their executives to make sure
they adhere to travel policies.
   ``It is a policy that is difficult to enforce unless the
travelers themselves are concerned,'' Burris said.
   ``You'd never know it is adhered to until the plane crashes,''
he said.
   Some companies' limits reach into the middle-management level.
   ``We restrict the number of divisional people that can travel
together,'' said Robert T. McDonough, a spokesman for the Upjohn
Co., a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``We
basically say that our most senior executives will not travel
together at all.''
   Peterson said GM's policy also included division heads.
   ``It would just appear to be good judgment,'' he said.
   At AT&amp;T, ``our chairman does not fly with either of our first
vice chairmen,'' said Lynn Newman, a spokeswoman for the
Bedminster, N.J.-based company. ``We don't want more than two of
our senior managers on the same flight.''
   As with most other companies who discussed their policies with
The Associated Press, Ms. Newman said AT&amp;T's restrictions did not
result from a particular incident.
   One company, however, declined to discuss policy for security
reasons.
   ``Our policy is not to discuss publicly the company's travel
policy,'' said Harold Carr, a spokesman for the Boeing Corp. in
Seattle. ``We have executives traveling around the world every day
of the week.''
   And the policy goes far beyond the corporate world.
   Even when appearing at the same function, President Bush and
Vice President Quayle take separate planes.

<HEAD>Report: Rural Workers More Likely to be Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family with a working head of the household
is nearly twice as likely to be poor in rural America as in the
country's metropolitan areas, says a policy research group.
   ``Many of the non-metro poor keep their end of society's
bargain: they find employment and try to earn their way out of
poverty. But they are unable to do so,'' the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities said in a report released Wednesday.
   The substantially higher poverty rates among rural working poor
were found among both whites and blacks, as well as full-time and
part-time workers, the report said.
   In 1987, the most recent year for which data was available, the
overall poverty rate in families in which the household head works
at least part time was 10 percent in rural areas, compared with 5.7
percent in metropolitan areas.
   For blacks, the rural poverty rate was 27.8 percent, compared
with 15.5 percent in metropolitan areas. Among white families, the
poverty rate was 8.5 percent in rural areas, compared with 4.5
percent in metropolitan areas.
   The 1987 poverty line defined by the federal government was an
annual income of $11,611 for a family of four.
   The report said there were significantly higher poverty rates in
rural areas even though ``a substantial majority of the
non-metropolitan poor live in a household with at least one
worker.''
   About 9.1 million Americans in rural areas lived in poverty in
1987, the study said. Of those, an estimate 5.8 million lived in a
household where at least one household member worked during the
year.
   In 1987, said the report, 70.5 percent of the heads of rural
poor families who were not ill, disabled or retired were people who
worked for all or part of the year, with 24.3 percent working full
time year-round.
   ``The poverty rate among workers in non-metro areas rose sharply
during the back-to-back recessions of the early 1980s and decline
during the ensuing economic recovery,'' the report said. ``Despite
the lengthy recovery, however, poverty rates among non-metro
workers are higher now than they were during the recovery of the
late 1970s.''
   One reason rural job growth has lagged behind job growth in
metropolitan areas is that non-metro area employment is more
concentrated in industries that are experiencing decline, the
report said.
   ``In particular, non-metro unemployment is more concentrated in
two areas _ resource industries (mining and agriculture) and
routine manufacturing _ that have encountered substantial problems
in the 1980s.''
   The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit research
organization that studies government spending and the programs and
policy issues that have an impact on low-income Americans.

<TEXT>
   A Rhode Island securities dealer and
investment adviser has been barred from associating with the
National Association of Securities Dealers for allegedly bilking
$1.4 million from investors in six states.
   Edward E. Dockray was also fined $700,000 by NASD, the
self-regulatory body of the securities industry, The Providence
Journal-Bulletin reported today.
   ``This effectively kicks him out of the business,'' said Willis
H. Riccio, vice president and director of NASD's district office in
Boston. ``Most brokers are either members of NASD or the stock
exchange, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission honors
the NASD bar.''
   NASD alleges Dockray ran a fraudulent securities scheme that
enticed 140 people to invest more than $1.4 million in a ``white
board,'' an electronic bulletin board and copying machine for
hotels and convention centers.
   The NASD disciplinary complaint charged that Dockray and his
partner, Raymond D. Pollard of Missouri City, Texas, ``misused and
or misappropriated'' the investments.
   Dockray, 48, could not be reached for comment. NASD said he
neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but agreed to the
sanctions and findings, thereby avoiding an administrative trial.
   Pollard is not a NASD member and is not subject to NASD
sanctions.
   Dockray has denied allegations in a complaint filed against him
by the Massachusetts Division of Securities. A hearing on those
allegations is set for November, said Paul Glickman, chief of
enforcement.
   The Massachusetts complaint charges that the scheme was run from
May 1987 to April 1988, while Dockray worked as the branch manager
of Equities International Securities in North Providence.
   According to NASD, Massachusetts investors accounted for
$805,000 of the money taken, while $110,000 was taken from
Connecticut investors; $420,000 from California; $85,000 from Rhode
Island; $10,000 from Utah and $5,000 from New Hampshire.
   Investors were promised that their $5,000 investments were fully
guaranteed and would return $200 a month for 48 months.
   The Massachusetts complaint maintains only one white board was
ever purchased and none were placed in hotels for rental.
   Dockray had run several investment firms in Rhode Island until
his license was terminated in May. He had been registered with NASD
since 1981.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Providence said it is
investigating.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Declines Overall, Rises Against U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States
widened in September, although rising purchases abroad reduced
Japan's overall trade surplus from year-ago levels for the fifth
consecutive month, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
   Total exports exceeded imports by $7.24 billion, down from $7.76
billion in September 1988. The surplus was up, however, from $3.44
billion in August.
   Although September imports from the United States surged 12.3
percent from a year ago to $3.88 billion, Japan's surplus with the
United States rose to $4.78 billion from $4.65 billion a year
earlier. U.S. imports from Japan rose 6.8 percent to $8.67 billion.
   It was the first increase in three months in Japan's surplus
with the United States.
   On a global basis, Japan's exports rose 4.8 percent from
September 1988 to $24.29 billion while imports climbed 10.6 percent
to $17.05 billion. The import growth was down from the 15.8 percent
between August 1988 and August 1989.
   While analysts say they do not anticipate a major export
expansion soon, some cited fears that the yen's continued weakening
against the U.S. dollar, which makes Japanese goods cheaper abroad,
could add to already firm foreign demand for Japan's products.
   The weakening yen also makes Japanese purchases abroad more
expensive, but government officials have said demand in Japan is
robust.
   Japan registered a trade surplus of $2.02 billion with the
European Economic Community in September, up from $2.01 billion a
year earlier. Exports rose 4.4 percent to $4.08 billion, while
imports increased 8.7 percent to $2.06 billion.

<TEXT>
   Despite regulatory vigilance and significant
government cleanup efforts that brought the Great Lakes back from
an environmental crisis in the 1970s, the lakes may still pose a
health threat, U.S. and Canadian experts say.
   Accumulations of toxic contaminants are poisoning wildlife and
may reach up the food chain to the 35 million people who live in
the region, according to a report, ``Great Lakes, Great Legacy?,''
released Wednesday at news conferences held simultaneously in
Chicago and Toronto.
   ``Our study concludes that the Great Lakes environment is sick,
and it's no longer getting better,'' said David Runnalls, an
associate director at the Institute for Research on Public Policy
in Ottawa, Canada, which co-authored the study.
   The report said the Great Lakes cleanup that began in the early
1970s has reduced the amount of human waste and toxic industrial
garbage dumped into the lakes, but has not prevented continued
buildups of some dangerous chemicals, including cancer-causing
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, as well as pesticides that
leach into the lakes.
   ``Millions of people in the Great Lakes (region) are exposed to
the hazardous chemicals, drink them in the contaminated water, eat
them concentrated in the flesh of the fish and breathe them in the
air,'' said Jeff Leonard, vice president of The Conservation
Foundation of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit group that produced the
report with the IRPP.
   ``We know that these continuous exposures have serious adverse
effects on the wildlife of the Great Lakes region,'' Leonard said
from Toronto.
   ``We fear increasingly that humans, especially pregnant women
and children, may be affected as well.''
   Leonard said researchers do not know for certain what the risk
is to people from the toxic contamination in the Great Lakes, but
the report recommends that state health departments need to
reexamine and strengthen warnings about fish consumption.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, praised the report at the Chicago news
conference, but said his agency was not prepared to say that
states' recommendations on fish consumption are out-of-date or
inappropriate.
   State officials in the Great Lakes region provide advice on fish
consumption based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards
for commercial fish. They are based on findings that certain types
of fish, particularly bigger and older ones, are more likely to
contain dangerous contaminants than others.
   The four states along Lake Michigan have advised that women and
children should not eat medium-sized fish and that no one should
eat very large fish from the lake.
   Reilly said the report shows that ``as a society we are not
moving fast enough'' to deal with pollution problems in the Great
Lakes.
   But he disagreed with report authors who said the United States
has not done enough to meet its obligations under the Great Lakes
Water Quality Agreement that it signed with Canada in 1978.
   The goal of zero discharge of toxic substances, set for the
Great Lakes in the 1978 agreement and as yet unmet, is one of seven
``principles for action'' outlined in the report.
   Others include increased monitoring and research to correct
``grossly inadequate'' feedback on the environmental quality of the
region, and an emphasis on prevention of pollution ahead of cleanup.
   The Great Lakes _ Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario and Superior _
border eight states and Canada, and hold 20 percent of the world's
fresh surface water.

<UNK>Coca-Cola Reports 22 Percent Rise in Quarterly Income</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. reported today that the sale of its
bottled water business and increased international soft drink
volume helped boost its third-quarter profit 22 percent from the
same period a year ago.
   Net income for the three-month period totaled $361.3 million, or
$1.03 a share, compared with $295.6 million, or 81 cents a share,
in the same 1988 period, the Atlanta-based soft drink company said.
Net operating revenues rose 8 percent to $2.3 billion from $$2.1
billion.
   For the first nine months of 1989, net income was up 19 percent
to $966.6 million, or $2.73 a share, from $809.2 million, or $2.20
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $6.7 billion
from $6.3 billion.
   The results included a non-recurring after-tax gain of about $36
million, or 10 cents per share, from the sale of the bottled water
business, the company said.
   A much larger after-tax gain _ $530 million or $1.53 per common
share _ is expected to be added to fourth-quarter earnings because
of the sale of Coca-Cola's 53.8 million shares of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. to Sony Corp., company officials said. The
Coca-Cola board approved the sale Oct. 2.
   Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta said third-quarter earnings also
were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft
drink syrups and concentrates. International syrup sales were up 14
percent, but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2
percent during the three months ended Sept. 30, he said.
   Case sales of soft drinks in the United States were even with
the previous year.
   The Coca-Cola Foods subsidiary, which markets Minute Maid
brands, reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice
volume and a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for
the quarter.
   The company also reported that it completed a 40 million-share
stock repurchase plan during the third quarter. The plan was
initiated in 1987.
   The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an
additional 20 million shares through 1991, the company said.

   The stock market settled back a bit today,
extending the shallow decline of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.05 points over

   Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning. But
analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for September.
   Adavnce estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that
measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent
and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through
the summer.
   ``Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings

   ``Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up,
but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down ] at 52[;

<HEAD>Grain Futures Rise Slightly Ahead of Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices were
slightly higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade in
cautious trading in advance of the Agriculture Department crop
report.
   The USDA is expected to forecast larger corn and soybean crops
than last month's estimates of 1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and
7.32 billion bushels of corn.
   The report is scheduled for release at 2 p.m. Central time.
   Today's slight early gains extended Wednesday's modest advance.
   The markets drew further support from the National Weather
Service's latest six-to-10-day forecast, which predicts a chance
for normal rainfall in the eastern Corn Belt in the latter half of
next week, although the western Corn Belt is expected to remain dry.
   The unusually dry weather of the past three weeks has kept the
Midwestern crop harvest moving at brisk pace and put pressure on
the crop futures markets.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1{ cents higher
with December at $4.05} a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to
} cent higher with December at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to { cent higher with December at $1.41 a bushel; and soybeans were
{ cent lower to 2 cents higher with November at $5.54\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October
at 73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent
higher with October at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with October at 47.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
February at 47.95 cents a pound.
   Cattle and pork-belly futures advanced on Wednesday while hog

<HEAD>Field of Dreams: Tracking Genes in Corn to Fight $400 Million Scourge</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKENY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After raising millions of insects to feast
on corn plants in test fields this summer, researchers are
surveying the damage for genetic clues to fight the $400 million
pests.
   Using the same techniques that enable law enforcement agencies
to identify the ``genetic fingerprints'' of criminals, they are
trying to pinpoint pest-resistant genes on corn chromosomes.
   The aim not only is to breed corn that resists infestation by
the European corn borer, but also to use the findings to protect
corn and other crops from a wide range of pests and diseases, says
Michael Lee, an assistant professor of agronomy at Iowa State
University.
   ``You end up with an agricultural system less dependent on
chemical control of insects,'' Lee says. ``A more stable
agricultural system.''
   If scientists can map the location of genes for traits such as
pest resistance, they can tackle more complex genetic traits, such
as those that could increase crop yields with less reliance on
chemical fertilizers, he says.
   Lee is working in cooperation with academic and government
scientists at the Corn Insects Research Unit of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture at Ankeny, a community between Des Moines and Ames,
where Iowa State is located.
   He has a $160,000 grant for a four-year genetic study. The USDA
contributed about $10,000 of its $477,000 budget from the corn
research unit this year to produce the insects, place them on tens
of thousands of plants and record data, according to the
Agricultural Research Service.
   At laboratories in the midst of corn fields, about 3 million egg
masses of 25 corn borer eggs each were produced this year and kept
in Mason jars. The larvae were raised in a mixture of ground corn
grits and later placed in plastic dispensers that released them in
batches of 60.
   Typically, 240 larvae are placed on a corn plant, but in some
cases as many as 900 of the pests are let loose on one plant. There
are six to 10 plants in each of the more than 14,000 test plots in
Ankeny and Ames.
   ``Nothing escapes infestation,'' says Bud Guthrie, research
leader at the Ankeny corn insects research unit.
   But researchers say there is no threat that a feeding frenzy of
insects will be unleashed on farmers' fields from the test plots.
   The larvae cannot survive if they fall off the plant, Lee said.
   ``They stay where you put them. They never reach adult stage,''
he says.
   Adult moths do not damage corn, but lay eggs in fields that
hatch and can decimate crops.
   The corn borer causes damage when the first generation of larvae
eats corn leaves and the second generation eats the protective
sheath around the stalk at the time of pollination, burrowing into
the plant. The damage weakens the plants and causes them to topple
before the corn can be harvested.
   First found in this country in 1917, the European corn borer was
a seemingly unbeatable scourge. In the 1930s, entire fields were
laid waste.
   Guthrie estimates that in Iowa fields this past summer, where
corn typically is sown 25,000 plants to an acre, there was one
borer for every other plant. That's down from an average of eight a
plant 40 years ago, when fields were not so thick with corn.
   Development of hybrid corn strains and spraying has helped
reduce the devastation, but it still costs U.S. farmers $400
million a year in losses and control efforts, the USDA says. In
Iowa, the leading corn producing state, the corn borer costs
farmers about $100 million a year.
   This summer, in test plots near the laboratory, corn with
brittle stalks and leaves that looked like they'd been raked by
shotgun fire stood beside plants that would have been at home in
any healthy field.
   Even the highly susceptible plants look good compared with
pictures of the crop devastation of the 1930s.
   ``Compared with the old times, the entire acreage is
resistant,'' Guthrie says.
   This fall, researchers are splitting each plant by hand,
measuring the tunnels produced by the insects.
   Scientists already have identified eight corn genes that resist
leaf feeding by the first generation of larvae and seven genes that
condition the corn plant to resist the second generation. While
those genes are not on the same chromosome, says Guthrie,
scientists know which of the 10 pairs of chromosome arms are
involved with those genes.
   The problem is, each arm contains tens of thousands of genes.
   Using X-ray film and small amounts of radioactivity, the
scientists are looking at DNA samples from each of the plants to
detect genetic differences between the corn that resists borers and
is susceptible to the pests.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic building block of
life. It contains the genetic code and transmits the hereditary
pattern for reproduction.
   A technique, known as restriction fragment length polymorphism,
is used to detect differences in the DNA sequence among corn plants.
   ``This is exactly the same technique as genetic fingerprinting.
What they're trying to do with the prison population, we're trying
to do with plants,'' says Lee.
   Once the genes are mapped, the information can be used in
selection programs for the development of corn. Seed companies
could use the information to develop new hybrids, a process that
takes about five years.
   ``The first thing we hope to establish is a more precise
location of the genes,'' Lee says. ``We'll know the location of the
some of the genes next summer.''

   Market suspicion surrounding Donald Trump's $7
billion offer for the parent of American Airlines is misplaced and
incorrect, say some airline analysts and Trump officials.
   ``Everybody that I speak to says that the Street (the financial
community) doesn't believe it, but I think people should give
(Trump) more credit,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   Nevertheless, Buttrick agreed with other analysts that
skepticism over Trump's intentions and general profit-taking
combined Wednesday to drive down the price of AMR Corp. stock by
$4.25 to close at $97.12{, the lowest level since the billionaire's
$120-per-share offer was revealed a week ago.
   More than 2.6 million AMR shares changed hands Wednesday in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In midday trading today, AMR was up $1.75 a share at $98.87{ in
fairly active dealings.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that representatives of
Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass were willing to help AMR fend
off Trump. Group officials refused to discuss the report, although
Bass has been mentioned from the first as a possible ``white
knight.''
   The market ``may not believe it,'' Trump attorney Jack Nusbaum
said Wednesday, but ``he has not sold his shares, and doesn't plan
to. This is not a stock play.''
   Officials of Fort Worth-based AMR have refused to discuss the
bid for the parent of the nation's largest airline, and Nusbaum
said there had been no meetings between the two sides.
   Until there is some visible action, industry analyst David
Pizzimenti said the softness in AMR's price is likely to continue.
   ``I think that until you see some concrete kind of action by
either party, ... the stock will continue to trade at a discount''
to Trump's offer, said Pizzimenti, who works for Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York.
   AMR, considered one of the nation's best-run carriers, has said
it will consider the offer ``in due course,'' but gave no
indication when it might respond.
   There has been speculation that AMR may seek a competing bid
either from an employee-management group or a friendly buyer, that
it would push Congress for quick legislation to require government
review of airline takeovers, or that it would restructure and pay a
special dividend.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee has
approved a bill giving the transportation secretary authority to
review takeovers, but the bill is not scheduled for debate. A
similar bill has been introduced in the House, but is far from
being adopted.
   Legislative concern has centered over the use of debt to finance
the recent wave of airline takeovers, fearing that maintenance
might suffer while companies work to pay off debt.
   While Congress considers the legislation, Nusbaum said Trump has
received Justice Department clearance to pursue the offer. Under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the government must review the antitrust
implications of certain transactions involving the acquisition of
$15 million worth of a company.
   Meanwhlie Wednesday, the airline's largest union said it had
retained a financial consultant to advise it on any possible buyout.
   Ed Koziatek, vice president of the Transport Workers Union, said
officials had had no contact with American officials, but were
seeking financial advice. The union represents 33,000 ground and
support workers.
   Earlier, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants said
its officials were meeting with advisers, and the Allied Pilots
Association is reported to have retained an adviser.
   Meanwhile, one of AMR's large institutional stockholders said it
would hold onto its stock.
   ``We think the risk-reward is good at this point,'' said Gerald
R. Smith, senior vice president of Aetna Equity Investors in
Hartford, Conn. ``The worst case is that AMR will do something to
make the stock worth more than it was selling before offer. We peg
that in the low 90s. The upside we don't think is limited to $120
necessarily.
   ``We knew that when the offer was made ... that there was going
to be a bumpy road and the stock was going to fluctuate,'' he said.
   Smith said Aetna holds a substantial amount of AMR stock, but
would not be specific.
   Another institutional investor, the Windsor Fund, said it sold
its AMR holdings recently, cashing in on the higher prices since
Trump's bid.

   A nine-foot-tall, male ostrich is a strange
sight in the West Texas oil fields, especially when it's trying to
scare interlopers and attract females, but to Cooper Campbell,
there's gold in them there quills.
   ``Careful,'' he said, handing a visitor an off-white, pebbly
surfaced, 3{-pound ostrich egg the size of a human baby's head.
``That's worth $1,500.''
   If the egg is fertile, and the embryo survives its 42-day
incubation, and the chick survives the critical first three months
_ the odds of everything going right are about 50 percent at best _
the 2-foot-tall baby bird can command more than $5,000.
   A pair of fertile, productive adults can bring $30,000 to
$50,000.
   Campbell is manager of the Yellow Rose Ostrich Ranch south of
Odessa, part of a business taking its first steps in the United
States.
   Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country,
especially in Texas, Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest, although
the hardy birds can be raised in almost every state and even above
the Arctic Circle in Canada.
   Just a few years ago, ostriches in the United States could be
found only in zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors.
Now the U.S. commercial ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said
Tom Mantzel, executive director of the Fort Worth-based American
Ostrich Association.
   ``It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip,'' said
Mantzel, who promotes the ostrich industry with preacher zeal.
About 500 ranchers belong to the organization, three-quarters of
them in Texas. Most of the rest are in Oklahoma.
   Mantzel estimated the country's adult ostrich population will
have to reach at least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to
slaughter them for their hide, feathers and meat. Until then, which
he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the birds are more valuable
as breeders.
   The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of
clothing and luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. South
Africans and Europeans eat the meat, which looks, feels and tastes
like beef and is low in cholesterol and fat.
   Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh
about 300 pounds and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide,
feathers and meat are worth $400 to $500, Mantzel said.
   Ostrich ranchers are getting a boost from global politics since
virtually all ostrich products come from South Africa.
   Because of American economic sanctions aimed at protesting South
Africa's apartheid racial segregation system, U.S. consumers can't
buy ostrich hides directly from South Africa and must buy treated
skins from third countries.
   Mantzel believes American ostriches will mean big business, and
that Americans will develop an appetite for the meat just as they
have developed a taste for catfish and sushi.
   Americans already have developed a liking for ostrich leather.
Highest-grade, treated hide costs about $28 a square foot, said Joe
Lama, buyer for the Tony Lama Boot Co. in El Paso.
   The average ostrich will yield about five boots made from the
best-looking skin, called full quill, Lama said. About two pairs
can be made from the bird's lesser-quality hide, whose
characteristic bumps are smaller and less prominent than in
full-quill leather.
   Before a cowboy sticks his feet into a pair of ostrich-skin
boots, though, the bird has to hatch and grow up. That's Campbell's
business.
   The laying season lasts from about March to October, with hens
laying an egg about every other day. After 42 days in an incubator
and hatchery, the hatchling is ready, sometimes getting a little
human help to peck itself out of the eggshell, which is about as
thick as a nickel.
   A hatchling weighs about 1{ pounds and can stand up and walk
almost immediately. Its gray feathers look and feel like coarse
hair.
   Days after hatching, chicks already can run. They grow eight to
10 inches a month during their first few months. They can reproduce
at about 2 to 3 years of age. Ostriches in the wild can live to be
75.
   Because of their speed, they have few predators.
   ``They can sustain 35 to 40 miles an hour for five or six
miles,'' Cooper said, adding that lions and even cheetahs have
trouble catching the birds in the wild and almost always go for
something more attainable.
   Contrary to popular belief, they don't stick their heads in the
sand. If they're cornered or don't feel like running, they can
kick. Mantzel said the birds have been known to kick coyotes to
death on the American range.
   A 20-acre tract of range can sustain 50 or 60 ostriches, which
forage and eat pellet feed.
   ``I tell ranchers, `Just set aside 1 percent of your land, two
or three acres, and raise ostriches,''' Mantzel said. ``I say,
`Instead of spending a dollar and a dime to make a dollar, try
something you can make a profit on.' Someday, it will be a barnyard
industry like sheep, cattle and goats.''

<HEAD>Four Americans Share In Nobels For Physics And Chemistry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS Altman's citizenship from Canadian to U.S.; new throughout
with added explanation of chemistry prize. Also moving on general news

   The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded
today to two Americans and a West German whose work led to the
atomic clock used as an international standard. The chemistry prize
went to two Americans for the discovery of surprising properties of
the genetic material RNA.
   The physics award was given to Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard
University for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic
clock, and to Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington and
Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for a method to isolate single atoms
and make exacting measurements of them.
   The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech, 41, of
the University of Colorado, and Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale
University. They showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s
that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic messenger, could
rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions.
   Their discovery ``will probably provide a new tool for gene
technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral
infections,'' the Swedish Academy said.
   Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey, 74. The other half
will be shared by the German-born Dehmelt, 67, of the University of
Washington in Seattle, and Paul, 76 of the University of Bonn.
   ``All three of them have developed exact methods of measurement,
which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force
us to reconsider some basic physical laws, especially regarding
time and space,'' said Ingvar Lindgren, chairman of the awarding
committee.
   Each Nobel Prize is worth $469,000.
   Informed by The Associated Press that he had won the prize,
Ramsey said, ``Are you sure?'' In an interview, he said, ``It feels
great. I'm just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people with
whom I'm sharing the prize.''
   Cech, reached in Boston, said, ``I am obviously excited about
it. It was something that everyone has been telling me would
happen, but I had no way of knowing when.
   ``My main emotion is that this is a great thing for the
University of Colorado and the state of Colorado,'' he said. ``This
is not the sort of event that happens annually in the mountains the
way it does in Boston. That gives me a really good feeling.''
   The Canadian-born Altman, reached by telephone in New Haven,
Conn., said, ``I'm very happy. I'm very grateful to all my
colleagues and co-workers, teachers and family.''
   Ramsey developed a way to study the structure of atoms by
exciting them to different energy levels using two oscillating
electromagnetic fields.
   That led to the development of the hydrogen maser, a laser-like
device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed
determination of their internal structure.
   Another application was the cesium atomic clock, in which cesium
atoms are excited to higher levels. Since 1967, the second has been
defined as the time during which the cesium atom makes
9,192,631,770 oscillations.
   ``I was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and
nuclei, and ... it was apparent this was a very, very stable
clock,'' Ramsey said. ``It's a very valuable application. It gets
used in radio astronomy, navigation, satellite navigation, many
other purposes.''
   Dehmelt and Paul were recognized for the development of the
ion-trap technique for separating single ions _ electrically
charged atoms _ according to their weight. The two developed
similar techniques independently, the Swedish Academy said.
   Cech and Altman forced chemistry books to be rewritten when they
showed independently that RNA, or ribonucleic acid, could be a
catalyst, or trigger, for chemical reactions.
   The researchers found that RNA has the rudimentary ability to
reproduce itself, suggesting that the first living things might
have arisen from RNA rather than DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, the
principal carrier of hereditary information in plants, animals and
bacteria.
   When Altman discovered in 1978 that RNA was necessary for a
catalytic reaction in the cell, the discovery was met with
disbelief and ``he could hardly believe it himself,'' said Bertil
Andersson, a member of the academy.
   Four years later Cech demonstrated that the RNA molecule was not
only necessary to the reaction, but could trigger the reaction by
itself, without associated proteins that had been thought essential.
   The academy said the discoveries of the two scientists may
provide a method to destroy harmful RNA molecules that cause
infections, such as the common cold.
   Cech, born in Chicago, has been at the University of Colorado in
Boulder since 1983. He received his doctorate from the University
of California, Berkeley.
   Altman, who was born in Montreal, earned his doctorate at the
University of Colorado, studied at Harvard and Cambridge, and moved
to Yale in 1971.
   Ramsey has been at Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., since 1947.
Dehmelt, a U.S. citizen, was born in Goerlitz, now in East Germany,
came as a student to Duke University in North Carolina in 1952 and
has been at the University of Washington in Seattle since 1955.
   Paul was born in Lorenzkirch, Germany. He became professor of
experimental physics at the University of Bonn in 1952.
   Americans have shared or won the chemistry prize 36 times among
the 112 times it has been awarded since 1901.
   Last year's winners were three West Germans, Johann Deisenhofer,
Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel, for their work in photosynthesis.
   Fifty-two of the 134 recipients of the physics prize have been
Americans. Last year's winners were were Americans Leon Lederman,
Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger.

   The stock market drifted lower today, extending
the shallow decline of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.05 points over
the last two sessions, slipped 8.20 to 2,765.16 by noontime on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 469 up, 751 down and
558 unchanged.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning. But
analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for September.
   Adavnce estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that
measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent
and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through
the summer.
   ``Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings
in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed Jack Lavery at
Merrill Lynch in his latest market commentary.
   ``Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up,
but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down ] at 52[;
Philip Morris, down ] at 44|; Sears Roebuck, down [ at 42];
McDonald's, down [ at 30, and General Electric, down \ at 57~.
   GE reported third-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share, up from 90
cents in the like period a year ago.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.67 to 197.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .34 at 395.34.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.59 million shares at

   Afternoons in the little village of Golf are
lulled by the soft hum of electric carts and the pleasant snap of a
good tee shot.
   Not far beyond the back nine, however, the sounds change: trees
cracking under diesel bulldozers and hammers banging out another
clubhouse.
   These are the rhythms of golf in recent years, reflecting a
dramatic surge in the sport's popularity that has spurred a boom in
new golf courses and country club-style housing tracts around the
nation, led by Sunbelt states such as Florida, Texas and South
Carolina.
   Meanwhile, tourism groups, golf schools and clothing
manufacturers are seeking a share of the $20 billion domestic
industry.
   The 32-year-old community of Golf, homesteaded in lonely
woodlands southwest of West Palm Beach as one of the nation's first
golf-oriented developments, is now surrounded by new courses and
billboards promising more.
   ``Now they call this area Golf Lane,'' said John Mosher, manager
of the 131-home village that surrounds an 18-hole course. ``It's
like they can't build enough courses.''
   Actually, they may fall considerably short of demand, the
National Golf Foundation says.
   The Jupiter, Fla.-based trade group predicts nearly 4,000 new
courses may be necessary by the end of the century to accommodate
the burgeoning number of players, from hackers to tournament
professionals.
   ``That's about one every day from now on during the entire next
decade,'' said spokeswoman Kit Bradshaw, who noted 320 new courses
have been built since 1987 with about the same number either
proposed or under construction.
   An estimated 23.4 million golfers are whacking golf balls at
about 13,630 U.S. courses _ an average of about 3,700 golfers for
every 18 holes _ and their ranks could reach between 30 million and
40 million by the year 2000 at present growth rates. In 1980, 15.1
million golfers played on 12,800 courses.
   Florida, which leads the nation with 932 courses, is also No. 1
in planned new golf courses with 53. California, New York and Texas
have more than 750 courses each.
   The age of golf as the exclusive pastime of the rich ended in
the 1960s as golfer Arnold Palmer rose from a modest background in
Pennsylvania to become a legend in the sport, said John Rooney, a
professor of geography at Oklahoma State University and author of
several books on sport and leisure.
   ``That's when more blue-collar and factory workers started to
play,'' he said.
   Golf, however, ranks in the bottom half of the 20 most popular
sports or activities, the National Sporting Goods Association
reported in September.
   Swimming was enjoyed by 71.1 million people, followed by
exercise walking and bicycling.
   But the golf foundation noted nearly half the players are
younger than 40 years old, with the average age 38.1, and may drop
other sports as they age. Also, less than a quarter of all U.S.
golfers are women and their numbers may grow in coming years.
   ``Baby boomers are moving into middle age and taking up a sport
that isn't so physically demanding,'' said Thomas Dorsel, a sports
psychologist at Francis Marion College in Florence, S.C.
   ``I'd also like to think that they are starting to recognize the
almost philosophical aspect of the game. Golf parallels life in so
many ways and it may appeal to people more when they enter a more
philosophical stage of their life.''
   Yet it still takes cash _ and a willingness to part with it _ to
hit the links.
   Sales of clubs and balls have jumped 53 percent since 1984 to
$963 million last year, according to the sporting goods
association. Golf apparel manufacturers sold about $270 million in
merchandise to retailers last year, the Sportswear Manufacturers
Association reported.
   Hefty sums may also be paid to learn to swing the costly clubs.
   ``Money is not the question with many of our guests. The
objective is to learn the game of golf,'' said Fred Griffin,
director of the 3-year-old Grand Cypress Academy of Golf in Orlando.
   For up to $3,000 for a five-day stay, students have access to a
medical team, including a psychologist, optics and muscle experts
and an orthopedic surgeon. On a special practice tee, a
computerized video unit analyzes golf swings for flaws.
   The system records the student's swing then superimposes a
computer graphics model of the stroke of a famous professional
golfer, such as Jack Nicklaus or Palmer.
   ``It's the only one like it,'' said Griffin. ``It's things like
this that people are willing to pay for.''
   Courses, too, are now making special efforts to attract
out-of-town golfers, who spent about $7.8 billion last year on
travel and lodging.
   Consortiums of courses in areas such as Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
Arizona and the Great Smoky Mountains now offer charter golf
vacations. Some tours even provide putting greens at the airport.
   Other tours are specifically aimed at the estimated 13.6 million
Japanese golfers who often pay dearly for a membership to one of
that nation's 1,600 courses.
   In Europe, a ``golf summit'' earlier this month in West Germany
examined the growing crowds at courses from Spain to Sweden. Canada
is scheduled to hold its first golf conference in December in
Toronto.
   ``We're already seeing what happens when there are too many
golfers and too few courses,'' said Ms. Bradshaw.
   Despite forecasts of continued growth, she warned the U.S. golf
boom could be suffocated by the early 1990s unless more municipal
courses are built.
   ``If it starts taking six hours to play a round because of
overcrowded courses, that's when people are just going to say,
`forget it,' and put away their clubs.''

   Northwest Airlines today announced a $2.7 billion
order for Boeing jets in a deal that could involve 90 planes and
reach $5.2 billion if the airline exercises all its purchase
options.
   Northwest, in a statement from Minneapolis, said the order was a
``testament to the new ownership's and new management's commitment
to the people of the Northwest and the growth of the company.''
   The order was for six Boeing 747-400s, the world's largst
passenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highly fuel
efficient twin jet.
   In addition to those firm orders, Northwest took options on four
additional 747-400s and another 40 757-200s.
   Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, said the show of confidence in Boeing, which has been
hit with a strike by production workers, was appreciated.
   ``Boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies have
enjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely with
Northwest's new management to further strengthen those ties,''
Longridge said.
   The planes, to be delivered from late 1993 through 1998, will be
powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Striking Boeing workers, who had heard reports of Northwest's
impending order, said the news bolstered their contention that
Boeing can afford a better wage and benefit offer.
   ``It doesn't change anything,'' said Matt Bates of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
``When you've got an $80 billion backlog ... it just underscores
our position.''
   Striking Machinists say five consecutive years of record orders
for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer should result in
employees getting a bigger chunk of the gains.
   The company's order backlog stretches into the late 1990s.
Orders before the walkout amounted to 736 jets worth $38.5 billion
this year.
   The Northwest order was not the first placed during the strike
by the Machinists, who represent 57,800 Boeing workers.
Approximately 43,300 of the workers are in Seattle and its suburbs,
another 12,000 or so are in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 are in Portland,
Ore., and a few hundred others are at sites in several other states.
   Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. of Hong Kong said this week it has
placed orders for two Boeing 747-400 freighters and secured options
for two additional models, in a transaction valued at about $600
million.
   Last Friday company officials announced an order by Evergreen
Airways Corp. of Taiwan for four 747-400s and two extended-range
767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worth
as much as $1.93 billion.
   Four planes have been delivered since the strike began Oct. 4.
   No talks had been scheduled, federal mediator Doug Hammond said
Wednesday.
   Boeing's three-year offer to the Machinists featured wage hikes
of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause
to virtually match inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and
increases in some benefits.
   Another 28,000 Boeing workers start contract talks on Monday.
They are members of the company's second-largest union, the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association. Roughly 95 percent
of them work in the Puget Sound area, with the rest in Portland and
at Air Force bases and other government installations in
California, Florida and Utah, said Dan Mahoney, general counsel.
   Mahoney predicted the talks covering engineers and technical
workers would have little effect on or be much affected by the
Machinists' strike. He said the two unions coordinated strategies
in recent years, but this year the Machinists decided not to.
   The contract for engineers and technical workers _ whose work
includes designing, drawing, drafting and testing _ expires Dec. 1,
but the earliest they could possibly strike would be sometime in
January, Mahoney said. They have never struck and ``nobody's
interested in a strike,'' he said.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said Boeing officials hoped to have
a settlement in the Machinists strike by Dec. 1.
   The last walkout by the Machinists lasted 45 days in 1977,
ending a couple weeks before the association's contract expired,
but had little effect on the smaller union's negotiations, Mahoney
said.
   SPEEA engineers want a 14 percent increase in the first six
months, 5 percent in the second six months, followed by 4 percent
in each subsequent six-month period of a three-year contract.
Technical employees want 14 percent the first six months and 2
percent every six months thereafter for the rest of the contract.
Both want quarterly cost-of-living adjustments and an unspecified
lump sum bonus.
   To go on strike, Mahoney said, his group would first have to
reject a contract by a simple majority, then approve a walkout by
at least two-thirds, both on mail ballots taking at least two weeks
each to conduct.
   A walkout would mean design and development work would grind to
a halt, and a return to production with the return of the
Machinists would be much slower, he said.
   Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause,
have been crossing the Machinists' picket lines while refusing to
do work normally done by the strikers.

<DATELINE>GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a reversal of an electronics trend,
Philips Consumer Electronics Co. on Thursdasy began shipping
American-made television sets to Japan.
   Philips plans to export 1,500 table-top sets to the land of the
rising sun this year, ``with significantly increasing exports
projected for the 1990s,'' the company said in a statement.
   Philips President and Chief Executive Donald F. Johnstone called
the shipment ``a significant first step in gaining a much-needed
equilibrium in the balance of trade between the U.S. and foreign
nations, particularly Japan.''
   The 27-inch sets were specially designed following an intensive
study of Japanese consumers. They have special colors and exterior
finishes that proved appealing to Japanese buyers.
   ``They like complexity and features,'' said A.L. Rodgers,
director of international marketing, adding that simplicity in
using the product also is important to the Japanese consumer.
   Rodgers said the sets will be marketed to ``upscale Japanese
consumers ... the same purchaser who buys a Mercedes Benz imported
from Germany.''
   The sets will be sold as products of Philips International,
rather than as American-made sets. But with control buttons in
English, the fact that the sets are American-made will not be
hidden, Rodgers said.
   The sets were manufactured at the Philips' Greenville plant,
which employs 4,800 people.
   In addition to these direct-view sets, Philips plans to
manufacture projection TVs for export in 1990 and 1991.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Machinists union at United Airlines has asked
the Labor Department to block the proposed employee buyout of the
airlines' parent company, claiming it violates laws governing the
use of retirement funds.
   In a three-page letter sent Wednesday to Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, the union charged that the tax benefits of the
proposed $6.75 billion buyout ``are effectively subsidizing a
substantial and excessive windfall'' to UAL Corp.'s management and
United's pilots, the employee group spearheading the takeover
effort.
   On Tuesday, United's pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit $200
million from their $1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock
in an employee stock ownership plan.
   The banks financing the deal wanted to see such a commitment
before providing financing for the takeover.
   A group led by the pilots and UAL's management, with the
participation of British Airways PLC, has offered to buy the
Chicago-based company for $300 a share in a tender offer that
expires Oct. 26.
   The pilots are the only UAL employee group so far committed to
participating in the buyout. The machinists previously declared
their opposition to the plan and United's flight attendants are
continuing to negotiate with UAL's management on contract
concessions in exchange for partial ownership of the company.
   The deal also is being examined by the Transportation
Department, which has expressed concern about leveraged buy-outs
and foreign stakes in U.S. airlines.

<HEAD>Trade Rep Presses For Open Japanese Markets On Construction, Satellites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials pressed Japan on Thursday to open
its markets wider to U.S. businesses, with Trade Representative
Carla Hills calling for measures to aid entry of construction
companies, supercomputers and telecommunications satellites.
   Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John E. Robson told
a private business conference that U.S. companies were becoming
more competitive at home and abroad but still faced difficult trade
and investment barriers in Japan.
   Mrs. Hills, in a luncheon meeting with Construction Minister
Shozo Harada, asked Japan to continue working to open the domestic
construction market, a Construction Ministry official said.
   She also urged Japan to increase penalties for companies caught
rigging bids for construction projects, said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Last month, the U.S. government said it was seeking at least
$35.7 million in compensation from 145 Japanese construction
companies for alleged price fixing on projects at a U.S. military
base.
   Harada replied that bid-rigging is illegal in Japan and
authorities have taken appropriate measures. Japan bars violating
firms from participation in public projects for up to nine months,
the ministry official said.
   Mrs. Hills singled out supercomputers and telecommunications
satellites in talks Thursday evening with Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama, a Foreign Ministry official said.
   Nakayama said Japan's policy of favoring Japanese manufacture
was meant to develop the nation's technology rather than as a
scheme to establish a domestic industry, the official said.
   Mrs. Hills replied that the United States had no objections to
Japan carrying out research and development, but if that led to
closing out foreign products it would be opposed, the official said.
   Mrs. Hills arrived in Tokyo on Thursday after visiting South
Korea. Later in her four-day stay, she was to confer with Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Minister of International Trade and
Industry Hikaru Matsunaga and other Japanese leaders.
   Robson and other senior U.S. officials in Japan for the business
conference urged Japan to show results soon in lifting structural
market barriers or risk stronger protectionist legislation from
Congress. Such barriers are the subject of ongoing trade talks
between the two sides.
   ``Our objective is to make significant progress in the ...
discussions before next spring,'' Robson told reporters. ``We
believe the risks in failing to make significant progress may be
considerable.''
   Increased competitiveness will do little to boost American
exports to and investment in Japan if markets remain closed to
foreign investors, he said.
   Robson said accusations that American corporate management is
too short-sighted, emphasizing short-term profits over longer-term
planning, ignored that many businesses do plan for the future.
   Energetic merger and acquisition activity in the United States,
another factor often blamed for short-term planning and instability
in American businesses, does not have an entirely negative impact
on U.S. competitiveness, Robson said.
   ``Many of these transactions have resulted in a new corporate
strategic focus beneficial to competitiveness,'' he said.
   Increased spending for on-the-job training and retraining and
cooperation with public sector education also are enhancing
American competitiveness, Robson said.
   He said the U.S. government was taking seriously Japanese
complaints, raised in the trade talks, that inadequate education, a
low personal savings rate and the huge federal budget deficit,
estimated at 155.1 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 1988, were
significant contributors to the U.S. trade imbalance with Japan.
   The overall U.S. trade deficit was estimated at $119.8 billion
last year, down from $171.2 billion in 1987, according to U.S.
figures. It suffered a $52 billion deficit with Japan.

<HEAD>Say Porkers from the East Hold Secret to Bigger Litters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With floppy ears, flaccid faces and fat
stomachs, the beauty of Chinese swine is in the eyes of their
scientist-beholders, who see them as a key to breeding efficient
``super pigs'' of the future.
   U.S. researchers hope to unlock the secret of large litters from
these porkers of the Orient, and incorporate that trait into
domestic hogs. It would be an important breakthrough for
scientists, who already have bred hogs that grow faster and produce
leaner meat.
   ``Litter size hasn't changed much in 30 years, but we're nowhere
near the limit,'' said David McLaren, a University of Illinois
animal scientist and member of the research team.
   The brown Meishan and Fengjing sows wean about 15 pigs, and the
black Minzhu nearly that number _ about twice as many as most U.S.
sows.
   Scientists will try to determine exactly why these Chinese pigs
have such large litters. Then, they hope to use conventional
breeding or genetic engineering to give U.S. pigs more offspring.
   They hope the result will be available to commercial producers
in five to 10 years. Increasing the number of weaned pigs to 11 per
sow would save U.S. pork producers about $78 million a year through
lower production costs, university scientists say.
   For example, Illinois sows now wean about eight pigs per litter.
If Chinese pigs could be used to produce a new sow that could wean
11 pigs, researchers estimate pork producers' costs would drop
about $9 a hog.
   ``This is not like going down to your friendly, local breeder
and buying a boar,'' said Robert Easter, an animal nutritionist and
member of the research team. ``This is something new.''
   The 47 Chinese pigs here are among 140 purchased from China and
imported in March after more than six years of battling bureacratic
obstacles.
   The pigs cost $11,000 each, including delivery, and the expense
was shared by the University of Illinois, Iowa State University and
the federal government. Some of the pigs are at Iowa State and at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture livestock research station in
Nebraska.
   The Chinese pigs at the University of Illinois share quarters
with sleek, white U.S. Yorkshire hogs in the school's new,
$2-million, state-of-the-art swine research facility that includes
a solar heating system. But that is all the pigs have in common.
   The Yorkshires are as solid as the Chinese pigs are flabby. They
thrash about and squeal loudly for food, while the Chinese pigs are
quiet.
   ``These Chinese pigs are so docile and nonaggressive, they'll
work out the pecking order (with the U.S. pigs) in a short time,''
McLaren said.
   U.S pigs, which grow quickly, are bred for meat production and
the Yorkshires are known for heavy muscle _ big pork chops and
hams. The Chinese pigs mature slowly and are too fat for domestic
meat standards.
   Chinese pigs also are nearly blind, because the wrinkles of
their faces cover their eyes.
   Scientists are breeding the Chinese pigs to each other to
increase the number of animals to work with. The first Chinese pigs
should be born here in January. Then, the Chinese will be
cross-bred with Yorkshires.
   Scientists from 13 disciplines will study every aspect of the
Chinese pigs, including what food makes them grow the fastest and
leanest, and whether growth-enhancers will help.
   ``We're talking about turning out an animal that's the pig of
the future,'' said Easter.

<HEAD>Reports Earnings Increase of 22 Percent for 3rd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. said Thursday that its profits for
the third quarter were up 22 percent over the same period a year
ago, due mainly to the sale of its bottled water business and an
increase in international soft drink volume.
   Net income for the three-month period was $361.3 million, or
$1.03 per share, compared to $295.6 million, or 81 cents a share,
in the 1988 quarter.
   Net operating revenues were up 8 percent to $2.3 billion for the
quarter from $$2.1 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1989, net income increased 19
percent to $966.6 million, or $2.73 a share, from $809.2 million,
or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 percent to $6.7
billion from $6.3 billion.
   The figures included a non-recurring after-tax gain of about $36
million, or 10 cents per share, in the third quarter from the sale
of the bottled water business, the company said.
   Another after-tax gain _ $530 million or $1.53 per common share
_ is expected to be added to fourth quarter earnings because of the
sale of Coca-Cola's 53.8 million shares of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. to Sony Corp., company officials said. The
Coca-Cola board approved the sale Oct. 2.
   Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta said third-quarter earnings also
were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft
drink syrups and concentrates. International syrup sales were up 14
percent, but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2
percent during the three months ended Sept. 30, he said.
   Case sales of soft drinks in the United States were about the
same as the previous year.
   The Coca-Cola Foods subsidiary, which markets Minute Maid
brands, reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice
volume, but a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for
the quarter.
   The company also said it completed a 40 million-share stock
repurchase plan during the third quarter. The plan was initiated in
1987.
   The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an
additional 20 million shares through 1991, the company said.

<HEAD>After Alar: Greener Apples, More Varieties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A season without Alar has taken its
toll on McIntosh apples, the crisp and tangy mainstay of New
England's fall crop, forcing some growers to begin the lengthy
process of switching to hardier varieties.
   Agriculture officials say some growers are being forced out
because they can't afford to wait the five to seven years it can
take for new trees to produce.
   ``They can't just change over orchards,'' said John O'Donnell,
marketing director of the New York &amp; New England Apple Institute.
   ``I know some growers that have tossed their hands up in the air
and said they're done; they're not going to continue,'' said Frank
Carlson, co-owner of Carlson's Orchards Inc., a 150-acre concern in
Harvard.
   Growers are marketing a greener McIntosh apple and trying to
convert bruised fruit into apple juice, sauce and cider, said
Agriculture Commissioner August Schumacher Jr. A new trend may be
the brewing of alcoholic hard cider, he said.
   The McIntosh crop was down this year, except in Vermont, with
the yield estimated at 7.1 million bushels instead of the projected
8.3 million, according to figures from the regional apple institute.
   The growth-retardant Alar keeps apples on the tree longer,
producing redder fruit with a longer shelf life. It voluntarily was
taken off the market earlier this year after a private consumer
group said eating apples treated with the chemical increased cancer
risk in children.
   The apple industry and federal Environmental Protection Agency
and the Food and Drug Administration disputed the report as an
exaggeration of the risk, and the EPA has proposed new standards
for use of the chemical.
   Alar was just one of the factors in the reduced New England
McIntosh crop and the problem of apples dropping before they could
be picked was not as bad as had been expected, said Wesley Autio,
assistant professor of pomology, the study of fruit-growing, at the
University of Massachusetts.
   But the loss of Alar is hard on McIntosh apples because they are
a tender variety, more prone to dropping.
   New England and New York account for 65 percent of the national
McIntosh crop, O'Donnell said. Overall, New England apples account
for 3 percent to 5 percent of the total national crop.
   Autio said growers appear to be ready to plant different
varieties, such as Empire, Cortland and Macoun, and wait out the
production lag.
   ``I think that they've had three to four years now to come to
terms with it,'' he said.
   Autio said he expects McIntosh eventually will account for about
40 percent of the region's crop, compared with the current 55
percent.
   Elsewhere in the nation, apples appear to be bearing up without
Alar, said Maureen Miklavic, spokeswoman for the International
Apple Institute based in McLean, Virginia.
   Red Stayman, grown in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and Winesap
apples, grown in the western states, are cracking without Alar.
``Beyond that we really don't see any other difficulties,'' she
said.
   Schumacher said growers are hoping for higher prices in November
to offset losses. He said he's optimistic the McIntosh won't fade
away.
   ``It's a great apple and we hope that farmers will continue to
grow it, but cultural practices may have to change, and some
farmers may want to put in other varieties,'' Schumacher said.

<DATELINE>ZAHURA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PepsiCo Inc., the soft drink, restaurant
and snack foods giant, will sell its cola and other beverages in
India next year, the company said Thursday.
   The announcement was released after Punjab Governor Sidharth
Shankar Ray presided over the placement of the cornerstone for a
food and vegetable processing plant, partly owned by PepsiCo, at
this remote village.
   The plant is the second unit of Pepsi Foods that was formed as a
joint venture of PepsiCo and two Indian companies _ the Punjab
government's Agro-Industries Corp. and the privately owned Tata
group.
   The other unit, also located in Punjab at the Channo village,
will manufacture concentrate for soft drinks which will be
distributed to independent bottlers throughout the country.
   The compnay said it expects its beverage and food products will
be on the market by the summer of 1990. It said the cola will be
sold under the brand name Pepsi Era.
   PepsiCo's share in the $15 million project is 39.9 percent, in
line with an Indian law which restricts the holding of foreign
partners in a joint venture to 40 percent. The law also forbids use
of foreign brand names.
   According to the government's terms, soft-drink production will
be restricted to 25 percent of the project's sales and exports of
food products will have to be five times the value of imports.
   Indians were cut off from U.S. soft drinks after Coca-Cola Co.
ended 27 years of business here in 1977 when the government
insisted that the company disclose its secret formula.
   PepsiCo left India in the 1950s because of poor sales.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious

<TEXT>
   Plant pathologists have discovered a
previously unknown virus in Florida's tomato crop but say they
don't have enough information about it to predict the impact on the
state's vegetable industry.
   ``It's a new virus for most of us,'' said George N. Agrios,
chairman of University of Florida's department of plant technology.
``Since we really need to study the virus ... we have no
recommendation on what to do about it.''
   Tomatoes comprise about one-third of all vegetables grown in
Florida. Last year growers shipped to market 64.87 million 25-pound
cartons valued at more than $600 million.
   With an estimated 54,000 acres planted in tomatoes, Florida
produces much of the winter domestic crop sold November through May.
   With no way now to defend against the still-unnamed virus,
researchers plan simply to learn what they can about its behavior.
   Researchers said the suspected virus is similar to one that has
stunted plant grown and reduced the quantity of tomatoes produced
in Mexico. Symptons include green and gold mottled leaves, leaf
curl and stunting.

<TEXT>
   Saatchi and Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's largest
advertising agency, on Thursday named a new chief executive and a
new finance director.
   The company, which recently has been the target of takeover
speculation, said Robert Louis-Dreyfus, 43, is to join the company
as chief executive Jan. 1. A Frenchman, he currently is president
and chief executive of IMS International Inc., where he has worked
since 1982, Saatchi said.
   IMS is the leading market research firm in pharmaceuticals. It
was acquired last year by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. of the United
States, Saatchi said.
   Saatchi's new finance director, also effective Jan. 1, is to be
Charles Scott, 40, who currently is chief financial officer of IMS.
   Maurice Saatchi serves as chairman of the company, and his
brother Charles is a member of the board of directors.
   Saatchi's statement didn't say who Louis-Dreyfus and Scott were
replacing, or if the posts were vacant. Repeated attempts to reach
Saatchi officials in London and New York and at Saatchi's public
relations firm in London were unsuccessful.
   Saatchi's shares have been buoyed by takeover speculation.
   Southeastern Asset Management Inc., a Memphis, Tenn.-based
investment company, has acquired a 10.2 percent stake in Saathchi,
and said earlier this week that it had been approached by third
parties it did not identify who are interested in restructuring
transactions involving Saatchi.

players said Thursday.
   Hotel giant Ramada Inc. on Wednesday postponed indefinitely a
$400 million bond issue and traders expect more cancellations in a
market wracked since retailer Campeau Corp. had to get a $250
million loan to meet its junk bond obligations in September.
   ``The junk bond market has not collapsed but it's done a pretty
good impression of it in the last month,'' said Tom Fendrich, a
managing director at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Prices of the high-yield debt securities, which frequently are
used to raise money for small- or medium-sized businesses with slim
credit histories, dropped again on Thursday. Issues were down on
average about 1 point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face amount.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc.'s index of prices of 24
high-yield bond funds is down 3.3 percent in net asset value since
Sept. 12, shortly before Campeau's financial problems sent the junk
market into a tailspin.
   In the same period, the stock market rose 2.2 percent, based on
the Wilshire Associates index of 5,000 stocks, and longer-term U.S.
Treasury bonds gained about 0.4 percent.
   A sustained decline in junk bonds _ which offer high yields to
investors to compensate for companies' poor credit ratings _ could
discourage use of the high-cost debt. That could crimp companies'
plans for junk-financed expansions, acquisitions or restructurings.
   Traders said the junk bond market's weakness has extended in
recent days to include securities of some companies normally seen
as stable.
   Bond prices of Duracell Inc. lost about 1} points Wednesday and
Thursday. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. bonds have declined four
points this week as investors were discouraged by a
lower-than-expected sale price for its Sea World theme parks.
   Supermarkets General Corp., which owns Pathmark grocery stores,
also has been under selling pressure in recent days ``for
apparently no reason,'' said a trader at a major firm who asked not
to be named.
   ``These bonds objectively should not be that cheap,'' the trader
said. ``I think it's a marketplace where people are nervous and
they would rather have a small loss today than a nasty surprise a
year from now.''
   Meantime, a total of about $11 billion in new offerings from
companies including Continental Airlines, Blockbuster
Entertainment, Grand Union and CNW Corp.'s Chicago &amp; North Western
railroad, are scheduled to occur by the end of the year.
   Traders expect some of the issues to be hard sells and others to
be delayed, like the Ramada offering, or canceled outright, like a
$475 million offering by Ohio Mattress Co. was last month.
   ``People are being very selective because they can afford to be
selective,'' said Jim Lewis, a high-yield bond trader at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``There's a lot more paper coming
out right now. You'll probably see several more postponements or
cancellations.''
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the leader in junk bond
underwriting, estimates that only $6 billion to $7 billion of the
planned offerings will be completed.
   But the firm also said $11 billion in existing bonds will leave
the market because of redemptions, refinancings and other bond
buyback programs, which should help boost the market for the new
issues.
   Not all new issues are struggling. Investors snapped up $550
million in new Drexel-underwritten debentures by Turner
Broadcasting Inc. this week and CNW's $475 million issue by
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. next week is expected
to stimulate demand.
   Also, with the price declines, junk bond yields are as high as
14 percent. The ``spread'' between returns on high-yield and
Treasury bonds was 5.9 percentage points on Thursday, compared with
4 percentage points in January.
   But with the continued shakeout in the $200 billion junk bond
market _ by all accounts its longest and most severe ever _
investors are maintaining their cash positions and not buying new
junk.
   ``At this point we are reluctant to draw down our reserve
levels,'' said Steven Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc. in Baltimore, which has over $1 billion in
junk-bond assets.
   ``Our view is the market still really hasn't stabilized,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Ford Forms Holding Co. to Reduce Tax Bite of Associates Acquisition</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co. has formed a holding company to
dull the potential tax sting of its pending acquisition of the
Associates financial concern, the automaker said Thursday.
   The value of the move can't be determined precisely, but an
analyst says it may be worth millions to the nation's most
profitable automaker.
   The creation of Ford Holdings Inc. and the sale of 25 percent of
it for $800 million to institutional investors should deflect some
of the taxes related to Ford's acquisition of the Associates Corp.
finance company, Ford officials said.
   In a complicated procedure involving seldom-used provisions of
the 1986 tax law and foreign tax credits, Ford is avoiding the
potential taxes by owning less than 80 percent of the holding
company, compared with owning it outright.
   ``The net effect for us is that unless we form Ford Holdings or
a similar company, the effective tax bill for Associates earnings
would go up,'' said assistant Ford treasurer Malcolm Macdonald.
   Neither he nor George Brown, executive director of Ford
Financial Services, would estimate how much savings may be realized.
   ``It could be literally millions,'' said Charles Bee, national
director for international tax issues at the Seidman &amp; Seidman
accounting firm in New York. The spectre of losing millions of
dollars in potential tax revenues may kick Congress into action, he
added.
   ``I think Congress will look again at this area, because there
are probably so many dollars involved,'' Bee said.
   He said there has been talk for months about the procedure Ford
is using, but as far as he knows no large corporation has tried it
so far.
   ``If a lot of companies did this, there's no way we can balance
our books,'' he said.
   The holding company would include Ford's American Road Insurance
Co., U.S. Leasing, Ford Motor Land Development and Ford Leasing
Development Co. in addition to Associates. It would not include
Ford Motor Credit Corp. or First Nationwide Financial Corp., two of
Ford's largest financial subsidiaries.
   The stock sale should be completed by the end of the month, the
same time Ford's acquisition of Associates from Paramount
Communications Inc. is expected to be completed, Macdonald and
Brown said.
   ``The cash we are raising (through the sale) will be paid to
Paramount as part of the Associates acquisition,'' Mcdonald said.
   The Associates, founded in 1918 and acquired by Paramount 21
years ago, is the nation's third-largest independent finance
company. It has assets close to $14 billion.
   It was Ford's largest financial acquisition. The company took
over the San Francisco-based First Nationwide in 1985 and doubled
its size last year through the takeover of a number of savings and
loan institutions.
   Those acquisitions made First Nationwide the second-largest
savings and loan association at the end of 1988, the latest figures
available. The largest is Home Savings of America, held by H.F.
Ahmason &amp; Co. Inc. of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Prices Rally, Most Other Energy Futures Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wholesale home heating oil prices rallied
Thursday amid speculation about temporary tightness in supplies.
Crude oil futures prices also posted gains while gasoline futures
finished mixed.
   The contract for November delivery of No.2 heating oil surged
1.36 cents to 61.17 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after rising 0.17 cent the previous session. Other
contract months also rose.
   James Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc., said reports of
disruptions in heating oil shipments from the Soviet Union to
Western Europe caused some speculative buying on world markets. A
low water level on the Rhine River was said to be delaying barge
travel.
   The heating oil market also has been pumped up by a belief that
supplies in Europe could be tight because earlier this year an
abundance of gasoline was processed, at the expense of heating oil.
   Domestically, industry figures on oil inventories encouraged
some bullish sentiment toward heating oil, said Steel. The American
Petroleum Institute's weekly report was released after the market
closed Wednesday.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 22 cents to settle at $20.47 per
42-gallon barrel after rising 8 cents on Wednesday. Contracts
calling for delivery December through February sported gains also.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoine fell 0.16 cent
to 55.57 cents a gallon, but contracts for later delivery settled
with moderate increases. On Wednesday, the November gas contract
declined 0.26 cent.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 470 money market mutual
funds rose $899.9 million in the latest week to a new all-time
record of $349.89 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
revised $378.2 million decline in fund assets the previous week to
$348.99 billion, which snapped a 12-week string of record growth.
The decline originally was reported as $429.3 million to $348.94
billion.
   The previous all-time high of $349.37 billion reported by the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group was established in the
week ended Sept. 27.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 233
general purpose funds rose $436.7 million to $114 billion, assets
of 96 broker-dealer funds rose $484.5 million to $152.75 billion,
and assets of 141 institutional funds fell $21.3 million to $83.14
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.26 percent from 8.28 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.27 percent from 8.26 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, unchanged.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts at 6.42 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.28
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.31 the
previous week. Yields were 8.33 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.35 percent; 8.24 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.26 percent;
and 8.22 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.25 percent.

   Stock prices lost ground for the third straight
session Thursday as traders warily awaited the latest government
data on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.52 to 2,759.84,
bringing its loss over the last three trading days to 31.57 points.
The average hit a record closing high of 2,791.41 on Monday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
543 up, 907 down and 511 unchanged.
   Interest rates dropped in the credit markets. But analysts said
stock traders had other concerns on their minds.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for September.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that
measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent
and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through
the summer.
   ``Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings
in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed Jack Lavery at
Merrill Lynch in his latest market commentary.
   ``Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up,
but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down { at 52;
Philip Morris, down | at 44]; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1~ at 129{;
Eastman Kodak, down | at 47, and General Electric, down [ at 58.
   GE reported third-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share, up from 90
cents in the like period a year ago.
   Owens-Corning Fiberglas recorded one of the day's biggest
percentage losses, falling 2~ to 30}. The company said its
operating income for the third quarter would fall short of both
analysts' estimates and comparable levels from the period last year.
   Chrysler lost | to 24. The company estimated its third-quarter
results at around the breakeven point, not counting an
extraordinary gain from the sale of part of its stake in Mitsubishi
Motors.
   Raytheon dropped | to 83{ despite the company's report of higher
third-quarter profits.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.12 million
shares, against 164.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 188.04 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $12.51 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .83 to 196.98.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.00 to 405.40, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.60 at 355.39.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.03 to 482.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 395.01, down .67.

   The dollar fell in subdued dealings Thursday as
traders awaited the release of fresh economic data.
   Gold prices rose worldwide.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.40 a troy ounce, up $1.40 from Wednesday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$363 an ounce, $1.50 higher than Wednesday's late bid.
   Many traders stayed on the sidelines while awaiting the
government's release Friday of retail sales and producer prices
data for September.
   ``If the Producer Price Index comes in on the high side, the
(Federal Reserve) won't have room to ease (interest rates) any
further,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of
Boston's New York office.
   ``While the Fed is concerned about the level of the dollar,
their major priority is to keep inflation'' down, he added.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was undermined by
speculation that the Fed was considering a cut in the discount
rate, its interest charge on loans to member banks. Lower interest
rates make U.S. investments less attractive to foreigners, thereby
diminishing their need for dollars.
   Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., said that despite the fact that the dollar is holding to
key levels, the U.S. currency is likely to come under pressure
because interest rate differentials have narrowed considerably.
   U.S. interest rates currently are about 2.5 percent higher than
those in Japan, he said.
   ``And historically, as it gets under 3 percent, the dollar comes
under pressure,'' Flanagan said, adding that earlier this year the
spread was as high as 5 percent, ``which had kept the underlying
support of the dollar all year.''
   Separately, the British pound got a boost from comments by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who told the governing
Conservative Party's annual conference he would continue to fight
inflation with high interest rates for as long as necessary.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 144.60 Japanese yen, from 143.90 yen.
Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 144.25 yen. In New
York, the dollar finished at 144.15 yen, down from 144.50 yen on
Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5520, more expensive for
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.5425. In New York, it cost $1.5527
to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5460 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.9075 West German marks, down from 1.9155;
1.6735 Swiss francs, down from 1.6800; 6.4670 French francs, down
from 6.4900; 1,399.25 Italian lire, down from 1,403.00, and 1.1749
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1748.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.9068 West German marks, down from 1.9185;
1.6715 Swiss francs, down from 1.6785; 6.4650 French francs, down
from 4.4925; 2.1510 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1630; 1,397.50
Italian lire, down from 1,403.25, and 1.1737 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1750.
   Gold traded late in London at a bid of $362.75 a troy ounce, up
from $361.25 Wednesday. The Zurich late bid was $363.10, up from
$361.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $362.75, up from
$361.25.
   Silver traded late in London at a bid $5.10 a troy ounce, up
from $5.05. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed
at $5.090 a troy ounce, up from $5.076 on Wednesday.

<HEAD>EC, US Reach Tentative Agreement on Steel Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community and the United
States reached tentative agreement on a new accord increasing
slightly the European share of the American steel market, the
trading bloc announced Thursday.
   The European Commission, the community's executive body, said
the European share would rise from 6.68 percent to 7 percent under
the new arrangement, which will remain in effect until March 31,
1992.
   The accord, which still must be approved by the 12 nations of
the European Community, means European producers could increase
exports to the United States by almost 300,000 metric tons.
   The trading bloc exported 5.9 million metric tons of steel
products to the United States in 1988.
   Frans Andriessen, the community's top trading official, told
members of the European Parliament, ``The results are not
unsatisfactory but (we are) bound to see it with mixed feelings.''
   ``There was no need for an agreement. .. Objectively speaking,
it was unnecessary,'' he said.
   The arrangement stems from a decision in July by President Bush
to extend steel import quotas, which were first put in place in
1984. They had been set to expire on Sept. 30.
   The restrictions set annual limits on the amount of steel that
can be brought into the United States from 29 countries, including
those of the European Community, Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
   The European Commission said the new agreement covered the same
steel products and that some terms of the arrangement were
improved, particularly for the export of goods in short supply in
the United States.
   It said the 30-month extension of the U.S. restrictions was a
``credible step toward the liberalization of the steel trade.''
   In Strasbourg, France, the European Parliament, the community's
legislative body, said it regretted the new agreement limiting
European sales in light of the improvement in the American steel
industry. It said the accord could complicate international trade
talks for a broader steel pact.
   The U.S. quotas were first imposed at a time the American steel
industry was suffering heavy losses. Steelmakers complained they
were hurt by foreign producers who were helped by big government
subsidies and import restrictions.
   They say they have benefited from the quotas but argue they
still need more time to modernize their operations.

<TEXT>
   James R. Jones, a former White House chief of
staff under President Lyndon B. Johnson and a seven-term
congressman from Oklahoma, was named Thursday as chairman of the
American Stock Exchange.
   Jones, 50, succeeds Arthur Levitt Jr., who resigned in May after
11 years as chairman of the exchange, the nation's third largest
stock market behind the New York Stock Exchange and the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system.
   ``Obviously I come to this with a sense that equities are of
great importance,'' Jones said in a telephone interview. ``This
country was built on ownership of our companies. I think we have to
get the individual investor back into the equity markets.''
   Jones, a Democrat, was chairman of the House Budget committee
and a member of the powerful Ways and Means committee during his
congressional career from 1973-86.
   He was defeated in a 1986 bid for the U.S. Senate by incumbent
Republican Don Nickles and earlier this year lost a race for the
chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.
   Jones, who served on Johnson's staff from 1965-1969 was the
president's last chief of staff. Jones also was chairman of a task
force on U.S.-Japan trade relations and said he would make foreign
market contacts a priority for the Amex.
   The Amex, which caters to medium-sized companies, is far
outpaced in volume by the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ
over-the-counter market traded electronically nationwide.
   The Amex grew from an average daily volume of 3.9 million shares
traded when Levitt took over in 1978 to 9.94 million shares last
year, but the number of companies traded has fallen from 1,004 to
895.
   But Amex in recent years has curbed the decline in its listed
companies, marketed itself well domestically and abroad, emerged as
a leader in options trading and offered innovative new products and
services.
   Jones said he would use his contacts in Washington and abroad to
try to ``add to a climate of economic growth and capital
formation'' and help mid-sized companies develop capital and
develop markets around the world.
   ``I think there are a lot mid-sized companies that are either
unfamiliar or unsure of themselves in both markets,'' he said.
   Jones, a partner in the Washington law firm of Dickstein,
Shapiro &amp; Morin, also said his contacts in Europe and Asia ``will
be very helpful as we move into this global marketplace and find a
niche for the Amex.''
   The exchange dates to the 1790s, when its brokers traded
unlisted securities on the streets of lower Manhattan while others
moved indoors. It was known as the New York Curb Exchange until
1953, when its present name was adopted.
   The Amex in 1988 reported net income of $2.6 million on revenue
of $102.8 million, compared with profits of $8.3 million and
revenue of $114.5 million in 1987, Amex's most profitable year.
   Jones, who has been on the Amex board since January 1987, is to
take over Nov. 10. Levitt, 58, resigned to expand his publishing
company, Levitt Communications Inc.

<TEXT>
   The Student Loan Marketing Association, known
as Sallie Mae, reported Thursday that third quarter earnings were
up 15 percent because of continued strong student loan purchase
volume.
   Net earnings for the period ending Sept. 30 were $65.9 million,
or 65 cents per share, compared to $57.5 million, or 55 cents per
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sallie Mae is a federally-chartered, publicly-traded corporation
that buys insured student loans from the originating institutions,
such as banks, to increase the availability of education loans for
college students.
   As of Sept. 30, total assets for the Washington-based

billion total for the same period in 1988.
   Student loan purchases for the third quarter totaled $1.2
billion compared to $1.4 billion for the 1988 third quarter. That

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move in Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Oct. 2, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,165.7 billion from $3,159.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,005.2 billion from $4,006.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $789.3 billion from $782.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 4 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,138.2 billion, a 7.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,008.2 billion, up 4.5 percent, while M1
rose 1.8 percent to an average of $779.0 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $800 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$953 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $291.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 4, down from $293.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Soar The Limit As Supply Fears Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frozen pork-belly futures prices soared the permitted
2-cents-a-pound daily limit Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Thursday amid growing supply fears rooted in the
government's decision to ship pork bellies to Poland.
   On other commodity markets, copper and precious metals futures
advanced, grains and soybeans were mixed; and energy futures were
mostly higher.
   Frozen pork bellies futures settled 2 cents higher across the
board with the contract for delivery in February at 49.72 cents a
pound.
   The rally followed a surge of buying on Wednesday and may
reflect the market's uneasiness about the government's plan to ship
$10 million worth of U.S. pork bellies to Poland as part of a
food-aid package.
   Pork bellies are the part of a pig from which bacon is made.
   With stocks of frozen pork bellies at historically high levels,
supply tightness would seem to be low on the market's list of
concerns.
   But under the rules of the futures market, only bellies frozen
after Nov. 1 are deliverable against any of the futures contracts
currently trading. And some of the surplus bellies produced this
winter _ perhaps as much as 15 million pounds' worth _ are destined
to be sent to Poland instead of being packed away in commercial
freezers for domestic use later on.
   Traders fear that the large stockpile of bellies currently in
freezers may be too old to guarantee their quality if they were to
be shipped to Poland. But the government has not yet decided on the
specifications for the Polish shipment.
   ``The longer the government delays in outlining the
specifications of the product that has to go to Poland, the more
uncertain the situation becomes ... and the more nervous the
futures market becomes,'' said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   In livestock trading on the Chicago Merc, live cattle futures
settled .20 cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 73 cents
a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .42 cent higher with
October at 83.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to
1.05 cent higher with October at 48.67 cents a pound.
   Copper futures rose on New York's Commodity Exchange after the
Arizona-based copper producer Magma Copper Co. announced it was
forced to cancel some shipments due to equipment problems.
   Copper settled 1.2 cents to 1.45 cents higher with December at
$1.3035 a pound.
   In precious-metals trading on the Commodity Exchange, gold
settled $1.30 to $1.50 higher with October at $363.40 a troy ounce;
silver was 1 cent to 1.4 cents higher with December at $5.153 a
troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade ahead of the Agriculture Department's
eagerly-awaited monthly crop report.
   The report, which was released after the close, estimated the
1989 U.S. corn crop at 7.45 billion bushels, up 2 percent from last
month's projection of projection of 7.32 billion bushels and 51
percent higher than the drought-shriveled 1988 crop of 4.92 billion
bushels.
   The USDA estimated the 1989 U.S. soybean crop at 1.93 billion
bushels, up 2 percent from last month's projection of 1.89 billion
and 24 percent larger than last year's harvest of 1.54 billion.
   And the USDA estimated total 1989 U.S. wheat production at 2.04
billion bushels, up 13 percent from last year, but 1 percent below
the September forecast of 2.06 billion bushels.
   The corn and soybean numbers were above market expectations and
analysts said the report may send corn and soybean futures prices
moderately lower at Friday's opening.
   Wheat futures were expected to open slightly higher Friday in
response to the report.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 2} cents higher with December
at $4.06} a bushel; corn futures were 1} cents lower to \ cent
higher with December at $2.35\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to {
cent higher with December at $1.40} a bushel; soybeans were 2{
cents lower to \ cent higher with November at $5.52{ a bushel.
   Wholesale home heating oil prices rallied strongly on the New
York Mercantile Exchange amid speculation about temporary tightness
in supplies. Crude oil futures prices also posted gains while
gasoline futures finished mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 26 cents
higher with November at $20.47 a barrel; heating oil was .57 cent
to 1.36 cents higher with November at 61.17 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .16 cent lower to .55 cent higher with
November at 55.57 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Two Big Insurers Agree to Pay Fines, Testify in Texas Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major insurance companies agreed
Thursday to pay $500,000 each and testify in Texas' antitrust
lawsuit against other of the nation's largest insurers, Attorney
General Jim Mattox said.
   Mattox said Travelers Insurance Co. and St. Paul Fire and Marine
Insurance Co. also agreed to stop certain industry activities in a
settlement agreement signed by state District Judge Pete Lowry of
Austin.
   In the agreements, both companies denied any wrongdoing or
liability. The pacts say each $500,000 payment is for investigative
and legal costs and ``does not represent a fine or penalty.''
   ``In essence, these companies have entered a nolo contendere (no
contest) plea and have agreed to testify for the state as the
lawsuit continues against the other defendants,'' Mattox said.
   The state accuses the insurance industry of seeking to create a
phony ``insurance crisis'' several years ago in which insurers
claimed that an increase in lawsuits was forcing them out of the
commercial liability field.
   Mattox in March 1988 sued eight major insurance companies and
other insurance groups, accusing them of illegally conspiring to
boycott, coerce and intimidate insurance consumers in order to
drive up rates, cut back coverage and create a false insurance
crisis in the commercial liability field.
   Several other states joined a similar suit filed in federal
court in California.
   ``We fully intend to proceed with our legal action against all
these other defendants. As a prosecutor, I can explain it to you
like this: Sometimes you cut a deal with one member of a gang in
order to put the entire gang out of business,'' he said.
   ``We are asking the court to set us a trial date as soon as
possible for the rest'' of the defendants, Mattox said.
   The state's lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution for
consumers.
   The civil penalties could range up to $1 million for each
violation of the state's antitrust law by corporate defendants and
up to $100,000 for each violation by individuals.
   Spokesmen for both Travelers and St. Paul Fire and Marine said
their companies believe they would have won but decided to settle
because of the costs involved.
   ``We look at this as a very cost-effective way for the company
to avoid further legal expense, a lot of inconvenience and a lot of
burden on our shareholders,'' said St. Paul spokeswoman Suzi Hagen.
   ``We feel confident that if it would have gone to its
conclusion, there would have been a ruling in our favor. But the
costs of doing this would have far outdistanced the benefits we
would have been getting,'' said Travelers spokesman Dan Kaferle.
   Mattox recalled a television advertising campaign in which the
insurance industry contended that the crisis would hinder
everything from high school football games to fire protection.
   When his suit was filed, Mattox charged the insurance industry
with ``the most insidious consumer fraud perpetrated upon the
American public in decades.''
   Mattox's investigation began with a letter from the Austin
suburb of Westlake Hills, which was notified in 1985 that its
liability coverage was being canceled.
   ``After years with the same liability carriers, Westlake's
coverage was suddenly canceled despite the fact that the city had
only one minor claim since becoming a city in 1953,'' he said.

<HEAD>Chemical Boosts Loan Loss Reserve, Posts $825 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chemical Bank's $900 million addition
to loan-loss reserve and $825 million third quarter loss. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. said Thursday it added
$900 million to its cushion against possible loan losses, resulting
in an $824.6 million third-quarter loss for the nation's fifth
largest bank holding company.
   Also on Thursday, Bank of New York Co. announced a $600 million
increase in its allowance to cover potentially bad loans. The
provision caused Bank of New York to post a loss of $271.3 million
in the third quarter.
   Chemical and Bank of New York joined a lengthening list of big
U.S. banks that recently have bolstered their protection against
losses amid a widespread perception that economic and political
difficulties in the Third World might make it impossible for
countries to repay their debts.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. were among the nation's major money-center banks that
previously announced they were substantially boosting their
loan-loss reserves.
   Chemical said in a news release that it has made a special $600
million provision to its reserve for losses on loans to countries
engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations. Chemical's allowance for
losses on loans to troubled Third World debtors has grown to $1.84
billion on account of the addition.
   Another $300 million was set aside to cover possible losses on
nonperforming loans at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a Chemical
subsidiary. Chemical has been trying to weed out shaky loans at
Texas Commerce Bancshares since acquiring it in 1987.
   The federally-assisted bailout and recapitalization of numerous
Texas banks has weighed down the state's real estate market. By
making the $300 million provision, Chemical was attempting to
insulate future earnings from expected losses on the disposal of
nonperforming Texas Commerce Bancshares' loans.
   In a move aimed at enhancing its equity capital position,
Chemical also announced plans to issue $500 million in common
stock. Chemical said it soon would file a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Chemical's loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 came to $12.89 a
share. In 1988's third quarter, Chemical earned $211.9 million or
$3.43 a share, a period in which results benefited from several
nonrecurring gains.
   Chemical lost $578.1 million, or $9.75 a share, in the first
nine months of 1989 compared to after-tax income of $465.1 million,
or $7.36 a share, in the corresponding 1988 period.
   Bank of New York said its loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30,
which came to $4.10 a share, compared with income of $54.2 million,
or $1.51 a share, a year earlier.
   But without the special addition to its loan loss allowance,
Bank of New York would have earned $118.7 million, or $1.60 a share
on a fully diluted basis, in the quarter.
   J. Carter Bacot, Bank of New York's chairman and chief executive
officer, said $400 million of the special addition was designated
to cover loans to Third World countries, and the remainder was set
aside for other unspecified loans.
   ``Our decision was prompted by recent developments regarding
Lesser Developed Country debt negotiations, and is consistent with
our policy of maintaining appropriate reserves for the entire loan
portfolio,'' Bacot said in a news release.
   Bank of New York said its provision for LDC loans now stands at
$938.6 million out of a total loan-loss allowance of $1.52 billion.
   The bank's earnings, meanwhile, were said to be strong. The bank
benefited from cost savings related to its $1.4 billion acquisition
of Irving Trust Co., completed in December of last year. Revenue
growth from securities processing operations also contributed to
third quarter results.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Bank of New York reported a
loss of $55.9 million , or $1.18 per share, compared to the prior
year's income of $158.3 million, or $4.52 a share.
   Excluding the special addition, nine-month earnings would have
been $334.1 million, or $4.52 a share, fully diluted, which
includes common stock and equivalents.
   Bank of New York said it expects to post a profit for all of
this year.

<HEAD>Boeing and Strikers Cheered by $5 Billion Northwest Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest aircraft deal in Northwest Airlines
history, $5.2 billion in orders and options for Boeing jets, was
good news Thursday to striking production workers as well as to
company officials.
   Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, said the show of confidence on the ninth day of a strike
by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers was appreciated.
   ``Boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies have
enjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely with
Northwest's new management to further strengthen those ties,''
Longridge said.
   Striking machinists saw the order as more evidence that they're
needed.
   ``It's wonderful. It means we'll have more work for a long time
to come,'' said Jack Daniels, communications director of Machinists
District Lodge 751. ``But you can't get paid for it until you build
them.''
   A statement issued by Northwest in Minneapolis called the order
a ``testament to the new ownership's and new management's
commitment to the people of the Northwest and the growth of the
company.''
   Northwest ordered six Boeing 747-400s, the world's largest
passenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highly
fuel-efficient twinjet, and took options on four 747-400s and 40
757-200s.
   The planes, scheduled for delivery from late 1993 through 1998,
were ordered with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000 and PW4000 engines, making
the deal worth $1.5 billion or more to the East Hartford, Conn.,
manufacturer.
   Chief corporate spokesman Harold Carr said the deal boosted
Boeing's orders to 788 planes worth $42 billion this year, the
fifth straight year of record orders, and the backlog of firm
orders _ excluding options _ to 1,644 planes worth $82 billion with
deliveries extending into the late 1990s.
   Those figures do not include an order announced Wednesday by
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. for two 747-400 freighters and options
on two more models for a total potential pricetag of about $600
million because the deal was still being confirmed Thursday, Carr
said.
   Last Friday company officials announced an order by Evergreen
Airways Corp. of Taiwan for four 747-400s and two extended-range
767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worth
as much as $1.93 billion.
   Production has been grinding to a halt at Boeing since the union
representing about 57,800 workers, including 43,300 Puget
Sound-area members of District Lodge 751, went on strike Oct. 4.
   The Machinists also represent about 12,000 workers in Wichita,
Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred in California,
Utah, Montana, Hawaii and other states.
   Four planes have been delivered since the strike began, and
company officials said about three dozen more were close enough to
completion for non-striking personnel to finish them.
   Carr said senior Boeing officials had heard no concern from
customers about delivery problems. The Northwest order was the
third received by Boeing during the strike.
   ``It's certainly not going to be an issue at the bargaining
table,'' Carr said.
   Local union president Tom Baker said Boeing should start to feel
the heat soon.
   ``I just don't know how they can withstand a prolonged work
stoppage without facing a great deal of pressure,'' Baker said.
``The company is not going to be able to deliver the existing
aircraft, much less these (new orders), without us being back on
the job.''
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond said Thursday he was remaining in
contact with both sides, but no talks were scheduled.
   There have been no negotiations since the Machinists voted 85
percent to strike rather than accept a three-year offer featuring
wage hikes of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8
percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a
cost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction in
mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., parent of NBC, on
Thursday reported third-quarter profits of $945 million, or $1.04 a
share, as most divisions showed increases while broadcasting was
about level.
   GE said its quarterly profits rose 16 percent from $815 million,
or 90 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. Revenues were $13
billion, compared to $12.2 billion in the previous third quarter.
   GE said profits from its broadcasting operations remained about
the same despite a drop in revenue because last year's third
quarter included the 1988 Olympics.
   Earnings were particularly strong in financial services,
plastics, transportation systems and power generation, GE Chairman
John F. Welch said.
   ``This strong earnings performance continues to reflect
widespread productivity improvements as well as sales growth in a
number of our businesses,'' he said.
   Revenues for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $38.4
billion, up 11 percent from $34.6 billion for the first nine months
of 1988.
   Net earnings for the first nine months were $2.76 billion, or
$3.06 a share, up from $2.38 billion, or $2.63 a share, in the
previous nine-month period.

<HEAD>GM Moving Full-Size Van Production to Michigan from Ohio, Ontario</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Production of General Motors Corp.'s full-size
vans will be moved to Flint, Mich., from plants in Ohio and
Ontario, leaving production lines there idled in late 1991, company
and union officials said Thursday.
   The 4,700 workers at GM's Truck and Bus Group plant in Flint had
been waiting for such an announcement and it was greeted with
relief and celebration.
   The news wasn't good for the 2,500 van workers at Lordstown,
Ohio.
   ``No further product is scheduled for the (Lordstown) van
plant,'' said GM spokesman Philip Workman. ``At Lordstown, the
focus will be on passenger cars in the future.''
   In addition to the full-size vans, the sprawling Lordstown
complex makes Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird automobiles.
There are about 11,500 people employed at the plant in the
Youngstown suburb about 50 miles southeast of Cleveland.
   GM said it was looking for another product to put in its
Scarborough, Ontario, plant, which employs about 2,700 people.
   Earlier this year, GM said it would end production in Flint of
three light-duty trucks and move it to Janesville, Wis., in late
1991. At that time, GM said it was looking for another product to
put in the Flint truck factory.
   ``Last February we said we would have a vehicle to be named
later at Flint,'' GM spokesman Tom Klipstine said Thursday in a
statement. ``We have now named that product.''
   He said the timing of the move, how many employees may be
affected and how much time it would take to retool the factory for
full-size van production hadn't been determined.
   But Gary Pruett, president of United Auto Workers Local 598 at
the plant, said the change would be completed in time for late 1991
production of 1992 models, employment at Flint shouldn't be
affected too much and the plant would be shut down for about five
months for the changeover.
   ``We've got people jumping up and down here,'' he said by
telephone. ``We had some people who were really scared. This is
really great for us.''

   The agency called leaders of the UAL Corp. buyout group to
Washington on Thursday ``to meet with us and describe the details
of the proposed transaction,'' said department spokesman Paul
Williams.
   The Machinists union contends the buyout is too high-priced and
unfair to employees.

   Continued weakness in the market for ``junk''
bonds is casting doubt on prospects for $11 billion worth of these
securities that companies plan to issue by year end, market players
said.
   Prices of the high-yield debt securities, which frequently are
used to raise money for small- or medium-sized businesses with slim
credit histories, dropped again Thursday. Issues were down on
average about 1 point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face amount.

   Northwest Airlines said Thursday it has
placed orders and options for $5.2 billion worth of Boeing jets,
the largest order in Northwest's history.
   ``This order is a testament to the new ownership's and new
management's commitment to the people of Northwest and the growth
of the company,'' said Fred Malek, who last month was named
president of the nation's fourth-largest carrier by its new
chairman, Alfred Checchi.
   Northwest ordered six Boeing 747-400s and secured options on
four more of the 420-passenger, high-technology jumbo jets. In
addition, the airline bought 40 Boeing 757-200 twin jets and placed
options on 40 more.
   The order comes even as Boeing has been hit with a strike by
production workers.
   In Seattle Thursday, Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the show of confidence in Boeing
was appreciated. Striking Boeing workers said the reports of the
impending order bolstered their contention that Boeing can afford a
better wage and benefit offer.
   Value of the firm orders in today's dollars is about $2.7
billion and the options represent another $2.5 billion, Malek told
a news conference at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Deliveries of aircraft included in this order are scheduled
between the second half of 1993 and 1998.
   Northwest, which earlier this year became the first airline to
fly the 747-400, will power the new 747-400s with Pratt &amp; Whitney
PW4000 engines. Northwest already operates the world's largest
fleet of 747-400s with five in service now and five more scheduled
for delivery by the end of 1990.
   Malek said Northwest plans to use the new 747-400s on routes to
and from Asia. Projections show that trans-Pacific markets will
continue to grow at a double-digit pace, he said, adding that the
range, payload and fuel efficiency of the 400 make it an excellent
choice for high density Asian routes.
   The 757 orders and options will bring Northwest's fleet of these
184-passenger twin jets to 113 aircraft. The 757s will be powered
by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2037 engines, which are designed for fuel
efficiency and low community noise levels.
   Northwest, purchased in June by a group of investors led by
Checchi, received its first 757 in 1985 and currently operates 33
of them. The 757s, with transcontinental range, will be used on
medium- and long-haul domestic routes, Malek said.
   With Thursday's $5.2 billion transaction, Northwest has 229
aircraft on order for delivery through the 1990s for a total value
of more than $11.5 billion.

<HEAD>House Panel Blasts European Policy to Limit US TV Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel on Thursday lashed out at the
European Community's decision to place quotas on imported
television programs and urged President Bush to use trade sanctions
if necessary to assure U.S. access to European viewers.
   The House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, in a unanimous
voice vote, approved a non-binding resolution that said the 10-2
vote on Oct. 3 by the European Community Council of Ministers was
illegal under terms of the 96-nation General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs.
   The resolution said the House ``deplores the damage which will
be inflicted on United States broadcasting, film and related
industries'' and urged Bush and U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills ``to take all feasible action under its authority, including
possible action under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, to
protect and maintain United States access to the EC broadcasting
market.''
   Section 301 authorizes the U.S. trade representative to take
action against a foreign nation that discriminates against U.S.
commerce.
   On Tuesday, Hills said she would file a fair-trade complaint
with GATT against the European Community over the Oct. 3 directive,
which urges the 12 member nations to take steps to limit imports to
no more than half of all shows aired.
   Although the so-called Television Without Frontiers directive
was not binding on European Community nations, Hills said it was
``blatantly protectionist'' and discriminates against U.S. and
other non-European Community film goods.
   Although GATT has no police power over the European Community,
Hills' action indicated the Bush administration was having second
thoughts about the plan to drop internal trade barriers by the end
of 1992.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher also has told Congress the
administration is concerned that the European Community will impose
local content rules in areas such as television, computer chips,
telecommunications equipment and automobiles.
   According to industry figures, the United States realizes a $3
billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and TV
exports, and Europe is the leading market for such programs with
about $700 million in purchases yearly.
   TV series such as ``Miami Vice'' and ``Dallas'' are very popular
in Europe, which has caused legislators there to decry the
``Americanization'' of their citizenry.
   Officials estimate that out of 125,000 hours of TV shown in
Western Europe annually, only 20,000 hours are produced in Europe.
Japan, Australia and the United States provide the bulk of the
remainder.
   The House resolution was sponsored by Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,
and had 14 co-sponsors, the subcommittee staff said.

<TEXT>
   The state Public Utilities Commission on
Thursday scrapped its 50-year-old system of regulating telephone
rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation, encouraging
new technology and promising Pacific Bell customers a rate decrease.
   ``Local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive
businesses and should be treated that way,'' the commission's
president, G. Mitchell Wilk, said before the new system was
approved on a 5-0 vote.
   Pacific Bell and GTE California, the other company affected,
both praised the plan. A consumer group, Toward Utility Rate
Normalization, called it ``a dangerous ride down an unmapped road.''
   The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy by
the current PUC, appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, to loosen
some of its traditional regulation and scrutiny of management
decisions by utility companies in telecommunications, energy and
transportation.
   Current phone rates are based on the commission's determination
of major phone companies' revenue needs, based on its costs,
efficiency and the state of the economy.
   Under the new system, rates will be changed annually according
to this formula: a federal inflation index called the Gross
National Product Price Index will be reduced by 4.5 percent, based
on the assumption that phone companies can increase their
productivity by that amount each year.
   For example, if inflation was 4.8 percent, the figure shown by
the index this past March, the rate increase would be .3 percent.
   The companies' basic rate of return on investment would be set
at 11.5 percent as of Jan. 1. Carl Danner, an aide to Wilk, said
the result would probably be a rate decrease of $100 million or
more for Pacific Bell next year and probably little change for GTE,
which had a 20 percent rate cut last year.
   If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of
return, stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13 percent.
Additional earnings up to 16.5 percent would be split 50-50 with
ratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5 percent would belong to
ratepayers.
   Sometime next year, the current $1.20-a-month charge for
touch-tone telephone service would be eliminated, and the free
local calling area would be expanded from eight to 12 miles.
   The PUC said Pacific Bell would be allowed to spend $405 million
to modernize its system over the next three years so that 950,000
customers would have access to services they now lack, including
touch-tone phones and blocking of ``dial-a-porn'' and other
tape-message fee calls.
   The commission will also let phone companies cut prices for some
high-tech and business-oriented services, and require the companies
to assume all financial risks of many new services while keeping
all revenues from those services.

   Raytheon Co., boosted by successful bids
for military contracts, reported Thursday its third quarter
earnings for 1989 rose 8.5 percent compared with the same
three-month period a year earlier.
   Earnings rose to $137.4 million, or $2.08 per share, on sales of
$2.189 billion in the quarter that ended Oct. 1. In the third
quarter last year, the company earned $126.7 million, or $1.91 per
share, on sales of $1.993 billion.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, earnings were
$391.9 million, or $5.94 per share, on sales of $6.552 billion. In
the same period last year, earnings were $362.3 million, or $5.43
per share, on sales of $5.983 billion.
   Thomas Phillips, Raytheon chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a prepared statement that all of the company's segments
produced higher sales and operating profits in the third quarter
compared with the year before.
   Electronics, which is Raytheon's largest segment, continued to
benefit from defense contracts, the company said. Raytheon won a
contract to develop a ground-launched missile system, in addition
to other contracts with the U.S. Air Force and Navy.
   The company reported its Beech Aircraft sales and profits
improved significantly during the quarter, as domestic orders for
commuter and business turboprops improved at a strong pace.

   Fears that a computer virus will trash
information on some personal computers are overblown, experts said
Thursday, but some alarmed users have taken steps to make sure they
don't wake up Friday the 13th with the infection.
   ``Our advice to people is stop worrying,'' said Dennis Steinauer
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. ``People
should make a backup copy of their files and don't call me in the
morning. There's virtually no way it can spread around and cause
any significant damage at all.''
   But others feel the threat is real from the so-called Columbus
Day virus, programmed to activate after computers' internal clocks
hit 12:01 a.m. Friday and begin doing its dirty work when an
operator begins using an infected program.
   ``We're talking about a communicable disease that is absolutely
indiscriminate,'' said Winn Schwartau, president of American
Computer Security Industries in Nashville, Tenn.
   ``It's not going to be Armageddon today or tomorrow. But if you
ignore it and you're infected, the risk is high for getting your
data destroyed,'' Schwartau said.
   By coincidence, more than 2,000 of the nation's top computer
security experts convened their annual meeting Thursday in
Baltimore, Md.
   Few, if any, opted to stay on the job because of the virus
threat, according to the sponsoring National Institute of Standards
and Technology and the National Computer Security Center.
   Only a tiny fraction of the nation's 40 million users of
personal computers are expected to catch the virus, officials said
at a news conference.
   ``We want to send a calming message to people that if they take
reasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than any
other,'' said Thomas P. Malarkey, deputy chief of the computer
service office of the federal National Computer Security Center.
   A computer virus is the electronic equivalent of a biological
bug. It is a malevolent program designed to sneak through a
computer system on infected disks or in programs copied over
networks from electronic bulletin boards.
   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breeding
germ, eating away processing power and storage space or even
destroying information. About 30 viruses are known to exist, not
counting strains and mutations.
   The Columbus Day virus, also known as Datacrime, is programmed
to scramble indexing information in IBM or IBM-compatible personal
computers. It would be the equivalent of zapping index cards in a
library so books would be impossible to locate.
   The virus, of unknown origin, has been identified about 12 times
since March 1, when experts discovered suspicious strings of code
that had attached themselves to programs. The confirmed cases of
Columbus Day viruses were discovered before they did any real
damage. A number of programmers, including IBM, have developed ways
to detect if a disk or program has been contaminated.
   IBM took 2,000 calls since Oct. 2 on a special hotline for
people who want its virus scanning program.
   ``We're taking the threat seriously,'' said IBM spokesman Arthur
Hill. ``You don't defeat computer viruses. You detect them and
erase them.''
   In South Carolina, the Budget and Control Board checked its
computers.
   ``It's being handled exactly like a bomb threat,'' said
spokesman Larry Huckabee. ``I think you have to be serious about
it, but not necessarily alarmist.''
   Also lurking in computer networks is another virus which has
strains known as Jerusalem, Friday the 13th or PLO.
   Russ Sura of Antiquity Piano Co. in South Amboy, N.J., on Monday
lost all the business information he had in two computers to the
Jerusalem strain.
   ``How would you feel if every piece of business information was
stuck on a computer and you couldn't get it out? Those dirty dogs.
I got hit but good,'' Sura said Thursday.
   ``They've stolen time from me. This will take two to four days
of work to correct,'' Sura said. ``This is worse than the
heartbreak of psoriasis.''
   To avoid losing information, PC users have been warned to make
duplicates of their programs. They can lower risks of infection by
avoiding disks, networks and shared programs that may be
contaminated.
   Some users also have moved up their computer clocks to make Oct.
13 ``arrive'' early and try to bring the virus out into the open.
   But some experts insist the fuss in unwarranted.
   ``You have more chance of being hit by lightning than getting
this virus,'' said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus
Industry Association in Santa Clara, Calif. ``The virus is a
phantom. It's a media virus. Nothing is going to happen.''
   Computer viruses are similiar to sick practical jokes done by
mischief-makers.
   ``Why do folks call in bomb scares? It's the thrill of knowing
you're driving a bunch of people nuts,'' said Steinauer. ``You
can't stop it anymore than you can stop people from writing
graffiti on subway walls.''
   He said that perhaps the point of the virus threat is that
computer users should take measures to protect themselves.
   ``If this threat has done nothing more than gotten everyone to
go out to make back-up files, then maybe it's not such a bad
thing,'' Steinauer said. ``The bottom line is, make a back-up and
get back to work,'' he said.

<HEAD>UAL Buyout Group Answers Labor Department Questions On Buyout</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with American Airlines questioning British
Airways' involvement in UAL deal.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines pilot and management
representatives met with Labor Department officials Thursday after
the Machinists union asked the agency to block a proposed employee
buyout of the airline, a department spokesman said.
   The agency called leaders of the UAL Corp. buyout group to
Washington ``to meet with us and describe the details of the
proposed transaction,'' said department spokesman Paul Williams.
   The Machinists union, representing more than a third of UAL's
70,000 employees, has asked the Labor Department to block the
group's $6.75 billion buyout of the nation's second-largest
airline, contending it is too high-priced and unfair to employees.
   In a letter to department officials, the Machinists said the
proposed deal violates sections of the Employment Retirement Income
Security Act, which governs use of employee investment funds.
   Williams said that after gathering the facts, the department
would ``make a judgment under the ERISA as to what, if any problems
exist with the proposed buyout.''
   Meanwhile, the United chapter of the Association of Flight
Attendants hit what it called a number of major stumbling blocks in
contract negotiations aimed at giving the attendants an ownership
stake in UAL. Union spokeswoman Carol Holmes said at least one of
those hurdles ``may prove to be insurmountable.''
   The only unionized employees committed to participating in the
buyout are United's 7,000 pilots, who are leading the takeover
group that also includes UAL's top management and British Airways
PLC.
   The company's 24,000 non-union workers would automatically
participate in an employee stock ownership plan if the buyout,
which has been approved by UAL's board, goes through.
   The pilots have said they are prepared to proceed with the
$300-a-share deal regardless of whether fellow unions participate.
Nonetheless, disunity among the workers has raised questions about
the chance of the buyout's long-term success.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL climbed $3.25 a
share to $285.
   The pilots have agreed to accept contract concessions of $250
million a year and have voted by a 9-to-1 margin to commit $200
million from their $1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock
in the employee stock ownership plan.
   In a three-page letter delivered Wednesday to Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, the Machinists charged that the tax benefits of the
proposed buyout ``are effectively subsidizing a substantial and
excessive windfall'' for UAL's management and United's pilots.
   The letter, signed by John Peterpaul, executive vice president
of the Machinists' union, also contended the purchase price
approved by UAL's board is too high and that the buyout would
result in ``significant risk and inefficiency'' caused by ``ongoing
labor strife and disharmony.''
   Peterpaul referred calls about the letter to Brian Freeman,
financial adviser for the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, who did not immediately return telephone
calls.
   Labor Department spokesman Paul Williams said agency officials
were meeting to consider the letter.
   The pilots had no comment on the letter, said spokeswoman Kathie
Hardin of the Air Line Pilots Association.
   The Machinists previously said they opposed the deal because of
the increased debt it would involve and the uncertain prospects for
the company's continued prosperity.
   The deal also is under scrutiny by the Transportation
Department, which has expressed concern about debt-financed buyouts
and foreign stakes in U.S. airlines.
   Ms. Holmes said contract negotiators for the 14,000 United
flight attendants have balked at company proposals to increase the
attendants' share of their medical costs and to increase the number
of foreign-language-speaking attendants on international flights.
   She said the latter proposal would unfairly reduce the
international flight opportunities for senior attendants who do not
speak a foreign language.
   Meanwhile Thursday, AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines,
issued a statement saying it had asked the Department of
Transportation ``to make fundamental changes'' in the air service
agreement between the United States and Great Britain before
allowing British Airways to participate in the UAL buyout.
   AMR, which is weighing a $7 billion takeover offer from Donald
Trump,
   said the UAL deal ``represents a unilateral opening of U.S.
aviation markets'' and ``it is unsound as a matter of policy, and
it is inconsistent with U.S. efforts to attain fair trading
relationships.''
   AMR spokesman Al Becker said the company did not object in
general to British Airways participation in the deal, but believes
the U.S. government should require Great Britain to open up its
markets to greater access by U.S. carriers.
   Becker said American has been stymied in its efforts to open up
non-stop Chicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because
``the British government is one of the most restrictive in the
world'' in allowing foreign carriers access to its markets.

   The Chicago Board Options Exchange won't be just
for options anymore, officials of the exchange announced Thursday.
   The world's biggest options marketplace is planning to launch a
stock market basket during the week of Oct. 23, pending Securities
and Exchange Commission approval.
   The new product, a basket made up of all the stocks in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, represents the Options Exchanges'
latest attempt to boost its trading volume, which dropped
dramatically after the 1987 stock market crash.
   The exchange reported volume of 9.69 million trades last month,
up 10 percent from 8.84 million in September 1988 but still 46
percent below the pre-crash September 1987 volume of 17.78 million
trades.
   The market basket, the exchange's first non-option product, is
designed for use by institutional investors.
   Investors who buy the market basket will actually be buying
shares in each of the 500 stocks represented in the S&amp;P 500 index,
with the number of shares in each stock determined by its relative
weight in the index.
   The basket's value will be equal to $5,000 times the S&amp;P 500
index level, or about $1.79 million currently.
   The product will lend itself to various trading strategies
involving stocks and stock options, the exchange said in a
statement.
   The Options Exchange trades options on 204 stocks, on the S&amp;P
500 and S&amp;P 100 indexes, on interest rates and on U.S. Treasury
bonds and notes.
   An option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy or sell a
commodity or financial product at a specified price by a specified
date.

<HEAD>CFTC Head to Futures Industry: Reform Now or Pay Later</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The futures industry needs to get behind
market reforms now or it will wind up paying for those enacted by
Congress without any say in the matter, a top federal futures
regulator warned Thursday.
   ``In the upcoming year, the future of the futures industry will
be written, for better or for worse, in Washington, not in Chicago
or New York,'' said Wendy L. Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   In a speech prepared for the Commodities Law Institute in
Chicago, the text of which was released here, Ms. Gramm said recent
events have placed the CFTC and the industry it oversees ``under
more public and congressional scrutiny than ever before.''
   In July, an emergency soybean futures liquidation order on the
Chicago Board of Trade, reportedly caused by an alleged attempt to
corner the market, led to wild price fluctuations that had traders
and farmers howling.
   In August, more than 40 traders and brokers at the CBOT and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the nation's two largest futures
exchanges, were indicted on a variety of charges _ including
racketeering _ for alleged schemes to defraud customers. Several
already have pleaded guilty.
   Earlier this year it was revealed that futures markets in New
York also are under investigation, although no charges have been
brought.
   After a series of congressional hearings and reports by the
General Accounting Office, the accounting arm of Congress, ``the
very legitimacy and integrity of the markets are being
challenged,'' said Ms. Gramm.
   A reform bill already has been passed by the House and another
is being considered by the Senate. The Senate Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry Committee has scheduled hearings in
Washington for Tuesday.
   Ms. Gramm said her agency supports ``the general goals'' of both
bills, which require exchanges to toughen record keeping standards
that would allow investigators to precisely reconstruct a given
transaction, a process known as following the ``audit trail.''
   But she said the agency has some reservations ``in terms of
necessity and practicability'' about aspects of the House bill that
would require recording of transactions to within 30 seconds of
their occurrance.
   The House bill also would require the CFTC to monitor and
approve changes in the margin levels, or the amount of collateral
put up to buy stock index futures.
   Ms. Gramm, a supporter of the CFTC policy of self-regulation by
the exchanges, said that could all be changed by Congress depending
on ``industry, exchange and CFTC response to the call for reforms.''
   She said the CFTC was proposing reforms to detect and deter
trading abuses but ``the industry needs to show those writing the
reform agenda in Washington that they are prepared to act, and act
decisively, to ensure market integrity. Only in this way can public
confidence in these markets be maintained.''

<HEAD>Harley-Davidson Asks for FTC Investigation of Investor</HEAD>

   Harley-Davidson Inc. said Thursday it wants the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate businessman Malcolm I.
Glazer's move to increase his group's stake in the company to 15
percent.
   Executives of Milwaukee-based Harley, the last U.S. manufacturer
of motorcycles, have said they are determined to stay independent
despite a possible takeover bid by the Glazer group.
   Glazer announced Oct. 2 that his investor group had acquired
6.24 percent of Harley stock.
   The company, in a statement, said Thursday it asked the FTC to
investigate Glazer's announcement he filed Wednesday for clearance
to raise his group's stake to 15 percent. Federal law requires FTC
clearance for such a move, but Harley said it did not receive the
required prior written notice of the filing.
   The company said it also asked the FTC to look into Glazer's
indicated expenditure of more than $15 million to acquire Harley
stock without the required advance clearance of an investment in a
company exceeding that amount.
   ``As previously announced, the company does not intend to sell
the company to Mr. Glazer or any other party and has not had any
contact with Mr. Glazer or any of his representatives,'' the Harley
statement said.
   Glazer's group, based at Rochester, N.Y., said Wednesday it was
still studying ``a full range of options'' regarding Harley.
   Harley stock lost 25 cents to close at $40.50 a share in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday.
   Last year, Glazer bought 9.9 percent of Formica Corp.'s stock
and offered to buy the entire company. His overtures were rejected
and a management-led group subsequently took the laminate maker
private.
   Glazer is chairman of First Allied Corp., which he said has
interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including
television stations, real estate, health care and banking. He said
the company has assets of more than $200 million.

<HEAD>Affiliated Publications Reports Profit for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affiliated Publications Inc., parent company of
The Boston Globe, reported Thursday it earned $8.48 million in the
third quarter though revenue declined.
   The profit for the quarter ended Sept. 24, which amounted to 12
cents a share, compared with a loss of $25.6 million, or 38 cents a
share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Affiliated said declining newspaper income in the third quarter
led to a 2.9 percent drop in overall revenue, to a total of $126.3
million, compared with revenue of $130.1 million for the same
period last year.
   Income from the company's continuing operations declined 20
percent in the third quarter, from $10.69 million to the $8.48
million net income figure, the company said.
   That figure excludes charges that stemmed from losses in
Affiliated's investment in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. of
Kirkland, Wash. Earlier this year, Affiliated restructured that
investment, separating its publishing operations from the troubled
cellular business.
   Newspaper revenue declined 4.1 percent in the third quarter, and
operating income from the newspaper declined 16.6 percent.
   William O. Taylor, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company's earnings continued to be affected by softness in
advertising volume at the Globe.
   For the first nine months of this year, income totaled $2.9
million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $51.4 million,
or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue this year
totaled $394.4 million, compared with $397.2 million for the same
period in 1988.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges, Share Prices Rebound Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar opened sharply lower against the
Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchage shot up.
   The dollar started trading at 143.60 yen, down 1.00 yen from
Thursday's Tokyo finish. In New York, it closed at 144.20 yen
overnight.
   The dollar's plunge at the opening of Tokyo trading followed its
downswing overnight in New York, where investors sold the currency
following a downtrend in the federal funds rate, said a trader with
Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously.
   The federal funds rate, the rate charged by a bank that loans
excess reserves to another bank overnight, is considered a
sensitive indicator of monetary conditions.
   Falling interest rates in the U.S. tend to lower the dollar's
value.
   The Bank of Tokyo trader said, however, that the dollar should
go up as participants bought back the currency to cover their short
dollar positions.
   Investors also were awaiting the release of the U.S. wholesale
price index for September later Friday to see if it would bring any
relaxation in U.S. monetary policy.
   Because the Bank of Japan's discount rate hike Wednesday by 0.5
percentage point to 3.75 percent and its massive dollar-selling
intervention has not been very successful in stemming the dollar's
continuting rise, a discount rate cut by the U.S. would be expected
to add stability in currency movements, he said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 242.52 points, or 0.70
percent, to move to 35,037.86 shortly after the morning session
started.
   On Thursday, the index shed 444.73 points, the second-largest
one-day loss, ending at 34,795.34.
   Dealers said the index rebounded sharply as market players
picked up issues whose prices plunged the previous day, while
traders also were reassured by the yen's overnight recovery.

<HEAD>Italian Bank Files Federal Suit Against Two Former Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banca Nazionale del Lavoro filed a suit in
federal court Thursday that charges two former officers of the
Italian bank's Atlanta office with making unauthorized credits to
Iraq.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses Christopher P.
Drogoul, former manager of the Atlanta office, and Paul Von Wedel,
a suspended vice president at the office, of concealing the
transactions and causing the bank several million dollars in losses.
   BNL, Italy's largest bank, said in the suit that the actual
amount of the losses has not been determined, though bank officials
previously said more than $1.7 billion worth of unauthorized
transactions were made. The suit does not seek specific damages.
   The suit also says others were involved in the alleged scheme,
though it does not identify additional participants.
   The suit says the alleged activities include racketeering, mail
fraud and wire fraud.
   John R. Martin, an attorney for Drogoul and Von Wedel, said late
Thursday afternoon he had not yet seen the suit but was aware it
had been filed. Martin would not respond to specific charges in the
suit but denied that any actions by the two men caused the bank to
lose money.
   ``I understand they have charged Drogoul and Von Wedel with
unauthorized transactions that have caused the bank a loss,''
Martin said. ``Our side is, whatever happened did not harm the
bank.''
   He said he would file a response to the suit within 20 days.
   BNL announced in August it had uncovered transactions by its
Atlanta branch that were neither authorized by the bank's North
American management nor its Rome headquarters.
   The developing scandal has caused shock waves both in the United
States and in Italy, where the bank is 74 percent owned by the
national treasury.
   Drogoul was fired in early September, and nine of the 15
employees in the Atlanta office later were suspended. In Italy, the
government replaced the two top officials of BNL after word of the
investigation broke.
   The suit says the time the alleged activities began has not been
determined. Drogoul and Von Wedel began working for BNL in 1984.
   The suit alleges that the unauthorized credits and loan
agreements were made to various commercial banks in Iraq, the Iraqi
Ministries of Trade, the Central Bank of Iraq and facilities in
other countries including the United States.
   ``The loan agreements and credit facilities purported to
obligate BNL to extend credit ... at interest rates, fees and other
compensation below the prevailing market rates fore such loans,''
the suit said.
   The defendants ``engaged in a conscious, deliberate and
widespread effort to conceal the existence of the agreements and
facilities and the actions'' to bank officials as well as
regulatory agencies, according to the suit.
   By doing so, the suit said, the two men violated their duties as
officials of the bank and caused the institution harm that will
continue into the foreseeable future.
