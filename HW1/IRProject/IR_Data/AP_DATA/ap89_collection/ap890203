   Teachers pressing stalled contract demands
defied threats of withheld paychecks and gave out students' midyear
grades on union report cards Friday rather than report them to the
school district as required.
   The action came after weeks of student demonstrations supporting
the teachers and amid talk of a possible teacher strike. Meanwhile,
a state mediator organized a weekend meeting between the union and
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
   A union spokeswoman said the ``vast majority'' of teachers at
junior and senior high schools refused to report grades to the
school district, as required by school regulations.
   District spokeswoman Tammy Sims said 69 percent of the high
school teachers did not turn in grades. The school system's tally
for junior high teachers was not completed by Friday night, she said.
   United Teachers-Los Angeles printed up 400,000 report cards to
give to students, said spokeswoman Catherine M. Carey.
   ``Both members and non-members are participating,'' Carey said.
   Carey also said the union agreed to a state mediator's urging
that both sides in the long-running dispute meet Sunday.
   On Thursday, union President Wayne Johnson called for a
negotiating session between just the seven school board members and
seven union officers. But the meeting Sunday will include the
district superintendent and the district's chief negotiator.
   The union action on grades involved the 117,477 students in
junior highs, the 119,904 students in senior highs, and secondary
students among the 27,000 students at so-called magnet schools and
centers, Carey said.
   High school seniors have been concerned that the action would
affect their university applications, but Carey said those students
have been told to take the union report cards to their counselors
for forwarding to universities.
   The spokeswoman said both California university systems and the
Ivy League schools have said the grades will be recognized.
   The contract covers 26,000 classroom teachers and about 6,000
librarians, nurses, counselors and other certificated employees,
Carey said. Of that 32,000, about 22,000 are union members.
   The teachers have been without a contract since June. The union
has been seeking a 12 percent pay hike while the district offered
about 17 percent over three years.
   Current salaries range from starting pay of $23,440 to a maximum
of $43,319. The average salary is $36,600.
   Total district enrollment from the elementary level through high
school is more than 594,000.

   The February Freeze spread Thursday to New England and the
mid-Atlantic states, while wind and cold lingering in the nation's
heartland and Northwest endangered livestock and crops and made
venturing outside hazardous.
   A band of freezing rain extended from Texas to New England; heavy
snow was reported in parts of the central Rockies; and wind-chill
readings hit 75 below or lower in parts of Montana, the Dakotas and
Wyoming.
   The cold and snow led to a short workday for state workers in
Montana, unexpected school and university holidays in several states
and highway accidents. Ranchers reported that newborn calves were
dying in the cold, and citrus growers took precautions to keep the
deep freeze from harming their crops.
   The misery stemmed from an ocean of cold air that poured down
from Alaska early in the week, after a shift in the jet stream. By
midday Thursday, its effects in the Lower 48 were being felt across
a vast, roughly triangular area from the Pacific Northwest to Texas
to New England, areas that had enjoyed in many cases their warmest
January in years.
   Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66 degrees Wednesday.
Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31-degree air, and
light freezing rain was falling.
   In Montana, which continued to post the lowest temperatures
outside Alaska, Gov. Stan Stephens sent all non-essential state
workers home Thursday. The capital, Helena, grappled not only with
the bitter cold but with a train derailment and explosion that
forced the evacuation of thousands of people and disrupted
electrical power.
   Montana's two largest universities shut down through the weekend.
   ``It's not the cold, because we've been open in much colder
weather,'' said Bill Tietz, president of Montana State University at
Bozeman. ``It's the wind chill we're concerned about.''
   Classes were canceled at many South Dakota schools because of the
wind chill and blowing snow. Schools also were closed North Dakota,
Oregon and elsewhere.
   Temperatures overnight dipped to 34 below in three Montana towns:
Great Falls, Lewistown, and Cut Bank; and their wind-chill readings
were as low as 78 below. In Billings, the record low for a Feb. 2
used to be 13 degrees below zero; on Thursday, it went to 28 below,
and 20 below was the high for the day.
   In all, six record lows for the date were posted, including
Astoria, Ore., with 18 above; Casper, Wyo., 27 below; and Sheridan,
Wyo., 28 below.
   But temperature records at the other end of the scale, though not
so widespread as on Wednesday, also were racked up Thursday. Nearly
30 record highs were set, including Asheville, N.C., 76 degrees;
Cape Hatteras, N.C., 74; Charlotte, N.C., 80; Norfolk, Va. 80;
Richmond, Va., 78; and Wilmington, N.C., 80.
   In Alaska, temperatures remained in the cellar near the Canadian
border but warmed up elsewhere. Early Thursday it was 37 degrees at
Adak in the Aleutian Islands, and 59 degrees below zero at Northway.
   At least four traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather, and
in Edmonds, Wash., a 35-year-old utility worker died Thursday when
he fell while trying to repair a downed power line.
   In Martin, S.D., a 50-year-old man was found dead Thursday
morning in a vacant lot. Bennett County Chief Deputy Sheriff Craig
Dillon said the man's death apparently was caused by exposure. The
overnight temperature in Martin was about 25 below zero, with a wind
chill of 60 below.
   The man ``fell down and you could see where he struggled in the
snow to regain his feet, but he was unable to do so,'' Dillon said.
   But a life was saved in North Dakota, when searchers Thursday
found a 16-year-old boy who got lost Monday while driving to his
family's farm. Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland was coherent but
``too wrung out to show any emotion'' aside from saying ``I'm
thankful that I'm alive,'' said volunteer rescuer Greg Mitchell.
   The boy, who had only light clothing and car mats to keep him
warm, had badly frostbitten feet and hands and was hospitalized in
stable condition. Overnight temperatures in the area had plunged to
30 degrees below zero.
   Heaviest snow was reported in the Rockies. Craig, Colo., reported
6 new inches by midmorning, while 11{ inches were reported in
northern Larimer County, Colo., and 4 inches at Laramie, Wyo. Snow
also fell in the upper Midwest.
   In northern California, snow blanketed the Sierra, dusted San
Francisco Bay area mountains and fell over beachfront communities.
   Freezing rain extended as far south as Texas, and forecasters
said there was a chance that below-freezing temperatures could
extend to the southern part of the state by the weekend.
   Nervous citrus growers in south Texas, still recovering from a
devastating freeze in 1983, were taking precautions, officials said.
   ``As people have been leaving my store today I've been telling
them to go to church Sunday and pray for us,'' said Mardy Eggers
from her family's Rio Grande Valley citrus farm, Eggers Acres.
   Montana ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves that
died from exposure within hours.
   One rancher, Dr. George Ingham, said he lost two calves.
   ``We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big
100-pounder was dead,'' Ingham said. ``It's the wind chill out on
this prairie.''
   Workers at Double M Farms feedlot near Kearney, Neb., put
acetylene torches to some water tanks for cattle, part-owner Steve
Mercer said. They also had to stir the cattle feed so it wouldn't
freeze.
   Power outages blamed on the weather were reported in Washington,
Montana, Utah and Nebraska. Officials in Norfolk, Neb., theorized
that a power line contracted so tightly in 58 below wind-chills that
it just snapped.
   Still, there were signs that people were getting used to the
weather.
   ``A lot more people are staying home,'' Portland, Ore., police
spokesman Henry Groepper said Thursday. ``Traffic was definitely
lighter today ... (and) I think people have just adjusted more to
the weather.''
   Forecasters said the deep freeze would last for at least a few
more days in most affected areas.

   In the mining town of
Carletonville, officials voted this week to erect a fence to keep
blacks off the civic center's lawn.
   In Johannesburg, a mob of whites threatened to kill an Indian man
who hoped to be their neighbor.
   Near Cape Town, a blond, 5-year-old boy was expelled last week
from an all-white nursery school. Wayne Shirley was ``a lovely and
intelligent boy,'' the principal in Kraaifontein said, and he was
legally classified as white, but he could not stay because his
mother had mixed racial ancestry.
   Practices like these pervade South African society. What sets the
country apart, however, is not the existence of racism, but the fact
that it is permitted, even mandated, by many of the people in power.
   When right-wing whites resegregated parks in the city of Boksburg
last year and blocked the Indian man from moving into their
neighborhood last weekend, they were scolded by the government and
the press. But they had the law on their side.
   Employers face no penalties if they hire according to race, but
colorblind landlords face heavy fines. Government schools must
practice segregation, and private schools are entitled to do so.
Municipal governments are empowered to bar blacks from parks, buses
or beaches.
   ``The racists and bigots will exploit laws as long as they remain
on the statute books,'' said Brian Currin, director of Lawyers for
Human Rights.
   President P.W. Botha's government has spoken out against racism
with increasing frequency in recent years. In November, it banned a
small white-supremacist group, and it has outlawed the incitement of
racial hostility.
   ``If apartheid means ... racial discrimination and encroachment
on human dignity, then I reject it out of hand,'' Botha said in 1986.
   But rarely is the government's rhetoric accompanied by tough
action. The recent banning of the White Liberation Movement has not
been followed by steps against the larger, more powerful Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, despite its white-supremacist ideology,
Nazi-style symbols and paramilitary training programs.
   Nor did police disperse the mob that gathered Sunday outside a
house in Johannesburg's Mayfair West district, draped a noose over a
wall, and shouted threats at the Indian who planned to move his
family into the white neighborhood.
   ``Years of forced separation and years of racist indoctrination
have resulted in people behaving in such abominable ways,'' said The
Sowetan, a black newspaper, in a subsequent editorial.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in an interview
that the Mayfair West incident could have happened in the United
States or Britain.
   The government was conducting a ``campaign of persuasion'' to
diminish white racism, he said, ``but if you overdo that, you create
a reaction.''
   ``The eradication of racism from a society is a very complicated,
long-term undertaking, as evidenced by the American experience,''
van der Merwe said. ``Compared to 10 years ago, we've made
tremendous progress.''
   Van der Merwe described Wayne Shirley's expulsion from nursery
school as ``very unfortunate.''
   ``When one lives in a society in a state of change, there is a
gap between morality and legality,'' he said, noting that the
principal acted lawfully.
   The government says blatant racism will worsen South Africa's
international isolation, but it refuses to outlaw segregation of
local facilities or residential areas.
   ``Unfortunately, the government is unable to act decisively in
such matters,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper.
   Prosecuting non-whites who live in white areas would ``create
racial tensions at home and damaging publicity abroad,'' it said
this week. But if the government scrapped the Group Areas Act, ``it
would lose its constituency.''
   Racism is practiced most enthusiastically by extreme-right
whites, who Thursday launched a whites-only rugby league.
   But bigotry exists in relatively liberal neighborhoods as well.
In Johannesburg's wealthy northern suburbs, where most voters back
anti-apartheid candidates, doctors willing to treat black servants
ask them to use separate waiting rooms.
   Neighborhood newspapers in those suburbs carry ads for
``European-supervised'' plumbing or electrical services. Readers
know this means that if blacks come to their house to do repairs, a
white man will be in charge.
   Despite the entrenchment of racial divisions, many South Africans
are working to overcome them.
   Church groups have sponsored workshops in which whites stay
overnight in black townships, while blacks live with whites. Several
multiracial private schools are flourishing.
   Amanda Shirley, the mother of the expelled nursery school
student, said she will seek out one of these schools for her
children, ``where they will realize that they are equal to and no
better than any other child.''

   Satirical cartoonists have launched a scathing
attack on Buddhism and superstitious rituals such as fortunetelling,
which are enjoying a resurgence after 40 years of communist
suppression.
   ``Today you will suffer financial losses,'' a fortuneteller in
one cartoon intones as he holds a customer's palm in one hand and
takes a hefty fee with the other.
   Another shows a man with a bad leg going from temple to temple to
pray for healing and finally being carried into a hospital on a
stretcher.
   More than 120 such cartoons were part of an exhibit called ``Away
With Superstition and Ignorance,'' shown this week in Beijing and
four other cities.
   Cartoonist Xu Jin said the artists timed the show for just before
the Feb. 6 celebration of the Lunar New Year, traditionally one of
the most superstitious dates on the Chinese calendar.
   Setting off firecrackers, still popular on the holiday,
originally was intended to scare away evil spirits.
   ``We have a mission to help educate people,'' Xu said. ``It's not
just a matter of people losing money to witch doctors and
fortunetellers, it's also a problem of increasing the scientific
spirit.''
   The rebuilding of temples and the worship of Buddhist gods also
come in for heavy attack.
   One cartoon shows a man answering the telephone in a government
office and telling the caller that all the officials have ``gone to
the front line.''
   ``Where exactly?''
   ``To the Dragon King Temple to burn incense,'' comes the answer.
   Wang Xiuqiao of the Chinese Research Institute for Popularizing
Science, which helped organize the exhibit, said it often is hard to
separate religion from superstition.
   ``Religion often uses superstitious elements, for example, if it
claims to be able to cure people who are ill,'' she said.
   China says it allows freedom of religion. But it is more tolerant
of Christianity _ which most Chinese see as alien _ and other
minority religions than it is of Buddhism, which has deep roots
among the Chinese and greater potential to spread.
   Religion and superstition played a large role in daily life in
pre-Communist China, especially in the countryside.
   Omens were seen in everyday events _ such as a crow passing
overhead _ and people consulted diviners before making important
decisions. Single women made offerings at ``maidens' temples'' in
hopes of finding good husbands, and married women prayed to other
gods for sons.
   The communists quashed most such practices after taking power in
1949. But the rituals have enjoyed a comeback recently as the
government has relaxed controls and peasants have acquired more
money.
   In the prosperous southeast, rice fields once again are dotted
with small ancestral shrines and tombs newly built by peasants or
renovated after decades of neglect.
   ``After they build a new house and buy a washing machine, (rich
peasants) have nothing else to spend money on so they rebuild the
family shrine,'' Ms. Wang said. ``Also, they want to show their
gratitude for their wealth and ask the gods to keep the government
from changing its policies'' of allowing some private industry.
   The official media often complain that building shrines and tombs
wastes money and land, and call diviners and witch doctors cheats.
   All were targets at the cartoon exhibit, which drew about 24,000
viewers during an eight-day showing at the China Art Gallery in
Beijing.
   One that drew chuckles from viewers showed a spiritualist telling
a fearful family that their goat, chicken and TV set harbored evil
spirits. The spiritualist loaded them onto his cart and set off,
calling cheerfully, ``Now I have all the evil spirits.''
   Others took swipes at the new fad of computerized fortunetelling,
touted by its hawkers as scientific. Customers feed their birthdate
into a computer and get a printout with their fortune.
   ``We just came to laugh; hardly anyone in Beijing believes in
these things,'' said a young woman who giggled over the cartoons
with her boyfriend.
   Ms. Wang agreed most city dwellers aren't as superstitious as
rural residents.
   But she said even in the cities people are turning to old beliefs
because of a crisis of faith in the government.
   During the 1960s and 1970s, she said, ``people developed the
habit of worshipping Chairman Mao (Tse-tung) as a god. Now they
don't have Mao so they look for other gods.''

   Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan
appeared Thursday at the racially troubled University of
Massachusetts and angrily told Jewish protesters they had no right
to call him a hate-monger.
   Farrakhan told an audience of 2,000 that he did not come to the
college to pit blacks against Jews, but he said blacks learned how
to hate from the hatred directed at them.
   ``To those Jewish students who see me as a Hitler, as a hater, I
wish you life, I wish you life. I don't wish to see any human
forfeit his life,'' said the leader of the Chicago-based Nation of
Islam.
   But, Farrakhan added, ``Your people taught us to hate ourselves
for years, and you have a hell of a nerve to see me today and call
me a hate-monger.''
   Farrakhan said whites should leave blacks to solve their problems
themselves.
   ``If the Jewish students come together to work out some family
matter, we shouldn't call that racism,'' he said. ``No one outside
the family should dare to interfere with our family problems.''
   He said more separation between the races is needed to combat
black feelings of inferiority.
   ``We don't need a bedroom relationship with white people, we want
a boardroom relationship. Perhaps some other time we might want to
entertain some social contacts.''
   Farrakhan added, ``When we awaken, we will march against every
vestige of oppression, and if you challenge us, then we are going to
clash with you until death separates us from life or you from life.
But why should that be?''
   More than 500 students held a quiet candlelight march prior to
Farrakhan's visit, while members of a militant Jewish group led
students in a loud demonstration outside the hall in which the black
leader spoke.
   ``Farrakhan is a Nazi without a swastika,'' declared Mordechai
Levi, the New York-based head of the Jewish Defense Organization.
``He should be in Libya, not in this campus.''
   The visit by Farrakhan and the 38 guards he calls the Fruit of
Islam nearly coincided with the first anniversary of a campus
building takeover by 100 minority students to protest racial
violence at this 30,000-student school in western Massachusetts.
   Farrakhan was promised $11,000 by a black fraternity and a campus
speaker program to talk at the university's Fine Arts Center.
Tickets sold out within a day.
   Farrakhan came to national attention in 1984 for calling Judaism
``a gutter religion'' and making other anti-Semitic remarks that his
supporters say have been taken out of context in his campaign to
foster black pride.
   The Amherst campus has been the scene of racial strife since a
fight broke out among black and white students after the Boston Red
Sox loss to the New York Mets in the final game of the 1986 World
Series.
   On Feb. 11, 1988, minority students began a weeklong occupation
of a university building to protest another racial scuffle. The
takeover, which was the first of several around the Northeast, ended
with the chancellor's agreement to boost programs for minority
students.

   British spymaster Sir William Samuel
Stephenson, the legendary ``man called Intrepid'' whose vast
intelligence web snared German spies in the United States during
World War II, died at his home. He was 93.
   Stephenson operated out of New York during the war and was given
his famous code name and a virtual carte blanche to conduct
espionage by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He died on
Tuesday and was buried the next day.
   Sources close to him said he died peacefully at home and had
instructed that his death not be announced until after his burial.
   Stephenson, the son of a lumber mill owner, was born in Winnipeg,
Canada, in 1896 and became an engineer. During World War I, he was a
pilot in the Royal Air Force and shot down 26 German planes.
   He became a millionaire industrialist by the age of 30, largely
as a result of inventing in the 1920s a method of sending pictures
by wire. He made a fortune through other business ventures and even
found time to win the world amateur light heavyweight boxing
championship.
   But his most famous exploits came after 1940, when he was tapped
by Churchill to put together the most potent intelligence netork of
its kind.
   He was sent to New York officially to establish an organization
to protect British shipping during the war and counter the
activities of Nazi spies. But in fact, the operation he set up was
later acknowledged to be the hub of all the branches of British
intelligence.
   He also was reported to be the link between Churchill and
Roosevelt in the years before the United States entered the war.
   He became Britain's top operator in the Americas and was
responsible for training in Canada a cadre of spies and saboteurs
who operated in Nazi-occuped Europe.
   He set up shop in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center with the
approval of President Roosevelt and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover,
but without of the official knowledge of the State Department, which
was observing neutrality because the United States had not yet
entered the war.
   Stephenson and his agents secretly killed at least three German
operatives in America and ran clandestine operations to discredit
U.S. politicians who opposed aid to Britain, according to the
popular book on the operation, ``A Man Called Intrepid'' by William
Stevenson.
   The book chronicled a dazzling series of successes ranging from
code-breaking to dropping agents into occupied Europe. He was a
severe anti-communist after the war.
   He already had retired by the time his exploits became public,
mostly through Stevenson's 1976 book and the author's subsequent
``Intrepid's Last Case'' in 1983.
   Stephenson stayed out of the public eye until 1987, when Peter
Wright's book Spycatcher became famous because of the British
government's attempts to suppress it.
   He went on record as saying that he believed the late Sir Roger
Hollis, head of the MI5 British spy agency, was a Soviet double
agent.
   ``Hollis ... was a bad egg if ever there was one,'' he told the
Royal Gazette newspaper in Bermuda.

<HEAD>LaRouche Followers Seek To Block Further Distribution of `Dangerous'
Column</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jailed political extremist Lyndon LaRouche has
filed a lawsuit to stop distribution of a newspaper column that he
says could incite other inmates to harm him because it calls him a
``cat-killer,'' a lawyer said.
   The column by Mike Royko, syndicated through the Chicago Tribune,
contends that LaRouche followers have killed cats of LaRouche
opponents _ a claim LaRouche followers deny.
   ``I hope that this column finds its way to his fellow inmates,''
Royko wrote in the column, printed Monday in the Chicago Tribune and
distributed to about 500 newspapers. ``They should know that they
have a cat-killer in their midst. And I hope any cat-lovers among
them do whatever they feel is appropriate.''
   Michael Null, the Chicago lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Cook
County Circuit Court, said Thursday the column is ``nothing less
than inciting people to violence.'' Null said that is not something
writers can do under constitutional protections of freedom of the
press.
   ``This is a case of a verbal act ... solicitation to commit a
crime, to do great bodily harm to Mr. LaRouche or do murder,'' Null
said.
   But Royko, in a telephone interview later Thursday, said violence
against LaRouche was not his intent.
   As to what is ``appropriate'' for other inmates to do with
LaRouche, Royko said, ``They should lecture him ... they should tell
him to caution his people against picking on cats.''
   A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., sentenced LaRouche to 15
years in prison Friday for scheming to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service and deliberately defaulting on more than $30 million in
loans from supporters.
   LaRouche, 66, a three-time presidential fringe candidate, was
sent to the Alexandria County Jail to await transfer to a federal
prison.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, originally stressed the importance
of keeping the Royko column out of the Washington Times, which Null
said is distributed in the Alexandria jail. However, the column ran
in the newspaper on Wednesday.
   Null said the lawsuit would still be pressed to avoid any further
distribution, and to seek a permanent injunction against any further
columns that might incite people to harm LaRouche.
   A hearing on the lawsuit was set for Friday, Null said.

   Rioters threw rocks and bottles and set trash
bins on fire Thursday in the second night of violence after a
suspected drug dealer died in police custody.
   Police cordoned off the same predominantly black neighborhood
where about 100 officers in riot gear quelled the first outbreak
Wednesday night by about 75 young people, many ages 12 to 14.
   The melee erupted after the arrest of Edgar Allen Price, 40, in
an undercover bust. It took eight police officers to subdue Price.
   Police attempted to ward off further trouble in the College Hill
section Thursday by releasing details of the arrest. Price, who is
black, was not beaten or choked but died of cardiac arrest of
undetermined cause, Deputy Chief Thomas DePolis said at a news
conference.
   At sundown, however, more violence erupted, and 70 officers
responded. Police reported making nine arrests for inciting to riot,
including two juveniles and four members of the African People's
Socialist Party from St. Petersburg. There was no official estimate
of the number of people involved in the unrest.
   ``Many of these people that were arrested tonight were
outsiders,'' said Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman, who added the
situation was under control late Thursday.
   ``The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots,
you're going to get arrested,'' she said, vowing to stay in the area
as long as necessary.
   An officer hit by a brick, Sgt. B.J. Curry, was treated and
released at Tampa General Hospital.
   A couple of trash bins were set ablaze and there was sporadic
rock and bottle throwing over a three-hour period, said Sgt. Walter
Sluga.
   On Wednesday night, a grocery store was looted and torched and
two shotgun blasts were fired at a news van. One man was arrested,
and at least four officers injured in the disturbance.
   Price, a 6-foot-3, 300-pound man, struggled with two undercover
officers after an informant made a drug buy in the housing complex,
said police spokesman Steve Cole.
   DePolis gave this account of events:
   When the two plainclothes officers tried to arrest Price, he
picked one up off the ground with one hand and punched the other
repeatedly in the face. Price suffered a 2-inch gash from a blow to
the head, then wrestled free and tried to flee to his girlfriend's
apartment as two backup officers arrived.
   The four officers struck Price with their nightsticks on his arm
and leg, but he again pulled free.
   ``Two more officers arrived and all six officers go tumbling into
the living room fighting with this man,'' DePolis said. The officers
finally managed to slap handcuffs and leg manacles on Price.
   The girlfriend's mother, who uses a pacemaker and a walker, ended
up under the pileup. Paramedics arrived to treat the woman, who was
not identified, the officer with the broken nose and to dress
Price's head wound.
   When the rock- and bottle-throwing began, police put Price in a
cruiser and drove around the block for safety, which took about 45
seconds.
   ``Medical personnel looked in the car and realized he was
suffering cardiac arrest,'' said DePolis. Paramedics treated Price
and rushed him to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead less than 90 minutes after the arrest.
   The suspect was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded
25-caliber derringer in his pockets, Cole said.
   Price, of Houston, was sentenced in 1974 to 50 years on a Texas
robbery conviction and also had a 1967 robbery arrest on his record,
said Cole, adding he did not know the disposition of that case.
   Officials cordoned off four intersections in the 22-block housing
development and summoned 100 police officers and 30 firefighters to
quell the disturbance.
   Gene Bexley, owner of Bexley's Bar-B-Q in the neighborhood, said
some of the young people looted a grocery store before it was set on
fire.
   ``Once they broke it, it took 10 to 15 minutes and they cleared
it out,'' he said. ``Some went in, then things come flying out
windows and doors.''
   The fire forced choir members at the Deliverance Tabernacle
Church to move an organ and other valuables into a truck as a
precaution.
   A young man with a 10-gauge shotgun fired on a WFLA-TV van, said
cameraman Rugene Moore, who was not injured.
   The College Hill neighborhood and housing development have been
the site of frequent confrontations between residents and police in
recent years, including an incident last April when a crowd 400
threw rocks and bottles after the arrest of a robbery suspect, and a
violent outbreak in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died
in police custody. A white police officer who used a neck hold to
subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing and the neck hold
was banned.
   ``People feel trapped and they're ready to explode when something
even looks like brutality,'' said Eliott Johnson, pastor of Blessed
Hope Ministries two blocks from the looted grocery store. ``...
We're still sitting on a keg of dynamite down here.'
   Last month, blacks in Miami rioted for several days after a
police officer fatally shot a speeding black motorcyclist.

   A domestic airliner taking off from Rangoon
airport crashed Friday after striking a tree, killing 26 people and
injuring the three other people aboard, the state radio said.
   Four more people were injured on the ground when the Burma
Airways Fokker Friendship 27 crashed near housing for families of
air force personnel at Mingaladon Airport, Radio Rangoon said.
   The radio gave engine failure as the cause of the crash, Burma's
fourth since mid-1987. It said the turboprop failed to gain altitude
and hit the tree shortly after takeoff on a flight to Kengtung, 380
miles northeast of Rangoon.
   The aircraft carried 25 passengers, a pilot, co-pilot and two
stewards. The report did not identify the three survivors and
described victims on the ground as family members of air force
personnel.
   All on board were presumed to be Burmese nationals, since
Kengtung is normally off limits to foreigners due to security
problems in the area.
   Burma Airways has lost four Fokker 27s, a Dutch-manufactured
aircraft, since June 21, 1987, when 45 people were killed after a
takeoff from Heho airport in the Shan States.
   All 49 persons on board were killed near Pagan in central Burma
in a crash on Oct. 11, 1987.
   On June 16, a chartered aircraft crashed on a flight from
Myitkyina to Putao in northern Burma and all four persons aboard
were killed.
   Several others crashes occurred in earlier years.
   Burma's tiny fleet of eight aircraft is plagued by a shortage of
spare parts and poor maintenance. After Friday's crash, the airline
has only five Fokker 27s for domestic service and three Fokker 28
jets for international flights.

<HEAD>Producers Reduce Flocks to Raise Egg Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's egg producers are shipping lazy
hens off to the soup factory in an effort to reduce flock sizes, but
even those stern measures are unlikely to return quick profits to
the battered industry.
   Department economists say that losses to egg producers in 1988
were the highest since USDA began keeping those financial records 17
years ago.
   As of Jan. 1, the hen flock that produces table eggs _ the kind
in cartons _ was estimated by USDA at 233.4 million birds, 6 percent
fewer than a year earlier. Overall hen flocks, including hens
producing eggs to hatch new chicks, declined 5 percent to 271.3
million birds.
   ``This was the largest liquidation of layers since the avian
influenza outbreak in 1983,'' says economist Robert V. Bishop.
   Egg consumption is expected to continue its decline to around 235
eggs per person this year from an average of about 243 in 1988 and
259 in 1984. according to the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Health concerns relating to cholesterol content may be
affecting egg consumption,'' the agency said in a recent report.
``At the same time, egg producers have spent little money on
changing the image of eggs or convincing consumers that eggs are not
just for breakfast.''
   Meanwhile, egg prices at the farm were erratic at times in 1988
but wound up the year averaging 62.1 cents per dozen, about the same
as in 1987.
   But production costs have risen in recent years, and in 1988
producers nationally lost an average of 5.2 cents per dozen.
   Lawrence A. Witucki, another USDA economist, said Thursday in a
telephone interview that the 1988 loss of 5.2 cents per dozen eggs
was the second poor year in a row for egg producers, who barely
broke even nationally with an average net return of 0.2 cents in
1987.
   According to agency records, he said, producers averaged a net
profit of 6.9 cents in 1986 before rising feed costs and other
expenses cut margins. Last year was the first real loss since 1980,
when producers had a negative average of 3.5 cents per dozen, he
said.
   Further, Witucki said, last year's 5.2 cents was the largest
annual loss since the agency began keeping track in 1972, a year
when egg producers lost an average of 2.8 cents per dozen.
   As with any national figures, he said, some egg producers have
made money and others have lost. The yearly averages are general
indicators of how the industry is faring.
   ``We expect more negatives in the first half (of 1989), with feed
prices playing a role,'' Witucki said. ``Hopefully, with normal
crops, feed prices should decline in the second half. But I'm afraid
it doesn't look real bright.''
   All states have some commercial egg production, even Alaska with
an output of about 700,000 eggs last year. The top 10 and their 1988
output in millions of eggs:
   California, 7,718.
   Indiana, 5,644.
   Pennsylvania, 5,302.
   Ohio, 4,477.
   Georgia, 4,294.
   Arkansas, 3,784.
   North Carolina, 3,396.
   Texas, 3,363.
   Florida, 2,758.
   Alabama, 2,596.

   Japan is a growing consumer of nuts, but an
Agriculture Department report says American exporters are finding
the market a bit hard to crack.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said that Japanese
imports of tree nuts increased more than 40 percent in five years to
almost 64,000 metric tons worth $220 million in 1987.
   Although U.S. almonds and walnuts are on the upswing in Japan,
some other foreign suppliers are much bigger for certain kinds of
nuts.
   Japan has no quotas on the import of tree nuts, the report said.
But import duties have ranged from 4 percent for almonds to 9
percent for pistachios and macadamia nuts, 10 percent for hazelnuts
and 16 percent for chestnuts and walnuts.
   However, under the U.S-Japan beef and citrus agreement signed
last July, Japan agreed to eliminate the duty on pistachios, lower
it for macadamias and pecans to 5 percent, and reduce the walnut
duty to 10 percent, the report said.
   ``Although the U.S. share of the market for pistachios, hazelnuts
and macadamia nuts are relatively small, sales have increased
notably in the past few years and the future appears bright,'' the
report said.
   Iran is the main supplier of pistachios to Japan, Turkey is the
largest provider of hazelnuts, and Kenya has more than half of the
market for macadamia nuts.

   The Agriculture Department has proposed to
sharply increase inspection user fees on imported flue-cured and
burley tobacco.
   J. Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said Thursday that all flue-cured and burley that
is affirmed by importers to be free of prohibited pesticides is
currently assessed fees of 0.1 cents per pound for USDA verification.
   The proposal would raise the fee to 0.35 cents per pound and
establish a minimum fee of $162 per shipment for sampling and
testing.
   Boyle said that tobacco not affirmed by importers to be free of
banned chemicals is currently charged an additional fee of 0.3 cents
per pound to cover USDA's more extensive testing. The proposal would
raise this fee to 0.35 cents.
   The 1985 farm law required USDA to revise its fees to reflect
changing costs in the inspection and testing of imported tobacco, he
said.
   Public comments on the proposed rule changes can be sent by March
6 to: Director, Tobacco Division, Room 502 Annex Building, AMS,
USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090-6456.

   President Bush says he is much better, thank
you, and so all Washington can breathe a sigh of relief and put
William Henry Harrison out of mind.
   Bush caught a stubborn cold a few days after taking office two
weeks ago, and it was the sort thing that calls attention to itself
in a new president.
   His voice turned raspy, and he apologized to an audience of
sailors in Norfolk, Va., Tuesday for ``just croaking away.'' On
Wednesday he lost his voice altogether to laryngitis, and greeted
guests at a diplomatic reception that night in a bare whisper. He
canceled a speech, looked flushed, said he was taking antibiotics
for an ear infection, and kept saying it was only a cold.
   But, ``I'm a totally new man,'' he reported Thursday. ``All well.
Totally recovered.''
   Bush likes to compare himself to Martin Van Buren, but it was Van
Buren's successor in the White House, Harrison, who came uneasily to
mind.
   Harrison, 68, gaunt, malnourished and apparently suffering from
ulcers, delivered the longest inaugural address on record _ one hour
and 45 minutes _ in cold, blustery, wet weather on March 4, 1841. A
month later, he was dead in the White House.
   He refused to wear a hat or coat when riding a horse to his
inauguration and then, despite the weather, declined to shorten his
8,578-word speech. He led a parade back to the White House and that
night attended three inaugural balls. He caught a cold.
   Harassed and fatigued from the demands of office seekers, he was
unable to shake it off. No help was offered by the environment of a
poorly heated White House.
   According to ``Medical Cover-Ups in the White House,'' by Edward
B. MacMahon, a doctor, and Leonard Curry, a journalist, published in
1987, Harrison _ like many presidents _ was given inadequate care.
   ``American presidential history is filled with examples of
medical treatment that has ranged from questionable to downright
incompetent,'' the authors say.
   By March 27, Harrison, who had avoided standard medical treatment
all his life, was willing to submit to the doctors.
   He and they both ``knew that the diagnosis _ pneumonia of the
right lower lobe of the lung with congestion of the liver _
constituted, in those days, a fatal complication,'' the book says.
   The doctors first blistered the skin on the right side of his
chest, then applied suction cups to draw out what they considered to
be the offensive substance making the president ill. That weakened
him.
   Next they induced vomiting, gave him castor oil to purge his
bowels and finally gave him sedatives in the form of opium and
brandy. As a last resort, they tried a Seneca Indian remedy,
Virginia snakeweed. It didn't work, either.
   Bush's treatment was presumably more medically relevant than
Harrison's and presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was able to
pronounce his boss fit Thursday afternoon.
   ``His prognosis is excellent,'' he said. ``He's in good shape.
His voice is getting stronger. He feels well.''
   So Washington relaxed. People here laughed again at what comedian
Mark Russell said during an inauguration event _ that the five most
feared words in Washington were, ``Barbara, I don't feel well.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel May Seek Testimony from Navajo Chairman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate investigative committee may summon the
head of the nation's largest Indian tribe to address allegations he
accepted cash payments and favors from contractors seeking work on
its reservation.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said after Thursday's committee
session that he is ``pursuing'' the question of whether to invite
Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald to testify before the panel, and
whether to subpoena him if necessary.
   A special investigative committee of the Senate Select Committee
on Indian Affairs has been holding hearings all week in which
allegations have been made of corruption and mismanagement in
federal Indian programs and on reservations. The investigation was
inspired by a series of reports in The Arizona Republic and other
publications.
   Two white construction company owners and a Navajo contractor,
testifying under immunity, spoke Thursday of free airplane rides,
cash payments and other favors they gave MacDonald in hopes of
increasing their business on the 25,000-square-mile Navajo Nation
reservation in northeastern Arizona and adjoining parts of Utah and
New Mexico.
   They and another Indian construction official also said it was
common for non-Indians to create dummy companies headed by Indians
in order to qualify for federally financed projects set aside for
members of the minority group.
   Tribal spokeswoman Tazbah McCullah, speaking from tribal offices
in Window Rock, Ariz., said the accounts of fraud and abuse made
during the week were ``malicious allegations'' designed to
``discredit the integrity of the Navajo nation, its people,
government and sovereignty.''
   She said a delegation of 11 tribal officials would travel to
Washington, perhaps by Monday, to testify to the Senate panel. She
said MacDonald would not be among them.
   DeConcini said the committee would hear next week about organized
crime and sexual abuses connected with Indian programs.
   Thursday's session focused on favors allegedly provided to
MacDonald, 60.
   Contractor John A. Paddock of Marana, Ariz., testified he had
offered MacDonald the use of a company airplane and pilot during the
chairman's 1986 re-election campaign. He said MacDonald ended up
taking about 35 flights, many of them after his November 1986
election and including two trips to Las Vegas, Nev.
   Paddock said he had not been reimbursed for the trips. He said
the flights cost him $12,000 in pilot and fuel costs, and would have
been worth more than $60,000 commercially.
   Paddock said his company was declared ineligible to work on the
Navajo reservation by Peterson Zah, who had ousted MacDonald from
the chairmanship in 1982. The company was recertified for contracts
after MacDonald recaptured the position.
   Paddock said MacDonald asked him for a $35,000 one-year loan in
December 1987, money Paddock gave MacDonald and has not been repaid.
   The contractor said he paid many of the expenses of the two Las
Vegas trips he and MacDonald took with their wives and other
couples; lent a company truck to MacDonald's daughter, Hope; and
paid a $400 bill he received for her use of the vehicle's telephone.
He said he also contributed $2,500 to a birthday party for the
chairman's wife, Wanda, and was later reimbursed for only about half
of the amount.
   Franz A. Springer, a contractor from Albuquerque, N.M., and his
Navajo partner, Pat Chee Miller, told of giving MacDonald $1,000
during his re-election campaign in 1986. They also described
separate payments of $1,000, $5,000 and $3,000 they said were made
last year, and an effort to purchase MacDonald a $5,500 replica of a
Model A Ford that was thwarted after an FBI agent began making
inquiries.
   ``In my culture, when an elder asks you for help, I didn't see
any problem with $3,000 or $4,000 at the outset,'' said Miller. ``It
was just a small favor, but I didn't realize it would get this
large.''

<HEAD>Firm Barred From Recruiting at Law School After Partner Makes Racist
Remarks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in grafs 8-10.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Chicago law school has barred a
prestigious law firm from on-campus recruiting for one year because
a partner made racist, sexist and anti-Semitic remarks during an
interview with a student.
   Geoffrey R. Stone, dean of the law school, commended the
Chicago-based law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie on Thursday for
displaying ``sensitivity, professionalism and ... integrity'' after
the incident became public.
   But, he added in a statement, ``just as Baker &amp; McKenzie has
assured us it will take strong steps to condemn this behavior and to
prevent its repetition, so too must we take strong steps to protect
our students against insulting and degrading conduct in the
interview process.''
   The ban, which covers the 1989-90 academic year and had been
recommended by the university's Law Students Association, Black Law
Students Association and the Law School Placement Committee, came
nearly a week after initial reports of the job interview.
   ``This is especially painful because we've always taken great
pride in being part of the solution rather than part of the
problem,'' said Robert Cox, chairman of the executive committee at
Baker &amp; McKenzie, one of the world's largest law firms. ``But
obviously, when something like this happens, you must take a look at
yourself again.''
   According to last Friday's edition of the law school student
newspaper, the Phoenix, a partner from Baker &amp; McKenzie later
identified as Harry O'Kane conducted the interview with a black
female law student.
   Neither the law school nor the firm has disputed the account. The
student has not been identified.
   Among other things, O'Kane asked the student during a discussion
about the practice of law how she would react to being called a
``black bitch'' or ``nigger'' by adversaries or colleagues.
   When the student remarked at another juncture that she played
golf, the partner responded: ``Why don't blacks have their own
country clubs?'' He then answered his own question, saying, ``There
aren't too many golf courses in the ghetto.''
   The newspaper also paraphrased O'Kane as remarking he wouldn't
want to belong to a Jewish country club, ``but at least they had
their own.''
   O'Kane declined to comment when reached by telephone Thursday
night at his suburban Arlington Heights home, and referred all
questions to Cox.
   Cox said O'Kane, a partner for 20 years, has taken an
``indefinite leave.'' He said that O'Kane is ``not a racist,'' and
suggested his commments may have been a kind of ``stress test'' for
the applicant.
   ``But let me reiterate there is no attempt to excuse what he did.
We'll deal with what (disciplinary action) is appropriate in the
days ahead,'' he said.
   Baker &amp; McKenzie operates 44 offices in 26 countries and has
approximately 1,300 lawyers worldwide.
   Of the estimated 400 lawyers working in the United States, Cox
said there would be 10 blacks after the current round of hiring.
   Of the firms' 432 partners, Cox said about 30 were women and none
are black; 23, however, are graduates of the University of Chicago
law school.

   An attractive, major new ballet and a brief,
rather insignificant ballet duet, both choreographed by Peter
Martins, were danced for the first time by the New York City Ballet
on Thursday night.
   ``Mozart Serenade,'' for four couples, four women soloists and a
corps de ballet, filled the stage in a balanced, flowing, George
Balanchine way, without looking like an imitation of a Balanchine
ballet.
   Balance is appropriate because the music is selections from
Mozart's ``Serenades in D Major.'' However, the symmetry is more
relaxed than rigid, giving the dance a contemporary look. When one
of the four lead couples has a duet, the other six dancers stand as
onlookers in two rows of three rather than staying always as couples.
   The corps de ballet flowed smoothly, melting from three rows of
dancers, which gave soloists aisles to dance in, to form a picture
frame outlining the soloists.
   The dancing was of a high order and stressed ensemble _ with
soloists and corps presenting one picture. The main costume color,
by Barbara Maters, was pearl gray, accented attractively by darker
grays. Gray draperies were hung at each side of the stage.
   The four lead couples, mostly relatively new to the company, were
Margaret Tracey, Jeffrey Edwards, Roma Sosenko, Michael Byars,
Zippora Karz, Ben Huys, Marisa Cerveris and Philip Neal.
   Martins also was in a formal mood for the brief pas de deux
titled ``Beethoven Romance.'' Kyra Nichols wore green over purple
chiffon and Adam Luders' costume suggested a Viennese cavalry
officer's uniform and boots. The dance was romantic. The couple,
both dancing beautifully, moved away from each other and met again
in embraces.
   Miss Nichols had a brief solo but there were no solo variations
for Luders. He had to be content with dancing away from the
ballerina and jumping, thrusting one leg high and behind him as he
reached a far corner, a step he does very well. A viewer was left
with the feeling that there might have been more.
   Lamar Alsop was the noteworthy soloist in Beethoven's ``Romance
in F Major for Violin and Orchestra.'' Robert Irving conducted.
   The evening began with a terrific presentation of ``Interplay,''
Jerome Robbins' 1945 witty working of Morton Gould's music. Byers
shone, leading the section titled ``Horseplay.'' The finale was
Balanchine's exhilarating ``Stars and Stripes.''
   The company is dancing through Feb. 26 at the New York State
Theater.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Ponders Arab Arms But Has No Peace Plan
Yet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress has begun to weigh a new package of
potential U.S. arms sales to the Arab world even as prospects for
Mideast peace talks remain cloudy.
   The possible purchases under discussion with Bush administration
officials are bound to touch off a row with Israel's supporters.
Saudi Arabia, for instance, might get 315 Abrams tanks, probably the
best in the world, and the United Arab Emirates 40 jet fighters.
   The list is far from final. It's only a wish list _ what the
oil-rich Arab countries and other potential customers would like to
buy. Reaction to the soundings that began last Friday on Capitol
Hill could force changes before the White House makes formal
requests for approval.
   In the meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has
unveiled a proposal to extend autonomy _ but not statehood _ to
Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The plan was rejected outright by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which is gaining diplomatic support in Western Europe
and apparently sees no reason to compromise on its demand for a
state carved out of Israeli-held territory.
   Shamir also has not engendered any enthusiasm from the Bush
administration despite his offer to withdraw troops from some of the
population centers on the West Bank and in Gaza once Palestinians
there accept autonomy. The State Department simply has had nothing
to say about the offer.
   In the Camp David agreements 10 years ago, the United States,
Israel and Egypt called for autonomy for the Palestinians. After
five years of managing their own local affairs, negotiations would
be opened for a permanent arrangement. All options, including
statehood, would be on the table.
   The idea was to see how living together would work, but Egypt was
ostracized for approving something less than immediate statehood for
the Palestinians and the plan never got off the ground.
   If the Bush administration has another approach in mind it has
not tipped its hand, although Secretary of State James A. Baker III
ruled out U.S. support for an independent Palestinian state at his
Senate confirmation hearing.
   The classified arms list under discussion in Capitol Hill
corridors and over lunches reflects a traditional U.S. approach of
trying to lubricate Middle East diplomacy with weapons.
   A copy obtained Thursday by The Associated Press showed Israel
under consideration for 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, four
helicopters and some new radar and equipment for its jet fighters.
   The potential Arab purchases have far more punch.
   Kuwait, a wealthy Arab state, could receive 200 Abrams tanks,
known also as the M1A1 and considered by experts to be the best in
the world.
   Other key items include 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles with
an infrared guidance system and electronic warfare gear for Bahrain
and 24 F-16 jet fighters and 100 Mavericks and 100 Sidewinder
air-to-air missiles for Morocco.
   If Bush follows through with specific requests he will have a
battle on his hand. Israel's supporters are concerned that Arab
weapons could be turned against the Jewish state in a Middle East
conflict.
   Congress has the power to block a purchase, but only if a
majority of both the Senate and the House reject a White House
proposal.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, declined to
identify any of the weapons under consideration. He stressed it was
not a ``sale plan,'' but rather the administration's ``best
estimate'' of other countries' weapons needs.
   ``Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' Redman
said.
   Israel's supporters were successful during the Carter and Reagan
administration in blocking some U.S. sales to both Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
   But the skillful management of Baker, then the White House chief
of staff, and other Reagan administration operatives overcame
stubborn resistance in 1981 to the sale of Awacs radar planes to
Saudi Arabia which the Senate approved 52-48.
   The White House, in a cover letter, informed Congress the Saudis
were in the process of deciding whether to request U.S. or European
fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade, the sources
said.
   The letter said the Saudis were considering jet fighters to be
jointly produced by Britain and West Germany and the French Mirage
4000, as well as U.S.-built F-16s and F-18s.
   Besides the Abrams tanks, on the list for the Saudis were seven
multiple-launch artillery rocket systems, for battlefield use, and
seven of the box-type rockets for Kuwait along with 1,500 Tow
anti-tank missiles.

<TEXT>
   Universal Pictures plans to produce
two ``Back to the Future'' sequels this spring and summer starring
Michael J. Fox, who had the role of the young time traveler in the
original 1985 hit.
   Robert Zemeckis, who directed the first ``Back to the Future,''
will return behind the cameras for both follow-ups, the studio
announced Thursday.
   Most of the original co-stars, including Lea Thompson,
Christopher Lloyd and Tom Wilson, also will be reunited. Filming of
the first sequel will begin on Feb. 20. The two sequels are
scheduled for release in the winter of 1989 and the summer of 1990,
respectively.
   The consecutive filming schedule will keep production costs down
and take advantage of an extended opening in Fox's busy schedule,
said Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group.
   Fox stars as Alex Keaton the NBC situation comedy ``Family Ties.''
   The original ``Back to the Future,'' in which Fox journeyed back
to the 1950s and had to make sure his parents fell in love, has
grossed $350 million in its domestic and international theatrical
release.
   Zemeckis' last film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' was last year's
No. 1 movie at the box office.

<HEAD>Kemp Move Blunts Ethics Question, Senate Confirms Appointment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp blunted last-minute ethical questions
about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding House limits to win
unanimous Senate confirmation as secretary of housing and urban
development.
   The Senate voted unanimously to confirm Kemp, the former
professional football player who served 18 years as a congressman
from Buffalo, N.Y., and unsuccessfully ran for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1988.
   The vote followed by hours the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Development Committee's vote to recommend Kemp's nomination to the
full Senate.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the housing and urban
affairs subcommittee, said Democrats on the committee and the
committee's staff concluded that Kemp's acceptance of thousands of
dollars in speaking fees above House limits was ``part of a
misunderstanding'' and no bar to his confirmation.
   ``There was no reason to do anything to embarrass him or to
harass him to block him,'' Cranston said.
   Kemp's financial disclosure reports show that in 1988 he accepted
or agreed to accept $67,350 above what House rules allow a member of
Congress to accept in one year. The limit is 30 percent of salary,
or $26,850. In addition, Kemp accepted honoraria far larger than the
$2,000 per event limit.
   When committee staff raised questions with Kemp last week, he
agreed to return, forgo or defer more than $67,000 in speaking fees
to bring his 1988 fees within House limits.
   Congressional and federal ethics officials said Thursday,
however, that it was unclear whether part of Kemp's remedy _ the
deferral of $12,500 in excess fees from 1988 to 1989 _ was permitted
by House rules and federal law.
   Kemp declined to comment Thursday on the matter, said his
spokeswoman, Mary Brunette. On Wednesday he attributed the problems
to a misunderstanding on his part of the limits.
   Cranston said, ``There was ambiguity in the rules that led to
uncertainty as to what one could or could not do.''
   At the federal Office of Government Ethics, deputy director
Donald E. Campbell said staff attorneys concluded they could not
resolve the questions over Kemp's fees and the House rules.
   ``We couldn't get anybody there (at the congressional ethics
committees) that would give us any answers,'' Campbell said.
   As a result, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to
the Senate committee that it was approving Kemp's finances within
executive branch standards only.
   House rules forbid members from deferring income from one year to
the next ``to avoid the income limitation,'' according to the ethics
manual for House members. Senate Banking Committee staff director
Kevin Gottlieb said he did not object to the deferral, however,
because he did not believe honoraria were included in that
prohibition.
   John Davison, staff attorney for the House Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct, the ethics committee, declined to say whether
the committee or its staff had examined the Kemp case, saying such
information was private. He said the deferral question would be up
to the committee, but he added, ``I would suggest caution in making
an intentional deferral.''
   The Senate Ethics Committee ruled on that question in a 1984
case. It said: ``A member may not accept the offer of an
organization to defer payment of an honorarium to a subsequent
calender year in order to avoid the limitation on honoraria
applicable for the year in which the honorarium is earned.''
   Kemp's move also raised the question of what his 1989 limit would
be, since he served only two days as a member of Congress before
resigning Jan. 2. The House rules say the limit is 30 percent of
aggregate salary paid during that calender year _ which could mean
30 percent of two day's pay, or about $150.
   Under that interpretation he would have to forgo the $12,500 or
give most of it to charity. The rules allow members who receive more
fees than are permitted in a year to reach the limit by donating the
excess to charity.
   Asked whether Kemp would exceed his 1989 limit by deferring the
$12,500, Davison said, ``I will not interpret that for you ... but
it says, aggregate salary, as a member, paid in a calendar year.''
   Kemp sought to comply with the rules this week by agreeing to
return $16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo another $39,400 in fees
earned but not yet received. He deferred receipt of $12,500 in fees
earned in 1988 until 1989, a move that left him $550 under the 1988
limit.
   Kemp's spokeswoman Brunette, asked if Kemp believed the deferral
of the $12,500 might still be improper, she said she would relay
that question but did not respond further.

   The speed limit on highways in Stockholm
county will be reduced from 68 mph to 56 mph to reduce pollution
from trucks and cars, the county council decided.
   The council said Thursday that the reduction from 110 to 90
kilometers an hour could cut emissions of carbon dioxide that were
affecting the Baltic Sea, the national news agency TT reported.
   Motor clubs and a conservative opposition party on the council
protested the decision and said they would appeal to national

<HEAD>Pay Raise Spotlight Now on House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate's rejection of a 51 percent
congressional pay raise places the spotlight on a House leadership
plan to legalize the increase next week but scale it back to 30
percent a day later.
   The Senate's 95-5 vote Thursday against the raise sent the two
houses in different directions, and ``no one knows'' how the
controversy will be resolved, said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., ``I don't believe we'll know that for a matter of weeks or
months.''
   The Senate resolution included language to roll back the raise if
it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases,
along with those for top federal executives and judges, to become
law automatically unless rejected by both houses.
   The chief sponsors were Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South
Dakota and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
   Also approved, by unanimous voice vote, was a Senate rules change
that would ban senators from keeping fees for speeches, articles and
appearances. But the ban on such fees, typically paid by
special-interest groups, would only remain in effect while senators
were receiving the raise.
   The Senate action has strong political appeal to a public angry
with the size of the raise, but will have little practical effect
under House Speaker Jim Wright's plan to let the increase become law
automatically next Wednesday.
   Wright plans to use a risky parliamentary procedure that requires
a two-thirds majority to scale back the raise to 30 percent, and to
pass a House ban on speaking fees along with other outside income
restrictions.
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said there was only
a 50-50 chance of getting the two-thirds while Rep. Tom Tauke,
R-Iowa, and a leading pay raise opponent, predicted it would be
``very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds to vote for the
resolution.''
   Rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise from
$89,500 to $135,000 under the full raise. But the pay would be
$116,350 under Wright's plan, the same amount House members can now
receive in salary plus honoraria _ defined as fees for speeches,
appearances and articles.
   Even if the Wright plan passed, the Senate would be unlikely to
go along, since senators can now keep $35,800 in honoraria and would
therefore lose money by accepting a smaller $26,850 raise. While the
two houses haggled, the 51 percent raise would remain in effect
along with the honoraria bans.
   Wright explained his rollback plan at a news conference Thursday,
emphasizing the virtue of banning honoraria and taking that same
amount in salary. ``The difference is we will be serving one master,
not two, that is, the American people,'' he said.
   ``I don't like to articulate failure,'' Wright said, when asked
what will happen if his plan is defeated. ``If for some reason it
doesn't work, we will regroup.''
   The House could try to pass the 30 percent raise by a majority,
like most legislation, but opponents might be able to tack on
language rescinding the raise altogether. Under the two-thirds rule,
no amendments would be in order.
   The House plan would scale back the raise for all three branches
of government, even though the Constitution prohibits judges' pay
from being reduced.
   ``I think the courts are likely to hold it's unconstitutional to
do this to the judiciary,'' Wright said.
   Wright released results of a survey showing 57 percent of House
members opposing a pay raise vote before the Tuesday midnight
deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the raise
to 30 percent.
   Wright said his proposed $26,850 pay raise was ``a decent raise
but not an exorbitant raise,'' compared with the $45,500 increase
proposed by former President Reagan and endorsed by President Bush.
   Actually, most House members would find their incomes
substantially increased, since fewer than half reach the current
honoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to their
financial disclosures.
   The five senators who voted against the package to eliminate the
currently-proposed pay increase were Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.;
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   Their votes do not necessarily mean they support the 51 percent
raise.
   The Senate honoraria package would:
   _Prohibit acceptance of honoraria, but allow a donation to
charity on the members' behalf. Donations would be limited to $2,000
per appearance.
   _Prohibit members from receiving any pension or tax benefit
resulting from the charitable payments.
   _Prohibit conversion of the charitable donations to personal use
by a member or former member.
   _Require the Senate ethics committee to issue guidelines for
travel expenses reimbursed by outside individuals or organizations.

<HEAD>ABA, Senators May Meet on Secret Nominations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association's president says
there are limits to how much secrecy the lawyers' group will give up
in evaluating nominees for the federal bench, but he's willing to
meet with senators about possible changes in procedure.
   The issue of how the ABA rates judicial candidates came up again
Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee. It first arose during
consideration of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominees Robert H. Bork
and Douglas H. Ginsburg, and came to a head during hearings on
Anthony Kennedy, whose nomination was approved.
   The Supreme Court is also considering two challenges to the ABA's
confidential role in screening applicants.
   ``It seems especially appropriate that we undertake this
reevaluation before the committee faces another Supreme Court
nomination rather than in the context of that operation which we
started to do during the Kennedy nomination,'' Sen. Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa, said Thursday.
   ``I believe that we must do it if we are to avoid a repeat of the
very unsatisfying situation and the hard feelings arising out of the
Bork, Ginsburg, Kennedy series of hearings,'' he said.
   ``At best, there is uniform discomfort with the way the ABA
proceeds,'' said committee chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., reflecting
the bipartisan nature of the criticism.
   Biden, D-Del., said that he and ranking Republican Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., will arrange to meet with top leaders of the ABA
and its standing committee on the federal judiciary to try to
resolve the problems.
   During the December 1987 hearings on Kennedy, some Republicans
called for the ABA panel to hold its deliberations on judicial
candidates in public since the Senate gives great weight to its
advice.
   However, panel chairman Harold R. Tyler Jr. refused, saying:
``You are free to accept or reject our views. You are free to ignore
us.''
   During the Bork hearings, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, accused
four members of the ABA panel of being ``willing to play politics''
on the nomination. While 10 of the 15 panel members gave Bork the
highest rating of ``well qualified,'' four reportedly said he was
unqualified and a fifth was said to have taken the neutral ground of
``not opposed.''
   ABA President Robert Raven, reached in Denver where the ABA is
holding its mid-year meeting, said his organization would be happy
to meet with the Judiciary Committee.
   ``We've been working for them since 1948, and they're our bosses,
so to speak,'' Raven said. ``We're always looking for ways to
improve the system.''
   But he said there would be limits on how much secrecy the
standing committee would give up, saying some of that material would
have to remain confidential due to possible repercussions against
people who speak to the panel when asked about a judicial nominee.
   ``That person practices in the area (of the nominee),'' noted
Raven, with the San Francisco law firm of Morrison &amp; Foerster. ``If
that person said something critical, and the nominee became a judge,
it could cause problems for him.''
   Tyler was not in his New York office on Thursday and his
secretary said he would be unavailable until next week.
   The Supreme Court is considering a consolidated case of two
challenges to the ABA's confidential role in screening federal
judicial candidates. A lower court judge ruled that imposing the
Federal Advisory Committee Act _ which requires public scrutiny of
advisory groups _ on judicial selection would violate the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.
   Biden noted that the ABA got involved in the evaluation process
to keep the appointment of judges ``from being a political
cesspool,'' and ``to make it hard for a president or a senator to
put a crony on the bench.''
   He asked committee members to give him comments and criticisms of
the ABA for discussion during his and Thurmond's meeting with ABA
representatives.
   Following that meeting, there may be an informal session with the
entire Judiciary Committee, and, if necessary, the committee would
call a formal public hearing, Biden said.

<HEAD>Measles Outbreak Blamed On `Toddler Immunization Gap'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One-sixth of America's 1988 measles patients
came from Los Angeles County, where an ongoing outbreak among mostly
Hispanic toddlers demonstrates a nationwide need to vaccinate 1- to
4-year-olds, experts say.
   ``We seem to have a toddler immunization gap,'' said Dr. Stephen
Waterman, chief of acute communicable disease control for the county
Department of Health Services. ``A lot of those kids don't get
vaccinated until they go to school,'' where measles shots are
mandatory.
   The extent of the outbreak of the virus-caused respiratory
disease in Los Angeles County was reported by the national Centers
for Disease Control in today's issue of the agency's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report.
   The county last year reported 513 measles cases, 17.5 percent _
or more than one-sixth _ of the nation's total of 2,933, the
Atlanta-based CDC said. Two of the patients, ages 8 months and 23
months, died.
   Waterman, a co-author of the CDC report, said he didn't know how
many measles cases occurred in the county so far this year, but said
the outbreak is continuing at a slower pace.
   Eight unvaccinated children of Samoan descent were brought this
week to two Long Beach hospitals, where two of them died, said Ron
Yukelson, spokesman for Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. Waterman
said he understood they belonged to a religious group opposed to
vaccinations.
   Of the 1988 cases, an ethnic group was identified for 331 of the
Los Angeles County measles patients, and 77.6 percent of them were
Hispanic. Age was known for 353, and of those, 25 percent were
younger than 1, while 40 percent were ages 1 to 4, the CDC report
said.
   The CDC considers 15 months to be the minimum age for
vaccination, and 26 percent fell in the 16-month-old to 4-year-old
age group. But the outbreak prompted Waterman's department last July
to lower the minimum age for vaccination in Los Angeles County to 1
year.
   Infants exposed to the measles in areas where the virus is
endemic, such as Los Angeles, should be vaccinated at 6 months, even
though the vaccine's effectiveness is questionable for children
younger than 1 year, Waterman said.
   Officials in some counties recommend dual vaccinations at 9
months and 15 months, he added.
   The CDC said lowering the minimum vaccination age is an important
way to help control measles in infants.
   ``The routine age for vaccination is 15 months, but in most
states where vaccinations are required for school, you've got that
4{-year period where they are not ... required to have measles
immunization,'' said Dr. Paul Stehr-Green, a CDC measles specialist.
   Waterman said this immunization gap is worst among ``the lower
socioeconomic status population and Hispanics. They just have
variable access to health care. Some of them may be afraid to go to
institutions because they're undocumented (aliens). They may not be
aware they can get the vaccinations for free with no questions
asked.''
   The CDC recommended programs aimed at reaching parents and
children in poor areas and use of churches, schools and mobile vans
as temporary vaccination sites.
   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the childhood
disease could be eradicated in the United States by fall 1982. That
goal wasn't met. In the past six years, between 1,497 and 6,282
cases have been reported nationally each year.
   Part of the problem is what researchers call ``non-preventable''
cases _ patients too young for vaccinations to be effective and
those who were vaccinated but still got measles, since at best one
in 20 vaccinations does not provide full immunity. In Los Angeles
County, 58 percent of cases overall were considered non-preventable,
the CDC said.

<HEAD>Longer Delay Seen in Resumption of Nuclear Materials Output</HEAD>

   The Energy Department said restarting the
crippled Savannah River nuclear reactors probably will take longer
than previously forecast, raising new concerns about supplies of a
gas used in making atomic weapons.
   Richard Starostecki, the department's top safety official, told a
Senate Armed Services subcommittee Thursday it was ``not likely''
that even one of the three reactors would be restarted this year as
planned. All three have been shut down since last spring because of
structural, safety and managerial problems.
   The subcommittee was reconvening today for a closed session on
how long the reactors could remain shut down without harming
national security. Among the scheduled witnesses were Gen. Robert T.
Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert C.
Duncan, chairman of the Pentagon's Nuclear Weapons Council.
   ``I expect we're going to get some unpleasant news,'' Sen. Jim
Exon, D-Neb., told Thursday's session.
   Savannah River is the nation's only source of tritium, a
perishable gas used in the production of most U.S. nuclear weapons.
For weeks the Energy Department has said it expected to restart one
reactor by the end of the year, but Starostecki indicated he could
not be sure it would be operating even by January 1991.
   ``A lot of things would have to happen very quickly, and they are
not happening,'' Starostecki said of preparations to meet the
year-end 1989 target.
   Troy E. Wade III, the Energy Department's acting assistant
secretary for defense programs, told the subcommittee at least one
of the reactors would have to be restarted by the end of the year to
avoid a squeeze on supplies of tritium.
   The exact level of current tritium supplies is classified.
   ``It is our goal to resume operations this calendar year,'' Wade
said, adding, ``I'm an optimist.'' He later said a restart could be
accomplished by October at best and that if new problems were
encountered, the target date could slip.
   Wade said in a written statement to the subcommittee that the
effort to resume production of tritium ``is becoming critical''
because of the weapons requirements.
   ``If a reactor is not restarted this year, then the supply of
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear
stockpile may be affected,'' Wade said.
   Asked how much confidence he held in the official goal of getting
Savannah River in shape to produce adequate supplies of tritium
until a proposed new generation of reactors comes on line late in
the 1990s, Wade said, ``I wish my confidence were higher.''
   Wade said that by March the department should be able to set a
target date for restarting the K reactor. By then, a department
safety advisory panel is expected to have completed its assessment
of the criteria for restarting the reactor.
   James S. Moore, president of Westinghouse Savannah River Co., a
subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corp., told the subcommittee
that his company's own assessment of the safety, technical and
management problems at the plant will be done by March.
   Westinghouse is due to take over April 1 from E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co. as operator of the plant, which is owned by the Energy
Department and has been a key link in the nationwide network of
nuclear weapons plants since the late 1940s.
   Some officials voiced doubts about Westinghouse's claim that it
will improve safety and efficiency at Savannah River by bringing in
its own core management team while retaining more than 90 percent of
the 11,000-strong Du Pont workforce there.
   ``It's going to be very difficult to make the level of changes
necessary'' even if Westinghouse expands its core Savannah River
management group to as many as 150 people, said John Ahearne,
chairman of an Energy Department advisory panel on safety.

   Federal ethics officials say Health and Human
Services Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan appears to have no
conflict of interest problems, but an FBI investigation into his
tenure as a medical school president continues.
   An Atlanta lawyer said Thursday that his client, a suspended
Fulton County, Ga., commissioner convicted of extortion, told the
FBI that Sullivan never tried to improperly influence him.
   In a half-hour meeting with FBI agents earlier this week,
Reginald Eaves was asked about his relationship with Sullivan,
president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, said the
attorney, Charles R. Floyd Jr.
   Morehouse paid Eaves more than $34,000 as a lecturer over four
years while Eaves used his seat on the county commission to promote
measures that benefited the school. Published reports said Eaves had
lectured twice during the time he was paid by the school.
   According to Floyd, Eaves told agents ``that Sullivan never
sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a
commissioner, either as a result of his friendship or any other
position he might have had with Morehouse College.''
   The lawyer also said Eaves told the FBI he had not negotiated his
position with Morehouse through Sullivan directly and was unsure
Sullivan knew that he was being paid by the school as a lecturer.
   Sullivan and Eaves were undergraduates together at Morehouse
College and their relationship has been ``primarily of a social
nature,'' Floyd said.
   The interview took place at a federal prison at Maxwell Air Force
Base in Montgomery, Ala., where Eaves is serving a six-year sentence
for extortion, the lawyer said. He is appealing his conviction.
   On another front, Sullivan got a boost from the Office of
Government Ethics, which is working on Sullivan's request for
permission to maintain a relationship with the medical school he
founded while at the same time he heads HHS. The possibilities
include a paid sabbatical.
   Don Campbell, deputy director of the office, told The Associated
Press that the office foresees no problems with that issue,
Sullivan's finances or any potential conflicts of interest between
the new job and federal aid to Morehouse, which in fiscal 1988
amounted to $5.8 million from HHS.
   ``It's simply a matter now of getting the forms written down,
because all the problems have been worked out,'' Campbell said.
   The White House has cited the continuing FBI background check and
the incomplete financial disclosure forms as reasons for asking
Congress to postpone Sullivan's confirmation hearing. It had been
scheduled for Wednesday this week, but the Senate Finance Committee
agreed to put if off indefinitely.
   The FBI had no comment.
   At Morehouse, the FBI has been asking school officials about
Sullivan's connection to Eaves, who was found guilty last May of
accepting $35,000 from an undercover FBI agent in exchange for his
vote on a zoning matter. He was suspended from the commission when
he was indicted in October 1987.
   ``They talked to me about a range of issues about Dr. Sullivan's
fitness for the position (of HHS secretary), including that (Eaves)
and many other things,'' said Dr. James Goodman, executive vice
president of the medical school.
   He declined to identify the other issues.
   One proposal Eaves pushed as a commissioner was to increase
Morehouse's participation at Grady Memorial Hospital. He wanted the
county hospital authority to allow Morehouse to provide more patient
care at Grady.
   J.W. Pinkston, executive director of Grady, said that the FBI had
contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the Atlanta
region have told him they also had been questioned by the FBI in a
background check on Sullivan.
   He said the agents ``asked routine questions, which were very
appropriate.''

<HEAD>Caterpillar's Diet Determines its Appearance, Researcher Finds</HEAD>

   To a small caterpillar living in oak trees in
the Southwest, the old saying ``you are what you eat'' is not just
wise advice _ it's the code of survival.
   Erick Greene, a researcher from the University of California at
Davis, reports today in the journal Science that the food eaten by
the caterpillar nemoria arizonaria causes bodily changes allowing
the insect to mimic the seasonal appearance of its oak tree home.
   In effect, the caterpillars hatched in spring eat their way into
bright yellow and green outfits resembling a flower, while fall
caterpillars munch on leaves to assume the subdued gray-green
appearance of a plain twig.
   The survival strategy, said Greene, probably developed as
camouflage concealment from hungry birds.
   ``Both fall and spring caterpillars have identical genetic
material,'' said Greene. ``The spring brood and the fall brood look
exactly the same when they hatch. Their later change depends
entirely on what the caterpillar eats. Diet cues turn on or off the
right set of genes so that they turn into the right shape at the
right time of year.''
   Caterpillars, or larvae, hatched in the spring come out and
immediately begin feeding on the oak catkin, or flower. Soon, these
caterpillars turn bright yellow with green dots and develop the
fuzzy, segmented shape that mimics the oak blossom.
   After a few weeks, the caterpillar turns into a pupa and later
into an adult moth. The adult quickly mates, lays eggs and dies,
Greene said.
   The new eggs soon hatch and caterpillars identical to the spring
brood appear. But once this group start feeding, there are quick
changes.
   Greene said that by the time the fall brood appears, the oak tree
has lost its blossoms and has leaves. The new caterpillars nibble on
these leaves and soon develop a smooth, gray-green body that
resembles the oak twig. Powerful jaws, capable of chewing the
leathery oak leaves, also appear.
   Oak leaves have a high content of a chemical compound called
tannin. Greene said this compound apparently triggers the genetic
response to create the fall caterpillar's twiglike shape and color.
   Greene made his discovery by collecting eggs of the insect,
hatching them in the laboratory under controlled conditions and then
feeding the caterpillars either oak flowers or oak leaves. It
proved, he said, that diet made the difference.
   ``You could give me a spring or a fall caterpillar and I could
turn it into either form, depending on what I feed it,'' he said.
``If I fed the fall caterpillars spring pollen, they would all turn
into the catkin (flower) form. It depends entirely on what the young
caterpillars are eating.''
   ``I just caused a species name to go extinct,'' Greene said.
   ``Nemoria aemularia, was the summer form,'' he said. ``Now both
forms are called nemoria arizonaria.''
   The California scientist normally studies birds and said in a
telephone interview that he ``stumbled'' into his caterpillar
discovery while gathering data on the diet of birds living near
Portal, Ariz.
   ``I was finding lots of caterpillars and I had to raise them to
produce an adult form that could be identified,'' said Greene.
``While doing this, I realized that something much more interesting
was going on.''
   The caterpillars are just bite-sized for birds, said Greene.
About half of each season's caterpillar hatch is gobbled up, he
said, and this may explain why the insect developed such a clever
camouflage strategy.
   ``Birds are a major source of mortality for the caterpillars, so
being very well hidden can pay off,'' Greene said.
   The nemoria arizonaria caterpillar lives in Arizona, Mexico, New
Mexico and parts of California. The adult form is a brillant emerald
moth with a one-inch wingspan. Greene said it is commonly seen at
night on windows and screens in the Southwest.
   Science, which published Greene's study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   The crowd chanted ``Eddie! Eddie!'' in a
scene reminiscent of last year's Olympic ski jumping competition,
but Michael ``Eddie the Eagle'' Edwards was tossing darts instead of
hurtling down a slope.
   Edwards, 25, is in town in hopes of competing in an international
ski jumping meet at Silver Mine Hill this weekend. But he warmed up
by playing darts at O'Leary's Pub.
   Edwards whose last-place finish and ready wit made him a media
favorite at the Calgary Olympics, underwent a medical exam Thursday
to check head, shoulder and kidney injuries suffered in a fall at
Innsbruck, Austria, on Jan. 3.
   ``It's not too bad. The doctor says it's healing up beautifully
now,'' Edwards said, ``but he doesn't know how much of a jar it
could take.''
   After his accident, the British Ski Association barred Edwards
from the World Championships later this month in Lahti, Finland, but
he said he hopes to return to the World Cup circuit before the
season ends.
   Edwards, a former plasterer, now makes appearances, will have a
book released this weekend and expects to sign a contract to film
his life story.

   Actor Tom Selleck begins shooting his prison
movie ``Hard Rain'' this weekend, using a Civil War-era former city
workhouse for a location.
   The movie, set at the closed Hamilton County jail, will be
off-limits to outsiders.
   The film will also be shot partly at the field house of suburban
Norwood High School. The moviemakers project an 18-day filming
schedule, with shooting to start Saturday at the jail.
   Selleck, 44, portrays a man sentenced to prison after being
framed by corrupt police. Lila Robbins is to portray Selleck's wife
in the movie.
   The film offers Selleck a reunion with Ted Field and Robert Cort,
two of the producers for ``Three Men and a Baby,'' considered
Selleck's biggest movie success. Field and Cort are joined on this
production by Scott Kroops.

   Entertainer Bette Midler says her mother
encouraged her, but her father didn't think much of her career
choice.
   ``(My father) was one of those pooh-poohers _ `You'll never
amount to a hill of beans.' Maybe it was reverse psychology, hoping
against hope that I would amount to something, but it was pretty
painful for a long time,'' Midler told Parade magazine in this
Sunday's issue.
   ``He couldn't keep me down,'' said Midler. ``I had too much inner
belief. That came from my mother, who always said, `Kid, you're
going to be fine.'''
   Although her father refused to attend her performances as her
career took off, the pair had a reconciliation before his death in
1986, Midler said.
   Her flamboyant stage act doesn't reflect her upbringing.
   ``My parents were two of the most conservative people you've ever
seen in your life. They never went to a movie. And we didn't get a
TV set until 1957 or a phone until 1962,'' said Midler, whose latest
film is ``Beaches.''

bypass surgery next week.
   The 68-year-old Connecticut resident will have the operation
Wednesday at Yale University Hospital in New Haven, Russell Gloyd,
Brubeck's manager and conductor, said Thursday.
   Brubeck could resume limited travel and performances in a couple
of months, he said. His next concert had been set for Stanford
University on Tuesday. The canceled performances include a European
tour in March.
   Brubeck began his career in progressive jazz as a pianist with
dance bands and a trio from 1946-49. He toured the United States
with his own trio in 1950 and formed the Dave Brubeck Quartet in
1951. Brubeck has written more than 250 songs, including such
favorites as ``In Your Own Sweet Way'' and ``The Duke.''

   Bernhard Goetz, sentenced to a year in prison on
a weapons charge, is spending his time fixing walkie-talkies and
radios and earning 50 cents an hour.
   Goetz, an electronics engineer, has been working in the radio
shop at Rikers Island Jail since Jan. 26, about two weeks after he
was sentenced for possessing an unlicensed gun in the shooting of
four young men on a subway.
   ``It's good to see the city taking advantage of this bargain,''
said Donald Cranston, president of the Correction Captains
Benevolent Association. ``Where else could you get a deal like this
for 50 cents an hour?''
   The equipment is from Correction Department cars and buses.
   In a highly publicized case that fired national debate about
self-defense against urban crime, Goetz said he shot four young men
he thought were about to rob him on a subway. Assuming good
behavior, and giving him credit for the nine days he spent in jail
after the shooting, he would be eligible for parole March 5.

   President Francois Mitterrand of France
presented his nation's highest decoration, the Legion of Honor, to
Indian filmmaker and author Satyajit Ray, calling the award ``a
tribute to India.''
   Mitterrand gave Ray the gold medal award at a ceremony in
Calcutta on the second day of a four-day official visit to India.
   ``Your work is realistic, sometimes cruel, but truthful,'' the
French president told the 67-year-old Ray.
   Ray's stark and often blunt films, most of them in the Bengali
language, have won him wide renown. His novels are less well known
but have a wide following among Bengali readers.
   ``I am immensely happy and proud to receive this great honor,''
Ray said. One of Ray's best-known films is ``Pather Panchali''
(``The Story of One Life''), a trilogy that traces the life of a
poor villager from childhood to adulthood.

<HEAD>Minor Bumps Could Cost Thousands on 1989 Small Cars</HEAD>

   Minor accidents that would have caused no
damage to a 1981 small car can bring a big repair bill for 1989
models, according to insurance industry tests.
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety intentionally crashed
19 new 1989 two-door cars at 5 mph into two flat barriers, once
going forward and once backward, and then bumped the front end of
each car into an angle barrier and the back end into a post.
   Damage estimates calculated in January ranged from $3,445 for an
Isuzu Impulse to $434 for a Geo Spectrum.
   Identical tests on a new Ford Escort in 1981 caused no damage,
institute spokesman Brian O'Neill said Thursday.
   A 1989 Ford Escort suffered no damage in the straight-on barrier
tests but the repair cost after the other two tests totaled $1,481.
   O'Neill said the low-speed tests were conducted over the past
month at test facilities in Hartwood, Va., using new cars purchased
anonymously by the institute, which is financed by the insurance
industry.
   The highest repair estimates were for the Isuzu Impulse, the
Daihatsu Charade at $3,047 and the Honda CRX HF at $3,040. The least
damaged cars after the Geo Spectrum were the Toyota Corolla with
$495 in damage and the Plymouth Colt with $642.
   Prior to the 1983 model year, federal law required that cars
sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests. For newer
models, the standard was lowered to 2.5 mph.
   Nine cars sustained no damage at all in the front and rear
barrier tests in the 1989 study but all were damaged when nudged up
against the angle barrier and pole.
   Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Joyce Stinson said the difference in
damage to the Escort is due to changes in the model that include a
lightweight bumper to help Ford meet federally imposed mileage
standards. Lighter cars use less gas.
   She said the pole and angle tests are ``very tough'' but Ford has
voluntarily built other models to comply with the pre-1983 standard
for straight-on barrier crashes rather than the less-stringent 2.5
mph standard.
   A spokesman for Isuzu, Dan McCue, said the company had requested
documentation on the testing and would not respond until it could
study the material.
   Kurt Antonius, spokesman for American Honda in Los Angeles, said
the CRX HF model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper
but other Honda models have stronger bumpers than last year.
   ``The most important thing is that this is not related to auto
safety,'' he said. The tests did not cover any injuries that might
occur to driver or passengers in low-speed crashes.
   The institute said a basic 1989 Honda CRX model suffered $2,061
in damage, compared with $2,782 damage in a previous test on a 1988
model of the same car.
   ``This improvement is encouraging,'' said O'Neill, ``but there
was still a lot of damage to the '89 and a very long way to go.''
   The fourth most-damaged car, a Chrysler Conquest TSi, with a
repair estimate totaling $2,357, required a new front fender costing
$300.
   O'Neill noted that the mass-produced sheet-metal fender costs as
much as a washing machine which ``comes complete with motor, pump,
hoses and circuitry as well as the metal housing.''
   Bill Dunn, a Chrysler Corp. spokesman, said he could not comment
on the results without knowing more about criteria used for the
tests and damage estimates.

Manuel J. Lujan and two other high-level nominees were approved in
the most recent Senate votes on President Bush's appointments, with
Kemp becoming secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban

   Also confirmed Thursday were Michael J.Boskin, to be chairman of

nominees was 100-0.
   Kemp won unanimous approval by the Senate Banking Committee

   His approval came after the former New York Republican
congressman agreed to give up more than $55,000 in speaking fees

   Lujan, 60, was a 20-year member of Congress from New Mexico until
his retirement last year.
   He was approved 19-0 by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee on Wednesday.
   Reilly, former president of the World Wildlife Fund and

Public Works Committee on a 16-0 vote earlier in the day. He has
promised a ``new era'' at the EPA in strong enforcement of
environmental laws.

   Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton Yeutter
says he let a tobacco company pay for an inaugural reception for him
without thinking about whether it would be a conflict of interest.
   Yeutter told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday that he
was so busy wrapping up his work as U.S. trade representative for
President Reagan and preparing to become agriculture secretary for
President Bush that ``it totally disappeared from my attention
screen.''
   Philip Morris, Inc., staged the reception Jan. 18 for Yeutter,
saying it wanted to celebrate his appointment as agriculture
secretary.
   Federal ethics rules forbid government officials from accepting
anything of value from anyone who could be affected by the
official's actions.
   As trade representative, Yeutter aggressively promoted overseas
sales of U.S. tobacco products; as agriculture secretary he would be
responsible for policies directly affecting Philip Morris business
interests.
   The reception arrangement was reported Thursday by The Washington
Post and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., questioned Yeutter about the
possible conflict of interest during a confirmation hearing.
   ``When Philip Morris suggested that they would like to hold some
kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing
in the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict of
interest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending to
go back to the private sector,'' said Yeutter.
   ``When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring any
conflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held in
the final hours of Reagan's term. ``You are not going to be causing
any conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an
administration.''
   He said then Bush asked him to be agriculture secretary after he
had accepted Philip Morris' invitation.
   ``We probably should have reconsidered because of my expected
continuation in government. ... Frankly, I just didn't think about
it,'' he said.
   Yeutter was president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from
1978 to 1985, when he became trade representative.
   Asked about the current FBI investigation of alleged fraud in
futures trading at the Merc, Yeutter said he didn't know the probe
was under way while he was its president. The FBI began its
undercover investigation of brokers in Yeutter's last year at the
exchange.
   ``Some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they
are brought before a disciplinary committee,'' Yeutter said. ``Most
are fruitless. Some have validity and sanctions are applied upon
those against whom charges are levied.
   ``I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said. ``I
know no more than what is in the newspapers.''
   Yeutter emphasized throughout the hearing the importance of
holding down federal spending in agriculture and finding more
foreign markets for American products.
   ``We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn income
from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' he
said. ``We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in
this country.''
   Yeutter also discussed the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, saying ``We are not about to abandon any import constraints
in the United States unless there is quid pro quo in other
countries, giving us export opportunities. It's a horse trade.''
   On rural development, he said: ``The push and initiative should
come from local areas. We can help coordinate and provide technical
assistance'' but he said the federal government does not have
billions of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify.

   The San Jose Police Officers Association
has filed a lawsuit demanding that 500 officers be added to the
police force in response to the recent deaths of two patrolmen in a
shootout with a transient.
   The association, which represents 970 of San Jose's 1,014-member
police force, said the current level of 1.36 officers per 1,000
residents in San Jose is inadequate to assure reasonable police and
public safety and is far below the national average of 2.58 officers
per 1,000.
   Mayor Tom McEnery called the association's demand for a 50
percent increase, spelled out in a lawsuit filed Thursday,
``fiscally impossible and unrealistic.''
   In making the demand, which is estimated to cost $25 million
annually, the association is relying on a state labor code provision
requiring employers to adopt reasonable safety standards for
workers. It may be the first such use of the provision.
   With a total of 1,500 officers, the force would have about two
officers per 1,000 population. More than 742,000 people live in San
Jose.
   The City Council on Thursday approved McEnery's request for 15
more officers this spring as part of the mid-year budget review. The
mayor said he plans to ask the council for an addition 40 to 50
officers.
   Carm Grande, president of the association, conceded the hiring of
500 officers at one time is ``an impossible project'' and said the
association was willing to negotiate a time period when that many
officers could be added.
   The lawsuit filed in Superior Court, which names as defendants
the city, McEnery, the city manager and the city council, added fuel
to a heated debate over police staffing and procedures since the
Jan. 20 gun battle in which Officers Gene Simpson and Gordon Silva
were killed along with gunman Dale Randell Connors. Simpson was shot
with his own gun when Connors, a transient, grabbed the weapon
during a struggle.
   In its suit, the association also asked for two officers per
patrol car, but Grande said he would drop that demand if the city
agreed to hire 500 more officers.
   McEnery dismissed the need for so many more police, arguing that
despite the recent shootings San Jose is ``the safest big city in
America.''
   An FBI report last July showed that San Jose has only six violent
crimes per 1,000 population, far below Detroit's 25.4 per thousand,
Portland's 22.4, New York's 20.4, Chicago's 19.6 and Los Angeles'
19.1.
   San Jose also had the lowest homicide rate of California's 10
largest cities in 1987, when it had 26 killings. The city had 30
killings in 1988, but already has 13 so far this year, Grande said.
   Grande said the officers chose to fight the city in court after
getting nowhere in negotiations.
   ``The mayor has indicated over the past years that he supports
the police department but we see nothing forthcoming from his
office,'' Grande said.

   Two boys aged 4 and 5 were wounded
with a .38-caliber revolver they found while searching for chewing
gum in a purse belonging to the younger boy's mother, authorities
said.
   Jeremiah Curtis, 4, of Lake George was in serious condition
Thursday in the intensive care unit at St. Francis Hospital after he
was accidentally shot by his companion. The boy's lung collapsed,
and he lost part of his liver and much blood, officials said.
   Benjamin Mabrey, 5, of Florissant was in satisfactory condition
at St. Francis with a hand injury, authorities said.
   The shooting occurred Wednesday when Deborah Curtis and her son,
Jeremiah, stopped at the Mabrey residence in Florissant, 40 miles
west of here, said David Pierson, a Teller County sheriff's deputy.
   When Curtis got ready to leave, Jeremiah and Benjamin jumped into
the back seat of her car while the two mothers stood in the
driveway, Pierson said.
   Jeremiah was looking for chewing gum in his mother's purse when
Benjamin saw the .38-caliber revolver and pulled it out, the deputy
said.
   ``The 5-year-old held the gun up to his hands, like kids do when
they are shooting a water pistol, and the bullet went through his
hand, and then it hit the 4-year-old in the chest,'' Pierson said.
   Deborah Curtis, a real estate agent, said she was carrying the
loaded gun in her purse because she had to show property that
morning with people she didn't know and usually carries the gun
under such circumstances, Pierson said.
   The district attorney's office will investigate the case, said
Jeanne Smith, assistant district attorney.

<HEAD>Ortega Promises To Hand Over Power If Opposition Wins 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA TEJERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government will hand
over power if the opposition wins elections next year, visiting
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega promised.
   Ortega also announced a Central American summit would be held
Feb. 13-14 in El Salvador.
   The president said Thursday night that his Sandinista Liberation
Front was still the largest party in Nicaragua, but said ``whoever
wins the elections will assume power'' _ and cope with the most
battered economy in the region.
   ``If the opposition wins, they will have to assume power and
shoulder the responsibility of fixing the Nicaraguan economy, which
won't be easy,'' he told reporters at the end of a 2{-hour meeting
with President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   Earlier this week, Ortega announced a series of measures to try
to remedy the ravaged Nicaraguan economy, which is reeling from
inflation that reached 20,000 percent in 1988.
   Under the Nicaraguan Constitution, general elections must be held
in November 1990, and Ortega said he has already ``summoned
political parties to present their candidates.''
   Until now, the Sandinistas had refused to speak of handing over
the power they have held since they led a popular uprising that
toppled President Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   Ortega conducted intense talks on the Central American conflict
with Arias following the swearing-in ceremony for Venezuela's new
president, Carlos Andres Perez.
   Arias called the meeting with Ortega ``very frank'' and said that
he was convinced that ``without a doubt we can reach satisfactory
agreements'' about the thousands of Nicaraugan rebels in Honduras,
one of the main points of contention between Nicaragua and Honduras.
   Each Central American president attended the inauguration except
El Salvador's Jose Napoleon Duarte, who has terminal cancer and sent
his wife in his place.
   Ortega, who said he spoke by telephone Thursday with Duarte,
announced the summit of five Central American nations would be held
Feb. 13-14 in San Salvador.
   The presidents of the five nations _ Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Panama _ are expected to follow up on an
August 1987 plan to end warfare in the region.
   On Wednesday, Nicaragua presented new proposals, which include an
amnesty program for the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, reviewing the
cases of political prisoners and turning over some sectors of the
economy to private enterprise.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Against Yen, Stocks Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined today against the Japanese
yen, while stock prices firmed to set a record-high close in Tokyo.
   The dollar, after opening lower at 129.50 yen, the day's high,
dipped to 128.85 yen at one point before rebounding and closing the
week at 129.27 yen, down 0.48 yen from Thursday's close.
   Volume was estimated at an active $7.5 billion, compared to an
average daily volume of $5 billion.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 137.62-point winner the previous day, garnered another
178.48 points to close the week at a record 31,685.48. The previous
high of 31,646.13 points was set on Jan. 27.
   Volume was estimated at 2.0 billion shares, a three-month high.
   ``The gradual recovery of the yen, we believe, stems from the
market's expectations that the dollar would somewhat soften after
reaching a peak at a time when major monetary countries in the Group
of Seven are meeting in Washington,'' said Takamasa Yamasaki of the
Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   The dealer said market participants were expecting the seven
countries to reach agreement on the need to maintain currencies at a
stable level as the dollar inched down in value against the yen and
the German mark.
   ``The dollar's overnight retreat in London and New York also
tempted selling of the dollar,'' Yamasaki said.
   Bolstered by active stock purchases by foreign investors, trading
was brisk with construction and related issues showing continued
vigor, said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi of Daiwa Securities.
   Stocks also rallied following news reports that Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, in a meeting in Washington with President
Bush, pledged to further stimulate Japan's domestic demand,
Nishiguchi said.

   An Afghan guerrilla leader says
President Najib's regime will fold shortly after the Soviet army's
departure, and guerrillas are making plans to secure the major
cities without large-scale attacks.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the guerrilla group Hezb-i-Islami,
said the government ``will fall in weeks, not months.'' He addressed
a news conference in Peshawar, a frontier city where a seven-party
guerrilla alliance has its headquarters.
   Neighboring Pakistan and Iran, meanwhile, urged the factions to
end their squabbles and form a broad-based government in Kabul when
the Soviet withdrawal is completed. Pakistan and Iran support the
guerrillas.
   The Soviet army is due to complete its withdrawal from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord signed last
April.
   Hekmatyar said the insurgents were determined to avoid attacks on
Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other cities that would endanger
civilian lives. More than 2 million people, including many refugees,
have crammed into Kabul.
   ``The whole world will be witness to the fact that Kabul will
fall without any major onslaught on the city,'' Hekmatyar said.
   Abdul Haq, a senior military leader, said field commanders will
need plans for the administration of towns and cities that fall to
them, for bringing in food, and keeping water and power systems
operating.
   ``Before we knew only to attack the Russians,'' he said in an
interview. ``Now we must secure the nation, establish law and order,
feed the people, stop looting or killing. It is very difficult.''
   He said the Kabul regime was preparing to defend itself and about
5,000 special troopers had returned from training in the Soviet
Union in house-to-house fighting. The government also is
strengthening such elite formations as the presidential guard and
secret police militia, Haq said.
   Afghanistan's conscript army shows signs of collapse and is of
little use for major operations, he said, adding that government
forces generally are confined to cities and large towns, leaving the
countryside to the guerrillas.
   Haq said the guerrillas must find a way army units can surrender
safely and without fear of reprisal so they will not be compelled to
fight. ``We should not make them fight for survival,'' he said.
   Hekmatyar told the news conference there were arrangements for
securing the fall of major cities without large-scale attacks, but
gave no details. Other guerrilla groups said they were unaware of
such plans.
   Most of the nation's industry, agriculture and public facilities
have been destroyed by the civil war, which began after a communist
coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 and
an estimated 115,000 were in Afghanistan when the withdrawal began
in May under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Members of the seven-party alliance are trying to reach agreement
on a provisional government, but are deeply divided on sharing power
and other important issues.
   Syed Ahmed Gailani, head of the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, told reporters Thursday in Islamabad efforts were under
way to form an interim government. He indicated there were problems,
but did not elaborate.
   Ali Akbar Velayati and Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, foreign ministers of
Iran and Pakistan, appealed for guerrilla unity after two days of
meetings in Islamabad that ended Thursday, Pakistani diplomats said.
   A coalition of eight resistance groups is based in Iran. Most of
the guerrillas in Iran are Shiite Moslems, and those in Pakistan
largely follow the predominant Sunni branch of Islam.

<HEAD>FCC Commissioner Says Rules Needed on Phone Companies, Cable TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Federal Communications Commissioner says she
thinks the government must establish rules to assure that American
households are getting the most expansive selection of video, voice
and data material telephone companies have to offer.
   FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said Thursday she is
looking forward to the day when Americans will have access to an
unlimited number of two-way or ``interactive'' entertainment,
educational and communications signals carried into their homes by
lasers on telephone fiber optic cables.
   Expressing reservations about the ways telephone companies might
compete in the cable television arena, Dennis told a luncheon group
at FCC headquarters it was time to end an era of ``television of
scarcity'' in which a few companies offer a limited amount of
programming.
   She said regulations must be structured ``so that this cornucopia
of services will blossom _ just not video programming and video on
demand but interactive services for educational purposes, medical
purposes.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided to fill a top-level
State Department post with the man who oversaw background checks on
Republican vice-presidential hopefuls, the process that ended with
selection of Dan Quayle.
   Robert M. Kimmitt, a 41-year-old Washington lawyer, is Bush's
choice for undersecretary for political affairs. The job is now held
by Michael H. Armacost, who is expected to be named ambassador to
Japan. Bush announced his choice of Kimmitt on Thursday.
   Last summer Kimmitt oversaw background checks on the dozen-plus
Republicans under consideration by Bush as vice presidential
contenders.
   Kimmitt held several posts in the Reagan administration,
including executive secretary to the National Security Council from
1983-1985 and was general counsel of the Treasury Department from
1985-87.
   Bush also picked Morris Berthold Abram, the chairman of the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry, to be U.S. representative to
the European Office of the United Nations, a post that has
ambassadorial rank.
   Abram, 70, a lawyer, is also a former vice chairman of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights and was president of Brandeis University
in Waltham, Mass., in the late 1960s. He would succeed Joseph C.
Petrone.
   Other appointments announced Thursday by the White House included:
   _Richard R. Burt, U.S. ambassador to West Germany since 1985, to
be U.S. negotiator for strategic nuclear arms. The post carries an
ambassador's rank.
   _Richard T. McCormack, the U.S. representative to the
Organization of American States since 1985, to be undersecretary of
state for economic and agricultural affairs.
   _Reginald Bartholomew, U.S. ambassador to Spain since 1986, to be
undersecretary of state for coordinating security assistance
programs.
   _Ivan Selin, a computer and management consultant, to be
undersecretary of state for management.
   _Edith E. Holiday, financial operations director for the 1988
Bush campaign, to be general counsel for the Treasury Department.

<TEXT>
   President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the
Western Hemisphere's longest ruling leader, was placed under arrest
early Friday by the First Army Corps after it staged a rebellion, a
spokesman for the opposition claimed.
   Infantry divisions in three interior cities and an air force unit
sided with rebels after shooting broke out late Thursday and lasted
more than six hours.
   Stroessner, 76, ``is a prisoner ... and Gen. (Andres) Rodriguez
is in complete control of the situation,'' said the opposition
political leader, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The report on the detention of Stroessner, who has ruled since
1954, could not immediately be confirmed.
   The government issued no statement from the time gunfire began at
a military base and tanks rumbled through this semitropical capital
of 900,000, firing on the headquarters of the police and
presidential guard. Two planes flew low over the capital early
Friday but did not participate in the fighting.
   There was no immediate word on casualties.
   Rodriguez, commander of the powerful First Army Corps, issued a
statement, but it did not mention specific goals or motivations, nor
did it specify whether he was acting against Stroessner personally.
   ``Dear countrymen, appreciated comrades of the armed forces, we
have left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of
the armed forces, for the full and total unification of the ruling
Colorado Party, for the initiation of democratization in Paraguay,
for the respect of human rights, and for the defense of our Roman
Catholic religion.''
   Rodriguez, Paraguay's No. 2 military commander, is identified
with a faction within the ruling party that favors limited
democratic reforms.
   Diplomats and political sources said earlier Thursday that
Rodriguez for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He
refused.
   His statement was broadcast repeatedly by Radio Primera de Marzo,
one of two stations that stayed on the air.
   Residents quickly deserted downtown streets on a steamy summer
night when firefights involving cannon, recoilless rifles and heavy
machine guns broke out in the most serious incident against
Stroessner since he took power.
   The revolt by the army's largest and best-armed corps appeared to
catch Stroessner, the army commander, by surprise.
   Rodriguez, in his statement, asked citizens to remain calm.
   Shooting was first heard at 9:45 p.m. (7:45 p.m. EST) in front of
the First Army Corps' base in Loma Pyta, four miles to the north,
and continued early today.
   Some residents fled their homes, and witnesses reported seeing 40
to 50 tanks leave the base and rumble downtown, where exchanges of
gunfire continued past midnight.
   ``We're all keeping our heads down. We can hear mortar rounds
landing'' at the presidential escort battalion, said a U.S.
diplomat. The embassy and escort battalion are near one another on
Avenida Mariscal Lopez, lined with fine homes and old mango trees.
   The Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas reported early Friday
that heavy smoke could be seen from the quarters of the presidential
guard. Later, the station reported electricity was cut in its sector
of town.
   ``Return home and pray ... that nothing worse happens,'' the Rev.
Pastor Cuquejo, auxiliary archbishop of Asuncion, urged Paraguayans
in a radio address. Later, the bells of the National Cathedral
tolled briefly in the traditional call for prayer.
   The rebellion comes as Stroessner is in ill health following
surgery for a prostate operation five months ago.
   The stocky, vigorous general in recent months has worked fewer
hours, seen fewer people, delegated more work to subordinates and
looked pale and weak.
   The revolt follows a festering dispute within the Colorado Party
between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who
wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the unpopular,
authoritarian general.
   Domingo Laino, leader of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the
biggest opposition group, said the fighting ``has something to do
with Rodriguez and (Sabino) Montonaro,'' who is interior minister
and president of the Colorado Party.
   Montonaro leads the party's militant faction, which took over
party leadership in a divisive national congress in August 1987 and
since has purged its opponents from positions of power.
   Rodriguez is considered close to the traditionalist faction.
   The military and the Colorado Party control nearly all facets of
life in the California-sized nation of nearly 4 million between
Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina.
   Stroessner toppled Federico Chaves in 1954. The last unrest in
the military occurred in 1962, when a cadet was slain outside the
capital.

   Riot police arrested nine people during a
second night of arson and rock-and-bottle throwing that erupted in a
mostly black neighborhood following reports a suspected drug dealer
died in police custody.
   ``The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots,
you're going to get arrested,'' said Mayor Sandy Freedman after
police controlled the disturbance Thursday.
   About 70 police officers cordoned off the College Hill
neighorhood for nearly three hours after sunset. An officer hit by a
brick, Sgt. B.J. Curry, was treated at Tampa General Hospital and
released.
   ``It was very sporadic. Nothing on a major scale. It was kind of
hit and run,'' said Sgt. Walter Sluga.
   The Tampa incidents came as residents and officials in Miami seek
to maintain calm in the city's Overtown and Liberty City districts,
the scene of three days of rioting last month following the fatal
shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman.
   The College Hill neighborhood, the site of at least a half dozen
violent outbreaks in the past two years, erupted in a three-hour
melee Wednesday night following the drug arrest of Edgar Allen
Price, 40, who later died of a cardiac arrest.
   ``People feel trapped and they're ready to explode when something
even looks like brutality,'' said Eliott Johnson, pastor of Blessed
Hope Ministries two blocks from a looted grocery store. ``We're
still sitting on a keg of dynamite down here.'
   A mob of youths began throwing rocks and bottles at the officers
who struggled to subdue Price, a 6-foot-3, 300-pound black man from
Houston. Eight officers were finally called in to capture Price in
the living room of his girlfriend's mother.
   The girl's mother, a heart patient with a pacemaker who uses a
walker, ended up under the pileup on the floor. She was not injured.
   Price, who suffered a two-inch gash in his head during the
struggle, began experiencing heart trouble in a police cruiser
shortly after his arrest. He died about 90 minutes later at St.
Joseph's Hospital.
   Police said Price was not beaten or choked during the arrest, and
an autopsy was being performed to substantiate the cause of death.
   ``We wanted to dispel any rumors we beat a man to death,'' said
Police Chief Austin McLane.
   Dr. Charles Diggs, an assistant Hillsborough County medical
examiner, said preliminary autopsy results suggest Price may have
suffocated in the police cruiser because his breathing was
constricted due to being handcuffed.
   Price was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded
.25-caliber derringer in his pockets, said police spokesman Steve
Cole.
   Price was sentenced in 1974 to 50 years on a Texas robbery
conviction and also had a 1967 robbery arrest on his record, said
Cole. He did not know the disposition of that case.
   During Wednesday night's unrest, an estimated 75 young people
threw rocks and bottles, fired at least two gunshots at a television
news van and looted and burned a grocery store. Officials cordoned
off four intersections in the 22-block housing development and
summoned 100 police officers and 30 firefighters.
   At least four officers received minor injuries, and a 21-year-old
man was arrested on charges of inciting to riot, disorderly conduct
and drinking in public.
   There was no official estimate of the size of the crowd involved
in Thursday's unrest, although it was believed smaller than the 50
to 75 youths believed involved in Wednesday's unrest. Among the nine
people arrested were four members of the African People's Socialist
Party from St. Petersburg.
   Last April, a crowd of 400 threw rocks and bottles following the
arrest of a robbery suspect in the neighborhood, and violence
erupted in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died in
police custody. A white police officer who used a neck hold to
subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing, but the neck hold
was banned.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Clean Oil Spill That Threatens Delicate Ecosystem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. experts were en route today to
Antarctica to clean an oil spill that threatens the delicate
ecosystem, but an environmentalist said only a few weeks remain
before the area's frigid waters begin to freeze.
   A giant C-5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gear
to the southern port of Punta Arenas on Thursday. The crew was to
board on a U.S. research ship departing today for the spill, about
590 miles south of the Cape Horn.
   Anton Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, said the vessel Polar
Duke would take about four days to reach the spill, just off the
Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S. scientific
base Palmer Station.
   However, a Greenpeace spokesman cautioned that less than two
months remain to contain the damage.
   ``They can't hang around too long,'' said Peter Wilkinson from
the Greenpeace ship Gondwana in Antarctic waters. ``By mid- to
late-April the ice will start to freeze over.''
   ``Any ship that's underwater in Antarctica with that amount of
fuel poses a big problem,'' he said in a radio telephone interview
to Sydney, Australia.
   The environmental group is calling for an international effort to
contain damage caused by the sinking Tuesday of an Argentine navy
vessel that, according to the National Science Foundation, was
carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel.
   In a stop in Santiago on Thursday, Inderbitzen told reporters the
crew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the polluted
area.
   ``All the young penguins are just about at the age where they
take their first swim,'' he said. ``When these birds enter the water
for the first time, it could be the last time.''
   The 9,300-ton Paradise Bay was leaking fuel oil at an
undetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of
compressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday,
``There really wasn't a (significant) spill.''
   An Argentine navy statement said an icebreaker was to arrive at
the scene today to ``assess the best ways available to combat the
pollution.''
   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said
hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked from the ship and created a slick
up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports appeared
exaggerated.
   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''
said a navy snnel at Palmer Station were
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around
the grounded ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels in the water,'' Renirie said in a telephone interview from
Santiago. ``And there's still oil coming out of the ship.''
   Inderbitzen said the Science Foundation, which organized the
cleanup mission and directs all U.S. activities in Antarctica,
feared lasting environmental damage.
   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had
caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,
Renirie said.
   Inderbitzen said Antarctica's unspoiled environment requires
special measures to contain the spill, which is near two areas set
aside for scientific study under terms of the Antarctic Treaty.
   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to
recover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in Antarctica, it takes
plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.
It's a very, very fragile environment.''
   The crew has a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled
oil and pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and
inflatable booms to contain drifting oil.
   The cleanup work will be peformed by Marine Pollution Control
Co., under contract to the U.S. Navy, Renirie said.

<TEXT>
   If and when the Afghan insurgents slip
out of the mountains and attempt to take this capital city, the
government's last line of defense will be a politically select and
specially trained elite guard.
   But like much else in Kabul, the most important questions about
the guard _ how motivated, well-equipped and trained it is _ have no
certain answers.
   As artillery fire greeted one of the final Soviet convoys to move
up the Salang Highway toward the Soviet border Thursday, soldiers of
the Kabul special guard were training at a former Soviet military
base in the center of the city.
   Some soldiers lay sprawled on the ground as drills were conducted
on a paved square.
   Many troops smiled at Western reporters or at each other as about
50 staged a drill of mounting six armored cars directly behind them.
   The uniforms did not match. Some of those taking part in the
drill by the armored cars were dressed in brown uniforms while
others wore khaki-colored padded jackets.
   Males and females as young as 17 or as old as 45 can volunteer
for the force. But some of the soldiers looked younger and others
much older.
   Maj. Gen. Mohammed Asin, the group's chief political officer,
told reporters, ``We will defend the city ... if necessary.''
   ``After the withdrawal of the Soviet soldiers, we will be able to
defend the country,'' said the general, who was dressed in fresh
camouflage gear and shiny brown leather loafers.
   If the resistance ``wants to impose war on us, there will be a
reaction,'' he said.
   Soviet troops are due to be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15 under
the terms of a U.N.-brokered agreement signed last April.
   Western observers have said the Afghan government force suffers
from high defections and low morale, and is ill-prepared to fight
the U.S.- and Pakistan-backed rebels.
   If the rebels are able to close in on this dusty capital in the
weeks after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, it is not certan
whether they will try to slowly squeeze the city into submission or
try to take it with an all-out assault.
   In any case, it is the special guard's task to defend the capital.
   The guard was formed several months ago on orders of the office
of President Najib, whose pro-Soviet government is being pressed by
the rebels as the Soviet soldiers leave.
   Sources in Kabul have said the original units of the special
guard were formed from the best of Afghan military units, but that
recent additions to the force have consisted primarily of raw
recruits.
   Asin said the force still is gaining members and eventually will
number more than 10,000 troops.
   The troops receive training in artillery tactics and other
military specialties as well as infantry training, officers said.
   The majority are members of Najib's Peoples Democratic Party of
Afghanistan, its youth organization or affiliates, Asin said. The
rest he described as ``Afghan patriots.''
   One of the duties of the special guard is to protect the
president himself.
   The 42-year-old general did not say how much soldiers are paid in
the special guard, but denied money was a factor in attracting
soldiers.
   The military base in Kabul serves as a reminder of Afghanistan's
long history of struggle involving foreign powers.
   An obelisk built at the camp pays tribute to the Soviet soldiers
who have fought in Afghanistan.
   And high on a hill overlooking the base stands the ruins of an
ancient stone fort where the Afghans say hundreds of British
soldiers died in 1878 during a British-Afghan war.
   Members of the special guard already have been involved in
combat. Asin said one man was wounded in heavy fighting along the
Salang Highway north of Kabul last week. The highway is the only
ground route for the departing Soviet troops, and Afghan and Soviet
forces have been fighting to keep it open.

   A strong explosion ripped through a shrine in
central Tokyo today, shattering windows and causing part of the
ceiling to collapse, police said. No injuries were reported.
   The pre-dawn blast shattered more than a dozen windows and burned
a covered passageway at the Togo Shrine, said a police official who
spoke on condiiton of anonymity.
   Parts of a fire extinguisher, electrical wires and welding
materials, which could have been used in making a bomb, were found
near the shrine's main building, the official said.
   However, he refused to confirm if police suspect radicals bombed
the Togo Shrine, a Shinto shrine, because of its close association
with militarism and loyalty to the emperor. Ultraleftist groups have
been linked by police to at least seven incidents since the death
last month of Emperor Hirohito.
   The Togo Shrine was founded in memory of Heihachiro Togo, an
admiral during the Russo-Japanese War who commanded the interception
and destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Battle of
Tsushima in 1905.
   Togo was in charge of educating Hirohito from 1914 until 1924,
and was known for his loyalty to the monarchy. He died in 1934.
   The shrine is located less than a mile from the site where
Hirohito's state funeral will be held Feb. 24.
   Teruo Matsuhashi, a priest at the shrine, said two priests were
staying at the shrine when the explosion occured and 20 more
employees were asleep in an annex, which was undamaged. ``I don't
know why they would want to attack us,'' Matsuhashi said.

   Thirty years after the music died, the
memories of rock 'n' roll stars Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P.
``Big Bopper'' Richardson are being revived here in sculptures as
big as life.
   Relatives of Holly and Valens arrived in Port Arthur on Thursday
for a private showing of the sculptures, to be followed by a public
unveiling and concert in Beaumont today on the 30th anniversary of
their deaths.
   ``This is really an honor,'' said Maria Elena Holly, Holly's
widow. ``I have no words to express. It is very touching. He would
be so proud. He would be crying to be in such good company.''
   ``There's no way I can express,'' said Bob Morales of
Watsonville, Calif., Valens' brother. ``He'd love it. It's the most
beautiful thing he could see.''
   The musicians were killed on Feb. 3, 1959, when their small plane
crashed in bad weather near Clear Lake, Iowa, en route to a concert
date in Fargo, N.D.
   At the time, Holly was a giant on the fledgling rock'n'roll scene
and his death became known as ``the day the music died.'' Valens was
a budding star famous for his hit ``La Bamba.''
   Richardson, who was from Beaumont, was known as ``The Big
Bopper'' and recently had earned a gold record for his hit song
``Chantilly Lace.''
   ``He was my hero,'' said John Palmer, a Port Arthur businessman
credited with being the force behind the memorials. ``These guys
were budding stars and then they were gone _ whammo! It's
frightening and it can happen to anybody. To think the only memorial
to these guys is here, it shakes me. I'm so happy.''
   The life-size sculptures were made by Port Arthur artist Doug
Clark for the city's historical society, which began its sculpture
collection last year with Clark's portait of rock queen Janis
Joplin, a Port Arthur native who died in 1970.
   Clark said he worked from videotapes of Richardson and Holly and
from photos of Valens. His pose of the three _ with the Bopper's
arms around Valens and Holly _ is intended to show the trio as if
they were standing for a picture just before boarding the fateful
flight to Fargo.
   ``I don't know that there really is such a picture,'' Clark said.
``But I could just imagine someone getting one last shot before they
got on the airplane.''
   A second sculpture of Richardson alone shows the wide-eyed
grinning singer with a guitar at his waist and his arms wide open.
   Proceeds from today's event will go toward the purchase of a
$50,000 building for a Port Arthur museum that would include rock
'n' roll memorabilia.
   Until the museum is built, the sculptures will stand in a local
library.

   Principal Matthew Plevyak promised pupils at
Bel Air Middle School he'd put on a chicken suit if they read four
books each in a month. Now he's flapping down Main Street.
   The 935 students, challenged to read four books apiece last
month, tackled 5,527 or nearly six each.
   ``It's worth it,'' seventh-grader Susan Hoopergardner said as she
waited for the feathered Plevyak to walk through the center of this
northern Maryland town Wednesday.
   Teachers decorated the principal's office like a chicken coop,
and a local newspaper delivered five roosters to the school.
   Plevyak, in costume, arrived at the school in the back of a
pickup truck, read to classes and ate lunches with the classes that
read most of the books.
   He said his day as a chicken was a lot of fun.
   ``In nine years, the students have not seen me wear anything but
a suit and tie to school,'' Plevyak said, adding, ``We hope that
some of them found out that reading books is fun.
   ``Everybody is wondering what we're going to do next year,'' he
said. ``Maybe we'll make the science teachers dress up like
ballerinas or something.''

   New Mexico has a state bird, tree, animal,
vegetable and mineral. Now it wants a cookie.
   House Bill 406 would correct that glaring deficiency, giving
state cookie honors to the bischochito, a rich sugar and anise
cookie relished by residents of northern New Mexico, especially
during the Christmas season.
   Three Albuquerque-area Democratic representatives sponsored the
cookie bill, and a bipartisan group of 16 lawmakers co-signed it
recently.
   If the bill passes, it would add the bischochito to the ranks of
the yucca, the official state flower; the roadrunner, the official
bird; the pinon, the official tree; the native trout, the official
fish; the black bear, the official animal; the chili and pinto bean,
official vegetables; the turquoise, the official gem; blue gramma
grass, the official grass; and the coelophysis, the official fossil.

   A bovine version of the
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich may help keep hay from spoiling and
make it more nutritious and delicious for cattle.
   Researchers at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale are
spreading a substance that resembles peanut butter onto bales of hay
to see if it shields the hay from rain and snow and reduces spoiling.
   They also may add flavorings to the protective paste to make it
more appealing to livestock and nutrients to make it more healthful,
said Robert Wolff, a professor of agricultural mechanization at the
school.
   The product, called ``balebutter'' because it resembles peanut
butter, consists of soybean oil and minerals.
   ``Not only does it have the capacity to cut down on hay loss, but
it also utilizes agricultural products,'' Wolff said recently. ``We
need to find new uses for soybeans.''
   Wolff said a farmer, Dale Halford, developed balebutter and
brought it to the university for evaluation.
   ``We're still investigating,'' said Wolff. ``We don't know yet if
it has fantastic potential or it doesn't.''

   A Burma Airways jet taking off from
Rangoon's Mingaladon Airport struck a tree and crashed today,
killing 26 people on board and injuring three, state radio said.
   Four people on the ground also were injured when the turboprop
jet crashed near housing for families of air force personnel, Radio
Rangoon said.
   The radio gave engine failure as the cause of the crash, Burma's
fourth since mid-1987, and said the accident was being investigated.
   It said the plane failed to gain height and hit a 15-foot tree
shortly after taking off on a flight for Kengtung, 380 miles
northeast of Rangoon. The plane then swerved to the left and plowed
through trees and electric lines, it said.
   The aircraft, a Dutch-made Fokker 27, carried 25 passengers and
four crew members. The radio report did not identify the three
survivors.
   All on board were presumed to be Burmese nationals since Kengtung
is normally off limits to foreigners due to security problems in the
area.
   Burma Airways has lost four Fokker 27s since June 21, 1987 when
45 people were killed after take-off from Heho airport in the Shan
States.
   All 49 people on board were killed near Pagan in central Burma in
a crash on Oct. 11, 1987. Last June 16, a chartered aircraft crashed
on a flight from Myitkyina to Putao in northern Burma and all four
aboard were killed.
   Burma's tiny fleet of eight aircraft is plagued by a shortage of
spare parts and poor maintenance. After today's crash the airline
has five Fokker 27s for domestic service and three Fokker 28 jets
for international flights.

   A Soviet soldier shot at three French
journalists today in a yard where departing Red Army troops gather,
slightly wounding one of the correspondents, a witness said.
   Jean Francois Leven, a correspondent for the weekly magazine
L'Express, was taken to the Red Cross hospital in Kabul with a
slight bullet wound to his right buttock, said Laurent Zecchini, a
fellow correspondent who was at the scene.
   Leven arrived in Afghanistan on Sunday and is one of 35 foreign
journalists covering the pullout of the Soviet army.
   Leven, Zecchini and Patrick Robert, a photographer for the Sygma
photo agency, where at a yard where Soviet troops assemble before
starting their journey home. The yard is at the base of the Salang
Highway, the strategic 260-mile road linking the capital to the
Soviet border.
   Zecchini said about 15 Soviet solders were talking to some Afghan
boys selling leather bags.
   ``I think they were about to make a deal. I think that's why one
of them started shooting,'' he said.
   He said one soldier fired four or five shots at the ground and
the three journalists raced back to their taxi. He said the soldier
fired one more shot, but Zecchini did not know if the bullet was
fired directly at the car or ricocheted and then pierced the door,
striking Leven.
   The French Embassy was notified about the incident.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, the Soviets have said they would
withdraw their troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

   President Carlos Andres Perez used his
inauguration ceremony to appeal to Latin American leaders to form a
united front on the $410 billion they owe foreign creditors.
   Perez, who took office Thursday, will host today's meeting on the
region's debt crisis with the presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Peru
and Uruguay and foreignministers of Argentina and Mexico.
   They are expected to consider a proposal to hold a conference
between the Latin debtor nations and seven major creditor countries
_ Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and West
Germany.
   The officials attended the swearing-in ceremony, in which Perez
blamed what he called Latin America's ``vicious cycle of debt and
economic stagnation'' on debt payments that consume most of the
region's resources.
   He also said that improved relations between the United States
and Latin America would have to include discussions on the $410
billion regional debt and peace in Central America.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, also in Caracas for the inauguration,
called the proposal a ``non-starter.''
   Quayle discussed the issue with Latin American leaders, including
Brazil's President Jose Sarney, whose country heads the list of
debtor nations with $114 billion. Next on the debtor list is Mexico,
followed by Argentina.
   Sarney told Quayle he favored treating the debt as a
``political'' issue, meaning it should be dealt with on a
government-to-government basis.
   Quayle said he would relay the demands to President Bush, but
that he did not expect major shifts in the U.S. position.
   President Felipe Gonzalez of Spain called the idea unrealistic.
   On Thursday, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced five
Central American presidents agreed to meet in El Salvador Feb. 13-14
for talks on regional peace.
   Among issues to be discussed would be democratic reforms in
Nicaragua, according to Ortega.
   The Central American presidents agreed in August 1987 to a plan
for cease-fires in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua.

   First there were the whales, trapped in an
ice-bound sea as red-nosed reporters from around the world shivered
in wait. Then things really got cold, again chilling Alaska's
efforts to warm its frosty image.
   Mark Rhoads, a public relations consultant in Washington, D.C.,
said he was watching television this week when he noticed some
startling mixed messages about Alaska.
   ``The weather report had just been on and they were reporting
these ghastly temperatures in Alaska,'' Rhoads recalled Thursday.
``The very next thing after the weather report was a commercial to
promote tourism in Alaska.''
   The commercial Rhoads saw features a southern governor enjoying a
sunny barbecue along a scenic Alaska bay. There's blue sky, lush
forest and not a hint of snow or ice. The governor has been away
from his home state a bit too long, and when his parka-clad aides
track him down he jokes that they're ``a little bit overdressed.''
   ``They're clever commercials, but they were just out of sync that
particular day,'' Rhoads said.
   That's the attitude state officials hope potential tourists adopt
as they plan their summer vacations. They say they don't believe the
publicity will lead to fewer tourists visiting the nation's largest
state, which bills itself as ``The Last Frontier.''
   ``Weather stories come along all the time. They have a passing
effect on people's thinking,'' said Hugh Gellert, director of the
state Tourism Division.
   But the past several months have focused an unusual amount of
national attention on Alaska, all of it having to do with ice.
   Before the record cold wave, there was the effort last fall to
save the trapped whales near Barrow. Telecasts of shivering
reporters on the windy and frozen Arctic tundra did nothing to warm
the hearts of Alaska's tourism officials.
   Rod Bradley, president of the Anchorage advertising firm that
handles the state's tourism ad campaign, said those scenes reinforce
a negative image of Alaska among residents in the lower 48 states.
   ``They still think we live in igloos and drive dog teams. There's
an ingrained bias there,'' Bradley said. ``We're the most
misunderstood state in the union, there's no doubt about it.''
   Alaska will spend about $7.6 million on tourism promotion this
year. Of that, $2.5 million is being spent on the television ads in
major urban markets and on cable.
   The ad campaign is part of a long-term effort to change Alaska's
image. It is based on extensive research showing many potential
tourists don't come to Alaska because they think it's too cold.
   ``The intent of those ads is not to say it's not cold ever in
Alaska, but to say this is not a year-round land of ice and snow. We
have some parts of the year when its warm, sunny, and all the nice
colors come out,'' Gellert said.
   Bob Miller, director of the Alaska Tourism Marketing Council,
says the commercials are under review and the ``weather strategy''
may be replaced next year. He says the icy publicity may actually
draw tourists.
   ``In many cases in enhances people's interest in coming in the
summer,'' Miller said.
   He may be right. Seattle-based Holland America Lines Westours,
the largest cruise ship company serving Alaska, reports heavy
bookings in recent weeks for summer cruises to Alaska.
   Company spokesman Rick Skinner said that's because those buying
Alaska cruises know what to expect.
   ``They've looked at the literature to make sure they know what to
wear and that sort of thing,'' Skinner said. ``They tend to be
well-educated and much more erudite than the typical Caribbean
cruiser would be.''

   A man dismissed as coach of his
daughter's basketball team after officials discovered he has AIDS
won a reprieve while the school board decides whether he poses a
public health threat.
   Allen Ward, who works as the volunteer coach of his daughter's
intramural team at Laurel Elementary School, was dismissed last week
after only one game. He was reinstated temporarily Thursday.
   In firing Ward, administrators cited a new AIDS policy requiring
school employees suspected of carrying the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus to be tested and their cases reviewed by a
committee of health and school officials.
   Don Jobe, superintendent of Franklin County Community Schools,
said at a news conference Thursday that Ward would be allowed to
continue coaching pending a decision by the school board whether his
condition is a public health threat.
   But Jobe said he doesn't think Ward's condition ``constitutes an
immediate health threat.''
   He said he made the decision to reinstate Ward after speaking
with the coach's physician, the Franklin County health officer and
officials at the State Board of Health.
   The school board was awaiting written confirmation of Ward's
condition from his physician in Indianapolis, Jobe said. A final
decision on whether Ward can stay on indefinitely is expected in
about two weeks, he said.
   Ward was diagnosed as having AIDS last June while undergoing a
blood test in Indianapolis. He contracted the deadly disease from
tainted blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984.
   The parents of some of Ward's players were upset he was suspended.
   ``Everybody is afraid of AIDS, but I don't think breeding
stupidity into our children will make it go away,'' said Dora Cable
of Metamora, whose 10-year-old son is on Ward's team.
   ``It's been blown out of proportion,'' added Pam Gerrain, whose
sixth-grade child is on the team. ``I don't see anything wrong with
him coaching the team. I'm not worried about it, but there's always
a chance I guess.''
   Ward, who launched a petition drive to be reinstated, said he was
happy to go back to work. ``I really feel good about it. I believe
their decision will come out in my favor.''
   He said he was concerned that school officials _ fearing he would
transmit AIDS to others _ would bar him from the school and would
insist on testing his children, Dande, 10, and Christopher, 14, for
the AIDS virus.
   The disease, which attacks the body's immune system, is
transmitted primarily through bodily fluids, such as during sexual
contact, intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but not
through casual contact.
   Ward had volunteered to coach the team of fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders when his daughter decided to play at the school, 60
miles southeast of Indianapolis.
   His wife, Theresa, offered to substitute as coach while her
husband's case was pending but was told that she, too, would have to
undergo an AIDS test.
   ``I have no physical contact with them (team members) at all,''
Ward said. ``I might throw a basketball to them, but if they're
going to get it that way, we're all in trouble.''
   A similar argument was made after school authorities in Howard
County barred Ryan White from his classes in 1985 because he has
AIDS. Ryan eventually won the legal right to return to classes, but
his family soon moved to Cicero in Hamilton County.

   Space shuttle Discovery was moved out
of its hangar today on its way to a launch pad where technicians
hope to replace three engine turbopumps in time for a mid-March
liftoff.
   The earliest possible launch date is March 10. If the shuttle
can't be launched by March 18, Discovery would be pulled back to a
hangar, yielding the pad to Atlantis, whose crew is to dispatch the
Magellan probe to Venus after a liftoff scheduled for April 28.
   Atlantis' planetary payload has priority over Discovery's
communications satellite because after May 23, Venus will not be in
the proper alignment with Earth again until 1991.
   ``We are under pressure, but in this case it's good pressure
because it will just make us be sure that we pay attention to all
the details in that we know we have a point to meet. But we know we
can make it,'' said B.K. Davis, NASA's shuttle engine manager at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``I think we're in good shape,'' Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's
associate administator for space flight, said Thursday at a Houston
awards ceremony. Discovery will ``fly sometime in the middle of
March.''
   Perched vertically on a giant tracked transporter, Discovery
moved out of an assembly building into the darkness at 6 a.m. to
begin a four-mile trip that was expected to take six to seven hours.
The transporter, called a crawler, traveled at a maximum speed of 1
mph.
   Shuttle managers, who had been debating for several days what to
do about Discovery's suspect turbopumps, decided Wednesday to
replace all three of them on the launch pad in conjunction with
other work. They also postponed the launch from late February to
mid-March.
   The problem stems from an Atlantis flight in December. A
post-flight inspection of the shuttle's engines disclosed two tiny
cracks in a bearing housing in one of three high-speed turbopumps
that convert liquid oxygen to a gas.
   Engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion
resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the
manufacturing process. Because two of Discovery's turbopumps
underwent the same processing, NASA decided to replace all three
pumps with new, carefully-inspected units.
   The pumps are a critical component because the shuttle could
explode if one failed during liftoff.
   In the past, turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle was
horizontal in a checkout building. But Discovery is now in a
vertical position and, without previous experience, there is an
uncertainty about how long the replacement will take. The new pumps
are scheduled to arrive here the week of Feb. 12.
   Discovery will be commanded by astronaut Michael Coats. With him
will be John Blaha, James Buchli, Bob Springer and James Bagian.
During five days in space they are to release a communications
satellite and conduct science and medical experiments.

   An arctic air mass maintained its icy grip on the northern and
central sections of the nation today, generating dangerous wind
chills of 80 below, as freezing rain made roads treacherous from
Texas to Vermont.
   Snow fell in Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.
   Temperatures fell below minus-20 degrees in Montana, Wyoming,
North Dakota and Minnesota, making for a 100-degree difference
between North Dakota and Texas.
   At midnight, it was 36 degrees below zero in Cody, Wyo., and 34
below in Broadus, Mont. The mercury plunged to a record low of
minus-14 in Goodland, Kan., where the old record of minus-7 was last
tied in 1981. It was the second consecutive record low for that city.
   Winds combined with the cold to produce dangerous wind chills
across the central and northern Plains. Wind chills between 60
degrees below and 80 degrees below zero were common in Montana and
the Dakotas.
   Freezing rain, freezing drizzle and sleet fell from north central
Texas to Vermont, with snow in extreme northern Ohio and northern
Vermont, making driving dangerous.
   Showers and thunderstorms dumped heavy rain and small hail on
sections of Texas and Arkansas, with some places getting more than 2
inches of rain. A flash flood watch was in effect for southwest
Arkansas. Rainfall also was heavy in western Kentucky and southern
Indiana.
   In the West, snowstorms accompanied by wind buffeted Wyoming and
Colorado. Up to 8 inches of snow was predicted for Colorado mountain
passes. Snow also was heavy in a small section of Utah south of the
Salt Lake area. Up to 8 inches of snow fell in the state.
   More than 5 inches of snow fell Thursday in Salem, Ore., and
heavy snow continued to fall over the state's western valleys today.
   Winds up to 75 mph blasted through mountain ridges around Lake
Tahoe and California's Sierra Nevada. Up to 6 inches of snow fell in
24 hours in the northern Sierra Nevada.
   Today's forecast called for snow from Oregon to Idaho and the
central Rockies, from Nebraska to the middle Mississippi Valley and
over the Great Lakes and central New England; freezing rain and
sleet from southeast Missouri to central Illinois and from western
and central New York to Connecticut; rain from the lower Mississippi
Valley to the Ohio Valley and the Middle Atlantic States; scattered
rain showers along the California coast and dangerous wind chills
from the northern and central Rockies to the northern and central
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were predicted from 25 degrees below zero to
minus 10 from the northern Rockies and northern Plains to western
Nebraska and northwest Kansas; from minus 10 to zero from northern
Idaho to the Colorado Rockies, the central High Plains, the lower
Missouri Valley and the upper Mississippi Valley; the single digits
and teens from much of the Pacific Northwest to northwest Colorado,
from the southern Plains to central Missouri and in northeast
Wisconsin and northern New England; the 20s and 30s from the
northern Pacific Coast to Nevada, western and northern Texas, the
middle Mississippi Valley, the lower Great Lakes and central New
England; the 40s, 50s and 60s from the California coast to southern
Texas, the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and the Middle
Atlantic States; and the 70s and 80s from the central Gulf Coast to
the southern Atlantic Coast and Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 35
degrees below zero at Cody, Wyo., to 74 degrees at Fort Lauderdale
and Key West Naval Air Station, Fla.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Not Kidding With Bill To Give 12-Year-Olds Voting Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker has proposed that
12-year-olds be allowed to vote in state elections, saying arguments
against her bill are the same ones once used by opponents of voting
rights for women and blacks.
   ``It's kind of an adult supremacist attitude,'' state Rep.
Phyllis Kahn said Thursday as she introduced her bill calling for a
constitutional amendment to be placed on the state ballot for the
1990 general election.
   ``Do I think it's going to be instantly agreed upon and pass?
No,'' said Kahn, a member of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party from
Minneapolis. ``I think it's a concept that people have to think
about.''
   It didn't take much thinking for some legislators, like Rep.
Bernie Omann, an Independent-Republican from St. Joseph, to dismiss
the idea, dubbed the kiddie vote bill.
   ``Is this a joke? They play a lot of jokes around here,'' said
Omann, a freshman representative who is the Legislature's youngest
member at age 24.
   Pondering the possibilities, Omann asked, ``What does that mean
for politicians? Shaking hands in elementary schools?''
   The bill wasn't taken as a joke by Secretary of State Joan Growe,
who oversees state elections. The proposal accomplishes more than
raising the argument of who should be able to vote, she said.
   ``I also believe it is really a very dramatic way of calling
attention to the fact that those who can't vote truly have no
power,'' Growe said.
   Kahn, who holds a doctorate in biophysics from Yale and a
master's degree from Harvard, acknowledged that she and the bill's
Senate author, Donna Peterson did have much more in mind than
children's suffrage.
   ``I think that giving children the right to vote is an essential
part of giving them additional political benefits. This route is
just a little less paternalistic,'' she said.
   Kahn said there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that would
prohibit lowering the voting age, since constitutional language only
prohibits the denial of voting rights to those 18 or older.
   About whether most children under 18 are mature enough to cast a
vote, Kahn said, ``The alternative is just because someone is 18
doesn't mean they're mature enough to vote.''

   The U.S. dollar rose in light, nervous trading in
Europe today as market players awaited fresh news from the
Washington meeting of the group of finance ministers from leading
industrialized countries.
   Gold prices moved down.
   ``The dollar is just bouncing around right now without any new
factors in the market,'' said one Frankfurt dealer. ``People are a
little nervous about the G-7 meeting and trading is very light.''
   The Group of Seven is made up of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.48 yen to a closing 129.27 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 129.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8779 West German marks, up from 1.8700
   _1.5952 Swiss francs, up from 1.5923
   _6.3885 French francs, up from 6.3735
   _2.1180 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1135
   _1,370.75 Italian lire, up from 1,368.50
   _1.1885 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1882.
   In London, the dollar also rose against the British pound, which
cost $1.7475, cheaper than $1.7515 on Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $391.35 a troy ounce, up
from $392.25 bid late Thursday, but fell back in later trading. At
midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $390.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price at noon was $390.40, down from $391.50
bid late Thursday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.81 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $5.86.

<HEAD>President Approves Bill To Retire Elderly Lawmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui today signed a law
that will give large bonuses to lawmakers elected in China 42 years
ago who voluntarily retire, but officials said many of the aging
politicians refuse to step down.
   A statement said the bill, part of the ruling Nationalist Party's
plan to increase the clout of native Taiwanese in the government,
will take effect Monday.
   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to Communist forces on the mainland, still claims
to be the rightful ruler of all China.
   The elderly lawmakers, most of them Nationalists, have been
frozen in office until they can return to their mainland
constituencies for new elections.
   Chang Chun, a 100-year-old presidential adviser, signed up today
to retire from the 880-seat National Assembly ``to support the
government reform,'' Assembly Secretary Gen. Irwine Ho said.
   Chang, the oldest assemblyman, will receive a one-time payment of
about $143,000, or more than five times his annual salary, for
stepping down.
   Ho told reporters only about 100 elderly members of the assembly
_ an electoral college that meets every six years to choose the
president _ are expected to retire this year. Approximately 700 more
aging assemblymen will wait to consider retirement until after the
next presidential election in May 1990, he said.
   Meanwhile, officials of the 297-seat Legislative Yuan said about
70 of the body's 200 elderly members are expected to retire this
year. Many others refuse to step down because they believe they
still represent their mainland constituents, the officials said.
   The opposition party Democratic Progressive Party has attacked
the retirement bill for failing to restrict pension payments to
lawmakers who resign this year. But the Nationalist Party rejected
the demand to avoid outraging the elderly legislators.
   Lawmakers elected on Taiwan now account for 73 seats in the
297-seat Legislative Yuan and 106 seats in the 880-seat National
Assembly. Most other members were elected on the Chinese mainland.
   Legislation has yet to be introduced to increase the number of
Taiwan's elected members in the two parliamentary bodies.
   The Nationalist Party proposed last week to increase the number
of elected Legislative Yuan lawmakers to 130 for the December
election. Under the plan, Taiwan-elected lawmakers would rise to 150
by 1992, when all elderly lawmakers are expected to have retired.

<TEXT>
   Mechanical problems may have caused
the derailment that killed at least 15 people on a crowded passenger
train, officials said today.
   Three cars of the 10-car, Dhaka-bound express train derailed
Thursday at Kumira, 14 miles north of this port city.
   The official death toll rose to 15 today after two people died of
their injuries in a Chittagong hospital. However, the independent
newspaper Inquilab said at least 25 people were killed and more than
100 injured. Officials say about 70 people were injured.
   Inquilab said some bodies were reportedly removed from the scene
either by their relatives or rescuers, and therefore remained
unaccounted for.
   The government news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha said the
train was carrying at least 2,100 passengers, three times its
authorized capacity, including many travelers riding on top of the
train or clinging outside the doors.
   A railroad official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
generator under a first-class coach may have broken and gotten
caught in the track, throwing the coach and two adjoining cars off
the track.
   Chittagong's police superintendent, Mohammad Talukder, blamed
defects in the train's frame and mechanical system.
   On Thursday night, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha quoted an
unidentified railroad official who was traveling on the train as
saying the derailment was caused by a defect in a dining car.
   The wreck happened less than three weeks after two trains
collided head on near Dhaka, killing 114 people in Bangladesh's
worst-known rail disaster.
   The Jan. 15 crash also happened on the line linking Dhaka with
Chittagong, 135 miles southeast of the capital.

   Bus and rail traffic ground to a halt

government's low wage and benefits, reports said.
   Union officials said about 95 percent of the bus, street car,
ferry boat and commuter services were paralyzed in Lisbon and
Oporto, the country's two main cities, and that national rail
services also had stopped.
   Officials at the state airline TAP said today that about half the
company's scheduled flights faced cancellation.
   Workers for the many state industries are protesting a loss in
purchasing power, saying wage rises granted last year by the
government were inadequate because of inflation.

<TEXT>
   Marchers threw firebombs at club-swinging
police during a rally to protest Vienna's social event of the year,
and police said today that 52 people were injured.
   Dozens of cars and shop windows were shattered in the worst clash
in three straight years of ``Eat the Rich'' protests against
Thursday's glittering Opera Ball in Vienna's famed opera house.
   ``I've never seen such mass aggression at a demonstration like
this,'' said Gustav Hochenbichler, head of Austria's security police.
   Thousands of police equipped with helmets, plastic shields and
metal barriers used rubber truncheons and water hoses to keep about
1,500 youths away from the ball, whose 7,000 guests paid up to
$11,000 to attend.
   The youths kept up a constant attack on the authorities, hurling
rocks, bottles and firebombs at about 2,200 police deployed to seal
the opera house off from all but ball guests.
   Police said today that 27 policemen, including one with a
fractured skull, and 22 demonstrators were injured. In addition,
three journalists required hospital treatment, police said.
   The violence started after protesters chanting ``Fascists!''
failed to break through metal barriers and police cordons sealing
off the Opera House in the city center.
   Police said at times the protesters beat drums to whip up
protesters.
   Those detained were still in custody today, but were expected to
be freed after formal charges are made, police said.

<TEXT>
   The military government today said it would
keep its ban on public assembly as long as anti-government
protesters continue their activities.
   ``There are elements who are bent to incite trouble at any given
opportunity,'' government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a news
conference. He said some people had shouted anti-government slogans
at the recent funeral of Yan Naing, a hero of Burma's 1940s struggle
for independence from Britain.
   Kyaw Sann announced the ban on public assembly would continue.
The spokesman also said political parties and other groups could be
prosecuted if they continue distributing pamphlets and videotapes in
violation of existing registration laws.
   Some opposition party leaders have complained of government
harassment.
   The military seized power on Sept. 18 and brutally put down
nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations, killing 500 people, by
government count. Diplomats estimated 1,000 people were killed.
   The new leaders have allowed the formation of more than 180
political parties and promised general elections but have not fixed
a date.
   Kyaw Sann said some political parties, insurgents and ``hostile
foreign organizations'' were probably behind the spread of rumors
that rebel commandos had infiltrated the Rangoon area and that
Soviet advisers were fighting with the Burmese army against the
Karens.
   The Karens are one of about a dozen ethnic minority groups
fighting the central government for greater autonomy.

   A part-time stagehand convicted of killing
another man with a karate kick to the neck was sentenced to up to
four years in prison despite an emotional plea for mercy.
   State Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller on Thursday criticized
Robert Wallace's actions as a ``purposeless, unprovoked attack on a
passive victim.''
   She sentenced him to one and one-third to four years in prison.
He will be eligible for parole in about 15 months.
   Wallace, 21, was convicted Dec. 17 of criminally negligent
homicide, the least serious homicide charge, for allegedly kicking
Daniel Klagsbrun, 24, in the neck during an angry exchange outside a
Manhattan bar.
   According to testimony, Wallace challenged Klagsbrun to a fight
the night of Jan. 24, 1988, after one of Klagsbrun's friends
insulted Wallace for wearing combat boots. When Klagsbrun refused to
fight, Wallace attacked.
   Relatives of both men wept in the packed courtroom as Wallace
asked for mercy and as the judge pronounced the sentence.
   Turning toward the Klagsbruns, Wallace said, ``This is hurting me
about as much as it's hurting them. ... I could say I'm sorry a
million times and it wouldn't change anything. It wouldn't bring
back Danny, but I think it has to be said.''
   After the sentencing, the victim's mother, Emilie Klagsbrun,
said, ``Daniel lost his life because of a brutal, senseless murder.
We love him and we all miss him deeply in our lives.''

<TEXT>
   Palestinian teen-agers from Arab east Jerusalem
are routinely held for weeks without bail on charges of throwing
stones or erecting roadblocks, an Israeli lawyer said today.
   In other cases, Palestinian children under 13, whom the law does
not consider legally responsible for their acts, are held for days
because their parents can't pay bail, said attorney Shlomo Lecker.
   Lecker said an 11-year-old and two 13-year-olds were detained for
five days each in a cell at Jerusalem police headquarters because
their parents could not come up with $415 bail.
   ``They are held eight to a cell, and it's dark,'' Lecker said,
adding that his young clients have complained of being slapped in
the face and kicked in the legs during interrogation.
   Dorit Beinish, a state attorney in the Justice Ministry, defended
the practice as legal.
   ``We have many cases of stone-throwing by minors. This is a new
crime, part of the uprising, and punishments are more severe,'' she
said in an interview.
   Ms. Beinish said she did not recall a case in which a youth was
held without bail and later acquitted.
   Ms. Beinish also said she did not know of Palestinians under 13
being held. ``If this happened, it was a mistake,'' she said.
   Police spokeswoman Nurit Buton said she would investigate
Lecker's allegations that children under 13 have been held.
   Asked about the charges of mistreatment during interrogation, she
said each complaint was investigated by a special police unit. ``We
have many complaints that have no basis at all, while in some cases
there may be something to it,'' she said.
   Nine left-wing Israeli legislators have written a letter to
Justice Minister Dan Meridor asking that the practice of holding
minors be stopped.
   ``Standards from the West Bank are coming to Israel,'' said Dedi
Zucker, a legislator from the Citizens Rights Movement. He spoke in
an interview Thursday.
   Lecker said the practice began a year ago after the Supreme Court
ruled that minors _ those between the ages of 14 and 18 _ can be
held without bail until the start of trial if they are charged with
throwing stones.
   On Thursday, Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old
Palestinian in clashes near the West Bank villages of Fahme and Kfar
Rai, the army said. Hospital officials identified the youth as Ahmed
Jamil Saabneh, and gave his age as 22.
   The death brought to 371 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have been killed.

   Prosecutors indicted a North Korean
agent today for her alleged role in the bombing of a South Korean
jetliner in 1987.
   Prosecutors said formal charges had been filed against Kim
Hyon-hui, 27, who confessed to bombing a Korean Airlines Boeing 707
that disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, near Burma with 115 people on board.
   Miss Kim has said she received direct orders from Kim Jong Il,
North Korean President Kim Il Sung's son and heir apparent, to plant
a time bomb on the KAL plane and commit suicide before she was
arrested.
   She said the purpose of her mission was to disrupt the Olympic
Games, which were held in Seoul in September and October.
   Miss Kim has been in the custody of South Korea's main
intelligence organization, the Agency for National Security
Planning, since she was extradited from Bahrain, where she was
arrested at the airport.
   Prosecutors said Miss Kim would face legal measures but not be
jailed. Although international aviation rules require South Korea to
put Miss Kim on trial, officials here want to spare her punishment
because she has shifted her allegiance and fully cooperated with the
government inquiry into the bombing.
   Miss Kim and a male companion, traveling on forged Japanese
passports, were among passengers on an early leg of the KAL flight
from Baghdad, Iraq to Seoul but disembarked before the jet
disappeared near Burma. They took poison when police tried to
question them at Bahrain Airport. The man died but Miss Kim survived.

   The No. 2 army commander seized power
today in a coup the official radio said ousted President Alfredo
Stroessner, the longest ruling leader in the Western Hemisphere.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the second-in-command of the army and a
close associate of Gen. Stroessner, said in a radio broadcast that
Paraguay's commander-in-chief for 34 years had surrendered.
   The announcement came after hours of gunfights and cannon fire in
the capital's streets Thursday night between rebel soldiers backed
by tanks and mortars and forces loyal to Stoessner.
   There was no official word on casualties, but residents who
ventured out this morning saw bloodstains on the pavement.
   The country's borders were closed.
   The police headquarters was pockmarked with bullets from small
arms fire, and metal shredded by the bullets hung from the modern
National Telephone building behind the police station.
   ``Order has been re-established, and with it all the human values
of our entire constitution will be respected,'' said Rodriguez, who
is father-in-law to Stroessner's youngest son, Alfredo.
   ``I communicate to you that Gen. Stroessner has surrendered and
finds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shown
all human rights, at a residence within the First Army Corps,'' he
said in the broadcast.
   Rodriguez said he was ``taking command of the country from this
moment.''
   Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that
Rodriguez for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He
refused.
   The rebellion also followed a dispute within the ruling Colorado
Party between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists
who wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the authoritarian
general.
   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the United States was
monitoring the situation. ``We don't like violence, of course, and
we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.''
   Stroessner, 76, has been the absolute ruler of this landlocked
South American country since 1954. He was army commander-in-chief,
doled out political favors and jobs to his allies and called anyone
who opposed him a Marxist subversive. He frequently exiled political
opponents.
   However, Stroessner, a staunch U.S. ally, has been in poor health
following prostate surgery five months ago.
   In an earlier radio communique, Rodriguez said he and his men
``left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of the
armed forces, for the full and total unification of the ruling
Colorado Party, for the initiation of democratization in Paraguay
(and) for the respect of human rights.''
   Early today, radio reports quoted an infantry division commander,
Brig. Gen. Ismael Otazu, as saying the uprising was not
``insubordination but a correction.'' Col. Dionisio Cabello told
March 1 radio he was the new air force commander and pledged
allegiance to Rodriguez.
   Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ Villarrica, San
Juan Bautista and Concepcion _ and an air force unit sided almost
immediately with the rebels, the reports indicated.
   Soldiers today blocked the street in front of the National Palace
near the central business district of this capital city of 900,000.
The palace did not look like it sustained damage, but residents saw
bloodstains on nearby streets.
   ``We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that people
had to die,'' said one woman, who added that the shelling and small
arms fire had forced her to spend Thursday night in a restaurant.
   Spokesman for the National Accord, a coalition of business,
church and political leaders who have called for democratic reforms,
said a transitional military junta may be named today to govern
until general elections are held. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Rodriguez, who did not mention a transitional junta or elections,
is identified with a faction within the Colorado Party that favors
limited democratic reforms.
   The uprising began late Thursday when the nation's largest
military unit, the First Army Corps, fired at the headquarters of
the police and presidential guard in shooting that lasted until dawn.
   Residents of Asuncion quickly deserted the streets when the
firefights involving cannon, recoilless rifles and heavy machine
guns broke out.
   Witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks rumble downtown.
   ``We're all keeping our heads down. We can hear mortar rounds
landing'' at the presidential escort battalion, a U.S. diplomat
said. The embassy is located between the battalion and Stroessner's
official residence.
   Domingo Laino, leader of the opposition Authentic Radical Liberal
Party, said: ``It has something to do with Rodriguez and (Sabino)
Montonaro,'' who is the interior minister and president of the
Colorado Party.
   Montonaro leads the militant faction, which took over party
leadership in August 1987 and since has purged its opponents from
positions of power.
   The military and the Colorado Party control nearly all facets of
life in the California-sized nation of nearly 4 million between
Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. Although closely allied with the
United States, Stroessner was criticized for human rights abuses by
the Reagan administration in 1986.
   Stroessner toppled President Federico Chavez in 1954.

   Two Air Force crewmen reported a faulty fuel
tank before they ejected from an FB-111 fighter-bomber that crashed
and exploded in northeastern Vermont on a training mission, a
congressman's aide said.
   The pilot, Capt. Randall F. Voorhees, 31, and the radar
navigator, Capt. Len J. Esterly Jr., 30, parachuted to safety
seconds before the plane hit the ground shortly before noon Thursday.
   The crew lost control of the aircraft after they noticed problems
with the fuel tank, Air Force officials told J.P. Dowd, an aide to
U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who was briefed on the accident.
   ``They radioed they were having problems, aborted the mission and
then ejected when they lost control of the plane,'' Dowd said.
   Air Force officials declined to comment on the cause of the
crash. Officials said a military board has been established to
investigate the crash.
   The pilot and navigator ejected together in a single capsule,
called a pod. The two landed safely, although a tree branch broke
through the pod on impact, bruising the pilot's knee.
   ``Everything turned out well,'' said David Eastman, 34, a former
Air Force sergeant who found the pilot and navigator a short
distance from his home. ``They walked away with just some bruises
and some hurt pride.''
   The plane, a medium-range fighter-bomber, was based at the U.S.
Air Force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., which is about 80 miles west of
the crash site.

<TEXT>
   South Korea and North Korea have held
secret negotiations recently on improving relations and discussed
the possibility of a meeting between their leaders, newspaper
reports said today.
   The reports come two days after the announcement of an
unprecedented trade agreement involving North Korea and the South
Korean conglomerate Hyndai. The Seoul government said today the
agreement may pave the way toward national unification after 44
years of bitter rivalry.
   Local newspapers quoted an unidentified government source as
saying the secret talks were held overseas and covered most major
issues between the countries.
   The most recent talks, the newspapers said, were in Singapore
last week between Park Chul-un, a special secretary to South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo, and an unidentified senior North Korean
official.
   During his stay in Singapore from Jan. 24 to Jan. 30, Park met
with his North Korean partner several times and discussed major
pending issues, including a proposed summit between the two Koreas,
the reports said.
   The newspapers quoted the government source as saying the summit
could take place by the end of this year.
   Last month, Roh renewed a proposal that he and North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung meet to discuss the future of the Korean
Peninsula, which has been divided into the communist North and
capitalist South since 1945.
   The reported secret talks coincided with the historic visit to
North Korea by a leading South Korean industrialist to discuss
direct investment and joint venture projects.
   Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the giant Hyundai
group, was in North Korea from Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 as a guest of the
government.
   He announced Thursday he had agreed with North Korean officials
to undertake several joint venture projects in that country,
including a shipyard, a railroad plant and development of a tourist
resort.
   Newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying
tours would be available later this year to the planned resort area,
a rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the
zone separating the Koreas.
   The Seoul government said it would propose special legislation to
facilitate the projects.
   In a statement today, the government said it ``in principle takes
a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as
possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve
national unification.''
   Chung was believed to be the first South Korean business leader
approved by both governments to visit the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang since the division of the peninsula.
   North Korea's participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to
revive its sagging economy. The North reportedly owes about $5
billion to East bloc and Western nations.
   Figures published today and attributed to the South Korean
government showed North Korea with a trade deficit of $720 million
in 1987. Exports were listed at $1.67 billion and imports at $2.39
billion.
   The agreement, in the form of a protocol, was signed by Chung and
Choe Su Gil, director of North Korea's Taesong Bank and consultant
to the state-run Korean Association of the Promotion of Asian Trade.
   Officials, requesting anonymity, also said the government had
ordered a special study of the security problems involved in trade
and personnel exchanges with the North.
   Under South Korean law, contact with North Korea is a violation
of national security. The two nations are technically still at war
since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the three-year Korean
War in 1953. Each claims to be the sole legitimate government of
Korea.

<HEAD>Cult Figure Of Hughes Aircraft Unmasked In Houston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fast track at Hughes Aircraft was too much
for Ed Greer, but life in the slow lane did not hold the appeal
fantasized by his former colleagues when the young executive left
without a trace in 1981.
   The man who had become a cult figure to corporate daydreamers was
tracked down by FBI agents last October in Houston, masquerading
under the name of Kenneth Roy Hearn and working quietly at a small
oil exploration firm.
   ``I hurt a lot of people _ my parents, my ex-wife and my kids,''
Greer, 40, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times this
week. ``I really regret doing this. If I had to do it over again, I
would do it differently.''
   He vanished on Sept. 10, 1981, leaving behind his engineering
job, his parents, his wife and two kids and taking a flight to Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. Before he left, he told a co-worker, ``Never become
too good at something you hate. They'll make you do it the rest of
your life.''
   After he left, his former colleagues, some of whom said they
wished they had the courage to do the same, began throwing annual
parties, often showing up at them wearing Ed Greer masks.
   No one from his past saw or heard from him again until FBI
agents, trying to learn why someone in Texas was using the name of
Kenneth Roy Hearn of Alabama, tracked him to his office at
Input-Output Inc. of Houston.
   Greer first lived in Florida for a time, fixing boat engines and
hanging out at the beach.
   ``There are a lot of pretty girls on the beach,'' he explained.
   But he eventually decided to go back to a regular job.
   ``After a while, I got tired of never having enough money and
never having an ID,'' he said. As for the pretty girls,
``Unfortunately, about the time you get to know them, they've gone
back to Muncie, (Ind.),'' Greer said.
   He got Hearn's name and Social Security number by placing a
newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered.
   He said the FBI agents who caught him lost interest in the case
after discovering he was not a drug dealer or money launderer.
   ``The federal charge that he was investigated on was possession
of a false Social Security card number,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Don De Gabrielle, who handled the case in Houston.
   Under an agreement with the government, Greer must stay out of
trouble for a year or face charges in the case. He also faces
$78,000 in back taxes.
   And he must face the past.
   ``Anyone with any attachment to the human race couldn't do what
he did,'' said his ex-wife, Kit Clark, who divorced him after he
disappeared. ``I will never forgive him for what he did to the
boys.''
   She said she told him he could contact his sons, now 9 and 16, if
he wanted, however.
   As for why he left, Greer said, ``I felt trapped. I really hated
management. ... I didn't like my life.''
   Greer plans to remain at his job in Houston.

<TEXT>
   Actor Todd Bridges, who played one of the
youngsters on the TV show ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was arrested for
investigation of attempted murder after shooting another man five
times, police said today.
   Bridges, 23, and another man, Harvey Duckett, were ordered held
without bail in jail after Thursday night's incident, said police
Sgt. Doug Tantee. Duckett, 30, was also held for investigation of
attempted murder.
   They were arrested in the shooting and stabbing of Kenneth Clay,
who was listed in critical but stable condition at Martin Luther
King Jr.-Drew Medical Center with five gunshot wounds and a knife
wound.
   ``Apparently, they knew each other, because when officers
arrived, Clay said, `Todd Bridges shot me,''' Tantee said.
   Bridges played star Gary Coleman's older brother, Willis Jackson,
from 1978 to 1985 on NBC's ``Diff'rent Strokes.'' They portrayed two
black youngsters raised by a wealthy white man played by Conrad Bain.
   Bridges has had several previous brushes with the law.
   In January 1987 he received a suspended sentence after pleading
no contest to charges of making a bomb threat. The charges stemmed
from the bombing of an auto customizer's car following a dispute
over work done on the actor's Porsche.
   In 1983, he paid a $240 fine after being arrested for allegedly
carrying a concealed firearm.
   Last November, he pleaded guilty to driving 80 mph in a 35 mph
zone in San Fernando, and received a $200 fine.
   Clay told police he confronted Bridges and Duckett inside a
vacant house that he was supposed to be watching, after a neighbor
alerted him that someone was there, Tantee said.
   An argument ensued and Bridges pulled out a gun and shot Clay
five times, while Duckett slashed Clay's face with a knife, Tantee
said.

   About three dozen pay-raise protesters gathered
at Union Station this morning to greet House Democrats as they
departed by train for a weekend legislative retreat at a luxurious
West Virginia resort.
   ``Money for the needy, not for the greedy,'' the group chanted.
However, the lawmakers arrived by bus under police guard and slipped
in through a side door of the station to avoid the protesters.
   Groups represented ranged from the conservative Students for
America to followers of Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless.
   ``Maybe we would be less inclined to be here if they were rushing
through a rise in the minimum wage'' or other measures to help
low-income Americans, Snyder said.
   The Democrats are spending the weekend at the Greenbrier, a
resort hotel in West Virginia. The annual retreat is subsidized by
corporate and union interests.
   The Senate voted 95-5 Thursday to reject the 51 percent pay raise
recommended by a presidential commission, placing the spotlight on a
House leadership plan to legalize the increase next week but scale
it back to 30 percent a day later.
   The Senate resolution included language to roll back the raise if
it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases,
along with those for top federal executives and judges, to become
law automatically unless rejected by both houses.
   Rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise from
$89,500 to $135,000 under the full raise. But the pay would be
$116,350 under House Speaker Jim Wright's plan.

   A 500-pound man unable to appear in court
because he was too obese and too ill was allowed to plead guilty by
telephone to assault and battery charges.
   David Streefkerk, 39, of Hazel Park made the call from his bed
Thursday to Oakland County Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz. In addition
to the severe obesity, Streefkerk has congestive heart failure,
advanced diabetes and lung disease, according to his doctors.
   He could face up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine at his Feb.
27 sentencing. Schnelz said he may grant a suspended sentence
because Streefkerk is penniless and terminally ill.
   Streefkerk initially was charged with felonious assault for
allegedly pointing a loaded gun at a man last June during an
argument, county Assistant Prosecutor Steven Meads said. The charge
was reduced to assault and battery.
   Robert Cleland, president of the Michigan Prosecuting Attorneys
Association, said he was unaware of any other case in which a guilty
plea was made by phone.

   The Chinese government has invited Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China, setting the stage for the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   The Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen proposed the visit in talks with his visiting
Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, who ``accepted the
invitation and expressed his gratitude.''
   Soviet Embassy spokesman Viatcheslav Duhin said Gorbachev's visit
could come as early as April. Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
will set the date when he meets with Shevardnadze on Saturday in
Shanghai, Duhin said.
   Shevardnadze left for Shanghai today after meeting for nearly two
hours with Premier Li Peng. The Soviet embassy said only that the
summit date and bilateral and international issues were discussed.
   Gorbachev would be the first Soviet leader to visit China since
Nikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959. A year later,
relations between the countries deteriorated over ideological and
strategic differences, and the Soviets halted technical and military
aid to China.
   Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit China in
30 years, arrived Wednesday for a three-day trip to work out final
details for the summit.
   Qian said during the talks that ``China and the Soviet Union
should establish a new type of state relationship with each other''
based on principles of equality and peaceful coexistence, according
to the Foreign Ministry.
   Qian ``stressed that China pursues an independent foreign policy
of peace and that the normalization of the relations between China
and the Soviet Union should not prejudice their respective relations
with other countries,'' the ministry statement said.
   China repeatedly has said it will never return to its
relationship of the 1950s when the Soviet Union was new Communist
state's political mentor and main economic benefactor.
   Beijing also has assured the United States and other Western
nations with which it enjoys increasingly important economic and
strategic ties that there is no possibility of a future Sino-Soviet
alliance.
   Earlier today, Shevardnadze canceled a tour of the Forbidden
Palace amid speculation he might meet Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who now resides in the Chinese capital.
   China long has insisted that Soviet financial backing for
Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia is the major obstacle to
normalizing Sino-Soviet relations.
   Qian, in a banquet speech Thursday night, said the two sides had
reached a consensus ``on many aspects of the problem,'' including
the need for Vietnam to pull out its troops and for some kind of
international supervision after Vietnamese troops leave.
   China is the main backer for the three-party resistance coalition
battling the Vietnamese in Cambodia. It supports the introduction of
an international peacekeeping force after Vietnam's departure, an
idea Vietnam has rejected.
   In his banquet speech, Shevardnadze called for joint ventures,
cooperation in science and technology and the transformation of the
Sino-Soviet border into a region of ``peace, friendship and
good-neighborly cooperation.''
   The two countries fought a short border war in 1969.
   Economic and cultural contacts gradually have increased in the
1980s, but normalization of political and party relations has been
stalled by the issues of Cambodia, the Soviet incursion into
Afghanistan and the highly militarized border.
   Relations have improved rapidly in the past year following Soviet
announcements it is withdrawing from Afghanistan and reducing its
troop strength in Asia, and with progress in efforts to end the
Cambodian conflict.

<HEAD>Iran To Resume Borrowing From Foreign Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has reversed its policy of refusing to
borrow from foreign banks as another step toward rebuilding an
economy devastated after eight years of war with Iraq.
   In an interview published in The New York Times today, Gholamreza
Agazadeh, Iran's minister of oil and mineral wealth, said Iran would
borrow for revenue-producing projects and that such borrowing would
not exceed $3 billion over the next five years.
   ``In my country a big debate has gone on,'' he said. ``Now we
have decided the No. 1 priority in this country is reconstruction of
the economy.''
   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had banned such loans when he
took power 10 years ago and established an Islamic government.
   Recent changes in government policy, including a decision to
reopen a natural gas pipeline to the Soviet Union announced in
December, reflected a decision to pursue a more pragmatic approach
to solving the country's woes, Agazadeh said.

<HEAD>Aborigines Angered at Findings into Blacks' Deaths in Custody</HEAD>

   Families of four aborigines who died in
police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths
that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal
charges.
   The report, issued Thursday, found no evidence of foul play in
the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided.
   Judge James Muirhead was ordered by the government of Prime
Minister Bob Hawke in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths
nationwide since 1980. Since the inquiry began, the number of deaths
has jumped to 107.
   Most of the offenders were arrested on minor charges such as
being drunk and disorderly.
   Alice Dixon, whose son, Kingsley, was found hanging in his cell
in Adelaide jail in 1987, wept when she heard the report.
   ``I expected some retribution. They're murdering our people, our
boys, and they're getting away with it,'' she said. ``My son is
dead, other sons are dead and other mothers are grieving and this is
the result we are going to get.''
   Leila Murray, whose 21-year-old son Eddie was found hanged in
1981, said: ``I've never believed police.'' She said the finding her
son took his own life ``shatters my faith in white justice.''
   Muirhead said police fabricated evidence and withheld evidence
during the inquiry's investigation of Murray's death.
   The judge concluded that proper custodial care and observance of
prison regulations could have prevented Dixon's death, and that the
death by heart attack of Charles Sidney Michael, 31, in 1984 might
have been avoided.
   Muirhead said the fourth death, that of John Clarence Highfold,
37, at Adelaide Jail in 1983 was from natural causes.
   Muirhead didn't say when another report on more deaths would be
released.
   The National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service, which helped
pressure the government to investigate, criticized the inquiry.
   ``There is no message in there that says to police, `Stop if you
are killing people or if you all allowing aboriginals to die,'''
said service director Peter Coe.
   Australia's indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, or about
1 percent of the 16 million population.

<HEAD>Protestants, Catholics Says Secret Talks Yielded No Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with new comments from political leaders.
CORRECTS name of Hume's party. No pickup.</HEAD>

   Protestant and Catholic politicians in Northern
Ireland confirmed today that party members met secretly in West
Germany but said they found no way to end the province's sectarian
violence.
   ``Sadly, there's no agreement, there's no new dawn, there's no
new era. We are not on the eve of a breakthrough,'' said Peter
Robinson, deputy leader of the hard-line Protestant Democratic
Unionist Party.
   His assessment differed from that of the British Broadcasting
Corp., which said the talks last year produced unanimous agreement
on power sharing at all levels of government, including the police,
in the British-ruled province.
   The BBC said the secret four-party talks could produce the most
important political breakthrough since sectarian violence in the
Protestant-dominated province flared in 1969. The BBC said Robinson
participated in the talks.
   Meetings have continued in Northern Ireland since October, it
said.
   The BBC said the West German talks included representatives of
Northern Ireland's two main Protestant parties, the largest Roman
Catholic party and the middle-of-the-road Alliance Party. It said
they took place Oct. 14-15 at the Angerhof Hotel between Duesseldorf
and Duisburg.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, was not included, the report said.
   The mostly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province with
the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic. About 2,700 people have been
killed in sectarian violence since 1969.
   Reacting to the BBC report, John Hume, who leads the moderate
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, said the BBC's version
of what had happened was ``wildly exaggerated'' and ``completely off
the wall.''
   Hume said in a BBC radio interview today that the political
leaders were invited to a meeting in West Germany to put forward
their views on Northern Ireland. He said there had been previous
similar meetings in West Germany and others in England that brought
together Protestant and Catholic politicians from Northern Ireland.
   ``But we did not exaggerate and say that suddenly there's a great
breakthrough because there has not been .... I am not aware the four
parties reached agreement.''
   James Molyneaux, leader of the Protestant Official Unionist
Party, said Thursday night it was ``crackers'' to suggest his or the
Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists had been involved in any
formal talks.
   He said the meeting in West Germany was merely the kind of
conference frequently attended by senior Protestant leaders. ``There
has never been any negotiation about the future government of
Northern Ireland,'' Molyneaux said.
   Gordon Mawhinney, deputy leader of the Alliance Party, which
draws support from both Catholics and Protestants, said a German
Lutheran churchmen organized the West German meeting for a different
purpose, which he did not specify, and the talks about political
differences took place ``somewhat by accident.''
   ``There was a regular line of communication opened between the
Northern Ireland political parties and ... great willingness to look
at the problems of the other community,'' he said.
   In addition to Mawhinney and Robinson, the BBC said, the other
two politicians who worked out the agreement in West Germany were
Jack Allen, chairman of the Official Unionists, the largest
Protestant party; and Austin Currie of Hume's party, the largest
Catholic political group.
   Catholic and Protestant party leaders who were not at the talks
divorced themselves from the report. The BBC said the talks were
supported by the government of Britain and the neighboring Irish
Republic.

<HEAD>Arizona House Passes Martin Luther King Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona House of Representatives has approved
a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state
Senate.
   The bill, which would designate the third Monday of each January
as ``Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day,'' passed the House in a
35-24 vote Thursday.
   Democrat Carolyn Walker, the chief Senate sponsor, said there may
be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.
   ``I have a, shall we say, gut feeling that this may be the
year,'' she said.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who supports the King holiday,
issued a statement congratulating the House.
   ``I now appeal to the Senate for similar, non-divisive passage of
the King legislation so that I may sign it and together we can move
Arizona forward,'' she said.
   Former Republican Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached last spring
for attempting to thwart a death-threat investigation and misusing
funds, drew fire in 1987 for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a
move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that
had planned to hold conventions in Arizona.

<HEAD>Bennett Says He Can Handle Job Without Being Cabinet Member</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Bennett interview this morning on Cabinet
status, delay in confirmation hearings, smoking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, President Bush's choice to
direct the federal war on drugs, said today he has ``the confidence
of the president'' and will be able to handle the job despite not
being a member of the Cabinet.
   In an interview this morning, Bennett said he appreciated the
concern of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr.
and others who have criticized Bush's decision to leave him out of
the Cabinet.
   On Thursday, Biden said, ``I'm worried that the president has
made a crucial mistake, maybe in part by oversight, by not having
the drug coordinator at the table.''
   The director of National Drug Control Policy ``has to do what
none of the others (in the Cabinet) has to do,'' said Biden. ``He
has to take them on, as a practical matter. He is entering the most
dangerous world in Washington, and that is the world of fiefdoms.''
   The director will be called upon to develop a strategy covering
more than 30 agencies spread throughout the federal government that
are under the more direct control of individual department
secretaries.
   ``I have the confidence of the president,'' said Bennett. ``I
know that. He said it. I heard it. He said it to my colleagues.''
   In a preliminary meeting of the top Cabinet-level appointments,
Bush told everyone that Bennett would be in charge of drug control
programs and said, ``You are to work with him,'' Bennett recalled.
   ``He has since reiterated that,'' he said. ``He's told me, `I
want you to be able to do it (the new job) in a way that's
unencumbered'.''
   Bennett said he's been assured by Bush that he will be invited to
Cabinet meetings when they pertain to the drug effort.
   Asked if he felt he wasted a lot of time attending Cabinet
meetings on subjects he didn't care about during his 3{ years as
education secretary under President Reagan, Bennett said only, ``I
went to three years of Cabinet meetings, and some were more
interesting than others.''
   Bennett, who met with Biden last week, planned to make courtesy
calls this afternoon with Sens. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, all members of the
Judiciary Committee that will begin hearings on his nomination
starting March 1.
   Biden said Thursday that he had wanted to start the hearings a
month earlier, but agreed to the later date at the administration's
request to give Bennett time to prepare.
   Once Bennett is confirmed, he ``must begin work immediately on
developing a plan that has never been developed in the history of
the United States of America, and that is a comprehensive drug
plan,'' which is due 180 days after the nominee is confirmed, said
Biden, D-Del.
   ``The clock is running the day I'm confirmed,'' Bennett said
today. ``Senator Biden and I discussed this and we decided to put
off the hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff, figure
out how the office is going to run.''
   He said his vow to quit smoking by the time he was confirmed was
not the reason for the delay in the hearings.
   ``I will be done by the time I take office,'' Bennett said.
``I've set a date for that, but I'm not going to preach until I've
succeeded.''
   Biden noted that the job of director of National Drug Control
Policy is bound to be extremely difficult. ``Dr. Bennett or whoever
will take that post will be a sitting duck. There is no way someone
can succeed in the first year,'' he said.
   The senator said he considered the administration's request for a
delay until March 1 ``reasonable.''
   ``We have created a completely new Cabinet post, and this is an
infrequent occurrence which requires time and great effort to
implement,'' he said. ``Dr. Bennett has no office, no place to
reside, physically, and he has no staff.''
   Bennett aide John Walters has said Bennett has other obligations
to take care of before he starts his new job. Those include some
speaking engagements and completion of a book on education.

<HEAD>Police Identify British Native as Spy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British-born woman who
escaped from black nationalist guerrillas in Angola had been a South
African police spy since 1981, police headquarters said today.
   Olivia Forsyth, 28, spent six months holed up in the British
Embassy in Luanda, Angola, last year after she escaped from African
National Congress guerrillas who had held her under guard for 22
months. She was allowed to leave Luanda in November, flew to London,
and then returned to South Africa.
   Until today, neither she nor South African police would comment
on the ANC's allegation that she was a spy who had infiltrated the
guerrilla movement. Her father, Peter Forsyth, had insisted she was
a journalist.
   The head of the police security branch, Maj. Gen. Basie Smit,
said in a statement that Miss Forsyth was a police lieutenant who
gathered ``valuable information'' after pretending to defect to the
ANC in 1986. Smit said she was tortured at an ANC camp in Angola.
   Smit also disclosed the identity of another police spy, Joy
Harnden, who infiltrated prominent anti-apartheid organizations in
South Africa such as the Black Sash civil rights group and the End
Consription Campaign.
   Both women ``performed a great duty for South Africa ... in
exceptionally dangerous circumstances,'' said Smit. He said details
of their assignments were being disclosed to counter a ``twisted
account'' that might come from the ANC.
   Police also issued a statement from Miss Forsyth, who holds
British and South African citizenship.
   In the statement, she asserted that the ANC was wracked by ethnic
conflict, disillusionment and alcoholism. She said the ANC's exiled
leadership did not want ANC leader Nelson Mandela released from
prison in South Africa because they felt he was more useful to them
as a martyr. She also said Mandela's wife, Winnie, was an
``embarassment'' to the ANC.
   The ANC was outlawed by the South African government in 1960 and
bagen a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961 aimed at undermining
the white-minority government.
   Miss Forsyth said she tried to convince the ANC that she was a
defector from the South African security forces and made a
pre-planned confession containing both factual and false information.
   While the ANC investigated her claims, she said, she was held
under ``diabolical'' conditions at the guerrilla movement's Quatro
rehabilitation camp in Angola. She later was taken to a house in
Luanda and escaped from it in May when her guards became drunk, she
said.
   Miss Forsyth said her first spying mission came in 1982, when she
was assigned by police to infiltrate anti-apartheid student
organizations at Rhodes University, in the eastern Cape Province
town of Grahamstown.
   A reporter for South Africa's Argus newspaper group interviewed
Miss Forsyth prior to the release of the police statement, and
quoted her account of being a campus spy.
   ``I had to adopt a radical left-wing lifestyle in every respect,
from dress, language and manners to living in left-wing communes,''
she was quoted as saying. ``My parents at this stage knew nothing of
my real role and they were extremely disappointed.''

<HEAD>Archdiocese to Close Three District High Schools Because of Low Enrollment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Catholic Archdiocese of Washington
has announced that it will permanently close three of its four city
high schools in June because of a decade-long decrease in enrollment
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The archdiocese announced Thursday that it will close Mackin
Catholic High School, a boys school, and All Saints and Holy Spirit,
two girls high schools.
   Only Archbishop John Carroll High School will open for classes in
the fall, drawing students from the other three schools and for the
first time admittng girls as students.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, Washington's archbishop, said the
archdiocese was not abandoning the nation's capital. ``Our
committment remains unshaken and enhanced,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, two independent Catholic girls high schools in the
area also have announced plans to close. They are the Academy of
Notre Dame, in Washington, and Regina High School in suburban
Hyattsville, Md.
   The closings follow a nationwide trend among Catholic schools
caused by the continuing exodus of middle-class black families from
the inner city to the suburbs.
   About 1,300 students will be affected by the closings.
   On Thursday, the students grappled with the news that their
schools were closing.
   ``We're Mackin men and that means something,'' said Aaron Young
III, Mackin student body president. ``It is unfair for the cardinal
to just close us down. He never even asked our opinion.''

<HEAD>County Declines Offer of Abandoned, Unheated Tower as Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HALL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has offered to lease
an abandoned 80-foot observation tower to house homeless people in a
rural county, but perplexed local officials say they don't need it.
   ``If we had any homeless, we certainly wouldn't take them down
there and put them in an 80-foot tower, not if we had their best
interests at heart,'' he said Kent County commission president
Alexander P. Rasin III.
   ``Why would you want to stick them in the middle of the
boonies?'' he asked.
   The 1940s-era steel tower is a former observation platform that
was used by the U.S. Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground north of
Baltimore to monitor shelling across the Chesapeake Bay.
   Access to the top is up a formidable number of rickety wooden
stairs. It lacks heat, electricity or running water, and is located
along the waterfront in a hard-to-find corner of the rural county.
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services recently
notified Kent County officials that they could lease the abandoned
tower to house the homeless if they were interested.
   They weren't.
   On Thursday, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development in Washington said the notice to the county may
have been an error.
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about things like this,'' HUD
spokesman William A. Glavin said. ``Either properties are too remote
or they somehow wouldn't work.''

<TEXT>
   About 200 people fought police with
firebombs in Kwangju today during a demonstration demanding an
thorough investigation into the government's suppression of a 1980
uprising in the southern city.
   A police officer was beaten by protesters and taken to a
hospital, but his condition was not immediately known, the Yonhap
News Agency reported.
   The protesters were among about 1,000 people who marched through
downtown after an outdoor rally denouncing the government of
President Roh Tae-woo and the United States, the news agency said.
   About 200 people, mostly students, dashed from the crowd hurling
rocks and dozens of firebombs when about 800 police halted the march
50 yards from the U.S. cultural center, Yonhap reported.
   It said the marchers dispersed voluntarily a short time later.
   The authoritarian government killed about 200 people when it put
down an uprising in Kwangju in 1980. The protesters accused the Roh
government of blocking efforts to investigate the suppression of the
revolt.
   Opposition and dissident figures say some military leaders
instigated the uprising as part of a plot to seize power in the
chaotic days that followed the death of then-President Park
Chung-hee in late 1979.
   They say the United States acquiesced in a military plan to
suppress the revolt ruthlessly and therefore is partly to blame for
the deaths.
   The United States has denied the charges and said it will
cooperate with a parliamentary committee investigating the revolt.
   Parliamentary officials said today that next week they will send
a questionnaire to two Americans, William Gleysteen and John
Wickham, and ask them to clarify any U.S. role in the case.
   Gleysteen was the U.S. ambassador and Wickham served as the top
U.S. military commander at the time of the uprising.

   The Supreme Court today upheld the
convictions of the publisher and editor of a tabloid that published
conversations obtained from an illegal wiretap of The New York
Times' Athens bureau telephone.
   Greece's highest court also ordered a reduction in the two-month
prison sentences given publisher George Bobolas and editor
Alexandros Filippopoulos of the left-wing daily Ethnos.
   A lower court will revise the sentences, which could be changed
to fines. A hearing date has not been set.
   Bobolas and Filippopoulos were sentenced in October 1987 for
publishing transcripts of the telephone conversations.
   Ethnos alleged the conversations proved Paul Anastasi, a
Greek-Cypriot journalist working for The New York Times and London's
Daily Telegraph, planned to bomb Ethnos, kill its employees and
destabilize democracy in Greece.
   Today's ruling was the latest in a series of court battles
between Ethnos and Anastasi.
   In 1983, Anastasi wrote a book that alleged Ethnos received
financial assistance from the KGB, the Soviet secret police and
intelligence agency, to begin publication in 1981.
   Anastasi was found guilty of libel in 1985 and sentenced to a
year in prison for his allegation, but the Supreme Court overturned
the conviction.
   He later filed a lawsuit charging Bobolas, Filippopoulos and
three other Ethnos editors with perjury and defamation. The suit is
pending.

   Freezing drizzle ushered the Big Chill of '89 deeper into the
nation's midsection and toward the East Coast today, turning
highways into glaring stretches of ice and draping trees and power
lines in a hardened coat.
   The frigid air mass that spilled into the lower 48 states from
Alaska earlier in the week brought more snow today to the
weather-weary Pacific Northwest and northern states, threatening
crops and endangering newborn livestock.
   Many cities stepped up aid to the homeless. At Paducah, Texas,
hundreds of people were left without heat when a 4-inch natural gas
pipeline ruptured. Temperatures were in the single digits at Paducah
and residents were told to move to electrically heated buildings.
   The cold spell has closed schools, disrupted travel, and caused
power outages at a time when electricity is in high demand.
Wind-chill readings between 60 and 80 degrees below zero were common
across much of Montana and the Dakotas.
   Stretching across a roughly triangular area from the Pacific
Northwest to Texas to New England, the air mass is pushing
southward, but at a slower pace than earlier in the week, said Brian
Smith of the National Weather Service.
   ``It's moving quite a bit slower now. We're not getting the
really rapid changes in temperatures that we were,'' Smith said
today.
   Overnight lows today were below zero all the way south to the
middle Mississippi Valley, with readings between 20 below zero and
38 below zero over the Dakotas, Wyoming, much of Montana, Minnesota
and northwestern Nebraska, the weather service said. Austin, Texas,
fell from a high Thursday of 69 to a low today of 28, and a freeze
warning was posted tonight for the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Record lows were scattered from Oregon to Iowa, including 33
below zero at Great Falls, Mont.
   The below-normal temperatures are expected to linger until the
middle of next week.
   Schools in Montana, Nebraska, Washington state, Kansas, New York,
Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas and elsewhere told students to stay home
today because of the snow and cold.
   ``There's no sense messing with this stuff,'' said Oswego, Kan.,
school Superintendent Ed Sink, who closed his schools.
   Montana state government employees returned to work today after
being sent home because of the weather at midday Thursday by Gov.
Stan Stephens. The capital, Helena, also had to cope with a train
explosion that forced the daylong evacuation of thousands of people
and left some without power with 38 below zero temperatures.
   The cold chased out what had been an unusually warm January in
many parts of the country. Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66
degrees Wednesday. Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31
degrees and freezing rain.
   At the same time as northern states experienced staggering lows
on Thursday, the southeast corner of the nation was hitting record
highs. Nearly 30 records were set, including 80 degrees in
Charlotte, N.C.; Norfolk, Va., 80; and Wilmington, N.C., 80.
   Two school buses collided on an icy school parking lot today in
Indianapolis and 16 students suffered minor injuries, authorities
said.
   At least seven traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather,
which slickened highways in a band of freezing rain from Texas to
Vermont. In Edmonds, Wash., a utility worker died Thursday when he
fell while trying to repair a downed power line.
   Two men died of exposure, one in Martin, S.D., and the other in
Great Falls, Mont. And in Washington state, four sledding deaths
were reported.
   But a life was saved in North Dakota when searchers Thursday
found a 16-year-old boy who got stranded three days before while
driving to his family's farm. Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland had
only a stocking cap, light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats to keep
him warm.
   ``He's quite a courageous young man,'' said Dr. William Norberg
at St. Luke's Hospital in Fargo, where Stebleton was taken with
frostbitten feet and hands. Overnight temperatures in the area had
plunged to 30 degrees below zero.
   The Alaskan air mass also delivered a rare snowfall to parts of
northern California.
   ``There was snow right down to the beach in Trinidad Harbor,''
Yvonne Lewis, deputy city clerk at the tiny fishing town 300 miles
north of San Francisco, said late Thursday. ``It was nice; the kids
loved it.''
   Farmers in Washington state worried that the cold would damage
their fruit trees. Some growers in the Yakima Valley activated wind
machines in orchards, said extension agent Mike Willett. The
machines are designed to draw warmer air from 50 to 100 feet above
the ground down into orchards, he said.
   Montana ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves that
died from exposure within hours.
   One rancher, Dr. George Ingham, said he lost two calves.
   ``We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big
100-pounder was dead,'' Ingham said. ``It's the wind chill out on
this prairie.''
   Sheep ranchers in Oregon were worried about newborn lambs.
   ``You've got to stay right on them or they'll freeze as soon as
they hit the ground,'' said rancher Curtis McBeth.

<HEAD>Heavy Water Which Helped India Develop Atomic Bomb Made at SRP</HEAD>

   India used heavy water purchased from the
Savannah River Plant in its nuclear weapons program despite
assurances it wouldn't do so, a nuclear expert said.
   India exploded a nuclear weapon in 1974. Soon after, the United
States and Canada, which had supplied both nuclear technology and
heavy water to India, cut off shipments. India then turned to the
Soviet Union for its heavy water.
   The Savannah River Plant, in nearby Aiken, S.C., at one time sold
heavy water to 21 countries, including eight with nuclear weapons
programs.
   Those countries were Argentina, Brazil, England, France, India,
Israel, Pakistan and South Africa, according to records cited by The
Augusta Chronicle and the Augusta Herald.
   England, France and India have exploded nuclear weapons; Israel,
South Africa and Pakistan either have or are capable of producing
such weapons; and Argentina and Brazil are close, said Leonard
Spector, senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
   India received 36 tons of heavy water in seven sales made in
1954, 1959 and 1960. It returned 15 tons of the water, records show.
   The heavy water ``was sold to a facility that was not under
inspection, but India promised it was not being used to produce
nuclear weapons,'' Spector said. ``It looked like a clear
violation.''
   Spector said most of the heavy water used by India in producing
its bomb was from other countries, ``but American heavy water had
been involved.''
   Heavy water is used as a moderator or primary coolant in some
nuclear reactors, including those at SRP.
   The Atomic Energy Act and its amendments allowed the Department
of Energy sell heavy water to foreign countries as part of a program
to expand the peaceful use of nuclear power as an alternative energy
source.
   Chris Sankey, a DOE spokesman, said the department made the sales
with the guidance of the administrations and the State Department.
   A state department spokesman said Thursday the department could
not comment but would review the report.
   A spokesman for the Indian embassy in Washington, who declined to
give his name, contended today that the 1974 explosion was not a
nuclear weapon. ``It was an underground explosion, called a ...
peaceful nuclear explosion,'' he said. ``It was not weapon-oriented;
it was scientific research ... for harnessing atomic energy.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, playing host to its
first big international gathering, got a skeptical reception today
from allied finance ministers over the ability of the president's
``flexible freeze'' plan to reduce the federal budget deficit,
participants said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was holding two days of
closed-door discussions with his foreign counterparts. The sessions
began late Thursday and continued through dinner.
   Finance ministers and central bank presidents from Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy rushed from their
limousines into the Treasury Department building today without
speaking to reporters kept across the street by police.
   But French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters at a
breakfast meeting that Brady had given the group assurances that the
administration was committed to reducing the budget deficit and
would meet the $100 billion deficit limit for the upcoming fiscal
year required by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The deficit for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, is expected to
top $160 billion.
   Beregovoy said Brady stressed that the administration saw the
reduction of the deficit as a ``very important'' commitment.
   However, a senior Canadian official said the other finance
ministers displayed much skepticism about the chances of success of
President Bush's ``flexible freeze,'' his campaign proposal to bring
down the deficit without new taxes by simply holding overall
spending growth to the level of inflation.
   The Canadian official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said other finance ministers expressed doubt to the
Americans that the proposal could work because it was based on
extremely optimistic economic assumptions, involving steep declines
in interest rates.
   The official said there was also discussion at Thursday's dinner
meeting by the so-called Group of Seven over the problem of Third
World debt and the need for West Germany and Japan to do more to
reduce their huge trade surpluses.
   Beregevoy said France hoped the United States and the other
countries would be willing to set up new machinery to guarantee
interest paymnents on the debt, using money supplied by the
International Monetary Fund.
   But he said he was willing to listen to other suggestions. While
officials agree that there is a pressing need to do something to
relieve the growing debt burden of developing countries, no final
decision is expected to come out of this meeting.
   The countries are expected to carry on talks at a lower level,
hoping to come up with concrete proposals to consider at the March
31-April 4 meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank.
   The Washington talks, coming only two weeks after Bush's
inauguration, mark the first time America's major trading partners
are getting a chance to discuss international policy issues with the
new administration.
   The talks were coming during a period of relative calm for global
currency markets, but investors were still watching with keen
interest, hoping to learn more about the new administration's views
on international economic matters.
   Brady was criticized last November for botching an effort to calm
financial markets concerned about a steep drop in the value of the
dollar. During a television interview, he said: ``Markets go up and
down. ... I don't really worry about (the dollar's decline) very
much.''
   The dollar plunged further following Brady's comments.
   The greenback has since stabilized, however, as the
administration has repeatedly declared that it is serious about
attacking the huge federal budget deficits.
   There has been growing pressure from other countries to move away
from the approach to Third World debt first advanced by
then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III. It proposed new loans
but no reduction of debt burdens for 15 of the largest debtor
countries.
   Many industrial countries and debtor nations believe the time has
come to grant debt relief. In his inaugural speech Thursday,
Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez, called for a summit
meeting between debtor nations and the industrial countries to
search for a way of ``breaking the vicious circle of debt and
stagnation.''
   Perez said the world needs to abandon the case-by-case approach
that is supported by the United States, saying this has not been in
the best interests of Latin American debtors.
   ``Each country found itself alone facing a formidable cartel of
creditors whose schemes and interests prevailed,'' Perez said.
   Bush has promised a new look at the debt problem but has revealed
no specifics about what the new administration might favor.
   Representatives of Latin American governments who are the biggest
debtors were meeting today in Caracas, Venezuela. They were expected
to propose a new international body to buy up some of the debt at
discounts from the face note on the loans.

   Actor Griffin O'Neal was released from jail
today after serving 15 days for violating terms of probation he
received for his involvement in the 1986 boating death of a friend.
   Appearing tired and unshaven, he left the Anne Arundel County
Detention Center accompanied by his lawyer, T. Joseph Touhey.
   O'Neal, the 24-year-old son of actor Ryan O'Neal, said he made a
few friends and ``actually was pretty well liked'' during his time
in jail.
   ``I'm going home now,'' he said when asked about his immediate
plans, adding he wanted to ``hold on to my animals and my
girlfriend.''
   O'Neal was given an 18-day jail sentence for not performing 400
hours of community service ordered by the judge who found him guilty
of reckless boating in the accident that killed Gian-Carlo Coppola,
the son of film director Francis Ford Coppola.
   Sebastian Valenti, deputy superintendent of the Anne Arundel
County Detention Center, said O'Neal was released three days early
because he earned time off for good conduct.
   O'Neal has completed several other terms of the probation given
him Feb. 27, 1987, including making a boating safety video, paying a
fine and answering questions on a boating telephone hotline.

   The Soviet Union allowed 2,616 Jews to emigrate in
January, a decline from December but still well above last year's
monthly average, the agency that helps resettle them said today.
   Only 108, or 4.1 percent, of the January emigres chose to make
Israel their new home, said Regina Boucault, spokeswoman for the
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, based in Geneva.
   The comittee said it only keeps count of the Jews it helps
resettle in Israel but that most apparently go to the United States.
   The monthly emigration figure reached an eight-year high in
December at 3,510. In all, 20,082 Jews were allowed to leave the
Soviet Union last year.
   The largest annual figure, 51,328, was recorded in 1979, before
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.

<TEXT>
   Church of England leaders have rejected a plan to
give black Anglicans more seats on the main policy-making body of
the church.
   After a two-hour debate, lay members of the Anglican state church
on Thursday blocked the proposal by a 96-80 vote, despite favorable
votes of 17-3 by bishops and 103-62 by clergy. The plan needed a
majority of each group to pass, as well as approval by the British
Parliament.
   Barbados-born Bishop of Croydon Wilfred Wood, the first black
bishop of the state church to serve in England, left Church House in
Westminster immediately after the vote. He looked upset and declined
comment.
   Although Wood's Committee for Black Anglican Concerns proposed
the plan, he and the seven other black members of the General Synod
did not speak during the body's debate.
   The proposal would have set aside a minimum of 24 seats for
blacks on the 574-member, policy-making synod in 1990. Proponents
said the arrangement would better reflect the estimated 2 million
blacks among England's 49 million people. Wales and Scotland have
separate churches.
   During the debate, senior synod member Oswald Clark said legal
advice had shown Parliament would reject the plan as ``inexpedient.''
   Businessman Timothy Royle said Parliament had never reserved
seats for any particular party or race. ``We won't make restitution
for our past to those who come from abroad, particularly from the
former colonies, by giving one group a special role,'' he said.
   Archbishop of York John Habgood urged the synod to approve the
plan and negotiate with the government on what it would accept.
   ``One generation of black people has already been lost and unless
we do something now, we shall lose the next generation and the
generation after that,'' Habgood said.
   Several speakers said they saw the plan as offensive to black
people because it implied they were incapable of helping themselves.

next year.
   Kirk, who turned down a chance for another four years as
committee chairman, would be seeking the post of Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, last year's Democratic nominee for president, who has said
he will not seek re-election.
   The Boston Globe reported today it was told by unidentified

that members of the business community in Massachusetts approached
him about runnning.
   The newspaper said it was unable to reach Kirk for comment.
   The Wall Street Journal also reported today that Kirk was
considering the race.
   Kirk, 51, a lawyer, is from Massachusetts and is moving back to
Boston when he leaves Washington.
   Kirk once served as chief of staff to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and ran his 1980 presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner relied on a canny blend of military
force, political patronage, and self-discipline to maintain control
over Paraguay for 34 years _ longer than any leader in the Western
Hemisphere.
   But a rebellion by army Gen. Andres Rodriguez, Stroessner's
second-in-command, today ended the dictatorship that began when
Stroessner seized power in a 1954 military coup.
   Stroessner, 76, won eight presidential elections despite
opposition charges the balloting was rigged. Even his critics admit
he helped stabilize a nation that before him had endured 22
presidents in 31 years.
   But at the same time, he was accused of brutal repression and
corruption, and his country became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug
traffickers and former dictators. The list of refugees included
Josef Mengele, the Auschwitz death camp doctor, and Gen. Anastasio
Somoza Debayle, the ousted Nicaraguan dictator.
   The red-haired Stroessner, son of a Bavarian immigrant father and
Paraguayan mother of Spanish heritage, oversaw the country's
transformation from a neglected backwater, with open sewers and no
running water, to a relatively prosperous and modern nation.
   Scores of schools and buildings, in addition to Asuncion's
international airport, were named for the man who began his military
career at age 20 and quickly distinguished himself on the battle
field.
   In a central plaza in the capital, a huge neon sign blinked
incessantly with the slogan, ``Stroessner: Peace, Work and
Well-being.'' An important city is named Puerto Stroessner.
   In his innumberable speeches, which sometimes lasted hours, he
liked to list in detail the public works projects achieved by his
regime.
   Among the most important works was the $16 billion Itaipu dam,
the world's largest hydroelectrical project, built in partnership
with neighboring Brazil. It began producing power in early 1985.
   He attended hundreds of ground-breakings and other public
ceremonies each year, even in outlying towns, and served regularly
as a witness at weddings _ even when he didn't know the bride or
groom.
   Stroessner credited his longevity and energy to Spartan habits _
he did not smoke and drank little _ and a busy work schedule.
   Public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly
evident in the mid-1980s, when protesters and police clashed in
street demonstrations.
   The nation's Roman Catholic Church and even a faction of
Stroessner's Colorado Party began criticizing the president,
accusing him of unjust repression and demanding democratic reforms.
   Human rights groups said many of Stroessner's foes were tortured
and killed during his early years in power. Others were simply
jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or forced into
exile.
   A rabid anti-communist and staunch U.S. ally, Stroessner was
stung by the Reagan administration's labeling him as a dictatorship,
and relations between the countries declined.
   Stroessner attended the nation's military academy, graduating in
1929, and as a 20-year-old lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the
Chaco War against Bolivia. He distinguished himself for bravery in
the war, which lasted from 1932 to 1935, and rose quickly through
the ranks, being promoted to general at age 40. He became army chief
of staff in 1951.
   After taking power, Stroessner put down five attempted coups by
exiled politicians from 1954 to 1958 and began dismantling the
opposition.
   Employing special powers under a state of siege, renewed each 90
days until last year, civilian and military police arrested
thousands of opponents.
   Stroessner branded virtually all his opponents as subversives.
   Critics charge his government promoted a growing private sector
dominated by contraband. Many government and military officials,
including relatives and close assocites, became enriched through
their ties with Stroessner.
   Stroessner reportedly has been ill since a prostate operation
five months ago. His apparent slow recovery increased the demands by
opposition leaders that the army and Colorado Party consider a
transition to democratic rule.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today awarded $1 million in
attorneys fees to a Contra leader, a former CIA official and others
who had been accused in a civil lawsuit of mounting a guns-for-drugs
scheme to aid the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in June threw out
the $24 million lawsuit filed by the Christic Institute on behalf of
journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey. The judge said the
plaintiffs failed to prove their case, and defense attorneys
immediately filed a motion seeking to recover damages caused by the
lawsuit.
   Today the judge ruled again in their favor, saying the Christic
Institute and the plaintiffs would have to pay the defendants
$955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in court costs.
   The judge said the lawsuit was ``based on unsubstantiated rumor
and speculation from unidentified sources with no first-hand
knowledge.''
   Among the defendants the plaintiffs accused of mounting the
extensive illegal operation were Contra director Adolfo Calero,
former CIA deputy director of operations Theodore Shackley,
Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, and former Maj.
Gen. John K. Singlaub.
   Singlaub's attorney Thomas Spencer said he was elated by the
decision.
   The liberal, Washington-based Christic Institute, which has
appealed King's original decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, had no immediate reaction to today's ruling.
   Avirgan and Honey filed the lawsuit in May 1986, prior to many of
the revelations in the Iran-Contra affair.
   It grew from a 1984 bombing in Nicaragua apparently aimed at
maverick Contra leader Eden Pastora. Pastora escaped, but Avirgan
was injured and several other people were killed.
   The lawsuit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing, as
well as working with drug traffickers in a 30-year conspiracy that
covered activities in Southeast Asia, Central America and other
locations.

<TEXT>
   A huge column of Soviet tanks and
trucks rumbled out of Kabul early today, and Soviet and Afghan
sources said the departure left only about 1,500 Red Army soldiers
in the country.
   The convoy rolled out of the marshaling yard at the base of the
Salang Highway under cover of darkness and began the 260-mile
journey north to the Soviet border in a heavy snowstorm.
   Afghan soldiers manned the Soviet outposts along the highway and
Soviet flags were replaced with the red, green and black flags of
Afghanistan.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas, called mujahedeen, have pounded
departing Soviet convoys with artillery fire in recent days.
   The Afghan and Soviet sources said that no more than 1,500 Red
Army soldiers would remain in the country once the convoy reached
Soviet soil.
   They said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers were in
the convoy, which took three hours to move out. Early this week,
Western and Soviet diplomats said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers were
still in the country.
   The Afghan and Soviet sources said the small contingent that
remained in Kabul today will guard the city's airport during an
airlift that will continue for at least a week.
   The Soviet Union, which once had about 100,000 troops in
Afghanistan is to complete its withdrawal by Feb. 15 under the terms
of a U.N.-brokered accord signed last year.
   On Thursday, President Najib said his army was ``mightier than
ever'' and ready for battle with the guerrillas, who predict an easy
time overthrowing the government once the Soviet pullout is
completed.
   The Afghan army ``can defend the country against any onslaught,
and we will prove it,'' Najib said at a two-hour news conference at
the Foreign Ministry, in a room unheated because of the fuel
shortage in the capital.
   As he spoke, another Soviet convoy of about 100 trucks, armored
vehicles and tanks headed for the Salang Highway.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, border headquarters of a seven-party
insurgent alliance, a guerrilla leader predicted Najib's regime
``will fall in weeks, not months.'' Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the
guerrilla group Hezb-i-Islami, said at a news conference that the
insurgents would not have to attack the cities.
   Speaking of a possible political settlement with the rebels,
Najib said his Communist Party must be part of any future
government. ``Any attempt to exclude'' the party ``and its allies
from a coalition goverment will be in vain,'' he said.
   The guerrillas have rejected offers of settlements based on that
assumption and say they are forming a council to choose an Islamic
government.
   Explosions and artillery fire could be heard in and around the
capital Thursday, where insurgent attacks have created severe food
and fuel shortages.
   Mountain guerrilla camps surround Kabul, and insurgent commander
Ahmed Shah Masoud controls the Panjshir Valley, through which the
Salang runs.
   Pakistan and Iran, the neighboring nations in which more than 5
million Afghan refugees live, urged the squabbling guerrilla
factions Thursday to patch up their differences and form a
broad-based government in Kabul as soon as the Soviets are gone.
   Najib, asked whether he would be willing to resign as part of a
settlement, said: ``The resignation of a person will not help to
solve any problem.''
   He expressed optimism that Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet
foreign minister, would work out a settlement at a meeting with
Pakistani leaders Saturday, but added that Pakistan must change its
position.
   ``Pakistan has not only refused to adhere to its commitment under
the Geneva agreements, but it has quantitatively and qualitatively
intensified and expanded its armed interferences and aggressions,''
he said.
   Najib's assurances about the ability of his conscript army,
estimated to number about 140,000, contrasted with uncertainty on
the part of others.
   Several governments, including the United States, are closing
their embassies and evacuating the staffs because of concern about
what will happen when the Soviets are gone. Bangladesh joined the
growing list Thursday.

<HEAD>Government Can Fine Up To $20,000 For Tampering With Railroad Safety
Devices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government can fine railroads or
individuals up to $20,000 for tampering with locomotive safety
devices under new rules issued by the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   Investigators found that the intentional disabling of a safety
warning device contributed to the collision of an Amtrak passenger
train and a Conrail locomotive, killing 16 people at Chase, Md., two
years ago.
   Since then, government inspectors have found more than 70
locomotives with warning whistles, automatic stopping devices and
other safety systems intentionally diconnected.
   Many of the 25,000 locomotives operated by the nation's railroads
are equipped with one or more of the devices designed to either
record data on the engine's operation or to make it safer, the
administration said in issuing the final rules Thursday.
   The devices range from audible alerts on changing conditions
along the rails, such as speed limits, to devices that stop or slow
the train if the engineer fails to respond.
   Under the new rules, fines include $2,500 for knowingly operating
or permitting the operation of a locomotive with disabled equipment
and $7,500 for tampering with the equipment.
   The administration also has the right to increase the fines to as
high as $20,000 per violation when it finds gross negligence or a
pattern of violations which cause death or injury or create an
``imminent hazard.''
   The Amtrak-Conrail crash on Jan. 4, 1987, was blamed on gross and
willful negligence by the Conrail crew. Conrail engineer Ricky Lynn
Gates pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a five-year
prison term. He admitted the crew had used marijuana before the
accident and violated a number of safety procedures.
   Conrail last July agreed to pay $58 million to survivors of those
killed and Amtrak agreed in August to pay $8.2 million. The
railroads also agreed to create a $9 million fund to pay 330
passengers who filed claims for injuries or distress suffered in the
collision.

   Britain's Princess Diana toured an AIDS pediatric
ward at a Harlem hospital today, asking questions about the
dimensions of the problem and winning praise for her interest and
involvement.
   Hundreds of excited Harlem Hospital workers craned their necks
for a glimpse of the 27-year-old princess. There were cheers,
applause and shouts of ``Welcome to America.''
   Diana, dressed in a double-breasted red suit and white silk
blouse, shook hands with some in the crowd and then used the stairs
to get to the second floor of Harlem Hospital because the elevator
bank was blocked by well-wishers.
   The princess, described on Thursday night as tired and perhaps a
little homesick, planned to head home to England today.
   Before touring the children's AIDS ward, Diana attended a
10-minute briefing given by Dr. Margaret Heagarty, director of
pediatrics, Dr. Elaine Abrams, head of the pediatrics AIDS unit and
Martha Grates, nursing director.
   During the session, the princess listened as Heagarty spoke about
how 1,300 children have been infected with AIDS nationwide to date.
Harlem Hospital is treating about 100 children with the deadly
disease.
   Diana occasionally interrupted asking questions about whether the
situation would get worse, the outlook for the next five years and
``when you have the problem of drugs, how do you deal with AIDS as
well?''
   Diana Thursday night went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for
the American debut of the Welsh National Opera, after which she
returned to Manhattan and dazzled guests at a gala dinner in her
honor at the World Financial Center.
   Earlier, she visited a family's apartment at a Lower East Side
shelter for the homeless and browsed at the giant FAO Schwarz toy
store.
   ``I dreamed about this last night,'' said Wanda Morales, who
shook Diana's hand. ``It was better (than the dream). It was really
better. We can hold our head up high and say, `Princess Diana came
to the Lower East Side.'''
   Cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess.
The lone note of dissent was heard outside the opera performance,
where more than 400 protesters chanted ``IRA, IRA'' and waved signs
denouncing the princess.
   Charles J. Hynes, a potential mayoral candidate who is active in
Irish-American affairs, said the protest ``is not directed against
Princess Diana, it's directed against her as a symbol of British
government, which for much too long has inhabited Northern Ireland.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and developer Donald Trump were heckled as
they entered the elegant concert hall, located in a run-down
Brooklyn neighborhood.
   But all was calm and serene inside, where the princess watched a
performance of Giuseppe Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' which tells the story
of Sir John Falstaff, Shakespeare's knight of the paunch.
   ``She was very proud of the company,'' said Brooklyn Academy of
Music president Harvey Lichtenstein, who sat next to the princess
during the opera and at the dinner that followed. As Princess of
Wales, she is the patron of the company.
   Diana sat in a balcony box festooned with garlands of purple and
red satin. As she entered, the orchestra sounded a drum roll and
played, ``God Save the Queen,'' the ``Star Spangled Banner'' and
``Land of My Fathers,'' the Welsh national anthem.
   From the stage, Koch told her: ``I want to bid you welcome. The
city is graced by your presence. We want to be sure your visit goes
just the way you want it to be so that when you go home you can say
you had a royal New York welcome.''
   Although tickets for the performance of ``Falstaff'' and the
dinner afterward went for $1,000, opera-lovers and fans of the
princess who were on a tighter budget could attend the show alone
for as little as $40.
   ``I wanted to see the princess. I bought my ticket two days
ago,'' said Margaret Skinner, a secretary who lives in Brooklyn.
``She has a very nice quiet air about her, not ostentatious, very
royal.''
   After the three-hour-plus opera, the princess returned to
Manhattan by limousine to the gala dinner in the World Financial
Center's Winter Garden, where guests were seated at candlelit tables
covered in deep red linen cloths.
   Potted palms rose majestically into the towering canopied space,
which Diana entered by sweeping down a sparkling marble staircase,
dressed in a white evening gown with beaded bolero.
   The guests were impressed, but Lichtenstein, who sat at the head
table with the princess, said the strain of her solo tour was
beginning to tell.
   ``I think she was very tired and this has been a rough couple of
days for her,'' said Lichtenstein. ``She was very hungry. I don't
think she had eaten all day and she was anxious to get back home.''

<HEAD>State Study Cites Above Normal Leukemia Rates Around No. 1 Superfund
Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITMAN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People living near the the nation's No. 1
Superfund toxic waste cleanup site had higher-than-average rates of
adult leukemia and of babies born underweight, a state study
concluded.
   The state Department of Environmental Protection's study was
released Thursday at a community meeting at a Pitman elementary
school, and was quickly criticized by many residents as being
incomplete.
   The 2{-year study, which covered residents of the Gloucester
County towns of Pitman, Mantua, Glassboro and Harrison, found normal
or below-normal rates of types of cancer other than adult leukemia
among residents within six-tenths of a mile of the defunct Lipari
landfill.
   ``It's superficial; the data base looks awful,'' said Joseph L.
Manganello, an assistant professor at Gloucester Community College
who has taught classes in statistics.
   ``If this is supposed to be a comprehensive study, I'd hate to
see one that isn't,'' Manganello said. ``The study should have gone
back more years and collected more data.''
   The cancer study looked at data from 1980 through 1984, and the
infant birth weight studies compared babies born in the 1960s, 1970s
and 1980s, according to today's editions of The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
   ``These findings suggest that the most adverse health effects
occurred during the 1970s, when exposures to hazardous substances
were probably the heaviest,'' the study concluded. But it stressed
that the limited information covered by the study could not prove
that the landfill caused the increased leukemia and low-birth-weight
rates.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency has set aside $20
million to clean up the 15-acre landfill 12 miles south of Camden,
which is ranked at the top of the Superfund priority list of more
than 900 toxic-waste sites.
   The Lipari landfill began operations in 1958, taking wastes from
several nearby plants. It was closed by the state in 1971 after
residents complained of respiratory problems, nausea, dying
vegitation, and odors. Numerous carcinogens such as benzene,
methylene chloride and aresnmic have been found at the site.
   In 1983, the landfill was sealed off by a containing wall and
cover made of polyethylene. The next phase of the cleanup involves
flushing contaminants from the landfill, a process that could take
up to seven years.

   Fumes from a solvent used to strip wax from a
bathroom floor overcame four people, killing one and injuring three
at the downtown federal building, authorities said today.
   Two cleaning company workers were stripping floor wax from a
washroom on the 21st floor of the Dirksen Federal Building about 9
p.m. Thursday when fumes from the thinner caused them to collapse,
said Michael Ahearn, a Fire Department deputy district chief.
   A security guard who pulled the men from the bathroom and a woman
who came into contact with the fumes also became ill.
   Randy White, 31, one of the bathroom workers, was dead on arrival
at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 10:05 p.m., said Roxanne
Sanderson, a hospital spokeswoman.
   White's co-worker, Vincent Brewer, 32, was in critical condition
in Northwestern's intensive care unit today, Ms. Sanderson said.
   Adam Barnes, 37, the building security guard, became ill as the
men were being transported to ambulances, said police Capt. John
Clisham.
   Barnes was treated and released at the hospital, as was Cherie
Halsey, 24, Ms. Sanderson said. She did not know how Ms. Halsey came
into contact with the fumes.
   The bathroom where the men were working lacked adequate
ventilation, Ahearn said. The container holding the solvent stated
that the area must be well-ventilated when the product is in use,
said Karen Morgan, a nursing supervisor at the hospital.

   The judge at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
selected four more people as prospective jurors today, including one
who said she doesn't pay attention to news because it's
``depressing'' and thinks the controversy over North is ``boring.''
   The woman, a secretary to a hospital director, said her mother,
who lives with her, pays such close attention to current events that
``I call her `news media'.''
   When her mother approaches her about the news, ``I always tell
her to get out of my room. I don't want to hear it,'' said the woman.
   She acknowledged she had been aware from other people, but said
she paid no attention to, North's immunized congressional testimony
in 1987 in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is
now accused of crimes.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell qualified her for the jury
pool over the objections of North attorney Barry Simon, who said the
woman ``was bombarded at a minimum'' with references to North.
   Gesell also selected a military personnel clerk for the pool, to
which 29 people have been sent since the trial opened Tuesday. He
hopes to build it to 50 before selecting a jury.
   Three people were rejected for the pool, including a
businesswoman who said North was involved in ``money and arms ... on
an international scale.'' She said she knew that North had ``a boss
named Poindexter'' and ``he had a blond secretary,'' a reference to
Fawn Hall, who has been granted immunity from prosecution by the
government in exchange for her testimony.
   The businesswoman, who has a masters degree, said she didn't
watch the 1987 congressional hearings because she was starting a
business and working 14 hours or more a day.
   On Thursday, Gesell said that ``security gurus'' from the CIA and
other intelligence agencies won't be permitted to disrupt North's
trial.
   Gesell responded angrily to a request that courtroom seats be
reserved for intelligence experts from the Justice Department and
agencies including the CIA, Defense Department, State Department,
the National Security Agency and possibly others.
   Gesell agreed to set up four seats for the intelligence
community, but said he is ``very concerned about their function.''
   ``I do not intend to have this case run by two or three security
gurus sitting in the audience,'' said Gesell. ``I don't want to be
in a position where every time a document flashes by you go to these
people who check with their department.''
   Gesell's admonition reflects a continuing behind-the-scenes
dispute in North's trial.
   The NSA is worried that government secrets will be disclosed in
the courtroom, even though the two central charges against North
were dropped Jan. 13 due to national security considerations. The 12
charges that remain generally accuse the former National Security
Council aide of attempts to cover up his activities in the
Iran-Contra affair _ activities which in many cases have since been
made public.
   The NSA had gone to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh with a list
of objections it said warranted blocking the trial, government
sources said. The attorney general has the authority to prevent
disclosure of sensitive information that might harm national
security, but Thornburgh overruled the NSA objections.
   Gesell, in his courtroom remarks Thursday, disclosed that he had
turned down an earlier unspecified request from the intelligence
community concerning how the trial would be conducted.
   He did not discuss the ruling, but said: ``I do not want to see
that proposal re-established in some other form.''
   Gesell's comments came at the end of a day in which nine
prospective jurors were sent into a jury pool the judge wants to
build to 50 before selecting a 12-member jury and six alternates.
   The judge predicted it will take ``most of next week'' to
complete the jury selection process.
   Gesell has spent much time since the Iran-Contra indictment was
handed up last March dealing with the problem of classified
information which the prosecution and defense want to present at
trial.

   The Interior Department said today it will
delay an offering of oil and gas leases in federal waters off
Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina because of limited
industry interest.
   Robert Kallman, director of the department's Minerals Management
Service, said environmental studies of the area would continue and
the government would issue another request for expessions of
drilling interest this fall.
   The lease auction, originally scheduled for October 1990, now is
planned for some time early in 1992.
   Last September, the department asked for nominations of specific
tracts to be offered in the 75-million acre area off the coast of
the four states.

<TEXT>
   The general who ousted military
dictator Alfredo Stroessner in a coup today is a career soldier who
rose from a humble background to become commander of the army's
premier unit and a wealthy man.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the son of a farmer, grew up in the rural
town of San Salvador but now lives in a mansion in a plush suburb of
Asuncion.
   Little is known of his early career, but Rodriguez, about 64, was
named commander of the First Army Corps in 1961. The corps, one of
three, is the largest and best equipped in the army.
   When Rodriguez attacked police headquarters and the presidential
guard to oust Stroessner, he had 40 to 50 tanks at his disposal plus
mortars, cannons, recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns and manpower.
   It was not clear why Rodriguez chose to unseat the 76-year-old
Stroessner or why he acted when he did.
   But diplomatic and political observers said that shortly before
the coup, Rodriguez, a stocky man of medium height, was ordered by
Stroessner to retire as army commander and become defense minister.
Rodriguez refused.
   Opposition leader Domingo Laino speculated that Rodriguez acted
because he had privately sided with the traditionalist wing of the
ruling Colorado Party, which has called for a transition to a more
democratic government and sought to distance itself from Stroessner.
   Rodriguez and Stroessner were personal friends as well as
professional colleagues. Their families became joined when
Rodriguez's daughter, Marta, married Stroessner's son, Alfredo.
   Rodriguez was well known inside the capital, but the first time
many Paraguayans heard of him was this morning when he said in his
clipped, commanding voice on the radio that Stroessner was under
arrest and he was ``taking command of the country from this moment.''

<HEAD>Bennett Says Lack of Cabinet Seat Won't Hamper Anti-Drug Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, who will lead
administration anti-drug efforts, said Friday his lack of a
permanent seat at President Bush's Cabinet table will not impair his
ability to deal effectively with other top officials.
   ``I have the confidence of the president,'' Bennett said in an
interview. ``I know that. He said it. I heard it. He said it to my
colleagues.''
   In a meeting of top-level appointees, Bush told everyone that
Bennett would be in charge of drug-control programs and said, ``You
are to work with him,'' Bennett recalled.
   ``He has since reiterated that,'' he said. ``He's told me, `I
want you to be able to do it (the new job) in a way that's
unencumbered.'''
   Bennett also said he's been assured by Bush that he will be
invited to Cabinet meetings when they pertain to the anti-drug
effort.
   Several members of Congress, including Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., who will preside over Bennett's
confirmation hearings starting March 1, have criticized Bush's
decision to leave the ``drug czar'' out of the Cabinet.
   ``I'm worried that the president has made a crucial mistake,
maybe in part by oversight, by not having the drug coordinator at
the table,'' Biden said Thursday.
   The director of national drug control policy ``has to do what
none of the others (in the Cabinet) has to do,'' said Biden. ``He
has to take them on, as a practical matter. He is entering the most
dangerous world in Washington, and that is the world of fiefdoms.''
   As soon as Bennett is confirmed, he will have 180 days to develop
a drug control strategy covering more than 30 agencies spread
throughout the federal government. Those agencies are under the more
direct control of individual department secretaries.
   ``I appreciate the concern of Senator Biden,'' said Bennett, who
met with him last week and was making courtesy calls on other
members of the Judiciary Committee on Friday afternoon.
   Bennett also said he had met with some department heads, such as
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   He said he has not been involved ``except in a very general way''
in developing the budget for fiscal 1990 that Bush is to present
Feb. 9. ``We're not going to get really involved in that until we've
finished our six-month plan,'' he said.
   The 180-day deadline for development of a drug strategy is the
reason his confirmation hearings were delayed until March 1,
according to both Bennett and Biden, who said he originally had
wanted the hearings to begin a month earlier.
   ``The clock is running the day I'm confirmed,'' Bennett said.
``Senator Biden and I discussed this and we decided to put off the
hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff, figure out how
the office is going to run.''
   He said he still has not decided who will be his top two deputies
_ one to work on reduction of demand for drugs and the other on
cutting the supply.
   Bennett vowed the day he was named to the job by Bush, Jan. 12,
that he would quit smoking by the time he was confirmed. He said
Friday he hadn't yet, but ``I will be done by the time I take
office. I've set a date for that, but I'm not going to preach until
I've succeeded.''

<HEAD>Government Plans to Pardon 30,000 For Hirohito's Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will pardon about 30,000 people and reinstate
certain rights for about 11 million others as part of the funeral
for Emperor Hirohito, news reports said Friday.
   Chief government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said the government would
pardon people guilty of 17 minor offenses, including violations of
traffic laws and the Alien Registration Law, news reports said.
   The plan also includes reinstating certain rights for about 11
million people, such as the right to vote, to run for public office
or to obtain driver's licenses because of past offenses, the reports
quoted Obuchi as saying.
   The plan is to be approved at a Cabinet meeting next week after
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita returns from the United States, the
reports said.
   Thirty-one foreigners on trial for violating the controversial
Alien Registration Law have said they are opposed to pardons because
they would eliminate their ability to protest in court against the
law's requirement that all resident aliens be fingerprinted and
carry identification cards.
   The amnesty plan excludes people convicted of bribery, and
therefore will not apply to former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who
was convicted in 1987 of receiving a bribe of $3.9 million from the
U.S. Lockheed Corp. to facilitate the sale of aircraft to a Japanese
airline.
   The government has pardoned criminals on previous occasions, such
as Japan's admission to the United Nations in 1956, the wedding of
then Crown Price Akihito in 1959 and the return of Okinawa from the
United States in 1972.
   The Foreign Ministry said Friday that 133 countries have notified
Japan they will send representatives to Hirohito's funeral on Feb.
24. Of the total, 54 nations have said they will send their head of
state, a ministry official said.
   A senior official in the National Police Agency said it plans to
mobilize 32,000 police to guard dignitaries and Japanese officials
at the funeral. At least six radical groups opposed to the imperial
system have threatened to disrupt the funeral.

   A 20-foot-long shark attacked and killed
an experienced scuba diver off the Mediterranean coast, news reports
said Friday.
   Luciano Costanzo, 46, was killed during a fishing outing Thursday
with his 19-year-old son, Gianluca, and a friend, the reports said.
   The son told Milan's Corriere della Sera newspaper he heard his
father yell for help and then saw the shark circle twice and pull
his father down.
   ``I clearly saw my father in the mouth of the shark,'' the son
said.
   The Port Authority in this central Italian city closed the area
to swimming and diving after verifying the attack.
   Large dangerous sharks are rare in the Mediterranean. The last
verified attack off the Italian coast was nearly 30 years ago when
an underwater photographer was killed by a shark near Naples,
newspapers said.

   Federal marshals staking out a post office
box in Florida captured two fugitives who fled Illinois after their
federal fraud convictions in a mail-order sex fantasy scam.
   Marshals recognized Donald S. Lowry Thursday despite a new beard
when they pulled up next to him in a car in Lantana, Fla., said U.S.
Marshal James Fyke. Lowry also had a fake driver's license.
   Lowry, 60, surrendered and led authorities to a house in Lake
Worth where they found Pamala St. Charles, 25, who had dyed her hair
and was using her maiden name of Ortiz, Fyke said at a news
conference.
   A federal jury convicted Lowry and St. Charles of mail fraud,
conspiracy and money laundering charges on Dec. 16 after prosecutors
accused them of bilking $4.5 million from 31,000 men nationwide
using the Church of Love _ a lonely hearts club for older men.
   Prosecutors said the two, both of Bettendorf, Iowa, illegally
cheated men out of money by selling phony stories of nude ``angels''
at a retirement paradise called Chonda-Za using a mail order system
linked to Lowry's Moline-based Church of Love.
   Lowry and St. Charles were free on bond pending sentencing April
7, when they disappeared. Federal warrants for their arrests were
issued Jan. 19 when they failed to check in with probation officers.
Interviews with Church of Love members and others led marshals to
suspect the pair might be in Florida, Fyke said.
   The two were expected to appear in court in West Palm Beach this
afternoon and Fyke said they probably would be returned to Illinois
in the next 10 days.

25 years, underwent a successful operation the next day to remove a
cataract from his left eye and returned to prison Jan. 27, Ms.
Mavumbe said.
   She said he had a similar operation on his right eye last year
and had not suffered a loss of vision.
   Prison officials declined comment on the daughter's report.
   Sisulu and Mandela were sent to prison after the same trial for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-run government. The
banned ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the main black group
fighting the government.
   Officials have released several aging and ailing black activists
in recent years, prompting widespread speculation that Sisulu could
be freed soon. However, the government has said nothing.

   U.N. relief officials plan to begin
airlifting food and medical supplies into the besieged capital of
Afghanistan within a few days, U.N. officials in Geneva and New York
said today.
   ``This is one of many actions of Operation Salaam,'' the U.N.
relief campaign for Afghanistan, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
``It's all in the effort to assist in the reconstruction of
Afghanistan.''
   U.N. officials in Geneva, speaking by telephone on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that an agreement had been reached with Afghan
guerrillas in which they promised not to attack relief planes.
   In return, the United Nations has pledged to send more relief
supplies into regions controlled by the Islamic rebels, who call
themselves the mujahedeen.
   ``The airlifts have not started, but it is not the only action
that is being taken,'' Ms. Younes said.
   She said it was part of ``an overall action,'' implying that
Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the mujahedeen areas would both
receive relief supplies.
   ``There have been contacts all along with all the parties,'' she
added.
   The agreement comes as the last units of Soviet troops are
pulling out of Kabul, where food and fuel shortages have been
reported.
   Guerrilla leaders have predicted that Kabul and other cities
controlled by the Afghan army will fall when the Soviet pullout is
completed.

   West Germany has asked the European
Economic Community to adopt an export ban on chemicals that go into
chemical weapons, and such a plan will be considered this month, a
group spokesman said Friday.
   The plan was prompted by a letter this week to Jacques Delors,
president of the EEC Commission, from West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   West Germany is embroiled in a scandal over the supply of
equipment to what the United States alleges is a chemical weapons
plant in Libya.
   The spokesman said the proposed EEC legislation would be
presented to a meeting of the body's foreign ministers in Brussels
on Feb. 20.
   The 12 EEC states now have an informal embargo on export of
chemicals that could be used to make weapons. It was declared in
1984 after it became known that chemical arms were used in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The spokesman said the EEC Commission envisons a formal ban on
the export of ``certain chemicals to certain countries.'' He did not
elaborate.

   A Japanese tuna boat caught fire off in the South

said Friday.
   The 299-ton No. 18 Sankichi-maru was found partially burned and
still smoking Thursday about 480 miles off northwestern New Zealand,
the officials said.
   No one was aboard when it was found by another Japanese fishing
boat, said officials of the Maritime Safety Agency. It appeared the

   The Maritime Safety Agency on Friday asked New Zealand and

   Vietnamese officials will come to Hong Kong this
month to try to arrange this British colony's first major
repatriation of Vietnamese boat people, a government spokesman said
Friday.
   The four-member Vietnamese delegation will leave for Bangkok,
Thailand, on Feb. 10, and fly on to Hong Kong, said government
spokesman Akber Khan.
   They will issue travel documents to countrymen who wish to return
home after fleeing Vietnam by boat. About 300 have asked to go home,
and Hanoi has cleared 141 cases for consideration, officials say.
   More than 25,000 Vietnamese are detained in Hong Kong camps,
including about 15,000 eligible to resettle but not accepted by a
foreign government.
   About 10,000 arrived after a new policy took effect in June.
Under the new rules, they face forced repatriation unless they can
prove they fled their homeland for fear of persecution.
   Until now, only about two dozen of the Vietnamese who sailed to
Hong Kong since the end of the Vietnam War have voluntarily returned
to their homeland.

<HEAD>HHS Offers Abandoned Tower as Shelter For Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HALL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kent County officials had no trouble
turning down an offer by the federal government to help house the
homeless _ the government was offering an old military observation
tower as a shelter.
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services recently
notified county officials that they could lease the abandoned tower
for the homeless. It's 80 feet tall, devoid of heat, electricity or
running water and situated in a remote part of the county.
   ``It's ludicrous,'' said county administrator William H. Landon.
``I can't believe anybody ever bothered to take a look at the
thing.'' The largely rural county has few problems with homeless
anyway, officials said.
   ``If we had any homeless, we certainly wouldn't take them down
there and put them in an 80-foot tower, not if we had their best
interests at heart,'' said county commission President Alexander P.
Rasin III.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development said Thursday that the notice to the county may have
been an error.
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about things like this,''
said the spokesman, William A. Glavin. ``Either properties are too
remote or they somehow wouldn't work.''
   A federal judge in Washington ordered HUD to determine which of
more than 300 surplus government properties could be used to shelter
the homeless under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act
of 1987. The ruling resulted from a lawsuit brought by homeless
advocates.
   HUD officials had only a month to determine which surplus sites
should be offered and gathered information by sending questionnaires
about the properties to other federal agencies. It is unlikely that
anyone from HUD actually visited the tower or contacted local
officials about it until now, Glavin said.
   The 1940s-era steel tower was used by the U.S. Army as an
observation platform during gun tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Crew of Crashed B-1B Simply Got Too Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Friday it lost one of its
new B-1B bombers in a crash last fall because the pilot and co-pilot
lost track of their altitude while attempting an instrument landing.
   The accident, which occurred Nov. 17 at Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D., destroyed the $280 million plane. The four crewmen ejected
safely.
   The detailed accident report, released by the Strategic Air
Command, was unusually direct in citing crew error.
   The bomber's pilot, a highly qualified instructor aircraft
commander, ``allowed the aircraft to descend below the published
minimum descent altitude for the approach being flown,'' and the
plane hit a power line and poles more than a half mile from the
runway, the report said.
   It said the plane's co-pilot failed to advise the pilot he was
too low.
   Lt. Col. George Peck, a spokesman for SAC, said Friday no
disciplinary action had been taken against the crew. He declined to
speculate whether any would be.
   The aircraft commander was Maj. Thomas C. Skillman of Bellmeade,
N.J. His co-pilot that night was Capt. Mick R. Guthals of Los
Alamos, N.M.
   Also aboard were Capt. Grover M. Gossett of Aiken, S.C., the
offensive system operator, and Maj. Dean C. Spraggins, an instructor
defensive system operator from Voorheesville, N.Y.
   The crash at Ellsworth occurred at 10:40 p.m. local time. While
the weather conditions were cold and foggy with a low cloud ceiling,
another B-1B landed safely just moments before the crash, the report
said.
   It said ``neither aircraft nor engine icing was a contributing
factor to the accident,'' and maintenance and other records revealed
no other factors leading to the mishap.
   Skillman and Guthals were making their second attempt to land
that night, having broken off an earlier approach.
   On the second try, Skillman had leveled the plane off at 3,480
feet _ the minimum altitude specified for that runway and approach _
but then allowed it to drift lower, the report said. After an
unidentified crewman called out ``altitude,'' the pilot applied
additional power to arrest his descent.
   The plane ``remained level or in a slight descent for five
seconds and then commenced an uninterrupted descent. Seven seconds
later, the right wing ... struck and sheared three wooden far field
monitor poles,'' the investigators wrote.
   The crash was the third involving a production-model B-1B in 14
months, leaving the Air Force with 97 of its original 100 planes.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is the first addition to
America's manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and
the new B-2 stealth bomber.
   The B-1B, built by Rockwell International Corp., has a maximum
speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

<HEAD>Call Reporting Officer Shot Turns Out to Be Elaborate Hoax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Someone used accurate police jargon over a
restricted frequency to report an officer had been shot, sparking a
hunt involving 24 officers, two helicopters and police dogs,
authorities said.
   The tense, two-hour search ended when a radio roll call
determined that no officer was missing, said Wilshire Division Sgt.
Stan Freedman.
   The man claimed to be an investigator with the police Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit. He issued a high-priority
call reporting that an officer had been wounded while pursuing a
drug dealer Wednesday night, Freedman said.
   Police quickly surrounded a midcity area to search for the
officer.
   The mysterious caller had initially asked dispatchers to run
license plate checks on a number of cars, but when asked for a radio
identification number, the caller went silent, police said.
   That number usually appears automatically on the dispatcher's
screen and among other things is used to pinpoint a patrol car's
location.
   Minutes later, the man radioed again, saying he was running after
a suspected drug dealer, Freedman said.
   ``He then broadcast: `Officer down,''' one of the department's
highest priority calls, reserved for times when officers appear to
be wounded, police Lt. Otis Dobine said. ``Because he was using
police jargon, it was believable.''
   Authorities were trying to determine how the caller was able to
tap into restricted frequencies used by police for emergency calls.
The man may have gotten his hands on a misplaced hand-held police
radio, Freedman said.
   ``We do have missing Rover hand-held radios that have been stolen
or lost,'' he said.

   U.N. relief officials plan to begin

   U.N. officials in Geneva, speaking by telephone and on condition

   Guerrilla leaders have predicted that Kabul and other cities

is to be out by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   Operation Salaam plans to spend more than $1.1 billion over two
years in Afghanistan. The project includes clearing the nation of
mines, repatriating millions of Afghan refugees from neighboring
Pakistan and Iran, and reviving Afghanistan's agricultural economy.
   The Soviet Union has so far pledged $600 million for the
campaign, out of total pledges of $887.6 million. The United States
pledged $16.7 million.

   A woman who allowed her daughter to skip
school was ordered to attend classes with the teen-ager, but she
said Friday would be her last day in school.
   Jeanetta Norvell, 45, was sentenced Monday to one day in jail and
the rest of the school year with her daughter, Diana, at West Junior
High School because Diana missed too many classes.
   But Mrs. Norvell, who skipped math class to speak in a telephone
interview Friday, said her school days are over because her daughter
turns 16 Saturday and is eligible to drop out.
   ``I'm withdrawing her Monday,'' Mrs. Norvell said. ``It's a
pretty sad thing that a 45-year-old adult has to go to a junior high
school, but it was more humiliating to be treated like a common
criminal.''
   Mrs. Norvell was convicted of permitting her daughter to skip
school five days between October and December of last year.
   ``Diana hates school,'' Mrs. Norvell said.
   Cabell County Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon ordered Mrs. Norvell to
accompany her daughter to school for the rest of the year and stay
with her throughout the school day. The judge also said she may not
leave the state without permission of the county probation office,
according to court records.
   It was believed to be the first time in West Virginia that a
parent has served time for allowing a child to be truant.
   West Junior High Principal Charles Buell said some of his
students have been required in the past to attend school past the
age of 16, but he said a final decision is up to O'Hanlon.
   ``I guess if this is the only way to make sure that children
attend school it's worth it,'' Buell said. ``But I'm really not in
favor of having parents follow their children around in school.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people returned to their homes
following a spectacular railroad explosion and fire, but the blast
damage threatened a dangerous power shortage today as temperatures
ranged to 38 below zero.
   ``We've got to minimize power usage right down to the last light
bulb,'' said Leroy Lamach, Helena division engineer for Montana
Power Co. ``It's that critical.''
   As wind chills dipped to 70 below zero, National Guard and Air
Force troops relieved local firefighters late Thursday to monitor
the explosion scene overnight and extinguish the last stubborn fires.
   ``We're just going to keep pouring water on it all night,'' said
Sgt. Ron Weber, a National Guardsman stationed in Helena. ``The cars
that were the most threatening are now huge ice cubes.''
   The wreckage continued to smolder this morning, said Paul
Spengler, Lewis and Clark County disaster services coordinator. The
temperature at 7 a.m. was 29 degrees below zero.
   Bitter cold weather that swept down out of Alaska was indirectly
responsible for the pre-dawn explosions that rocked Montana's
capital Thursday, severing power lines and showering some
neighborhoods with shrapnel.
   Authorities said the accident occurred when railroad workers
tried to switch locomotives on a freight train because the heater in
one locomotive had failed. Forty-eight freight cars rolled away
during the switch, traveling nine miles into Helena before derailing
and plowing into a propane tank.
   The tank exploded, authorities said, igniting a rail car filled
with highly flammable hydrogen peroxide, which also exploded. But a
second hydrogen peroxide car was coated with ice in the frigid cold,
apparently preventing it from exploding.
   The owner of the propane tank said today that his tank did not
explode.
   Only two minor injuries were reported, which Spengler termed
``miraculous,'' adding, ``We are all speculating what a disaster
we'd have had if that had happened at the rush hour.''
   It was one of two major train derailments in Montana on Thursday.
In the second, 52 Burlington Northern grain cars derailed near
Glacier National Park, spilling more than 5,000 tons of corn and
blocking tracks in both directions. The derailment forced Amtrak to
suspend service indefinitely between Minnesota and the West Coast.
   The explosions in Helena scattered debris for a quarter-mile
radius, showering a nearby college campus and sending a 1,500-pound
coupling unit through a dormitory roof. Windows were blasted out of
homes and businesses up to two miles away.
   About 2,000 residents were evacuated within a square-mile area
around the blast site as the temperature hovered near 30 below zero.
Power was knocked out in parts of Helena for up to six hours.
   By Thursday night, the evacuation order had been lifted, although
parts of neighborhoods near the blast site remained without power.
Lamach said the strain on substations carrying re-routed power was
so heavy that any further problems could force rolling blackouts
throughout the city.
   Many homes in Helena rely on electricity as their primary source
of heat. With forecasters predicting a high of 20 below zero today
and a low of minus 38 tonight, officials pleaded with residents to
cut back on all but essential electricity use.
   Mayor Russ Ritter, who also is vice president of Carroll College,
said damage in the city was estimated at $3 million, with $2 million
on the college campus. A cement plant near the blast also suffered
extensive damage, authorities said.
   Ritter said college officials hoped to have the 700 to 800
students evacuated from Carroll's three dormitories back in their
rooms this weekend and to resume classes Monday. The students were
staying in private homes while hundreds of windows in dormitories
and other campus buildings were being repaired.
   In Washington, the Federal Railroad Administration said the chain
of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a Montana Rail
Link Inc. locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the Continental
Divide west of Helena.
   The crew stopped the train to exchange locomotives and, in the
process, set the freight cars loose.
   ``When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crew
returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone,''
the federal agency said. The cars rolled into Helena, setting off
the day's chain of events.
   Bill Brodsky, president of Montana Rail Link, said proper
procedure requires train crews to set the brakes on a train before
cars are disengaged from the locomotive.
   He said it was not known whether the air brake system failed to
function properly or whether the crew did not follow proper
procedure when they switched locomotives.
   ``There's a considerable amount of investigation that has to be
done,'' Brodsky said. ``We just don't know at this point.''
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived Thursday night, Spengler said. The FRA also planned an
extensive investigation.
   Officials asked residents today to report _ but not move _ any
debris they find that might have come from the blast. Debris has
been spotted as much as a mile from the site.
   ``We're going to give it to the NTSB,'' Spengler said. ``They
need to know what flew where, so we don't want the citizens to pick
it up.''

<HEAD>Wurst Case Scenario: Farmers Upset Over Ruling on Sausage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was bad enough when West Germany had
to let foreign beers in. Now, fatty and gristly sausages from other
countries will be competing alongside the beloved domestic wurst.
   Farming and meat industry officials are fuming over the ruling by
the European Economic Community's top court forcing West Germany to
import wurst and other meat products that don't measure up to the
nation's purity laws.
   ``This is an extremely regrettable decision,'' said Rudolf
Schnieders, a spokesman for the West German Farmers Federation. ``It
amounts to allowing in products that West German law still forbids
us to make.''
   He said West German store shelves will soon be able to stock
products ``colored with chemicals and filled with fat, blood, soya
and milk-based lacto-proteins.''
   The mass-circulation Bild tabloid bannered its story on the
decision with the headline: ``Red Wurst!''
   Wurst products are a traditional staple in the German diet. Food
stores and butcher shops offer a wide range of wurst, including
dozens of varieties of pork and liver sausage. Compared to the high
prices of other meat products, wurst is relatively economical and
can be used in many dishes.
   The EEC's Court of Justice in Luxembourg struck down the West
German import restrictions on Thursday, saying they violated fair
trade agreements among EEC members.
   The court rejected West Germany's contention that plant proteins
in meat products were less nourishing than all-meat varieties.
   While West German law allows some additives to meat products,
their amount and nature are strictly limited.
   Thursday's decision followed a similar ruling two years ago, when
West Germany was forced to allow the import of foreign beer that did
not conform to the nation's brewing purity laws.
   That decision drew a loud outcry from the nation's brewers, who
pride themselves as being among the world's best beer makers.
   The court's decision Thursday drew immediate calls for stricter
labeling laws to make sure consumers know what they're buying.
   The reaction wasn't all negative, however.
   The Bonn-based West German Consumer's Working Group hailed the
ruling, saying ``foreign products are not necessarily better or
worse than local products.''
   The group criticized the West German goverment's position on the
imports. It said government resistance was aimed more at reducing
competition for West German producers than protecting public health
interests.
   The conservative Die Welt newspaper in Bonn, in an editorial,
said the government's position was untenable from the start, adding
that ``those who want to eat soya wurst ought to be able to.''
   Meat store owners in Bonn seemed undisturbed by the decision.
   ``Our customers are accustomed to the best and the purist
products,'' said Gabriela Fischer, who works at a specialty butcher
shop in Bonn.
   ``We don't expect that to change,'' Fischer said from behind a
counter well-stocked with a variety of German meat products.
   And the wurst-loving consumers?
   ``I prefer the German products because that's what I'm used to,''
said a shopper in downtown Bonn. ``But I'd still like the
opportunity to choose between them and what the French, Belgians and
Italians have to offer.''
   ``It's all wurst to me,'' said another consumer, using a popular
German slang phrase indicating indifference.

   The government claims that a man described as
an international terrorist for carrying explosives on the New Jersey
Turnpike planned three bombings in New York, a defense attorney said
today.
   Ronald Kuby, Yu Kikumura's attorney, said that in a pre-sentence
report filed by the government, prosecutors claim his client
targeted the United Nations building, a Navy recruiting office and
an area of Manhattan's garment district.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito alleges Kikumura, 36, is a member
of the terrorist Japanese Red Army who was secretly planning attacks
in retaliation for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya. Alito
would neither confirm nor deny reports that Kikumura was acting at
the direction of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Kikumura, convicted of illegally transporting explosives,
possession of firearms by an alien, possession of unregistered
firearms and carrying false travel documents, is to be sentenced
Monday.
   Alito said he would release the pre-sentence report later today.
   ``We are saying the attacks were planned by the Japanese Red Army
in retaliation for the bombing of Libya,'' Alito said. ``Any other
reports are probably coming from the defense attorneys, and they are
incorrect.''
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Alito
identified Kikumura's targets as the three New York sites. Alito
said the reports were incorrect.
   Kuby said this morning, and government sources previously have
confirmed to The Associated Press, that a map of New York was found
in Kikumura's car when he was arrested April 12.
   Kikumura was arrested at a highway rest area with three 18-inch
pipe bombs in his car. The government says the bombs were capable of
destroying an average building.
   Kuby said the government claims the map had pinholes in them that
marked the three targets.
   ``The government says there was three pinholes in the map and
they were near a U.S. Navy recruiting office, the United Nations and
the garment district,'' Kuby said. ``They're are identifying the
targets and we're saying it's not true.''
   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner convicted Kikumura Nov. 29
in a non-jury trial. He faces up to 100 years in prison.

<HEAD>Gov't Blasts Businesses For Raising Prices of Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a crackdown Friday on
state-owned businesses that have raised prices and cut the
production of inexpensive products.
   The action, taking by the Council of Ministers, or cabinet, was
another attempt to ease chronic shortages of consumer goods.
   The council said it would require businesses to produce a minimum
amount of inexpensive consumer goods and would ban price increases
for items whose ``consumer properties change insignificantly,'' the
Tass news agency reported.
   Price increases for ``new and fashionable goods'' may not exceed
15 percent, the council decided.
   The decision was announced Friday, but had been approved in early
January, Council of Ministers spokesman Lev Voznesensky said in a
telephone interview. It did not affect the burgeoning cooperative
movement that has arisen under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has said tackling the country's shortage of consumer
goods and food is a top priority of his economic restructuring
program.
   Because of Gorbachev's drive to make each factory pay its own
way, however, Soviet managers are in effect encouraged to seek the
highest markup they can on their products, and even to curtail
manufacture of cheap goods that bring little return.
   The consumer goods shortages _ known as ``deficits'' _ have
plagued the country for years, but Soviets complain that under
Gorbachev, new ones have appeared, including inexpensive items.
   One of the most talked about examples is soap. Soviets have
flooded the official press with angry letters and grumbled privately
that inexpensive soap has disappeared from shelves while expensive
bars are plentiful.
   ``I am writing this letter out of happiness that my husband
(according to a waiting list) received one bar of household soap and
a tube of `Zefir' toothpaste,'' one woman wrote sarcastically Dec.
28 in the labor daily Trud. ``I will take care of it to make sure it
lasts long, because it's unknown when such good fortune will visit
me again.''
   For state-owned Soviet factories and other businesses, the
problem is one of profits. They are required to be self-financing,
meaning they must not spend more money than they take in and will
not be bailed out by the government.
   As a result, many businesses have reduced production of
inexpensive goods that bring in little money, and increased output
of expensive items.
   Many Soviets complain they can't afford the costly alternatives
on their meager salaries, which average about $333 monthly. They
even charge that factory managers are withholding consumer goods
from the stores to try to sabotage Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   In October, Nikolai G. Belov, deputy director of the State
Committee on Statistics, called the substitution of cheap goods with
expensive alternatives ``hidden price hikes,'' and said that along
with increases in wages, inflation had developed. He did not give a
figure for inflation.
   Another decision of the Council of Ministers did pertain to
cooperatives, but its immediate effects were uncertain.
   Tass said cooperatives will be allowed to buy ``non-scarce foods
and non-edible commodities,'' presumably from the state, but that
any products made from them should be sold at prices fixed for
state-run retail shops.
   In the past, cooperative restaurants and other ventures could
only buy supplies from other cooperatives or independent sources
like the country's peasant markets.

<TEXT>
   If his successors want to obliterate
the stamp Gen. Alfredo Stroessner put on Paraguay, they will have to
take down hundreds of pictures, rename towns and schools, and change
the thinking habits of two generations.
   One of the biggest towns in this landlocked nation is Ciudad
Presidente Stroessner. Asuncion's airport bears his name and he had
a huge neon sign erected in its central plaza to blink out the
declaration, ``Stroessner: Peace, Work and Well-being.''
   He seized power in 1954 and ruled for nearly 35 years _ longer
than any leader in the Western Hemisphere _ with a canny blend of
military force, political patronage and self-discipline.
   The red-haired son of a Bavarian immigrant, whose mother was of
Spanish heritage, began his military career at 20 and quickly
distinguished himself.
   During his long rule, Stroessner oversaw Paraguay's
transformation from a backwater with open sewers and no running
water to a relatively prosperous and modern nation.
   Then, on Friday, the 76-year-old general's era ended as it began,
with a coup by his second-in-command, Gen. Andres Rodriguez.
   Stroessner won eight presidential elections despite opposition
charges of fraud.
   Even his critics admit he helped stabilize Paraguay. In the 31
years before he took over, it had 22 presidents.
   Yet, he also was accused of brutal repression and corruption, and
his country became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug traffickers and
former dictators.
   Among the refugees were Josef Mengele, the Auschwitz death camp
doctor who became a citizen of Paraguay in 1959 and was befriended
by Nazi sympathizers; Edward Rochmann, the Nazi ``Butcher of Riga'';
ousted President Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua, who was assassinated
in Paraguay; drug trafficker Joseph August Ricorde; and Croation
militant and convicted assassin Miro Baresic.
   As convenient tools for keeping order, Stroessner had his
perpetual state of siege and Law 209 _ the Law for the Defense of
Democracy _ that gave his government the power to make sure there
was no democracy to defend.
   Stroessner's ubiquitous approach to governing included
innumerable speeches, sometimes lasting hours, in which he often
would list his public works projects in great detail.
   Among the most impressive of those was the $16 billion Itaipu
dam, the world's largest hydroelectrical project, built in
partnership with neighboring Brazil. It began producing power in
1985.
   He attended hundreds of ground-breakings and other public
ceremonies each year, even in outlying towns, and served regularly
as a witness at weddings even when he didn't know the bride or groom.
   Spartan habits and a busy schedule were the reasons for his
longevity and energy, he said. Stroessner does not smoke and drinks
little.
   Public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly
evident in the mid-1980s, when protesters and police clashed in the
streets.
   The Roman Catholic Church and even a faction of Stroessner's
Colorado Party began criticizing the president, accusing him of
repression and demanding democratic reforms.
   Human rights groups said many of Stroessner's foes were tortured
and killed during his early years in power. Others were jailed
indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or forced into exile.
   He was a rabid anti-communist and staunch ally of the United
States, but the general's relations with Washington cooled when the
Reagan administration referred to his government as a dictatorship.
   Stroessner attended Paraguay's military academy, graduating in
1929, and as a 20-year-old lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the
Chaco War with Bolivia. He distinguished himself for bravery and
rose quickly through the ranks, reaching the rank of general at age
40. He became army chief of staff in 1951.
   In the first four years after seizing power, Stroessner put down
five attempted coups by exiled politicians and began dismantling the
political opposition.
   Using special powers under the state of siege, which was renewed
every 90 days until last year, civilian and military police arrested
thousands of opponents. Stroessner referred to virtually all his
opponents as subversives.
   Critics say his government promoted a side economy dominated by
contraband. Many government and military officials, including
relatives and close associates, became rich through ties with
Stroessner.
   The general is said to have been ill since a prostate operation
five months ago. His apparent slow recovery increased demands by
opposition leaders for a transition to democratic rule by the army
and Colorado Party.
   He and his wife, Eligia, have three children: Gustavo, an air
force colonel with many business interests; Hugo Alfredo, a
businessman, and Graciela Gonzalez Llamas.

   China on Friday formally invited Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to come to Beijing for their nations' first
summit in 30 years, and the Soviet Union accepted.
   The meeting between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping will normalize
relations that turned hostile in 1960 when their predecessors,
Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung, quarreled over the border and
leadership of the world communist movement.
   ``The coming Chinese-Soviet summit will be an event of great
significance,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li
Peng as telling Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. He said
the normalization of ties will ``help promote world peace and
stability.''
   ``It's official,'' Soviet Embassy spokesman Viatcheslav Duhin
said at a news briefing. He said Shevardnadze, who has been in China
since Wednesday, will make an announcement about the date Saturday
after consulting with Deng.
   He said only a general time-frame may be announced, such as late
April or mid-May. So far, both sides have said only that the summit
should be held in the first half of the year.
   Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit China in
30 years, flew Friday night to Shanghai for his meeting with Deng.
Duhin said he had heard Deng was in Shanghai for medical
examinations, but later said he had heard only rumors, nothing
official.
   Rumors that the 84-year-old Deng is in poor health have
frequently circulated in Beijing.
   After meeting Deng, Shevardnadze will fly back to Beijing for a
news conference before leaving for Pakistan.
   The Soviets released few details of Shevardnadze's meetings
Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, and the premier,
but they confirmed the issue of Cambodia was discussed for a second
day. The Chinese-Soviet border, over which the two countries fought
briefly in 1969, also was discussed, Duhin said.
   ``As far as I understand, he (Shevardnadze) was satisfied with
the talks. He said some problems still have to be resolved and some
things are left for Mr. Gorbachev, but he was satisfied in
general,'' Duhin said.
   Xinhua quoted Li as telling Shevardnadze his visit would give
impetus to resolving the Cambodian issue and ``remove a major
obstacle to the normalization of relations between China and the
Soviet Union.''
   China had long refused to normalize ties with Moscow until, among
other things, Soviet-allied Vietnam ended its occupation of Cambodia.
   Under pressure from the Soviet Union, Vietnam has said it will
pull out by September if a settlement can be reached on the makeup
of a future government. China has agreed in principle to end its
support to anti-Vietnamese guerrillas by then.
   Both the Soviets and Chinese have said during Shevardnadze's
visit they still differ on aspects of the Cambodian problem, but
neither has disclosed the specific points of disagreement.
   Xinhua said Li stressed the withdrawal must be carried out under
international supervision. The Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia has rejected this in the past.
   Shevardnadze canceled without explanation a planned sightseeing
tour Friday to the Forbidden City, the former residence of China's
emperors, and there was speculation he met with Cambodian resistence
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk spends much of each year in
Beijing and lives at the same state guesthouse as Shevardnadze.
   Duhin said he could not confirm the two met. Asked if the Soviet
Union, like China, wants Sihanouk to head a post-occupation
government in Cambodia, Duhin said that is up to the Cambodians.
   Duhin said that when Gorbachev comes to Beijing, it will also be
``natural'' to restore ties between the two countries' Communist
parties, severed in the 1960s.
   Gorbachev will be coming in his capacity as Soviet president, but
he also is secretary-general of the Soviet Communist Party. Duhin
said restored party ties would allow for exchanges on ideological
matters. Ideological differences were one of the key reasons for the
1960 split.
   Now, Duhin said, ``we don't speak about ideology.''

<HEAD>Female Prisoners To Promote N.C. Vacation Spots</HEAD>

   When residents of other states telephone
this spring to ask about vacation prospects in North Carolina, the
voice on the other end will belong to a state prisoner.
   Beginning in March, inmates at the North Carolina Correctional
Institution for Women will field inquiries for the Division of
Travel and Tourism, Gov. Jim Martin announced Thursday.
   The 16 or so women will be instructed about vacation
opportunities and on how to dispense advice, the governor said. The
program should provide valuable job training for the inmates while
improving the efficiency of the tourist-inquiry service, he said.
   Inmate labor has been used successfully for similar tasks in
other states, said Commerce Secretary Claude Pope.
   Martin drew criticism during his re-election campaign last year
because of slow responses to out-of-state inquiries about vacation
prospects in North Carolina. At one point in the summer, the backlog
of unfilled requests for information neared 100,000, and critics
said it was costing the state money in lost tourism dollars.
   The Division of Travel and Tourism has already used female
prisoners to package travel brochures, eventually eliminating the
backlog. Now, they will answer calls as well.
   David Guth, spokesman for the state corrections department, said
the inmates will earn $1 a day, the standard rate of pay for state
jobs done by prisoners.
   Male inmates can get jobs in printing, agriculture, and furniture
making for the state, but the state's only women's prison has few
similar jobs.
   ``There are just not a lot of opportunites for our women
prisoners to work and this seemed like an ideal one,'' Guth said.
   ``And from a psychological standpoint, women offenders are
generally better suited to this kind of work,'' Guth said. ``Male
offenders are often rougher and committed rougher crimes than women
offenders, and they are not the types you want answering questions
on the phone.
   ``Even women offenders who commit murder generally did so as a
result of abuse or some other factor and they better fit the
psychological profile we want for this type of job.''

   First lady Barbara Bush visited a community
services organization Friday, carrying bags full of donated toys and
clothes and telling reporters ``we've got to help the working poor.''
   Mrs. Bush also scheduled her first media interviews since
becoming first lady as she kept up a busy schedule before she and
President Bush left for their first weekend at Camp David.
   Earlier Friday, Mrs. Bush visited the United Community Ministries
Inc. in the Washington suburb of Alexandria and praised the center's
staff of volunteers.
   ``It reinforces my belief that we have got to help the working
poor,'' she told reporters during her 40-minute visit.
   The first lady helped carry from the trunk of her limousine seven
plastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of the
White House staff donated.
   The center is a private, non-profit organization whose programs
include a thrift shop, food pantry, medical clinics, day care,
counseling and financial assistance.
   In the thrift shop, Mrs. Bush was joined by volunteers Eileen
Friedman, a member of the board of directors, and 78-year-old Jessie
Stark as she looked over secondhand clothes being offered for sale
at nominal prices.
   She posed for photographers with four children from the
facility's day care center. They included 4-year-old Amber Daniels,
who handed Mrs. Bush a ``mock voting tally'' from the preschool
class, showing President Bush with a clear margin over Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   ``That just makes me feel wonderful,'' the first lady said.
   Mrs. Bush also visited United Community Ministries in 1984, the
year she was honorary chairwoman of the organization's fund-raiser.

   A divorce battle is shaping up between
Nautilus exercise equipment inventor Arthur Jones and his fifth
wife, a 26-year-old model and pilot suing for half his $20 million
fortune.
   Terri Jones was 18 and the fifth teen-age bride for Jones, who is
in his late 60s, when they were married in Las Vegas in 1981. Her
divorce papers accuse Jones of blackmail, infidelity and murder
threats.
   She claimed Jones, who raises crocodiles, elephants and other
exotic animals on a 600-acre ranch near Ocala, threatened to kill
her, her lawyer and the judge if she contested the divorce.
   Circuit Judge Wallace Sturgis summoned extra bailiffs to a
hearing Tuesday night where he issued restraining orders to keep
Arthur and Terri Jones apart.
   Jones filed for divorce Dec. 22, alleging his wife engaged in
extramarital affairs.
   Ms. Jones claimed he bragged about affairs with other women and
forced her to sleep with married men so he could blackmail them ``to
comply with his various schemes,'' according to court papers she
filed Jan. 27.
   Jones, represented by attorney Ann Loughridge Kerr of Clearwater,
claims that during their marriage he spent $50,000 teaching Ms.
Jones to pilot a Boeing 707 jet and that he helped her establish a
modeling career that netted her more than $200,000.

   Joan Kroc has offered a reward to
find a stray dog's owner after a therapist who reads the thoughts of
animals told the San Diego Padres' owner that the stray was lonesome
for its owner.
   Kroc, a millionaire philanthropist, put ads this week in local
newspapers offering $100 reward for the dog's owner.
   Kroc met with Samantha Khury of Escondido, who says she is able
to visualize the thoughts and emotions of animals in therapy
sessions with them.
   ``It's a mystery, and animals can't speak and I know that, but
maybe in some way they can communicate with her,'' Kroc said. ``They
certainly don't communicate with me, but she's quite a lady.''
   Kroc, 60, found the bleeding dog Nov. 8 and took it home in her
car. Once it got well, the dog she named Boots, kept trying to run
away.
   In two sessions, Khury said she learned Boots grieved over the
separation from its owner.
   ``She (Boots) informed me of what kind of emotion she had toward
Joan, for not only being willing to get blood all over herself, but
also all over her car,'' Khury said.
   Kroc said she's not sure Khury, who charges about $50 an hour for
her services, can communicate with animals. But adds, ``I'm not sure
that it's not true. So what harm does it do?''

   He took office Aug. 4, 1986, succeeding Roscoe L. Egger Jr. Gibbs
had served in the early 1970s as deputy chief counsel, acting chief
counsel and assistant commissioner. Between his IRS stints he had
been a partner in the Johnson &amp; Swanson law firm in Dallas.
   During his tenure as commissioner, Gibbs said taxpayers should be
treated by IRS employees as customers, and he launched a major drive
to improve service to taxpayers. He originally opposed congressional
passage of a ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' designed to protect
taxpayers who are subjects of IRS enforcement efforts, but endorsed
the measure after it was amended.

   As the Soviets prepare to leave Afghanistan,
Moslem guerrillas continue their assaults on government outposts in
the countryside. Here is a report by an AP correspondent who spent a
week with a group of the insurgents in their mountain strongholds
southwest of Kabul.

   Bent against a wind that
howls through Afghanistan's snow-covered mountains, Moslem
insurgents with stocking feet covered only in sandals coax camel and
mule supply convoys over rugged passes.
   The guerrillas say the snow that clogs the winding trails will
confine their military activities mainly to harassment of communist
troops until the spring thaw.
   They say the harsh weather prevents them from launching major
assaults on Afghan cities vacated by the withdrawing Soviet army.
   Winter has turned the imposing peaks that have harbored the U.S.
and Pakistan-backed guerrillas during their 10-year war against the
communists into frigid citadels.
   The turbaned fighters huddled in blankets say that until spring,
they will concentrate on weakening government forces by harassing
them and blocking their overland supply routes of food and fuel.
   ``God willing, we are near to freedom,'' said Jabbar, already a
seasoned guerrilla with the hard-line Yunis Khalis faction at the
age of 24. Ten years ago, he traded his textbooks for a Soviet-made
Kalashnikov assault rifle.
   ``But until the spring we can't do much,'' says Rahoney Wardak,
who along with his two brothers commands several hundred guerrillas
in Afghanistan's central and southern provinces of Wardak and Ghazni.
   Moscow pledged in a U.N. accord to withdraw all of its more than
100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Half were out by
August and the final pullout in under way.
   The Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 coup, sparking the Moslem insurrection. Soviet soldiers
marched in a year later to replace one pro-Moscow government with
another, then remained to help it fight the burgeoning civil war.
   Negotiations for the accord, signed by Afghanistan, neighboring
Pakistan, the Soviet Union and the United States, excluded the
guerrillas, who say it was their own persistence that forced the
Soviets to leave.
   The guerrillas, some wearing Soviet-made fur hats and woolen
uniform pants captured from fallen government posts, said morale
within their loose ranks is rising peaking while the morale among
Kabul troops is at an ebb.
   ``They are very nervous,'' says Wardak. With the Soviets pulling
out of the country ``they can't imagine what will happen to them.''
   The guerrillas have promised amnesty to defecting troops.
   ``If the Soviets really leave, regime forces will fall down on
their own,'' said Wardak. ``If they really take their hands off of
Afghanistan then the (fighting) can be finished in a short time.''
   In the eastern Afghan city of Ghazni, about 100 miles from the
Pakistan border, guerrillas divided into small cells of 15 have
breached the government's security belt and are inside the city
limits.
   About 2,000 government troops are posted in more than 130
positions in and around Ghazni. Guerrillas say half are from the
ranks of Kabul's elite Tsarandoy police and half from the Khad state
security force.
   Until the Soviets pulled out of the city of 100,000 last year,
guerrilla access to it was severely curtailed by Red Army troops who
stalked the perimeter and ambushed squads.
   ``When the Russians were in Ghazni, every day there was an
ambush,'' said Abdul Raqib, a commander in the city. But he said
communist troops stay within the confines of their posts when
returning fire.
   A handful of guerrillas, one wearing a captured Soviet-issued
tank helmet, moved within the Ghazni city limits to within several
hundred feet of its ancient Balahisar Fort, which seems inpregnable
from its perch overlooking the city.
   The guerrillas harass troops in the bastion with 82mm rockets.
   ``We don't expect to capture the fort, we just want to keep the
government off guard,'' said Raqib. Within minutes, a tank rumbles
out and indiscriminately blasts away in the direction of the
guerrillas' fire.
   He said the only time the troops venture out is when the fort is
attacked, and only then in tanks.
   Since the Red Army began withdrawing, government posts in the
countryside began falling to guerrillas. The insurgents now move
freely from neighboring Pakistan, where much of their weapons and
ammunition originate.
   Obscure villages with names like Loghari, Bandi Sadr and Ya Khiel
are memorials to Soviet-Afghan war dead and testimonials to
guerrilla tenacity.
   Rusting Soviet-made T-62 tanks and military vehicles are
partially buried in the snow outside Bandi Sadr. In Ya Khiel,
guerrillas with rocket-propelled grenade launchers slung over their
shoulders climb over the remains of a Soviet-made helicopter.
   The guerrillas want the major cities to collapse from within.
   ``We have adopted this strategy because the civilians are afraid
of (retaliatory Soviet) bombing raids,'' he said.
   Because of this, he said, the cities will stay in communist hands
until the snow melts away and the last of the Red Army has gone home.

   A 137-year-old covered bridge that
survived floods, tornadoes and an assault by Confederate troops was
done in by a gasoline leak and a car with a hot catalytic converter,
officials said Friday.
   The 312-foot Philippi Covered Bridge, the longest two-lane
covered bridge still in use on a federal highway, was destroyed by
fire Thursday night.
   Philippi City Manager Joe Mattaliano said he hoped the state can
repair the bridge, which carried U.S. 250 over the Tygart Valley
River.
   State Department of Highways officials were optimistic Friday
morning that the bridge's steel and concrete base was still
structurally sound. They planned a more thorough inspection later in
the day.
   A pool of gasoline that had trickled about 100 feet from a nozzle
being used to fill gas tanks at a service station was set off by a
car driving over the bridge, said firefighter Jeff Byrne.
   ``Apparently, the car's catalytic converter ignited the fuel,''
said Byrne. ``The women in the car said they heard a whoosing sound
and jumped out when they saw the road on fire.''
   No one was injured in the incident.
   Mattaliano, who was driving across the bridge when it caught
fire, said, ``I saw a wall of fire coming at me in my rear view
mirror. I got off the bridge in a hurry and called the Fire
Department.''
   The bridge, built in 1852 by Lemuel Chenoweth, was known for its
arched, all-poplar frame held together by iron bolts. It survived a
1910 flood and received minor damage in a 1985 blood. During the
Civil War, fleeing Confederate troops tried to burn the bridge to
prevent Union troops from following, but the attempt failed.
   ``This bridge is part of the history of West Virginia,'' said
Mattaliano. ``It survived floods and tornadoes.''
   With its loss, Philippi, a town of 3,700 people about 20 miles
southeast of Clarksburg, was left with only one other bridge, and
Mattaliano predicted traffic backups until the covered bridge could
be repaired.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze enters talks this weekend in a bid to forge a political
settlement from nine years of futile intervention in Afghanistan's
civil war.
   His 17-hour visit, beginning Saturday night, caps a week of
hectic diplomatic efforts to avert more bloodshed as the Red Army
continues its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Shevardnadze will be talking to officials of the Pakistani
government, which has backed and sheltered the most powerful
guerrilla forces fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed regime.
   ``We hope our talks with the Soviet leader will pave the way for
a peaceful settlement, although the situation on the ground in
Afghanistan is depressing,'' a Pakistani government spokesman said
this week.
   He was referring to bitter fighting between communist forces and
Moslem guerrillas. Some of the worst reported attacks have occurred
along the main Soviet withdrawal route from Kabul north to the
Soviet border.
   Moscow signed a U.N. accord last spring providing for removal of
the approximately 100,000 Soviet combat troops by Feb. 15.
   Although the last units are said to be en route home, there still
are no prospects for peace between Kabul's communist government and
tenacious Moslem insurgents armed by the United States, Pakistan and
other Islamic countries.
   All sides agree on the need for a settlement that will produce a
broad-based government to succeed the current regime, which seized
power in a bloody 1978 coup.
   President Najib of Afghanistan insists that such a new government
should retain some of his officials.
   However, the guerrillas consider the communists traitors for
inviting the Soviets to intervene in December 1979 and refuse to
negotiate with them.
   In addition, the guerrillas cannot agree among themselves on how
to form a transitional regime leading to a post-war Islamic republic
of Afghanistan.
   The insurgents' seven major parties, Sunni Moslem groups
headquartered in Pakistan, are at odds with Shiite Moslem insurgent
groups based in Iran over proportional repesentation in a grand
``consultative council'' that is to lay groundwork for a new
government.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran flew to Pakistan
earlier this week for two days of talks. When he departed Thursday,
he said only that the anti-government forces of Afghanistan should
work together to restore peace.
   In addition to backing the insurgents, Pakistan and Iran also
shelter more than 5 million Afghan refugees.
   Shevardnadze is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit
Pakistan in more than 20 years. He initiated the trip himself, said
a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman on condition of anonymity.
The spokesman did not disclose the agenda.

<HEAD>New Preservative Can Aid Liver Transplants, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new preservative is keeping livers for
transplantation alive outside the body up to three times as long as
before and could significantly increase the number of successful
transplants, experts said Friday.
   Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh reported in
Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association that the
chilled mixture can preserve human livers outside the body for 24
hours.
   Dr. Satoru Todo, who headed a six-member research team at the
University of Pittsburgh, said that since the article was written,
the solution has been used to keep livers viable as long as 34
hours. The old time limit was about 9{ hours.
   Given the critical shortage of donor livers and their relatively
quick deterioration outside the body, the new solution could greatly
aid liver transplantation and increase the distances livers can be
transported to get the best match between donor organ and recipient,
experts said.
   The mixture, UW-lactobionate, has also been used to extend the
viability of pancreases from six hours to more than 24 hours, Dr.
James Southard, a University of Wisconsin biochemist who helped
develop the solution, said. It has proven as effective for kidneys
as the conventional method, capable of preserving the organ for 30
to 40 hours.
   Experimentation with preserving hearts still is limited to
animals. So far, dog hearts have been preserved for 12 hours,
compared to the conventional three to four hours, he said.
   ``It's badly needed in hearts,'' Southard said.
   Under the older preservation method, livers are chilled and
flushed with Euro-Collins solution, a mix of electrolytes and
glucose.
   The new solution, which includes hormones, amino acids and
sugars, is being tested on liver transplant patients in Pittsburgh,
Wisconsin and 20 to 30 other centers worldwide. An additional 100 or
so transplant centers are using it for kidneys and pancreases.
   UW-lactobionate has not been cleared by the Food and Drug
Administration for general use. Developers applied for FDA approval
last August, and approval could come at any time, Southard said.
   ``The remarkable effectiveness of the UW solution has
revolutionized liver transplantation at almost every level,'' Todo
wrote in the journal. ``The enhanced margin of safety has permitted
more effective use of organs that can be stored safely while waiting
for operating room facilities or personnel to become available.''
   In their study, Todo's group found that transplants of 185 livers
preserved with the new solution for up to 24 hours were more
successful than 180 livers preserved up to 9{ hours with the old
mixture. The researchers measured success by the need for another
transplant and the rate of clotting of the main artery leading to
the liver.
   Todo said the Wisconsin solution limits swelling in the
transplanted organ.
   One liver preserved with the Wisconsin solution, but not included
in the study, was shipped last fall from Toronto to Paris and
successfully transplanted, Southard said.
   ``It was the first inter-continental sharing of livers,'' he said.
   Another liver was shipped from the United States to Brazil.
   Since the solution was first used in August 1987 at the
University of Wisconsin, doctors there have used it to preserve
about 80 livers and 50 pancreases, according to Southard. As a
result, surgeons can now schedule liver transplants at 8 a.m. rather
than rush around in the middle of the night.
   ``If you do it at midnight after you've done a full day's work,
with the emergency crew rather than the nurses and
anaesthesiologists who should be there, it's not as safe for the
patient,'' Southard said.
   In Pittsburgh, about 600 livers have been transplanted after
being preserved in the mixture, Tudo said. Liver transplant surgeons
at both institutions have abandoned the more conventional
preservation method.

   A huge Soviet convoy rolled out of
Kabul in a snowstorm Friday, and Afghan and Soviet sources said no
more than 1,500 Red Army soldiers would remain in Afghanistan once
the convoy reached Soviet soil.
   The column of trucks and tanks began their 260-mile journey north
up the Salang Highway under cover of darkness, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 1,000 to 1,500 Soviet soldiers still in Kabul will guard the
city's airport during food airlifts that are to continue for at
least a week, the sources said.
   Under an accord sponsored by the United Nations to end the
Soviets' nine-year intervention in Afghanistan, the Red Army has
until Feb. 15 to withdraw.
   Guerrillas fighting the pro-Marxist government since 1978 are not
a party to the agreement and say they will take over when the
Soviets are gone.
   President Najib, however, said Thursday that his conscript army,
believed to number 140,000, was prepared to repel the insurgents.
   A United Nations human rights report issued Friday said the
Soviet Union and Afghan army had violated international law during
the withdrawal by sowing mines, many of them in civilian areas.
   U.N. workers who visited Afghanistan in June found Soviet mines
in agricultural areas, rivers and villages, and said the number of
explosives ranged from 5 million to 30 million, according to the
report to the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
   ``Mines designed to cause unnecessary suffering have been widely
dispersed throughout Afghanistan,'' the report said. ``This is a
clear violation of customary and conventional international law.''
   Many diplomats say the Afghan civil war will become a bloodbath
when the Soviets are gone, and most major Western countries,
including the United States, closed their embassies in Kabul this
week.
   Heavy snow Friday delayed the departure of British diplomats and
their staff, who were to leave on a chartered plane for India,
government officials in London said. There was no immediate word on
when they would leave.
   Soviet flags Friday were replaced with the red, green and black
flags of Afghanistan, and Afghan soldiers took over the Soviet
outposts along the Salang Highway.
   Afghan soldiers said the Soviet convoy snaked through the Salang
Pass and the mountains where guerrillas have pounded departing
contingents with artillery fire in recent days.
   The sources said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers
were in the latest convoy but that it took three hours for it to
depart.
   Early this week, Western and Soviet diplomats said about 15,000
Soviet soldiers remained.
   A Geneva-based U.N. office coordinating relief for Afghanistan
said Friday that it planned to airlift food and medicine to Kabul,
whose population has swollen to 2 million because of refugees
streaming into the city.
   U.N. officials in Geneva, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed an agreement in principle had been reached with Afghan
guerrillas not to shoot down incoming relief planes. In return, the
United Nations has pledged to send more relief supplies into regions
controlled by the guerrillas.
   Also on Friday, officials in neighboring Pakistan denied claims
by Kabul that Pakistani jet fighters shot down an Afghan passenger
plane.
   Official Radio Kabul, monitored in the Pakistan capital of
Islamabad Thursday night, said the plane was carrying food suppplies
from Kabul to Khost, 12 miles from the Pakistan border, when it
strayed off course Tuesday.
   It said Pakistan ignored the pilot's call for help and shot it
down, killing all five passengers and a crew of nine.
   Pakistani military spokesman Riaz Ullah said the Afghan plane
crashed inside Pakistani territory apparently after running out of
fuel during a possible attempt to defect.
   The United States and Pakistan back the guerrillas, who began
fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. The Soviet soldiers
entered the country in December 1979, and grew in number to an
estimated 115,000 by the time the pullout began May 15.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, will meet
with Pakistani leaders Saturday to discuss ways to end the civil war.

<HEAD>What, Brazil Worry? It's Time for Carnival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation is 1,000 percent,
corruption charges abound, hospitals are closed because staffs
haven't been paid.
   Does anyone worry?
   Next week during Lent, sure, but right now it's Carnival!
   Brazil's famous annual party runs from Saturday through Wednesday
and the nation's 140 million people, at least those in Rio, seem
determined as usual to set aside their woes for a few days.
   ``Carnival is a time of renewal. It is a balsam,'' said Trajano
Ribeiro, president of the municipal tourism board Riotur. ``Brazil
has serious problems, but that's no reason not to enjoy Carnival.''
   The Scala nightclub, site of some of the most raucous Carnival
balls, announce plans to stock a ton of filet mignon, 650 pounds of
shrimp, 210 cases of scotch and 2,600 gallons of draft beer.
   ``Brazilians are naturally happy people,'' said Roberto Coure,
president of Rio's Monte Libano Club, another center of Carnival
fun. ``Carnival emotion is a great phenomenon,''
   ``I just spent a month in England, and the people over there
looked sad,'' he said. ``And they don't have inflation.''
   Coure's main ballroom has a silver-and-gold Arabian Nights motif
this year.
   Major Carnival balls draw 6,000-10,000 people each and are
covered on live television. Among the best known are the Grande Gala
G for homosexuals and the Bum Bum Ball, featuring a competition of
paintings rendered on the fundaments of young women.
   Ribeiro said ``a special police protection system for
foreigners'' had been established because of increasing street crime
in Rio, and suggested visitors stay together in organized groups.
   ``It is not recommended for foreigners to go about on their
own,'' he said.
   Some Americans, West Germans, Italians, Israelis and Argentines
who arrived early got an unpleasant initiation when a band of
thieves armed with pistols and crowbars invaded their hotel on
Ipanema Beach.
   They shouted ``Happy Carnival!'' broke open guest safes in the
lobby, and made off with $190,000 worth of cash, traveler's checks,
credit cards, cameras and airline tickets.
   Rio's ``samba school'' parade _ held in two 15-hour sessions
Sunday and Monday nights _ is the undisputed highlight of Carnival.
   Each of the 18 ``schools,'' neighborhood clubs generally located
in poor districts where most residents are black, puts as many as
5,000 dancers in dazzling costumes on the six blocks of open-air
paradeway known as the Sambadrome.
   Schools compose their own melodies and lyrics each year. Each has
a theme for its constumes and floats and its own rhythm beaters who
drive the display with a powerful African-tropical beat on hundreds
of drums and other percussion instruments.
   Themes usually are about mystical kingdoms or events in Brazilian
history, but this year one's school's lyrics deal with the racism
many say still exists in this huge, racially diverse nation.
   One part, translated from Portuguese, goes: ``I'm black, yes.
Freedom and poetry. And in today's society, we are fighting for
equality.''
   A continuing controversy is whether the samba parade is being
taken away from ``the people'' for the benefit of entrepreneurs.
   Riotur charges foreigners the equivalent of $213 for the best
parade seats, but also returns $150,000 to each samba school to help
pay for costumes and floats. Ribeiro said this means ``ordinary
Brazilians can participate in Carnival.''
   In the other 51 weeks of the year, most of the dancers and
musicians are anonymous toilers for the government minimum wage
equal to about $2 a day.
   A newly formed ``Independent Samba School League'' has negotiated
for greater revenue from television and advertising rights for the
parade. Ribeiro said the league wants to turn Carnival into ``a
media event _ show biz.''
   The head of the samba league, a banker of the
illegal-but-tolerated numbers game called Capt. Guimaraes, told a
newspaper: ``The samba schools are the ones who provide the show.
The authorities want us to hold the cow's legs, while they take the
milk.''

   A committee created by Congress to develop
within 15 months a long-range plan for the federal court system's
future held its first meeting Friday, and its chairman warned
against ``ideological warfare.''
   ``The assignment is breathtaking ... a pioneering effort,'' said
chairman Joseph F. Weis Jr., a federal appeals judge from Pittsburgh.
   Weis said the committee would work toward issuing by April 1990 a
report recommending, among other things, what role federal courts
should play in the 21st century.
   He said the committee plans to conduct public hearings in Los
Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta within the next 45 days so
legal groups, civic organizations and anyone else interested may
suggest what topics should come under review.
   Weis said the committee, whose 15 members include officials from
each of the federal government's three branches, will study the
federal judiciary's structure, its relationship to state courts and
the types of cases it should be handling.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., told fellow committee members
they should avoid ideological discussions about the role of federal
courts so that their efforts are not perceived as
``court-stripping'' attempts.
   Past efforts in Congress to limit the purview of federal courts _
such as blocking Supreme Court review of all cases involving school
prayer or abortion _ have proved controversial.
   Weis agreed with Kastenmeier, saying, ``I didn't intend to get
into any ideological warfare.''
   Besides Weis and Kastenmeier, the committee's members are Sens.
Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Calif.; J. Vincent Aprile II, general counsel of the
Kentucky Department of Public Advocacy; Keith Callow, chief justice
of the Washington state Supreme Court; Edward Dennis Jr., a Justice
Department lawyer.
   Also federal trial judges Jose A. Cabranes of New Haven, Conn.,
and Judith Keep of San Diego, Calif; federal appellate judges Levin
H. Campbell of Boston and Richard A. Posner of Chicago; private
lawyers Morris Harrell of Dallas and Diana Gribbon Motz of
Baltimore; and Rex Lee, professor of law at Brigham Young University.

   Gen. Andres Rodriguez is a farmer's son
who found his niche in the military, rising to command its most
elite unit and ultimately overthrowing the Western Hemisphere's
longest-ruling leader.
   Rodriguez was second-in-command to President Alfredo Stroessner,
the military dictator and personal friend he ousted Friday.
   Rodriguez, who is believed to be 64, grew up in the town of San
Salvador, 250 miles east of the capital. He left his rustic
beginnings for a career in the military, and in 1961 was named
commander of the prestigious First Army Corps.
   Instead of the farm, his home is a plush mansion outside the
capital.
   The First Army Corps, one of three, is the biggest and best
equipped in the army, whose overall size numbers about 12,500.
   Rodriguez and Stroessner were friends as well as professional
colleagues. The two families became joined when Rodriguez's
daughter, Marta, married Stroessner's son, Alfredo.
   It was not clear why Rodriguez chose to unseat Stroessner or why
he acted when he did.
   When he struck, it was with great force. Rodriguez moved in on
the headquarters of the police and presidential guard with 40 to 50
tanks, plus mortars, cannons, recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns
and manpower.
   Diplomatic and political observers link the strike by Rodriguez,
a stocky man of medium height, with an order he received from
Stroessner to become defense minister, or at least step down as army
commander. Rodriguez refused.
   Opposition leader Domingo Laino speculated it was because the
general privately sided with the traditionalist wing of the ruling
Colorado Party, which has called for a transition to a more
democratic government and sought to distance itself from Stroessner.
   Rodriguez is well-known in the capital, but the first time many
Paraguayans heard of him was Friday morning when he said in his
clipped, commanding voice over the radio that Stroessner was under
arrest and he was ``taking command of the country from this moment.''

   Chinese artists held an exhibition Friday night to
raise money for the relatives of jailed dissidents, rekindle a
once-banned literary magazine and set up a foundation to publish
controversial political essays.
   The artists, who live in China and abroad, were once members of
the Star group, an underground art and political society that
flourished briefly during a period of relative political freedom 10
years ago.
   The exhibition was held in the apartment of a Western European
diplomat and attended mostly by foreigners and Chinese artists.
   At least nine of the 25 works of art were sold, raising about
$5,405 for the group, said Ren Wanding, a Chinese dissident who was
jailed from 1979 to 1983 for advocating multiparty democracy. All
the buyers were foreigners.
   Ren said some of the money will be used to help people whose
relatives were jailed for political reasons.
   Amnesty International says thousands of people are in jail in
China for their beliefs _ religious, political or otherwise.
   Wei Jingsheng, an electrician who was active in the 1979
Democracy Wall movement, and Xu Wenli, a leading figure in the
pro-democracy April 5 Forum, are two of the best known political
prisoners. Both were sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979 for
``counterrevolutionary activities.''
   Ren said some money also will go to the rebirth of Today
magazine, a periodical of experimental poetry and short stories that
was published underground from 1979 until it was banned in late 1980.
   During its time, the organizers of Today escaped jail terms
because the periodical was purely literary and avoided politics. Bei
Dao, a well-known poet, said the new magazine would follow the same
line.
   Ren said the remaining money will be used to start a foundation
to help political thinkers publish essays that cannot find a place
in the state-run press.
   China's publishing industry, including its newspapers and
magazines, are all under state control. State-published books and
magazines are censored for political material.
   Recently, the country has witnessed a flourishing of illegal
publishing houses. Most print pornography or translations of risque
novels from the West, and very few concentrate on politics or other
intellectual subjects.
   Over the past 18 months, China has allowed debate to flourish on
the economy and art, but talk about political reform has been scant.
   Several of the Star group's artists, who have since emigrated
from China, returned to Beijing for the exhibition.
   Wang Keping, one of China's most famous sculptors who lives in
France, said he came back to help his own friends.
   ``They wanted money, but we artists are poor,'' he said. ``So we
decided to give them some of our works to help them.''

<HEAD>Quiet Peace Initiative is Uncovered in Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News of a secret two-day meeting
at a West German hotel reveals that after years of baleful silence,
Northern Ireland politicians are talking again across the communal
divide.
   But the sudden glare of publicity threatens to push them back
into their trenches.
   For war-weary Northern Irelanders, the report that dominated
BBC-TV news Thursday night was electrifying: leading Catholic and
Protestant politicians had spent two days in a Duisburg hotel in
October working out a proposed formula for jointly governing the
British province under a form of autonomy known as ``devolved
government.''
   But by Friday, party leaders from all sides had poured cold water
on the notion, accusing the BBC of over-dramatizing its story.
   John Hume, who as leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party
is the province's top Catholic politician, called it nonsense.
   Ian Paisley, the hard-line Protestant leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party, and James Molyneaux, leader of the Official
Unionists, the larger, more moderate Protestant party, also denied
any negotiations had taken place on the form of Northern Ireland's
future government.
   The meeting was arranged by an unidentified German clergyman and
was attended by Paisley's deputy, Peter Robinson; Jack Allen of the
Official Unionists; Austin Currie of the mainly Catholic SDLP; and
Gordon Mawhinney, deputy leader of the Alliance, a small, strictly
non-sectarian party. It was followed up over the past four months by
talks in Northern Ireland.
   Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, was not
invited.
   Mawhinney insisted Friday that despite the pooh-poohing from
party leaders, progress was made.
   The mere act of talking was significant, he said in an interview,
because stalemate has prevailed ever since the signing of the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave Dublin a say in Northern Ireland's
affairs.
   Protestant politicians, who regard the agreement as a gross
foreign intrusion into the affairs of their 1 million followers,
have refused to negotiate with the SDLP unless the accord is shelved.
   The SDLP, having helped midwife the pact on behalf of the
600,000-strong Catholic minority, predictably rejects that condition.
   Thus for more than three years, Northern Ireland politics has
amounted to little more than a prolonged sulk, leaving the field
open to the IRA and its extremist Protestant counterparts. Since the
agreement was signed, 258 more lives have been lost.
   ``What was different about Duisburg in many respects was that the
parties agreed that instead of us all going home and putting our
feet up, we would see if there was any basis for moving forward,''
said Mawhinney.
   A basis was found, he said, in ``a form of words'' which the
participants felt they could present to their leaders for further
discussion.
   He said it entailed agreement on devolved government as the best
way forward and putting the Anglo-Irish Agreement aside for a fixed
period while negotiations continued at a higher level.
   Currie confirmed that he and the three other parties agreed that
``to facilitate dialogue,'' it was worth considering a suspension of
the main workings of the agreement _ the periodic meetings between
British and Irish ministers to discuss Ulster's affairs.
   The Anglo-Irish Agreement broke the Irish logjam by forcing the
Protestants to realize that they had lost their traditional veto
over any compromise with the Catholics.
   ``But it created another logjam downstream,'' said Mawhinney.
   A key question is whether the Irish and British governments,
which signed the agreement, are willing to see it put on ice. The
widely held assumption here is that they will go along with anything
that offers real prospects for peace.
   Another question is whether the publicity has killed the
initiative. Already, angry words have been exchanged among the
participants over who was to blame for the story getting out.
   ``The nature of Northern (Irish) politics is that progress can
only be made behind closed doors, and when it comes out into the
open people tend to scurry back to secure positions,'' said Peter
Barry, Ireland's former foreign minister who helped negotiate the
1985 agreement.
   Mawhinney said the Duisburg parley reflected ``a new realism''
among Northern Ireland politicians _ a willingness ``to look at the
other side of the equation, to say `yes, I recognize that you have a
problem, but you must recognize that I have a problem too, and how
can we overcome these problems?'''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle told
the Salvadoran government today that democracy, eocnomic growth and
respect for human rights ``go hand in hand'' as he pledged a
continuing relationship between the Bush administration and El
Salvador.
   In a toast during a luncheon for government officials at the home
of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, Quayle repeatedly mentioned
commitment to human rights as a guiding principle for democratic
government.
   Earlier today, Quayle was urged by Archbishop Arturo Rivera y
Damas, acting as a go-between for a peace proposal by
anti-government rebels, to consider the dissidents' point of view.
   Quayle said in his toast that under Duarte's five-year term El
Salvador's human rights record has improved but that ``there are
challenges yet to be met and hurdles that must be overcome.''
   ``And the anti-democratic forces of the extreme left and the
extreme right are ideologically exhausted and weakened,'' he said.
But, he added, ``they're still out there.''
   He assured the Salvadorans of the commitment of the United States
to a shared vision of a secure democratic future in El Salvador.
``This is a vision of democracy, economic growth and respect for
human rights. The three go hand in hand,'' Quayle said.
   He made the comments following morning meetings with
representatives of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party and the
rightist Republican National Alliance or ARENA, two of the parties
vying to win next month's presidential election.
   During his meeting with the archbishop, Quayle said he was in San
Salvador in the interest of helping Salvadorans move toward peace
and democracy, said David Beckwith, Quayle's press secretary.
   Strife-torn El Salvador relies heavily on U.S. aid of some $1.5
million per day.
   Flying to San Salvador from Caracas, Quayle was taken by
helicopter from the airport to a point near the residence of
Ambassador William Walker, which was surrounded by security
personnel. He then got into a motorcade where press vans were
equipped with one-inch-thick windows against possible attack.
   Quayle was expected to discuss with Duarte and other political
leaders a proposal in which the rebels offered for the first time to
participate in elections if certain conditions are agreed to.
   State Department officials view the proposal as significant
because it marks a departure from the rebels' demand for
power-sharing, but say a decision on whether to act on it is in the
hands of Duarte and his government.
   As part of their proposal, the rebels want the March 19 elections
postponed until September. While that would violate the
Constitution's election timetable, a State Department official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said outright rejection of the
plan could be used by U.S. opponents of aid to argue that Duarte's
government is not serious about seeking peace.
   ``It would present some obstacles'' to winning continued aid, the
official said.
   Quayle's talks Thursday with presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras
and Guatemala were among the 10 bilateral sessions he held during a
hectic visit to Caracas for the inauguration of Venezuela's new
president, Carlos Andres Perez.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, author of a regional peace
plan signed in August 1987 by the five Central American presidents,
said after meeting with Quayle that he was optimistic the Bush
administration would allow further regional diplomatic efforts to
proceed instead of moving to restock the Nicaraguan rebels with
weapons.
   ``Mr. Quayle told me they want to give us a chance,'' Arias said.
   Quayle told reporters there is now a ``hiatus'' with no U.S. move
to renew funding for the Contras battling Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   Although he contended that Nicaragua's record on civil liberties
has regressed since Congress cut off military aid to the Contras, he
said: ``We are going to give the diplomatic route a chance.''
   ``This is a testing period for us,'' to see if Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega is serious about holding free elections and
implementing democratic reforms he agreed to in the Arias plan.
   Asked how the Bush administration would differ from President
Reagan's hardline pro-Contra policies, Arias adviser Francisco
Aguilar-Urbina said Bush is more pragmatic and that Latins feel
positively about his presidency so far.
   Quayle criticized former President Jimmy Carter, who also
attended the Venezuelan inauguration, for meeting with Ortega on
Wednesday.
   ``Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads
of state we don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating
matters,'' Quayle said at a news conference.
   The U.S. government has refused to hold talks with Nicaragua.
   Carter said Ortega had shared with him and Perez a new peace
proposal regarding the Contras.
   Carter did not release details, and U.S. officials said they had
heard only general components of the Ortega proposal. They said it
dealt with resettlement of the Contras into Nicaragua once peace is
declared.
   Carter also talked at length with Cuban President Fidel Castro at
the inauguration ceremony.
   Arias met at length with Castro, asking his support for the
regional peace initiative. President Mario Soares of Portugal also
met with Castro shortly before Soares' meeting with Quayle Thursday
night.
   Quayle said he was pleased with his own meetings.
   ``You can feel the good chemistry,'' he said, adding that the
Latin leaders appeared to be ``positive'' about dealing with the
Bush administration.

   An army general today seized power from
President Alfredo Stroessner in a coup that ended the military
dictator's 34-year grip on power and reportedly left hundreds of
soldiers and civilians dead.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who was Stroessner's second-in-command and
whose daughter is married to Stroessner's son, said in a nationwide
radio address the commander-in-chief was under house arrest.
   Rodriguez later took the oath as provisional president, then
swore in a nine-member Cabinet that included seven civilians, one
active general and one retired general.
   A message read over national radio and reportedly signed by
Stroessner said the 76-year-old ruler resigned as president and army
commander.
   Sources said the coup occurred after Rodriguez was ordered to
resign.
   Stroessner, who was the Western Hemisphere's longest-ruling
leader, was given 12 hours to leave Paraguay and chose exile in
Chile, the Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas reported.
   In Santiago, Chile, Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz said
no asylum request for Stroessner had been received.
   About a dozen bodies of soldiers loyal to Stroessner lay outside
the headquarters of the presidential guard, and radio stations
reported by military and civilian casualties, but there was no
official death toll.
   Opposition leader Domingo Laino put the death toll at 250.
Benjamin Fernandez, of the Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas,
said ``there are reports of more than 100 dead'' but that the
figures were ``speculative.''
   The gray, colonial-style police headquarters was pockmarked with
bullet holes, its windows shattered. Armed soldiers manned
roadblocks in front of the nearby National Palace, which was not
damaged, and at checkpoints throughout the city of 900,000.
   Stroessner's arrest followed eight hours of gunfights and cannon
fire in the capital's streets between rebel soldiers backed by tanks
and mortars and forces loyal to Stroessner. Witnesses reported
seeing 40 to 50 tanks moving through the city streets late Thursday
when the uprising began.
   ``Order has been re-established, and with it all the human values
of our entire constitution will be respected,'' said Rodriguez, a
career army officer allied with a faction of the ruling Colorado
Party favoring democratic reforms.
   ``I communicate to you that Gen. Stroessner has surrendered and
finds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shown
all human rights, at a residence within the First Army Corps,'' he
said in the radio broadcast, speaking in a clipped, authoritarian
voice.
   Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that
Rodriguez, for unknown reasons, apparently was ordered to give up
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He
refused.
   The rebellion also followed a dispute within the Colorado Party
between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who
wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the aging dictator.
   Richard Alan White, a senior research fellow at the
liberal-leaning Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington, said
Rodriguez acted ``in order to prevent others, including Stroessner's
son, from seizing power as the aged and sickly dictator was losing
his grip.''
   White, who just returned from a trip to Paraguay, said
``Rodriguez's talk of democratization and human rights is merely a
camouflage for his intention to continue the Stroessner regimen.''
   Between cars with tires shot flat, several large bloodstains
dried in the oppressive heat of this tropical city.
   ``We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that people
had to die,'' said one woman in the capital. She said the shelling
and small arms fire forced her to spend Thursday night in a
restaurant.
   Radio Itapiru reported that 32 government officials, including
Stroessner's long-time private secretary Mario Abdo Benitez, were
arrested and being held at a naval base.
   A member of the 3,000-man presidential guard, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said ``there was practically no battle. They
didn't even ask us to surrender. They just opened fire and battered
down the gates with small tanks.''
   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the United States was
monitoring the situation. ``We don't like violence, of course, and
we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.''
   Stroessner was the absolute ruler of this landlocked South
American country since seizing power in a 1954 military coup that
ousted President Federico Chavez.
   Stroessner was army commander-in-chief, doled out political
favors and jobs to his allies, and labeled his opponents Marxist
subversives.
   Under Stroessner, Paraguay developed a record of providing refuge
to fugitive Nazis, ousted dictators, and drug traffickers. The list
includes Auschwitz death camp doctor Josef Mengele; the ousted
Nicaraguan dictator, Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle; and heroin
kingpin Joseph August Ricorde.
   A staunch U.S. ally, Stroessner was criticized for human rights
abuses by Washington, and in 1986 the Reagan administration labeled
his government a dictatorship. He has been in poor health since
prostate surgery five months ago.
   Radio reports quoted an infantry division commander, Brig. Gen.
Ismael Otazu, as saying the uprising was not ``insubordination but a
correction.''
   Col. Dionisio Cabello told March 1 radio he was the new air force
commander and pledged allegiance to Rodriguez, who is believed to be
64 years old.
   Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ Villarrica, San
Juan Bautista and Concepcion _ and an air force unit sided almost
immediately with the rebel soldiers, radio reports indicated.

   A suggestion from advice columnist Ann Landers may
have started a run on the red ribbon and paper doily market, say
organizers of a valentine drive for Veterans Administration hospital
patients.
   Nearly a quarter of a million cards _ many of them homemade _ had
been received by Thursday, said Pam Surges, a spokeswoman for the
Hines VA Hospital. Hines, in the western Chicago suburbs, is the
national clearing house for the card drive, which is part of the
Feb. 12-18 National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans.
   ``We have more than 200,000 cards and we still have more than a
week-and-a-half until Valentine's Day,'' Ms. Surges said in an
interview Thursday night. ``We've been told to expect about 1
million of them. They've been coming from every state in the union,
plus Puerto Rico. We've even had one from Taiwan.''
   ``The valentine drive was our idea, and when we told Ann Landers
about it she said, `Yes, this is great!''' Ms. Surges said. ``She
hopped on the idea right away, and the U.S. Postal Service gave us
their cooperation, too. They gave us a special add-on Zip Code so
the cards could be separated from the regular hospital mail.''
   Miss Landers urged her readers to send the valentines in her Jan.
24 column.

   A state senator has introduced a bill to
repeal a 1923 law that, if enforced, he says, would have caused the
arrest of almost every dancing teen-ager in the state at least since
the dawn of rock 'n' roll.
   The old ``blue law,'' among other things, requires that public
dancing places be brightly illuminated. It outlaws dances that are
``indecent'' and ``immoral'' or are ``characterized by immodest
motion of the body,'' and prohibits public dances from 1 a.m. to 6
a.m. and from 1 a.m. and noon on Sunday.
   ``What we've in effect been doing is practicing behavior that's
not legal,'' said Sen. Jerome Hughes, 59.
   It was Hughes' daughter, Maggie Towle, who brought the archaic
law to his attention. She's the associate administrator at the
Coffman Memorial Union on the University of Minnesota campus, where
officials have puzzled over, then ignored, the statute for years.
   ``I can tell you right now that the number of dances with bright
lights at Coffman is none,'' Towle said.
   Although Hughes confesses to dancing in rooms that were merely
``partially lit,'' his daughter doubts it could have gotten him into
too much trouble.
   ``My mom and dad dance a lot,'' Towle said. ``But they would've
never been arrested under that law.''

   A Bulgarian human rights activist of
Turkish extraction and her family were given 24 hours to leave their
country on Friday, a Bulgarian emigre reported.
   Zeneb Yusseinov, 31, is a leader of the Society of the Protection
of Human rights. Her husband, Yussuf Yusseinov, also is an activist
of the group that has been persecuted for months.
   The family was expected to go to Turkey, said Eduard Genov, an
exiled member of the society living in Los Angeles.
   Genov and other members of the group were earlier forced to
emigrate. They include Tseko Tsekov, who said in Vienna on Thursday
he was given a choice of emigration or renewed imprisonment.
   Tsekov said he had been badly beaten in a Bulgarian prison and
was planning to settle in the United States. He also said there are
380 political prisoners in Bulgaria, many of them living under
humiliating prison conditions.
   Bulgaria is among the 35 countries who adopted a key document on
greater civil freedoms at the Helsinki review conference in Vienna.

<HEAD>China Offered Alternative To Cheesy New York Pizza</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former New York law student said Friday he is
signing a contract to open a not entirely New York-style pizzeria in
the Chinese capital where customers can hold the cheese and instead
pile on the pork.
   ``Beijing residents should be able to afford to eat there four or
five times a month,'' said entrepreneur Richard Rosenzweig. ``I
think they will come No. 1 for the atmosphere, but No. 2 for the
food. Over time, they'll develop a taste for the food.''
   He said he plans to decorate the 600-seat restaurant, which will
also offer takeout service, with New York street signs and play
American pop music.
   The obstacles are formidable. Cheese is not part of the Chinese
diet, and many Chinese don't like it on first bite.
   However, they will be allowed to order cheese-less pizza with
tomato sauce, vegetables and pork, China's staple meat, Rosenzweig
said.
   ``We're not going to change the recipe of the pizza; it'll be
authentic, but when it comes to toppings, we'll take a lot of
Chinese input,'' Rosenzweig said. ``They may want sea-slug pizza.''
   The 26-year-old remembers craving pizza in vain when he was
studying law in Beijing in 1986.
   Foreigners now can buy local chefs' versions of pizza at several
Western-run hotels, but there is no restaurant selling mainly pizza
to Chinese.
   Rosenzweig said the company he founded, New York City Pizza
Corp., will sign a joint venture contract Saturday with the Beijing
Yanhai Development and Trade Corp., a subsidiary of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
   He said the Chinese are putting up $1.8 million, including the
site in central Beijing. His side will put up $1.2 million and train
the staff in the arcane craft of making thin-crust, New York-style
pizzas.
   Ground-breaking on the restaurant is scheduled for March 1, and
Rosenzweig said it will be open by May 1, 1990.
   About a mile away, managers at Beijing's first Western fast-food
restaurant, Kentucky Fried Chicken, have been licking their fingers
over the good business. They say they sell an average of 1,300
chickens a day, more than any other restaurant in the chain
worldwide.
   Rosenzweig said his pizza restaurant will be even larger.
   ``This has got to be the biggest pizza restaurant in the world.
Where else in the world would there be a need for such a big
restaurant?'' he asked.
   Beijing has 10 million residents.
   Rosenzweig said about $1.70 will buy a slice of pizza and glass
of soda.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on Friday the two economic
superpowers ``still face a difficult agenda,'' but he expressed hope
the partnership will grow stronger as Japan assumes a broader world
role.
   Baker bid Takeshita farewell at the end of the Japanese leader's
two-day visit with an elaborate State Department luncheon featuring
champagne toasts, pheasant and ice cream with mangoes. Takeshita met
with President Bush on Thursday.
   For his part, Takeshita pledged to cooperate with the United
States in tackling sensitive economic and security issues.
   ``Japan is determined to do its utmost to collaborate with the
United States, its strongest ally, for the peace and security of the
world,'' the prime minister said, in his toast.
   ``No problems are unsolvable as long as Japan and the United
States join in an effort to solve them,'' Takeshita said.
   At the lunch, the new secretary of state tried to praise
Takeshita's tax policies by turning Bush's ``No new taxes _ read my
lips'' slogan into Japanese. Baker's attempt drew appreciative
chuckles from the Japanese and Americans in the dining room.
   ``Our economies are still the largest in the free world and we
still face a difficult agenda,'' Baker said. ``We can work it out.
... Together we will forge a new and even stronger partnership.''
   ``It is indeed reassuring to know that his capable leadership
will guide Japan in assuming a larger role in world affairs,'' Baker
added.
   Takeshita was leaving Friday night for the West Coast and a
meeting there next week with former President Reagan.
   Earlier Friday, he paid a get-acquainted call on key leaders in
the Senate, where criticism has emerged over an $8 billion joint
U.S-Japanese project to build jet fighters using American F-16
technology.
   Takeshita met behind closed doors with Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and
other senators involved in trade and foreign affairs issues.
   A Senate aide said the touchy issues of trade and Japanese
financial support for its own defense did come up.
   There has been pressure on Capitol Hill for Japan to increase its
military budget, and unhappiness over the $50 billion-plus U.S.
trade deficit with Japan, the world's largest such imbalance.
   Before the meeting, a dozen senators wrote Bush expressing worry
about the jet fighter project.
   The letter, organized by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., asked Bush to resist pressure from the Japanese to
support the project, and to undertake a full review of it before
going forward.
   The project has been criticized by lawmakers as a giveaway of
U.S. technological expertise.
   Under the agreement, General Dynamics of the United States and
Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industry would join forces to build FSX jet
fighters.
   The Japanese government says it needs a final go-ahead from the
United States by March 31 to put money for the project into its
budget.

<TEXT>
   Officials from 22 African countries called
on the continent's nations Friday to do more to save the lives of
pregnant women, hundreds of thousands of whom die each year.
   More than 1,000 pregnant women die around the world each day from
complications during pregnancy or childbirth, or from illegal
abortions, according to a study by the United Nations Children's
Fund.
   The study was the focus of a five-day conference of
French-speaking African nations, which called the deaths the ``shame
of modern times.''
   ``What a woman loses life in giving life is as intolerable as it
is unjust,'' a conference declaration said.
   About 450 pregnant women per 100,000 die each year in
underdeveloped nations, including those in Africa, compared with 30
per 100,000 in the West.
   Health ministers, doctors and representatives of African women's
organizations were among the participants of the conference, which
ended Friday. The sponsors were UNICEF, the World Health
Organization and the World Bank.
   They said the conference was part of an effort to get Third World
countries to devote more time and resources to saving the lives of
pregnant women.
   A similar conference was held two years ago in Nairobi, Kenya,
for English-speaking African nations.
   Participants said Africa should try to reduce the number of women
dying in childbirth by 50 percent in the next 25 years.
   According to U.N. studies, African women furnish 80 percent of
the food their families eat.
   They gather firewood, carry water, plant gardens, prepare food,
care for animals and look after children and the elderly. The women
work at least 12 to 16 hours a day and experts on Third World
development say they hold the key to helping nations struggling out
of poverty.
   Yet African women also are the most vulnerable members of their
society, said Edward Jaycox, World Bank vice president for Africa.
   ``When food is in short supply, she is the one who goes without,
when there is no doctor, she is the one who must deal with the risks
associated with frequent pregnancies,'' he told the conference.
   At least 63 percent of pregnant women in Africa suffer from
anemia and vitamin deficiencies that affect the health of their
infant, according to a UNICEF report. More than 45 percent of the
women deliver their children without medical help or midwives, the
report said.
   Throughout Africa, women also marry young and often have their
first child before age 15.
   ``The major problem in Africa today is preventing children from
having children,'' said Dr. Frederick Sai, the World Bank's
population specialist. ``And women of 45 or 50 who are having their
eighth or ninth child are dying from it.''

<TEXT>
   Just two months after visiting the United States
for the first time, Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov is
planning a return trip, this time with his wife, Yelena Bonner,
according to friends and family.
   The Sakharovs are to fly from Moscow to Rome next week. After
five days in Italy, they plan to visit Canada and then fly to Boston
to see Mrs. Bonner's children.
   Mrs. Bonner's daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich of Newton, said
Friday the dates are still uncertain.
   Although both Sakharov and Bonner have visited the United States
before, this will be their first trip together.
   Sakharov, 67, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his defense
of human rights. After speaking out against the Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan in 1979, he was exiled to the closed industrial city
of Gorky.
   Mrs. Bonner was banished there as well in 1984, and the couple
remained in Gorky until Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev personally
called them back to Moscow in December 1986.
   Although Sakharov generally has supported Gorbachev's
perestroika, or political and economic restructuring, he has
continued to express concern about political prisoners, the
treatment of various ethnic groups and the steady accumulation of
power in Gorbachev's hands.
   He received permission to visit the West last year. During the
trip, Nov. 4 to Dec. 8, Sakharov underwent a heart examination, met
President Reagan in Washington and visited New York.
   Mrs. Bonner came to Boston in January 1986 for cardiac bypass
surgery. While in the area, she and Sakharov have stayed with her
daughter.
   In addition, they have visited with her son and daughter-in-law,
Alexei and Liza Semyonov, and their children. The Semyonovs live in
suburban Westwood.

<HEAD>Court OKs EPA Agreements with Pesticide Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld the
authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to make agreements
with pesticide manufacturers permitting inventories to be used up
after federal pesticide licenses are cancelled.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer had enjoined EPA from
permitting Velsicol Inc., the only manufacturer of chlordane and the
related chemical heptachlor, from selling the chemicals under an
agreement that included cancellation of the company's license.
   That September 1987, agreement provided that no more chlordane or
heptachlor could be sold by Velsicol after April 15, 1988. EPA was
concerned, however, that it might not be able to win agreements to
end the use of other pesticides if Oberdorfer's decision stood.
   The chemicals have been used to drive termites away from the
foundations of houses. EPA believes the pesticides pose a high risk
of cancer to people living in homes treated that way.
   Oberdorfer held that EPA must examine the risks and benefits of
using up existing stocks. EPA maintained that it was not required to
make such an examination because it was clear the agreement with
Velsicol would result in a ``dramatic reduction'' in use, and less
risk to the public, than any other course of action.
   The agency said it could not justify an emergency ban stopping
all use immediately, and in any lesser proceeding to end use the
manufacturer could continue to produce and sell the chemical,
meaning that more would be introduced into the environment than
would be the case if inventories were used up under the agreement.
   At the time of the agreement, inventories were estimated at
110,000 pounds, about a two months' supply.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Funeral of Pro-Solidarity Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 Roman Catholic clergymen led
thousands of mourners Friday in a funeral for a pro-Solidarity
priest killed in a fire, and the union called for an independent
inquiry into his death and that of another priest.
   The Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec, 31, was buried in a small square
near the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Bialystok, a provincial
capital about 120 miles northeast of Warsaw. The city was home to
Suchowolec.
   The service was celebrated by Bialystok Bishop Edward Kisiel with
assistance of 162 priests, according to the Rev. Jozef Koszewnik.
   Koszewnik estimated that more than 10,000 people gathered for the
service. He said many carried banners from different chapters of the
banned trade union Solidarity and the banned Independent Students'
Association.
   ``We are parting with a great spokesman of Solidarity _ a man who
was always closely linked to the working class and to those who
struggle for human dignity,'' he quoted Kisiel as saying.
   Kisiel and Cezary Potocki, chancellor of the church's Bialystok
Curia, acknowledged the death caused great concern among Polish
Catholics.
   ``We hope that the concern will disappear when all the
circumstances are cleared up,'' Koszewnik quoted Potocki as saying.
   A fire caused by an electric stove Monday unleashed a cloud of
smoke that claimed the life of Suchowolec, the second priest killed
within 10 days. The Rev. Stefan Niedzielak of Warsaw, a Solidarity
sympathizer who maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the Soviet
Union in World War II, died of a broken neck Jan. 21.
   The results of a prosecutor's investigation into what caused the
stove fire have not been made public. Another investigation into the
death of Niedzielak has not been finished.
   In a statement Friday, the Warsaw regional chapter of Solidarity
expressed sorrow for the deaths and demanded that independent
representatives be allowed to take part in the investigations. It
said the results should be made public.
   Suchowolec actively supported Solidarity and organized
pilgrimages to the Warsaw gravesite of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a
popular pro-Solidarity priest murdered by security police in 1984.
   The young priest was buried next to a cross dedicated to
Popieluszko that Suchowolec had erected when he began to serve in
the parish 2{ years ago, Koszewnik said.
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity member, brought a wreath and
represented the union at the funeral.
   ``That man meant a lot to us,'' said his wife, Zofia, who also
monitors human rights for Solidarity. She said Suchowolec had
informed them that he was assaulted and that his car had been
tampered with at least twice. He also said his parents' apartment
was burned.
   The United States urged the Polish government earlier this week
to conduct a ``thorough and rapid'' investigation into the two
deaths.
   The Polish government has said it had no evidence the deaths were
politically motivated killings.

   Aerospace executive Ed Greer has resurfaced
seven years after abandoning his wife, two sons and the corporate
life to become the vagabond beach bum his yuppie colleagues
fantasized about.
   ``Anyone with any attachment to the human race couldn't do what
he did,'' said the wife he left behind. ``I will never forgive him
for what he did to the boys.''
   Although Greer was on the fast track at Hughes Aircraft in El
Segundo, the young executive hated the white-collar, pinstripe
world. On Sept. 10, 1981, he left without a word.
   ``I felt trapped. I didn't like my life,'' Greer said Friday from
Houston in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``It's
something that is hard for me to imagine, even now, leaving and
walking away from it all.
   ``This wasn't planned and certainly wasn't rational.''
   Before he disappeared, he told a co-worker: ``Never become too
good at something you hate. They'll make you do it the rest of your
life.''
   The Greed. As for the pretty girls,
``Unfortunately, about the time you get to know them, they've gone
back to Muncie.''
   He got Hearn's name, Social Security number and resume by placing
a newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered.
   He said he filled in FBI agents on those details when they caught
him. Under an agreement with the government, he must stay out of
trouble for a year or face charges in the case.
   Now, to an extent, he must face the past.
   The woman he left behind, Kit Clark, is remarried and living
somewhere in northern California after divorcing Greer in absentia,
the Times said. She told him he could contact his sons, now 9 and 16.
   In addition to being fed-up with struggling up the corporate
ladder, Greer said he left because there were pressures from his
wife and from his father, whose offer of $100,000 for information
about Greer's whereabouts set private investigators scurrying across
the country.
   Asked if he ever came close to calling his kids, Greer said,
``Yes, many times.''
   ``I just tried not to think about it,'' he said, adding he has
written his sons but hasn't talked to them or received a response.
   Is he happy with his new life? ``I'm certainly not satisfied. I'm
happy now with the work I'm doing, but I wouldn't recommend doing
this (disappearing) to anyone else.''
   After he left, his former colleagues, some of whom said they
wished they had the courage to do the same, began throwing annual
parties, often showing up at them wearing Ed Greer masks. Greer, now
40, said he wasn't aware of the celebrations, which attracted
national media attention. If there's another, he won't make an
appearance.
   As for his former co-workers, reactions include both relief and
disappointment.
   ``I'm glad he's OK,'' said Sherry McCullough, Greer's former
secretary who spoke with him by telephone on Thursday. ``But it is
kind of disappointing that the mystery is gone. I'm not sure we can
have any more parties unless we invite him. I'm not sure he would
want to come.''

   Here are a few facts and figures on Paraguay:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND _ A landlocked, semitropical country in the heart of South
America, Paraguay is bounded on the northwest by Bolivia, northeast
and east by Brazil and the southeast, south and southwest by
Argentina. It is roughly the size of California. The capital is
Asuncion, where one-fourth of the residents live. The country is
split into the Oriental and Occidental provinces and is bisected by
the Paraguay River.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ The population of 3.8 million is mostly a mix of Spanish
and Guarani Indian, with pockets of immigrants from Germany and the
Far East. Ninety percent of the people speak Guarani, but Spanish is
the official language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT _ Gen. Andres Rodriguez was sworn in as provisional
president on Friday, hours after toppling President Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner. Stroessner engineered a 1954 military coup and was
elected later that year. The 76-year-old ruler won re-election seven
times, but charges of vote fraud marred the balloting. The next
election was planned for 1993. Armed forces members and civil
servants, including teachers, are required to be card-carrying
members of the governing Colorado Party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Gained independence from Spain in May 1811 and ruled by
a succession of dictators. During the war with Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay from 1865-70, the population was drastically reduced from
600,000 to 232,000. Further losses were heavy in the 1932-35 Chaco
War with Bolivia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Main exports are cotton, meat and meat products,
soybeans and lumber. Searches for oil in the remote Chaco region to
the north and west have been unsuccessful. Smuggling is an important
portion of the underground economy and it has abundant hydroelectric
resources.

   Hundreds of Buddhist monks in Tibet paid last
respects to the Panchen Lama on Friday, with ancient chants and
prayers for reincarnation of the man who served as Tibet's top
religious leader in China.
   About 800 monks lined up in the early morning outside the Panchen
Lama's official residence in Xigaze, Tibet's second-largest city,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency. They filed by to view
the body of the government loyalist and presented white silk scarves
as a sign of respect.
   Other monks chanted ancient scriptures praising the Panchen Lama
and prayed for his early reincarnation, and tens of thousands of
faithful paid homage to a photograph of the Panchen Lama in an
adjoining hall.
   The Panchen Lama, who died of a heart attack Jan. 28 in Xigaze,
was revered as a reincarnation of the Buddhist god Amitabha. He
served as the main Tibetan spokesman for the Chinese government.
   Xinhua said his body would be preserved by being ``treated with
precious medicines and bound with fine silks and satins, which will
be changed regularly.'' It said ``golden powder'' will be painted on
his face.
   The body will then be placed in a special shrine to be built in
his honor at Xigaze's Tashi Lump Monastery, his religious seat.
   His predecessors also were preserved, but their funeral shrines
were destroyed and their bodies dismembered by leftists during
China's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   A memorial service for the Panchen Lama also was held in Tibet's
capital of Lhasa, Xinhua said. It said hundreds of monks, nuns and
local government attended.
   Tibet's Communist Party secretary, Hu Jintao, praised the Panchen
Lama for playing ``an enormous and incomparable role'' in putting
into effect party policies and managing Tibet's temples and
monasteries ``under a socialist mantle.''
   Xinhua also quoted Hu as urging Tibetans to honor the Panchen
Lama's appeals and ``strive for a united, prosperous and culturally
advanced new Tibet.''
   The Panchen Lama, who ranked second in Tibetan Buddhism after the
Dalai Lama, consistently supported Chinese rule in Tibet.
   By contrast, the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after an
abortive Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, has harshly
criticized Chinese repression and demanded freedom for his people.
The Chinese communists occupied the fabled mountain land in 1950 as
they consolidated national control after their revolution.
   The Panchen Lama, who was educated by communists from age 11,
criticized separatists without mentioning the Dalai Lama by name. He
denounced monks and lay Tibetans who held repeated anti-Chinese
protests in Lhasa over the past year and a half. Three of those
protests ended in violent clashes.
   However, the Panchen Lama spoke out against harsh treatment of
Tibetans and urged the government to promote Tibetans with talent,
``not simply lackeys.''
   The official media has given heavy coverage to his death,
recalling his support for Chinese rule in Tibet.
   Officials have refused to disclose funeral plans. It was not
clear if Friday's ceremonies in Tibet were meant to serve that
purpose.
   A ceremony is again likely when the body is placed in his shrine,
which will take months to build.

<HEAD>Groups Urge More Public Review of Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two consumer watchdog groups said Friday the
Agriculture Department should allow more public review of a proposal
to overhaul federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants.
   The Government Accountability Project and the Community Nutrition
Institute said in a statement filed with USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service that the changes should have an adequate
scientific basis and that ``swift and meaningful penalties'' should
be imposed on processors who violate the rules.
   USDA issued the proposal last November to carry out a 1986 law
that would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome
processing plants but ease up on those with good records.
   The agency estimated that over time its inspection force would be
reduced by half by retirements and resignations. The program would
rely increasingly on ``good'' plants policing themselves.
   But the two organizations said the proposed rules fail meet the
1986 law's requirements and are ``unacceptably general and vague to
the point where they only propose a structure for relaxing
inspection, but not intensifying it where needed.''
   Also, they charged, the agency's own evaluation of pilot projects
using the proposed system showed serious deficiencies.
   ``The regulations were developed and drafted with no consultation
with consumer or other public interest groups or inspectors'' the
statement said.
   As proposed, the new rule would apply to plants that make
frankfurters, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores of
other processed items that include meat and poultry. The proposed
rule would not apply to slaughter plants, which would remain under
continuous federal inspection.

   After four days of questioning prospective
jurors, the judge and lawyers in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
are learning that even in this news hub there are people who don't
give a darn about what's happening.
   By the end of Friday's session, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell had declared 24 women and eight men ignorant enough of
North's 1987 congressional testimony to earn them a shot at being on
the jury. Twenty didn't pass that muster.
   Gesell had wanted a panel of 50 from which the jury of 12 and six
alternates will be chosen, maybe next week. But Friday, he reduced
that target to 45. The panel will consist only of those who persuade
the judge and lawyers they did not watch North on television, hear
him on the radio or read about him in newspapers and magazines.
   ``Have you heard of Colonel North?'' Gesell asked a nurse's
assistant. ``No,'' she said.
   ``Have you read of Colonel North?'' he asked.
   She said, no, she only read her horoscope.
   ``Does `the Iran-Contra matter' carry any meaning for you?''
   No, she said.
   But Gesell dismissed the woman when she said she could not find
the defendant guilty because ``I wasn't there.''
   A supervisor of banquet cleanup at a posh White House-area hotel
said ``I'm the type of person who, once the news comes on, I switch
it off.'' And when she was asked if she heard North testify on
television, she said, ``with due respect to Colonel North, I found
the conversation boring and walked away.''
   To that, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan responded: ``He doesn't
mind at all.''
   North, at the defense table, smiled.
   Those chosen Friday included a woman who said she doesn't pay
attention to news because it is ``depressing.''
   ``I don't like the news,'' she said. And when her mother, who
does, turns it on, she said, ``I go to my room and lock my door.''
   Sullivan pressed her for her recollections of the six days in
which North testified before the Iran-Contra investigative
committees. At those joint hearings in the summer of 1987, the
former Marine lieutenant colonel detailed many of the activities
that are now charged to him as crimes.
   ``He was on TV all day long, on all morning, all afternoon and
rerun at night,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It made me mad, he was on all the channels,'' the woman said.
``I did not look at it at all. ... My mother probably did. I call
her the `news media,''' she said.
   One woman who publishes newsletters and the like said she was
trying to get her business going at that time and ``by the time the
day was over and the news came on I was out walking my dog.''
   But she did know that North had a blonde secretary, Fawn Hall, a
boss named (John) Poindexter, that he was a God-fearing man and that
he had something to do with money and arms on an international scale.
   ``I know people either are for him or against him,'' said the
woman whose office is on Capitol Hill. She was excused.
   A female military personnel clerk at the Pentagon qualified after
testifying ``I hate bad news.'' A legal secretary in the Federal
Trade Commission didn't qualify because she saw the first few
minutes of North's testimony before changing the channel.

<HEAD>Rupert Murdoch Takes Plunge In English Channels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Satellite television beams its way to Britain on
Sunday with much fanfare but few viewers.
   When media magnate Rupert Murdoch launches his four-channel Sky
Television network, the number of channels available to most Britons
will instantly double.
   But the equipment needed to receive the satellite signals in
British homes is in short supply and will be for several more weeks,
if not months.
   Only 5,000 to 20,000 homes will be equipped to tune in on Sunday,
giving just a fraction of the 56 million Britons a chance to watch
the 6 p.m. premiere.
   Watching television is Britain's most popular leisure activity,
even with only four regular channels: two commercial and two run by
the state-funded British Broadcasting Corp.
   Direct satellite-to-home television has been hailed as a
revolution in British broadcasting, and the beginning of a new
skirmish between Britain's two biggest newspaper publishers, who
both are trying to crack the satellite market.
   ``Time Out,'' the weekly guide to what's happening in London, has
billed it ``the biggest aerial dogfight since the Battle of
Britain'' and ``a no-holds barred Star Wars.''
   Critics, praising the high-quality shows now produced in Britain,
already have turned up their noses at Murdoch's programming, which
will rely heavily on imported American soap operas, situation
comedies and game shows.
   Michael Grade, chief executive of the highbrow commercial Channel
4, called it ``junk, fast-food takeaway telly.''
   Sky Television will be vying with a consortium involving rival
publisher Robert Maxwell, and a third international consortium,
British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).
   Murdoch has managed to get Sky on the air seven months before
BSB's target date.
   He's using the Astra satellite, owned by a Luxembourg-based group
and put into orbit in December.
   BSB was awarded three of the five channels on another satellite
under international treaty. That satellite isn't scheduled to be
launched until August and programming is not expected until
September.
   Maxwell's two channels, Screen Sport and Lifestyle, also will be
bounced off the Astra satellite as soon as contractual snags are
ironed out, said spokesman Chris Howland. Maxwell's two channels and
one of Murdoch's now are available only to British cable subscribers.
   Cable subscribers have more channels than the regular four, but
very fewer Britons have cable. It is available in only three of
London's 32 boroughs, plus a handful of other cities. The Cable
Television Association says there are 265,645 subscribers.
   Sky Television and BSB will use incompatible technologies, so
those wanting to subscribe to both must buy two receiving dishes and
descramblers.
   Sky Television says it hopes its head start will persuade
television fans to buy its technology.
   All four Sky Television channels _ news, movies, light
entertainment and sports _ will initially be offered free.
   This summer, just before the BSB launch, Sky Television will add
the Disney Channel and an arts channel which, along with the movie
channel, will arrive scrambled. For a monthly subscription fee,
viewers will then receive a small credit card to plug into a
receiving box and decode the signal.
   Eurosport will kick off Sunday with Davis Cup tennis; Sky Channel
_ the light entertainment channel now available on cable _ with a
30-minute documentary on the birth of Sky Television; and Sky Movies
with ``Project X.''
   Sky News, Britain's first 24-hour news station, will premiere
with a newscast. The station will be heavily peppered with American
accents, receiving ``NBC Today'' 30 minutes after its broadcast in
New York, and ``NBC Nightly News'' simultaneously. It will also have
access to material from CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' and ``57th Street.''

<HEAD>Judge Blasts Contra Conspiracy Suit, Awards Defendants $1 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday criticized a
guns-for-drugs conspiracy lawsuit against Contra and ex-CIA figures,
calling it an abuse of the legal system and awarding the defendants
$1 million in fees and costs.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King last June threw out
the $24 million lawsuit filed by the Christic Institute on behalf of
journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey.
   On Friday, King issued a follow-up ruling requiring the
plaintiffs to pay the defendants $955,000 in attorney fees plus
$79,500 in court costs.
   Some of the 29 defendants _ who include Contra rebel leader
Adolfo Calero, ex-CIA deputy chief of operations Theodore Shackley,
Iran-Contra figures Albert Hakim and Richard Secord, conservative
activist former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub and others _ promised
action against the liberal, Washington-based Christic Institute.
   ``This is the signal to begin the counterattack,'' Singlaub said
of King's action. ``I think this will put a damper on this kind of
courthouse terrorism against those who are fighting against the
radical left.''
   Singlaub said his attorneys would act quickly against the
Christics to seize any assets to fulfill the judgment.
   Avirgan and Honey filed the suit in May 1986, before many of the
revelations about the Iran-Contra affair. It grew from a 1984
bombing in Nicaragua apparently aimed at Contra leader Eden Pastora.
He escaped, but Avirgan was injured and eight people, including
three journalists, were killed.
   The suit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing, as
well as working with drug traffickers in a 30-year right-wing
conspiracy that included anti-communist activities in Southeast
Asia, Central America and other locations.
   In Washington, Shackley said he will ``try to keep the spotlight
of public scrutiny'' on the group and intends to continue his
campaign to drive the Christics out of business.
   The Christic Institute bitterly criticized the ruling by King,
noting that their appeal of his decision last June was still before
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. They also are
appealing Friday's ruling, seeking an immediate stay.
   ``Judge King's decision was a legal disgrace,'' said Christic
attorney Daniel Sheehan, who assembled much of the case. ``His
ruling will only strengthen our position in the appeals court that
Judge King is committing a consistent pattern of legal error.''
   Sheehan noted that while King criticized the suit as having no
legal merit, three of the defendants _ Hakim, Secord and Civilian
Materiel Assistance head Thomas Posey _ are under federal indictment
on related charges. Another defendant, John Hull, has been arrested
by Costa Rican authorities on drug- and gun-running charges.
   ``The Christic Institute's allegations ... were based on
unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified sources with
no first-hand knowledge,'' King said in the ruling.
   Theodore Klein, an attorney for three of the defendants, said the
case could now be ``consigned to the oblivion it richly deserves.''
   Asked what he planned to do with his share of the money, Klein
joked: ``Buy guns for the Contras.''

   Todd Bridges, a star of the ``Diff'rent
Strokes'' television show, was held for investigation of attempted
murder Friday, just days after a drug possession arrest.
   Bridges, 23, and Harvey Duckett, 30, were arrested late Thursday
at a residence a block from a vacant house linked to narcotics
activity where Kenneth Clay was shot five times and stabbed, said
Sgt. Doug Tantee.
   Clay was in critical but stable condition at Martin Luther King
Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Police had no other details about the
victim, including his age or residence.
   Duckett was also held for investigation of attempted murder.
   Police said Bridges was arrested at the same vacant house Jan. 25
for investigation of possession of cocaine. Deputy District Attorney
Richard Weber said that case was rejected but the file was not
immediately available to determine why.
   Bridges, best known for his role as Gary Coleman's older brother
on NBC's ``Diff'rent Strokes'' from 1978 to 1985, has had several
brushes with the law, including a no-contest plea to making a bomb
threat several years ago.
   Clay told police he confronted Bridges and Duckett late Thursday
in the vacant house after an unidentified person told him someone
was breaking in.
   An argument ensued and Bridges allegedly pulled a gun and shot
Clay five times, and Duckett allegedly slashed Clay with the knife,
Tantee said.
   After Bridges and Duckett were taken into custody, a .22-caliber
handgun and a shotgun were seized shortly afterward at the arrest
site, Tantee said.
   Tantee said police reports note that the house where Clay was
shot was the site of ``numerous calls over the past few weeks
regarding narcotics.''
   In 1983 Bridges paid a $240 fine after being arrested for
carrying a concealed firearm.
   He received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after pleading
no contest to a charge of making a bomb threat that stemmed from the
bombing of an auto customizer's car during a dispute over work on
the actor's Porsche.
   Bridges also appeared in court in January 1988 to answer a
reckless driving complaint in which police said he was driving about
80 mph in a 35-mph zone in San Fernando.

   Carnegie Mellon University students pelted
administrators with marshmallows Friday to protest the cancellation
of the 1989 Beaux Arts Ball over concerns about drinking by minors.
   ``We're getting a lot of fluff from them so they are getting it
back,'' said Norm Larson, a fine arts student who helped organize
the protest.
   The ball, scheduled March 11, has been held every four years for
the past 80 years, students said. Students and alumni dress in
elaborate costumes and drink and revel all night.
   The ball ``has a history of being a pull-out-the-stops party that
starts at 9 p.m. and last all night,'' said Braden L. Walter, dean
of student affairs.
   The Fine Arts Building sustained $50,000 in damage during the
1985 ball, he said.
   Walter said he canceled the ball because none of the student
organizers could assure him that minors would not be allowed to
drink alcohol and that university property would not be damaged.
   Word reached students Thursday, and about 70 of them stood in a
cold rain Friday morning outside the administration building,
carrying signs and throwing marshmallows at administrators as they
entered.

   Balmy southern breezes gave way Friday to
frigid north wind, but raucous Mardi Gras revelry continued building
to a fever pitch, including preparations for the nearly nude French
Quarter fashion show.
   With Mardi Gras less than five days away, maskers made ready to
roll on the elaborate floats of 40 metropolitan parades.
   Assistant Police Chief Ray Holman said the freezing temperatures
predicted for the weekend were unlikely to stop the fun.
   ``Snow, sleet, ice, or 80 mile an hour winds. Those are the only
things that would stop a parade,'' said Holman. ``Cold weather
doesn't dampen many spirits, but it may cause people to drink more
of them.''
   Each year on Mardi Gras, Wood Enterprises sponsors ``The Bourbon
Street Awards,'' a costume contest in which many of the participants
are male cross-dressers _ or undressers.
   Kenneth French of Wood Enterprises said hundreds of people turn
out each year in everything from elaborate creations of beads and
feathers to barely legal outfits. Thousands more are there to watch
and he doesn't expect this year to be any different, in spite of the
weather.
   ``People work all year on their costumes. They aren't about to
cover it up or not wear it just because it gets cold,'' he said.
   Holman agreed that the chill probably won't do much to tone down
the French Quarter celebration or cover up the celebrants.
   ``Mardi Gras day even if it's 30 degrees as predicted, you'll see
people, not nude, but pretty close to it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Top House Democrats, leading
their members to a weekend retreat at the luxurious Greenbrier
resort, tried to put the onus on the Senate Friday as they faced
heat over Speaker Jim Wright's plan to let a 51 percent
congressional pay raise take effect, at least temporarily, next week.
   But many lawmakers doubted Wright's gambit _ letting the raise
automatically go through and then having the House vote to cut it
back to 30 percent _ would end public demand for rescinding the
entire $45,500 pay increase.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, the House majority whip, told reporters the
Senate's 95-5 vote Thursday to reject the pay raise was an easy one
that left the difficult decision to the House.
   ``We intend to send that (30 percent increase) over to the
Senate, those folks over there who are very strong willed, and we'll
stand up and see what they do and see if they're interested in a 50
percent increase or not,'' he said.
   ``We're taking the heat and they're not,'' he said, defending the
need for a pay increase or some sort.
   The chairman of the House Democratic organization, Rep. William
H. Gray III, D-Pa., said the Senate was ``wanting it both ways _
keeping honoraria and after-hours (earnings) while appearing to be
pure on the pay raise.''
   The pay raise, which would increase rank-and-file congressional
salaries from $89,500 to $135,000, takes effect Wednesday unless the
House joins the Senate before then in voting to kill it.
   In Washington, meanwhile, a group of Republicans were planning to
force a House vote Monday on the pay raise.
   The group planned to offer a resolution calling on Wright to hold
a vote on the pay raise before it goes into effect. The draft
resolution asserted that ``the dignity of the House of
Representatives is being sullied from coast to coast'' because of
Wright's failure to schedule a vote.
   If the leadership declines to allow an immediate vote on the
resolution, proponents would call for a vote to override the ruling
and seek to construe that vote, which could be forced without
majority approval, as a test vote on the pay increase, according to
GOP aides.
   The move is being led by Reps. Robert Smith, R-N.H., and William
Dannemeyer, R-Calif.
   On the train ride here, Coelho and other Democratic leaders and
aides worked to explain Wright's decision, which blocks a vote
before the raise takes effect. Many of the 142 House Democrats,
accompanied by their families to the resort, wondered aloud whether
the speaker's strategy, which could keep the pay fight going for
weeks or months, was wise.
   ``The opponents of the pay raise will try a repeal every two
weeks until Christmas eve,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   ``I have never received such vicious mail,'' said Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M. He said constituents were promising to vote
against him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections.
   Richardson said he understood Wright's position, but said ``it
will not help because 30 percent and 50 percent are still viewed as
excessive and the public doesn't understand honorariums.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who has been working with the
bipartisan House leadership on the pay issue and a companion measure
to ban members from taking speaking fees or other honoraria,
declined to criticize the speaker's plan but said he doubted it
would defuse the situation.
   The issue caters to ``trash television and talk radio. If they
had their way, this wuld go on for months,'' he said. ``It could
become a far more dominant issue than it has been already,'' he said.
   Williams said he thought Wright's plan would still be seen as a
way to protect a raise while the public wanted none. ``And the 50
percent will be repealed,'' he predicted.
   The lawmakers were reminded of the public outcry at the outset of
their trip, as their buses arrived at the side door of Union Station
to avoid a protest. And along the way, a prominent trackside sign
read: ``Spike the Pay Hike.''
   Privately, members also worried that Wright's strategy would not
only fail to net them a pay raise, but cost them their income from
honoria as well. The ban on accepting those fees would go into
effect immediately in the House, and if the pay raise were rolled
back it would be politically embarassing to then repeal the
honoraria ban.
   Speaker Wright, D-Texas, and the House's second-ranked Democrat,
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., were not on the train
because of a White House meeting Friday morning. They were flying to
the resort later Friday to join their colleagues for the weekend.

<TEXT>
   Jim Moody, who portrayed a teacher at the High
School of Performing Arts in the 1980 movie ``Fame,'' lost and then
regained his real-life job as a drama teacher at the school for
aspiring actors and dancers.
   Moody, who also acts professionally and was at one time a student
at the school, holds a temporary teaching certificate and was told
Wednesday he was being replaced by a drama teacher with a permanent
license and more seniority.
   But on Friday the United Federation of Teachers announced that an
agreement had been reached with the Board of Education for Moody to
remain in the drama class and team-teach with his replacement, said
Bert Shanas, spokesman for the union.
   Team-teaching puts more than one teacher in the same classroom
and takes advantage of each teacher's special skills, Shanas said.
   His temporary license still entitles Moody to teach in other city
public schools, but he said: ``I just want to work in a place that I
think of as my home.''
   Moody said he chose to teach with a temporary license because it
meant he could take acting jobs. He has appeared in eight movies.
   ``If he wants the freedom to be an actor, it is to his advantage
to be a temporary employee,'' said Rosenfeld. ``With that he is
accepting the risk. You can't have it both ways.''
   He said the district superintendent, Pat Black, had wanted a
permanent license holder who would not leave when an acting job came
up.

<HEAD>U.N. Group Reports 400 `Disappearances' In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 400 people were reported missing last year in
new cases of ``enforced or involuntary disappearances,'' mostly in
Latin America, a U.N. report said Friday.
   It said the number of cases nearly doubled compared to 1987, and
the number of countries where disappearances were reported also rose.
   Most of the alleged disappearances, reported by human rights
groups, were linked to a country's authorities.
   The report, compiled by a five-member working group for the
current annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, cited
evidence of disappearances in 15 of the 44 countries examined.
   It voiced special concern about disappearances of women and
children, but gave no breakdown.
   The working group asked the governments concerned for comment on
the latest cases, but most of them remain unresolved, the report
said.
   Peru's 170 cases topped the list of alleged disappearances
reported last year. Also figuring prominently were Colombia with 70
people reported missing, Guatemala, 53; El Salvador, 40; and the
Philippines, 39.
   It said Argentina had the largest number of outstanding cases,
3,387, but it noted no disappearances have been reported there since
1983.
   The report said disappearances increased in Peru because of the
government's fight against two guerrilla groups, Shining Path and
MRTA, and its imposition of a state of emergency and military
administration in about 30 provinces.
   It quoted people who ``reappeared'' after arrest as implicating
Peruvian army, police and security forces.
   In Guatemala, evidence indicates that disappearances have
continued despite recent democratic government elections, the report
said. Peasants, religious activists and clergymen, and trade union
leaders were most often reported abducted or arrested. The report
blamed soldiers, members of paramilitary groups or security
services, and armed men in civilian clothes.
   Most of those reported missing in the Philippines are young men
in rural areas who were arrested as part of the government's fight
against the left-wing New People's Army, the report said.
   Laws in most of the countries investigated are inadequate for
quickly determining the whereabouts of disappeared people, the
report said.
   The working group, chaired by Yugoslavian expert Ivan Tosevski,
appealed to governments for sparing use of emergency powers in times
of civil conflict.
   It criticized Afghanistan, Angola, Chile, Guinea, Iran, Nepal and
the Seychelles for failing to reply to allegations of disappearances.
   The working group said it has compiled evidence of about 17,000
enforced disappearances since it began issuing annual reports in
1980.
   A separate report by the U.N. commission's special investigator
on religious intolerance Friday singled out positive developments in
the Soviet Union.
   It cited large imports of Bibles for the commemoration of 1,000
years of Christianity in Russia, early release or reduced prison
sentences for jailed believers and moves toward legal reform.
   But the report said the worldwide persistence of many different
forms of religious discrimination, often by governments, ``hardly
inspires optimism.''

<HEAD>Lujan Says Interior Still Backs Alaska Refuge Oil Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department plans to stick with its
recommendation that a vast wildlife refuge in northeastern Alaska be
opened for gas and oil exploration, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr., said Friday.
   Environmentalists have said the Bush administration's actions on
development of the 1.5 million acre coastal stretch of the Alaska
National Wildlife Refuge will be a test of the administration's
intentions toward environmental issues.
   Asked about the Alaska refuge during his first news conference
after being sworn in as interior secretary earlier in the day, Lujan
replied that President Bush ``has said we should explore (the
refuge) in an environmentally acceptable manner'' and the question
``is out of my domain.''
   Congress must approve any such oil exploration, and legislation
has been introduced in both the Senate and House that would open the
refuge for drilling. But other legislation also has been introduced
that would make the refuge a wilderness area protected from
exploration.
   The oil industry for years has been pushing for access to the
refuge's northern coastal plain where there are indications of large
oil and gas deposits.
   In the final days of the Reagan administration, outgoing Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel sent a recommendation to Congress endorsing
development. Earlier, Interior had sent Congress a formal assessment
that drilling would not cause undue harm to the environment.
   A dozen environmental groups, including some of the country's
largest, last month urged in letters to Bush and Lujan that Interior
review its findings, contending the conclusions were based on
incomplete or false research.
   Lujan told reporters Friday he was not aware of the petition from
the environmental groups and said of Interior's earlier
recommendation to Congress, ``I don't think I can pull it back.''
   He said that Bush has made it clear he favors oil and gas
exploration as long as it is acceptable environmentally. Lujan
declined to suggest how the refuge might be opened for exploration
and suggested he favors approaching that slowly.
   ``Should we open (the refuge) up in an environmentally acceptable
manner? That decision has been made,'' he said, alluding to the
president's previously proclaimed position. He emphasized that no
development in the refuge can proceed without congressional action.
   Environmentalists and conservationists including the Sierra Club
and the Wilderness Society have vowed to fight any drilling in the
refuge, which is home for the Porcupine caribou, polar bears and
millions of birds.
   On other subjects during his news conference, Lujan said:
   _ He has recommended abandonment of a proposal suggested by his
predecessor that firefighting on federal lands be paid for partly
from funds that now go to the states from lumber and mineral lease
receipts.
   _ He opposes selling oil shale development rights on public lands
for $2.50 an acre as Interior has proposed, saying that's too little.
   _ He plans in coming days to visit the Trust Territory islands in
the Pacific, over which Interior has jurisdiction, as well as tour a
number of schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the West.
   _ He intends to develop a strong anti-drug program aimed at
eradicating illegal marijuana growing on public lands, including
increased use of aircraft used by the National Park Service. A
federal court this week ordered a halt to random drug testing of
Interior Department employees.

   The single gas line into this tiny town
broke early Friday, cutting off heat to more than 800 homes and
businesses for most of the day in the coldest weather this winter.
   After an arctic cold front chilled most of the state,
temperatures dipped to below 4 degrees and the 4-inch steel pipe
that delivers natural gas to the town of 2,200 contracted and pulled
apart, said officials of Lone State Gas Co., owner of the pipeline.
   Almost two-thirds of the town's homes and businesses were without
gas for heating, hot water or cooking, and schools were closed for
the day.
   ``Boy, was it cold,'' said Kenny Bragg, a janitor at the Cottle
County Courthouse. ``I don't think I would have made it without my
electric blanket.''
   No injuries were reported either as a result of the break or the
cold, said officials.
   The pipeline broke about 3 a.m. in an isolated area of ranchland,
said LSG regional superintendent Bob Clark.
   Fire Chief Don Dillard sounded a fire alarm about 4:15 a.m. to
warn residents, and he and other volunteers began rounding up
electric space heaters to take to the elderly.
   ``I scared everbody to death blowing the whistle,'' he said.
``But we needed to warn 'em.''
   Space heaters were taken to the Wood Convalescent Home, where 44
people live. Nurses gathered ambulatory residents together in the
hall and draped bedspreads over windows for insulation, said nursing
home director Gwynna Stofel.
   ``Luckily it never got below 68 in here,'' she said. ``We used
hot plates to serve a warm breakfast.''
   The nursing home was the first place in town to have its service
restored, at about 11 a.m. after the break was repaired.
   Gas crews then went to work restoring heat to the homes of the
elderly, said Dillard. Others had to wait until late afternoon and
early evening.
   The cold sparked a run on $14 electric space heaters at West
Texas Utilities Co., said office manager Patsy Walling.
   ``We brought them in from all the offices around and we sold
those so they had to bring more all the way from Abilene,'' she
said, adding that more than 50 had been sold by early afternoon.
   Some people gathered on the town square at the senior citizens'
center, which has electric heat, stoves and ovens and served a warm
breakfast to about 125 residents, said center director Emma James.
   Restaurant owners Willa and Bill Isbell, lacking gas to fire
their stoves, took food from their steakhouse to feed the hungry and
cold.
   ``Isn't it wonderful how a little town just rises up and pitches
in when something like this happens,'' said Geneva Bragg, who
ventured out in the cold early to unlock the electric-heated Cottle
County courthouse so ``people would have someplace warm to go.''

   A U.N. airlift will begin flying food and
medical supplies in a few days to Kabul, the besieged capital of
Afghanistan, officials announced Friday.
   Kabul is surrounded by Moslem guerrillas who have attacked supply
convoys as the last Soviet soldiers withdraw from Afghanistan.
Soviet aircraft have been flying in emergency rations of flour and
fuel to relieve severe shortages.
   ``This is one of many actions of Operation Salaam,'' the U.N.
relief campaign for Afghanistan, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said.
``It's all in the effort to assist in the reconstruction of
Afghanistan.''
   U.N. officials could not give an exact date for the airlift to
begin. The Kabul airport was closed Monday because of heavy snow.
   Officials at the Geneva U.N. headquarters said by telephone, on
condition of anonymity, that Afghan guerrillas have agreed in
principle not to attack U.N. planes carrying relief supplies to the
2 million residents and refugees of Kabul.
   In return, they said, the United Nations would send more relief
aid into regions the insurgents control.
   Until last week, the guerrillas had threatened to attack U.N.
flights or truck convoys on grounds that providing aid to Kabul
would help the Soviet-sponsored government.
   Insurgent leaders have predicted Kabul and other cities will fall
quickly after the Red Army is gone, without the need for major
guerrilla assaults.
   Moslem guerrillas have fought since a Communist coup 11 years
ago. Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979,
increasing in number to an estimated 115,000 by last May 15, when
they began withdrawing under a U.N.-negotiated agreement. All are to
be gone by Feb. 15.
   ``Airlifts have not started, but it is not the only action that
is being taken,'' Ms. Younes said.
   Her comment that the airlift was part of ``an overall action''
tacitly confirmed supplies would be provided to both Kabul and
guerrilla areas. ``There have been contacts all along with all the
parties,'' she said.
   Government forces in Afghanistan generally are confined to the
cities, and insurgents control the countryside.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, director of Operation Salaam, was
beginning a week of consultations with the insurgents and other
parties to the conflict.
   Operation Salaam, which means ``peace'' in Arabic, plans to spend
more than $1.1 billion over two years in Afghanistan. Its objectives
include clearing the nation of mines, repatriating more than 5
million refugees from neighboring Pakistan and Iran, and reviving
the primarily agricultural economy.
   The Soviet Union has pledged $600 million of the $887.6 million
promised so far. The United States, principal arms supplier to the
guerrillas, pledged $16.7 million.
   Much of the Soviet aid will consist of food, clothing, bedding,
medical supplies and cloth, with no restrictions on where it may be
distributed, the Operation Salaam office said.

   President Bush congratulated the San Francisco
49ers on Friday and said they ``rewrote the record books'' with
their Super Bowl victory. In turn he was presented with two
autographed balls and a jogging outfit.
   ``Let me congratulate you also on your victory,'' quarterback Joe
Montana told Bush at a East Room reception. Montana said being
invited to the White House ``means a lot to all of us'' and joked:
``Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties.''
   Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, ``With this, your third
Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and
raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.''
   And, to Montana, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a
92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, Bush said: ``Joe, you once
again showed your grace under pressure. I guess we all wonder why it
took so long.''
   Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and wide
receiver Jerry Rice, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award.
   ``That's the real thing from the Super Bowl,'' Rice said of the
ball he gave the president.
   Bush joked that he heard, ``there is a new TV series coming out
based on your Super Bowl performance _ Miami Rice. Available in
every city in the country except one. Cininnnati, that is.''
   The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in
Miami.
   Team owner Danny DeBartolo told Bush that he would be presented
with a Super Bowl ring, size 11, ``because we want to make you an
honorary member of our team.''
   And outgoing coach Bill Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit,
but cautioned, ``I'm not sure we suggest running in the streets of
Washington, D.C., in this suit....Remember the Redskin fans are all
around us.''
   Super Bowl winners are traditionally invited to the White House.

<HEAD>Aide Says Nixon Would Use Extra Pension Money to Pay for Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a pay raise that would increase pensions of
former presidents becomes law, former President Nixon will use the
additional money to pay for security for himself and his wife, a
spokesman said Friday.
   John H. Taylor, assistant to the former president, wrote on
Nixon's behalf to David Keating, executive vice president of the
National Taxpayers Union, who had written to Nixon urging him to
publicly oppose the pay increase.
   The pay raise proposal, approved by former President Reagan,
calls for increasing the salaries of members of the Cabinet to
$155,000 from $99,500.
   Since a 1971 law links presidential pensions to Cabinet salaries,
the pensions of all former presidents would be increased by the same
amount.
   Keating wrote Nixon on Jan. 17: ``In view of your recent public
statements urging the new administration and the new Congress to
control the federal budget deficit, I hope that you will publicly
issue a statement urging Congress to reject the increase and saying
that you will refuse to accept a 56 percent pension increase.''
   Taylor noted in his reply that former first lady Pat Nixon
relinquished her right to Secret Service protection in 1983 and the
former president did so the following year.
   ``The Nixons are now paying for their own security, an expense of
over $500,000 since 1985,'' he said. ``It is RN's intention to apply
whatever increase may be enacted in his pension entirely toward
defraying the cost of his and Mrs. Nixon's security.''
   Taylor also told Keating that the Richard Nixon Library and
Birthplace, now under construction at Yorba Linda, Calif., would be
the first such facility to be both built and operated without
expenditure of public funds.
   ``In sum, I am sure you will agree that by his decisions
regarding Secret Service protection and private funding for the
operation of his library and birthplace, President Nixon has already
demonstrated extraordinary leadership on the deficit issue,'' Taylor
said.
   The pay raises automatically go into effect unless they are
disapproved by both houses of Congress before Wednesday.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, however, has proposed that the
House vote Thursday on a proposal that would scale the increases
back, both for members of Congress and for Cabinet officers and
other executive branch officials.
   Taylor released the correspondence from Nixon's office in
Woodcliff Lake, N.J.

   The House Energy and Commerce Committee on
Friday asked FCC Commissioner Dennis R. Patrick to explain the
``rationale and justification'' for his proposal to change the
two-decades-old system that regulates American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s long-distance rates.
   A letter from committee chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich, and
telecommunications and finance subcommittee chairman Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., urged Patrick to submit a detailed description of
the plan, which Patrick revised after failing to sell it on Capitol
Hill last year.
   Patrick acknowledged congressional concern about the price cap
proposal last week when he postponed a commission vote on the plan
until March 16.
   ``We are pleased that you have agreed to a procedure that will
permit the public and Congress to review the details of the price
cap plan,'' said the letter, which also was signed by Rep. Norman F.
Lent of New York and Matthew J. Rinaldo of New Jersey, the ranking
Republicans on the committee and subcommittee, respectively.
   It added: ``We also would appreciate your explanation of the
rationale and justification for adopting this price cap plan.''
   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said the commission would have
no immediate comment on the letter.
   A committee aide who asked that her name not be used said Patrick
would be invited to testify at a Feb. 28 subcommittee hearing.
   Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed AT&amp;T a certain
profit beyond its costs. But the FCC proposed replacing this
so-called rate-of-return regulation for dominant carriers such as
AT&amp;T and the regional Bell companies with ceilings on prices.
   The commission proposed to let AT&amp;T raise rates 3 percent less
than annual inflation _ a move it said would would encourage greater
efficiency and innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four
years if all the dominant companies participated. AT&amp;T officials
have applauded the plan as being a long-overdue concession to
changing economies in the telephone industry.
   But lawmakers said the plan didn't guarantee that AT&amp;T's rates
would remain in a ``zone of reasonableness.''
   The letter Friday asked Patrick to ``outline how the price cap
plan will benefit residential consumers, business users and rural
telephone subscribers. Please specify both the safeguards proposed
to prevent the dominant carriers from engaging in anti-competitive
practices and assess the role of competition in determining the
applicability of the price cap plan in each segment of the market.''
   It asked for computer models and analyses used to derive the
proposal, including ``any analyses of the impact of price caps on
residential and business consumers, and a comparison of how
consumers would fare under prices caps and under the current
rate-of-return regulation. Please include the origin of the starting
rate that you propose to adopt for each element of service, and the
method of adjustment proposed for each (element).''

<HEAD>Report Secret Meetings on Korean Reunification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of North and South
Korea have held secret talks about improving relations and discussed
the possibility of a meeting between their leaders, newspaper
reports said Friday.
   Two days before the reports, an unprecedented trade agreement was
announced between the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai and
communist North Korea. The South Koreans said Friday the agreement
could open the way to reunification after 44 years.
   Seoul newspaper reports quoted a government source, who was not
identified, as saying the secret talks were held abroad and covered
most major issues between the rival Koreas.
   They said the most recent meetings were in Singapore during the
past week between Park Chul-un, a special secretary to President Roh
Tae-woo, and a senior North Korean official who was not identified.
   Park met with the North Korean several times to discuss major
issues, including a proposed summit, the reports said. The
government source was quoted as saying the summit could be held this
year.
   Last month, Roh renewed a proposal that he and North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung discuss the future of the Korean peninsula, which
was divided in 1945.
   The reported talks coincided with the historic visit to North
Korea of a leading South Korean industrialist to discuss direct
investment and joint venture projects.
   Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of Hyundai, was in
North Korea from Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 as a guest of the communist
government.
   He said Thursday he had agreed with North Korean officials to
undertake several joint ventures in the North, including a shipyard,
railroad plant and tourist resort.
   Newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying
tours would be available later this year to the resort area, a
rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the
demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula.
   Roh's government said it would propose special legislation to
facilitate the projects.
   Contact with North Korea is a violation of South Korea's national
security laws. The two nations are technically still at war because
no peace treaty was signed when the three-year Korean war ended 1953.
   In a statement Friday, the government said it ``in principle
takes a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as
possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve
national unification.''
   Chung was believed to be the first South Korean business leader
approved by both governments to visit the North.
   North Korea's participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to
revive its economy. It is reported to owe $5 billion to Soviet bloc
and Western nations.
   Figures published Friday and attributed to the South Korean
government said North Korea had a trade deficit of $720 million in
1987. Exports were given as $1.67 billion and imports as $2.39
billion.

   A British woman who fled from
an outlawed guerrilla group last year was actually a South African
police officer assigned to spy on the anti-apartheid movement, the
government said Friday.
   Olivia Forsyth, 28, was held captive by the African National
Congress for 22 months before she fled in May to the British Embassy
in Luanda, Angola. She holed up in the embassy for six months before
returning here.
   Until Friday, neither she nor South African police would comment
on the African National Congress' allegation that she was a spy who
had tried to infiltrate the guerrilla movement. Her father, Peter
Forsyth, had insisted she was a journalist.
   The head of the police security branch, Maj. Gen. Basie Smit,
said in a statement that Miss Forsyth was a police lieutenant who
gathered ``valuable information'' after pretending to defect to the
guerrilla group in 1986. Smit said she was tortured at an African
National Congress camp in Angola.
   Smit also identified another police spy, Joy Harnden, who
infiltrated leading anti-apartheid organizations in South Africa
such as the Black Sash civil rights group and the End Conscription
Campaign.
   Both women, who are white, ``performed a great duty for South
Africa ... in exceptionally dangerous circumstances,'' said Smit. He
said details of their missions were being disclosed to counter a
``twisted account'' that might come from the guerrilla organization.
   Police released a lengthy statement by Miss Forsyth, who holds
British and South African citizenship.
   In the statement, she said she was beaten while in custody and
said the group's exiled leadership did not want their leader, Nelson
Mandela, released from prison in South Africa because they felt he
was more useful as a martyr.
   She also said Mandela's wife, Winnie, was an ``embarrassment'' to
the group because she ``never does as she is instructed.''
   She also asserted that a leadership struggle between two young
guerrilla leaders, Chris Hani and Thabo Mbeki, was likely whenever
president Oliver Tambo stepped down.
   Tom Sebina, an African National Congress spokesman based in
Zambia, denied a leadership split and said Miss Forsyth and not been
mistreated while in custody. He said Britain should take away her
British passport because she had spied for another country.
   Regarding morale problems within the group, Sebina said it was
possible there had been shortages of food and supplies in Angola.
   The National Union of South African Students, one of the
anti-apartheid organizations that Miss Forsyth infiltrated at Rhodes
University, issued a statement saying Miss Forsyth was believed to
have caused the detention of at least four human rights activists
whom she pretended to befriend while at the school.
   The African National Congress was outlawed by the South African
government in 1960 and began a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961
aimed at undermining the white-minority government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense News and Army Times, two independent
newspapers read by the military and Congress, are calling on John
Tower to withdraw from consideration as defense secretary, citing
recent allegations about his personal life and past ties to defense
contractors.
   ``Out of concern for the military, which the former Texas senator
clearly loves, he should step aside,'' Tom Donnelly writes in an
editorial to be published in Monday's edition of Army Times.
   The 49-year-old, independent publication has a worldwide
circulation of about 125,000, including most of the uniformed
military.
   ``Tower's public position has been so compromised by the
agonizing process by which he was nominated and is being confirmed
... that he cannot be the strong spokesman the Defense Department
needs now,'' the editorial said.
   ``More troubling and more at issue is Tower's position as a
consultant to defense contractors. ... the speed and greed with
which Tower spun through the revolving door is appalling,'' it said.
   The editorial suggests that either President Bush, who is
concerned about ethics in government, reconsider Tower's
appointment, or that the former senator ``summon personal courage of
his own ... it might be the best help he can give to his friends in
the military.''
   Defense News, in an editorial for Monday written by Richard
Barnard, says Tower's withdrawal ``would be the act of a seasoned
politician who understands that the best interests of the nation
sometimes require personal sacrifice by those who would help lead
it.''
   ``Withdrawal is necessary because the record of Mr. Tower's
professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with
utmost effectiveness at a time when defense priorities and the
Defense Department each are undergoing periods of vital but delicate
change,'' the editorial said.
   Defense News is a three-year-old independent publication with a
circulation of about 30,000, including the top level of the Pentagon
and defense industry, and members of Congress.
   Defense News suggests that Tower links to defense consultants is
the most troubling aspect of the recent confirmation process.
   ``The principal task of the next defense secretary is to build
public confidence that the Pentagon is being well-managed and that
defense dollars are being carefully spent,'' the editorial said.
``The defense secretary must be an independent voice of force,
authority and reason.
   ``There is ample reason to doubt whether Mr. Tower is the man for
these times,'' the editorial said.
   Tower, in his testimony before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he had received more than $1 million in fees for
defense consulting over a 2{ year period. He said he had severed all
ties with the consultants as of Dec. 1, 1988.

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament opened on Friday
without President P.W. Botha, but his temporary replacement echoed
the ailing leader's commitment to segregation and cautious social
reforms.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis, appointed
acting president after Botha suffered a stroke Jan. 18, promised
``full civil rights for all South Africans'' in a speech to
lawmakers. But he said racial segregation laws would remain in place
and announced no major new initiatives.
   Heunis also reiterated the government's call for political
negotiations with black leaders, although virtually all prominent
blacks have refused to talk without signs of additional race reforms.
   Zach de Beer, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, said afterward that Heunis ``merely repeated platitudes and
generalities offered in the past.'' Another liberal leader, Denis
Worrall, said Heunis should have condemned a recent series of racist
incidents nationwide.
   The opening ceremony took place one day after Botha announced he
was resigning as leader of the long-governing National Party.
   Education Minister F.W. de Klerk was elected as the new party
leader by a 69-61 vote, defeating a slightly more liberal candidate.
   Botha is recuperating at his home in Cape Town from a stroke that
weakened his left arm and left leg. Doctors said he has recovered
rapidly and is taking daily walks but needs at least one more month
of rest before returning to work.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said Friday that Botha
is not taking part in daily management of government while he
recuperates.

   Barbara Bush said Friday that guns scare her
and she doesn't own one because ``I'm too afraid I'd shoot the wrong
person.'' She said military assault rifles like the one used in a
California rampage that left five children dead should be outlawed.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the first lady said
she did not want to discuss the ``politics and policies''
surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, President Bush, opposes
new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member of the
National Rifle Association.
   ``I myself do not own a gun,'' she said, urging an interviewer to
talk with her husband about his position on handguns. ``I choose not
to get into that. I am afraid of them (guns). I'm too afraid I'd
shoot the wrong person.''
   Nancy Reagan, before moving to Washington eight years ago,
revealed she had owned ``a tiny little gun'' that she kept by her
bed for protection while husband was away. In her first White House
interview in 1981, Mrs. Reagan said she had gotten rid of the weapon.
   Marking the end of her second week in the White House, Mrs. Bush
spent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since her
husband became president. ``I feel at home here,'' she said, sitting
on a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her.
   In a town torn by debate over a 51 percent pay increase for
members of Congress, Mrs. Bush was asked if she had been able to
live on her husband's salary when he was a House member from Houston
in the 1960s. ``No,'' she replied, saying that they had relied on
money he earned as an oilman in Texas.
   ``Could we have lived on it? We probably could have,'' she said.
However, she said, they would have had a very different lifestyle
and would not have been able to maintain two homes or send their
children to private schools.
   Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becoming
president, she replied, ``I don't see a difference with him.''
Pointing to several people in the room, she said, ``I see a
difference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's just
different when you're president. Everybody treats you differently
when you're president.''
   Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs.
Bush said, ``I spend half my life saying, `Could you please get the
vice president on the phone?' and the operator says, `Do you really
want Dan Quayle' or `Don't you know Dan Quayle's in Venezuela.'''
   More seriously, she said, one big difference for Bush is that
``everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is the
president of the United States.''
   And yet, she said of her husband: ``I think he's exactly the
same.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband had
stopped doing that briefly but ``after awhile they all became normal
again. It just took a little while. ...
   ``I call him Mr. President sometimes _ when I'm needling him ...
to tease him, `Yes, Mr. President.'''
   The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws
banning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures to
outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of rifles
are pending in Congress and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47
assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five
children were killed and 29 others, as well as a teacher, were
wounded in Stockton, Calif. last month.
   Mrs. Bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed.
``They should be, absolutely,'' she said.
   While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. Bush
said that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, an
avid outdoorsman.
   ``I went hunting with George once,'' Mrs. Bush recalled. ``He
told me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his head
came right through that little circle (the rifle scope). I put down
the gun and said, `That's it. I'm not going to do that again.'''
   Earlier Friday, Mrs. Bush visited the United Community Ministries
Inc. in the Washington suburb of Alexandria and praised the center's
staff of volunteers.
   ``It reinforces my belief that we have got to help the working
poor,'' she told reporters during her 40-minute visit.
   The first lady helped carry from the trunk of her limousine seven
plastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of the
White House staff donated.
   The center is a private, non-profit organization whose programs
include a thrift shop, food pantry, medical clinics, day care,
counseling and financial assistance.
   Mrs. Bush posed for photographers with four children from the
facility's day care center. They included 4-year-old Amber Daniels,
who handed Mrs. Bush a ``mock voting tally'' from the preschool
class, showing President Bush with a clear margin over Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   ``That just makes me feel wonderful,'' the first lady said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on
Friday called for improvements in human rights conditions in El
Salvador, saying future U.S. support for the Central American nation
is tied to such efforts.
   Quayle also said during a one-day stop here that if President
Jose Napoleon Duarte agrees to a request by the leftist rebels to
postpone the country's March 19 election, the Bush administration
will back him.
   Duarte, in a luncheon toast honoring Quayle on Thursday, called
the rebels' election plan a step in the right direction ``because
for the first time they expected there exists an electoral
alternative.''
   The rebels said they would recognize the election under certain
conditions, including postponement until September.
   After praising Duarte as a champion of human rights during his
five-year term, which is coming to a close, Quayle said, ``Now as we
approach elections there has been more violence ... on both the left
and the right.''
   ``Why I am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms
possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human
rights,'' he told reporters in a news conference at the home of
Ambassador William Walker.
   ``There are consequences to human rights violations in the
future,'' he added, then he left to privately address military
leaders on the human rights issue.
   ``We, the United States, are committed to the process and the
system of democracy. Democracy means human rights and decency,'' he
said. ``Our commitment and our support is conditioned on this
process and this system.''
   One day earlier, Quayle had taken strong issue with former
President Carter's comment that the new Bush administration should
rely on ``economic pressure'' to further the cause of human rights
in El Salvador.
   At the White House Friday, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said of Quayle's comment on Carter, ``The vice president
is free to say whatever he wants to say. I think the vice
president's a pretty astute fellow.''
   Quayle said Friday he would speak in direct, emphatic and
specific terms to the military leaders, who have been accused of
failing to adequately curb human rights violations. He compared his
planned comments to those of then-Vice President Bush, who in 1983
told the Salvadorans that U.S. aid would dry up if the human rights
situation did not improve.
   A senior State Department official who attended the meeting said
Quayle told the military leaders the congressional consensus behind
aid to El Salvador was ``of necessity a fragile thing and that
sliding back on the human rights question would threaten it.'' The
official commented only on condition he not be named.
   The vice president's visit came against a backdrop of El
Salvador's presidential campaign and maneuvering over how to deal
with the peace proposal offered by the rebels last week.
   ``If President Duarte announces a consensus within the
constitutional framework, I am sure there would be strong support
from the administration'' on postponement of the election, Quayle
said in the strongest statement to date by a U.S. official on the
peace proposal.
   The proposal by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, is ``a step forward,'' he said. He said that was why Duarte,
after an initial negative reaction, did not reject it outright.
   ``But now it is incumbent for reciprocity from the FMLN,
reciprocity to cease fire now,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle met Friday also with political leaders and Roman Catholic
Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas, an intermediary in carrying the
rebels' peace proposal to San Salvador.
   The political delegation that Quayle saw included presidential
candidates Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, and Fidel Chavez Mena of Duarte's Christian
Democratic Party.
   Arena leader Roberto d'Aubuisson, who has long faced allegations
of involvement with right-wing death squads, was not invited to the
meeting.
   Quayle also chose not to meet with a third, trailing presidential
candidate, Guillermo Ungo, of the leftist Democratic Convergence
coalition, which is closely allied with the FMLN.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
left was passed over because ``we feel it is inappropriate because
we do not know how serious the FMLN is with this proposal.''
   Duarte initially blasted the Jan. 23 proposal as unconstitutional
because it called for changing the constitutionally mandated March
election.
   U.S. officials felt the proposal was worth examining because of
the rebels' first-ever offer to join in elections without demanding
power-sharing as a precondition.
   The United States has provided more than $3 billion in aid to El
Salvador this decade.
   The early 1980s were marked by many killings of civilians, and
soldiers and right-wing death squads were blamed. After 1984, human
rights violations seemed to decrease, but violence by both left and
right has picked up again in the last year.
   Quayle was under heavy security during his visit. The press corps
in the motorcade behind his bulletproof limousine rode in vans
customized against attack.

   The Justice Department declined Friday to
intervene in a suit charging that Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co.
billed the Pentagon for more than $10 million in fraudulent charges.
   The department's decision not to intervene in the case at this
point indicated it had legal reservations about the complaint by
current and former workers at the company's Sunnyvale, Calif.,
aerospace plant.
   The complaint, filed last year in federal court in San Jose,
Calif., alleged that employees, among other things, charged the
government for using computers to operate private businesses while
awaiting security clearances and to run a football pool.
   The suit also charged that a senior plant manager had Lockheed
machinists build him a private airplane at government expense.
Employees were also allegedly told to charge their time to contracts
on which they did no work, the complaint said.
   The suit was filed under the False Claims Acts, a Civil War-era
statute that was amended in 1986 to allow whistle-blowers to collect
a percentage of judgments against companies that cheat the
government.
   The Justice Department said it had elected not to join the
lawsuit ``after a review and investigation'' of the case.
   The department added, however, that it would continue to monitor
the case, brought by a former software manager and a technician
currently employed at the plant.
   The statute allows the government to intervene at a later time
``upon a showing of good cause,'' the department noted.
   The plant employs 23,700 workers to develop space craft,
satellite systems and submarine-launched missiles. Lockheed Missles
&amp; Space, a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp., has vigorously denied the
allegations in the complaint.
   But the lawsuit said the Defense Contract Audit Agency
substantiated the allegations made by Margaret Newsham, the former
software manager who was fired in 1984 for allegedly padding her
time card. Copies of the agency's reports were appended to the
lawsuit.
   Ms. Newsham's dismissal is the subject of a separate lawsuit
against the company.

   A school survey of junior high students'
romantic attitudes was withdrawn after parents complained that it
amounted to little more than a computer dating service, school
officials said Friday.
   The survey, passed out to sixth, seventh and eighth graders at
Harrison Middle School in nearby Sunnyside, asked students' thoughts
on kissing, parties, ``buns'' and other subjects.
   ``I think it's an overreaction,'' said Principal Dennis Birr of
the parental response. ``It was never intended to be a sexual,
offensive type of survey.''
   But upon review, Birr said he decided there were a few questions
not ``appropriate for this age level'' and decided Thursday to
collect the forms and dispose of them.
   The 30-question survey was put together as a fund-raiser by
members of the school's science club, and passed out in class to the
11- to 13-year-old students.
   ``I guess I was really concerned about the judgment of the adults
at that school,'' said Sherry Mashburn of Sunnyside, one of the
objecting parents whose son is a sixth-grader.
   Members of the science club were supposed to collect the
completed forms and punch the data into a computer, Birr said.
   For $1, a student could receive a list of eight to 10 names of
classmates of the opposite sex who shared similar interests, Birr
said.
   ``I don't know what they were supposed to do with those names,''
Ms. Mashburn said. ``I'd prefer my son not to do a lot.
   ``But he is 12 and he is interested,'' she added.
   The survey was called a ``Heart to Heart Personal Questionnaire.''
   For the question ``When I think of kissing I get?'' possible
multiple-choice answers were: really excited, interested, bored,
sick or fanatic.
   For the question ``Which of the following fascinates you the
most?'' possible answers included: electronic games, nice-looking
cars, nice-looking bodies, the moon and the stars.
   Asked what sort of parties they liked, possible answers were:
loud and wild, quiet and dignified, all, none, birthday and illegal.
   Another question asked which physical feature _ eyes, smile, legs
or ``buns'' _ the participant noticed first in the opposite sex.
   ``Eleven-year-olds don't need to worry about what their buns look
like,'' parent Sara Robert told the Yakima Herald-Republic.
   But Birr said most of the questions involved attitudes toward
friendship, sports and other personality characteristics.

   A group that once included President Bush's new
national security adviser recommended Friday that Bush stagger
deployment of long-range atomic weapons as part of an effort to
control defense spending.
   The report is likely to find a receptive ear at the White House
because the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, helped write
early drafts, although he dropped out of the working group following
his appointment.
   The report reiterated a view previously stated by Scowcroft, but
not repeated publicly since he joined the administration, that
former President Reagan's vision of a Star Wars umbrella against
nuclear attack would be impossible in the foreseeable future.
   Research has made ``clear that there is no near-term prospect
that any combination of defensive sytems will make possible
exclusive reliance on defense to defeat the projected threat,'' said
the report, drafted by members of the Foreign Policy Institute of
Johns Hopkins University and the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a pair of think tanks.
   Spending should remain constant for strategic defenses rather
than increasing sharply as requested by Reagan, group members said.
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., the chairman and
ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,
respectively, and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., Nunn's counterpart in the
House, presented the report at a news conference with former
national security adviser Robert McFarlane and former Defense
Secretary Harold Brown.
   Congress is unlikely to increase defense spending this year, as
requested by Reagan in his final budget proposal, and the United
States will not be able to pay for all the bombers, missiles,
submarines and other systems underway.
   Therefore, Congress and the administration must agree on which
are most urgently needed, deploy them first, and then add others as
necessary, they said.
   Two of the three legs of the U.S. nuclear ``triad,'' the bomber
and submarine forces, ``will survice any plausible Soviet attack,''
it said.
   ``We cannot, however, extend this confidence to our land-based
missiles in silos,'' it said. ``Against a surprise attack by Soviet
forces, in which only about one-third of their currently available
ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) warheads are used, only
about 5 percent of U.S. ICBMs would survive.''
   The situation could worsen under the proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty under negotiation between the United States and the
Soviet Union, because it would reduce by about half the number of
delivery systems. One side would require fewer weapons to knock out
the other's fixed land-based weapons.
   Foremost among the group's recommendations was that the
administration and Congress agree to develop a mobile
intercontinental ballistic missile class, to match two classes
deployed by the Soviets.
   ``Mobility is key,'' said Aspin.
   And they urged the administration to proceed cautiously on the
B-2 stealth bomber to avoid a repeat of problems suffered by the B-1
bomber, which was rushed through the development stage.
   Nunn and Aspin also urged the new administration to drop Reagan's
proposed ban on mobile missiles, arguing that such weapons reduce
the danger of nuclear war since it would be almost impossible for an
adversary to destroy a significant percentage in a surprise attack.
   The group leaned toward the small road-mobile Midgetman as the
best option, the same conclusion reached by a presidential
commission headed by Scowcroft in 1983.
   The Midgetman would be more expensive than other alternatives,
however, costing an estimated $39 billion versus $12 billion for a
rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX missile and $19 billion to
$40 billion for the so-called ``carry-hard'' approach, in which the
MX, Midgetman or Minuteman III missile would be encased in capsules
hardened against nuclear attack and scattered in a deceptive pattern
among a large number of silos.
   Reagan, in proposing a budget for the next fiscal year, cut all
money for the Midgetman in favor of the MX.

   More than two decades after a grand jury
charged Bernice Van Heise in the shooting death of her married
boyfriend, the woman pleaded innocent Friday.
   The woman _ who disappeared after the slaying _ was found living
quietly in rural Elburn, married and going by the name Greta
Knickerbocker.
   Mrs. Knickerbocker, 62, was re-indicted Wednesday on charges of
murder and involuntary manslaughter in the Jan. 31, 1968, shooting
death of Eugene Douglas in this prosperous suburb north of Chicago.
   ``She was sad and nervous, it seemed,'' in her court appearance
Friday before Lake County Judge Harry Hartel, said Joe Collina,
chief of investigations for the Lake County state's attorney's
office.
   She was accompanied in court by her husband of 20 years, Conrad
Knickerbocker, Collina said. Bond was set at $100,000, he said,
adding police do not believe Mrs. Knickerbocker is likely to flee.
She remained in jail Friday afternoon.
   Mrs. Knickerbocker was arrested Thursday in St. Charles, west of
Chicago, where ``she was having lunch at a restaurant with her
son,'' he said.
   ``This is a touchy situation,'' Conrad Knickerbocker told the
Chicago Tribune on Thursday. ``We thought it was over years ago.''
He said his wife worked occasionally in part-time retail jobs but
was primarily a homemaker.
   He declined to comment further, and no one answered the phone
Friday at the Knickerbocker home.
   The case was reopened in November, when police received a tip on
Mrs. Van Heise's whereabouts. ``She was found through a friend of
her daughter's,'' Collina said.
   Investigators said Douglas' survivors lobbied hard to have
charges renewed after it was learned where she was that month.
   At the time of the shooting 21 years ago, Mrs. Knickerbocker _
then Mrs. Van Heise _ was a divorcee involved with Douglas, a
married, 49-year-old artist who lived in the north Chicago suburb of
Glenview, Collina said.
   ``Witnesses said Eugene Douglas ... had decided to go back to his
wife and children,'' Collina said. ``He was breaking off the
relationship.''
   The shooting occurred at Mrs. Van Heise's coach-house apartment,
Collina said. She told police at the time that she had been showing
Douglas a gun, and that it fired accidentally when she was handing
it to him.
   ``The physical evidence doesn't support that, according to the
police,'' Collina said.
   Mrs. Van Heise was a suspect just after the shooting, but a judge
at the time rejected a murder charge, ruling there was insufficient
evidence. A grand jury later indicted her on a murder charge, but
she had disappeared, authorities said.
   That indictment was withdrawn about 1975, said Deputy Chief
Robert Boone of the Lake Forest police. He did not know why the
charge was dropped, but said the case had been inactive for many
years.
   The Knickerbockers have lived near Elburn _ about 40 miles west
of Chicago _ since 1976, when they moved from the suburb of Hinsdale.

   The nation's jobless rate inched up to 5.4
percent last month even as the economy created 408,000 new jobs, the
government said Friday in a report showing stronger than anticipated
early-year economic strength.
   While the report was good news for people seeking work _ in all,
700,000 Americans found jobs last month out of 865,000 who began the
search _ analysts said the economy may be growing too quickly and
predicted the Federal Reserve would move to rein it in.
   The report, however, had a neglible immediate impact on Wall
Street, where stock prices were little changed and the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25, reducing its
gain for the week to 8.39 points.
   January's unemployment rate was up 0.1 percentage point to 5.4
percent, the Labor Department said. But that masked the job gains
and the fact that a record 62.9 percent of working-age Americans
were at work.
   ``It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said Davis Wyss,
chief economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting firm. ``It suggests we are going into the first quarter
a lot stronger than we thought. The Fed is going to tighten and
short-term interest rates will be going up.''
   Some predicted that action will come next week, when the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee meets to set 1989 targets for growth
in the money supply. Tight growth restrictions act as a brake on
economic growth by pushing interest rates upward.
   In another sign of robust economic strength as 1989 began, the
average manufacturing work week rose by 6 minutes to 41.0 hours.
Average factory overtime held steady at 3.9 hours a week.
   And, in data showing the pace of wage gains picked up in January,
the department said average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory
workers climbed by 0.6 percent while average weekly earnings rose
1.2 percent.
   ``It's a quite disturbing spillover into wages of the strong job
growth,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Wage increases also put more money in consumers' wallets; the
resultant increased purchasing could stymie efforts to reduce the
U.S. trade deficit, analysts said.
   The government also reported Friday that orders to U.S. factories
for manufactured goods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest
rise in six months, and were up 9.7 percent for all of 1988, the
best showing since 1979.
   ``Combine the increase in factory orders with the tremendous
generation of jobs and building inflationary pressure and that
smacks of anything but a soft landing,'' Sinai said. ``That smacks
of a booming economy _ one that could get too hot to handle.''
   The growth in new jobs, as calculated from the department's
monthly sampling of households nationwide, was led by activity in
the construction and the service industries.
   Construction added 102,000 jobs, more than analysts had expected
even with unseasonably warm weather in most of the country.
Retail-trade jobs grew up 135,000; service industries added 75,000
workers; gains of 45,000 were recorded for manufacturing industries
and for transportation and public utilities.
   The overall January job gain far outpaced the consensus
prediction of a 250,000 increase.
   The Labor Deparment said that of the 123.4 million people in the
civilian labor force last month, 116.7 million had jobs and 6.7
million were seeking employment.
   A separate unemployment calculation that includes the nearly 1.7
million members of the armed services stationed in the United States
also stood at 5.4 percent in January, like the civilian rate up 0.1
percentage point from December.
   In the civilian economy, the jobless rate among whites remained
unchanged at 4.6 percent; the rate was 4 percent for white men, down
from 4.1 percent, and 3.9 percent for white women, unchanged from
December.
   Unemployment among blacks climbed to 12 percent in January from
11.6 percent, while the jobless rate among black teen-agers jumped
to 34.5 percent from 29.6 percent.
   Unemployment among teens overall rose from 14.8 percent to 16.4
percent.
   There also was an increase in unemployment among Hispanics, from
7.6 percent in December to 8.4 percent last month.

^Somali Premier Heckled as He Accuses Ethiopia of Arming Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somalia's Prime Minister Mohamed Ali Samantar
was heckled by dissidents Friday as he accused Ethiopia of arming
Somali rebels and promised to free all political prisoners in his
country.
   ``Stop the killing, stop the genocide,'' shouted several Somalis
as Samantar was answering reporters' questions at the National Press
Club. Outside, about 15 protesters shouted ``Samantar is a killer.''
   Samantar, who has met with Vice President Dan Quayle and members
of Congress to respond to accusations of human rights violations,
said Somalia would allow representatives of Amnesty International to
visit and investigate ``without restrictions.''
   The government has ``decided to release all political prisoners
in Somalia without exception, including those interned during the
last year in connection with the troubles in the north,'' Samantar
said.
   Amnesty International issued a report last September saying the
government had executed as many as 1,000 unarmed civilians last year
while trying to put down an insurgency in the northern part of the
country on Africa's eastern coast.
   U.S. officials and congressional aides noted that an Amnesty
visit had been postponed from January to April.
   In response to reports of torture and killings, Congress last
summer froze some $55 million of U.S. aid to the impoverished
African nation. After Somalia freed about 100 political prisoners
recently, there were indications that lawmakers might be willing to
release $17 million of the aid for payment of arrears to the
International Monetary Fund, said congressional sources who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   But Samantar's talks this week failed to convince some lawmakers
that his government was making much progress on human rights, the
sources said.
   ``For the time being, it's promises,'' said one source. He said
Somalia is still rejecting a U.S. condition for peace talks between
the government and the rebels.
   Samantar said the rebels were being armed by Ethiopia, in
violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their
11-year war and stipulated that they would not arm each other's
insurgents.
   Samantar said his government had brought the matter up with
Ethiopia's Marxist leaders and was told they had not authorized such
aid although it may have been approved at a lower level of
government.
   U.S. officials say that although some 200,000 to 300,000 Somalis
had found refuge in Ethiopia from last year's fighting in their
country, there is no evidence to support Somalia's accusations that
Ethiopia is arming the rebels who have been seeking to topple the
government for seven years.
   Samantar denied rebels' claims that his government had received
chemical weapons from Libya, but said the two countries had
normalized their relations in recent years.
   Asked whether Somalia had received shipments of conventional
weapons from Libya to help combat the insurgency, Samantar said:
``It's possible.''
   U.S. officials say they have evidence that Libya sent light
weapons and ammunition to Somalia last summer. But when asked about
this in Congress, Samantar denied any Libyan help, the congressional
sources said.
   Somalia has been ruled by army general Siad Barre since he took
power in a 1969 coup. The country of 5.3 million was originally
allied with the Soviet Union, but switched allegiance to the West in
1977.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Urges France to Press for More Releases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann urged Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas on Friday to seek the release of other Western
captives in Lebanon during his two-day visit to Iran.
   Dumas is to spend Sunday and Monday in Tehran on the first visit
by a French Cabinet minister since the Islamic revolution ousted the
late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a decade ago.
   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a
Belgian still are hostages in Lebanon, most in the hands of Shiite
Moslem extremists loyal to Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Kauffmann, freed last May with two French diplomats after more
than three years in captivity, said on Radio Monte Carlo he and
others in a delegation from the French League of Human Rights met
with Dumas earlier this week.
   He reviewed the conversation with Dumas, then said: ``A final
point close to my heart, the problem of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
Mr. Dumas should intercede with the Iranians, who have shown they
had total power to have us freed, and I still say they are 100
percent masters of the situation.''
   A Lebanese serving a life term in France for a failed attempt to
assassinate a former Iranian prime minister urged Iran on Wednesday
to demand his freedom, which he said was promised in the deal for
Kauffmann's release.
   ``I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accord
between France and the parties concerned during the liberation of
the hostages, to remind France of its engagements,'' Anis Naccache
said in a statement issued through his lawyer.
   ``It is inadmissible to say that relations between the two
countries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in French
prisons.''
   President Francois Mitterrand had said he would be willing to
pardon Naccache if all French hostages were freed at once, but after
their release last May, French officials denied Naccache was part of
the deal.
   He led a five man team in the July 1980 attempt on Shapour
Bakhtiar, the shah's last prime minister.
   A bystander and a policeman were killed and three police officers
wounded. Bakhtiar, who still lives in the Paris area, was not hurt.

   Britain's Princess Diana hugged a child with AIDS
on Friday while visiting children suffering from the deadly disease
at a hospital before ending her three-day visit to New York.
   Hundreds of excited workers at Harlem Hospital craned their necks
for a glimpse of the 27-year-old princess when she arrived.
   ``There's been great joy in this lobby,'' said the pediatrics
director, Dr. Margaret Heagarty. ``The hospital has been buzzing for
days.''
   The visit capped the princess' short trip to New York, which
included stops at a homeless shelter and day-care center on
Manhattan's Lower East Side and several nighttime social events,
including a performance by the Welsh National Opera. She flew out of
Kennedy International Airport on a Concorde supersonic jet during
the afternoon.
   At Harlem Hospital, where she toured the pediatrics ward, the
former teacher placed her finger in the curled hand of a
11-month-old boy with AIDS as the infant gazed at her from his
grandmother's arms.
   Diana stroked four other infants. Then, Heagarty said,
``unrehearsed and of her own volition ... she picked up a little boy
who has AIDS and hugged him'' after first asking the 7-year-old:
``Are you heavy?''
   The princess also attended a 10-minute briefing given by
Heagarty; Dr. Elaine Abrams, the head of the pediatrics AIDS unit;
and Martha Grates, the nursing director.
   Diana long has been a champion of the battle against acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. In 1987, she declined to wear gloves
while shaking the hands of AIDS patients at Middlesex Hospital in
London, helping to ease the stigma of the disease, which cannot be
transmitted through casual contact.
   From the hospital, Diana went to a private reception at the
residence of British Consul General Gordon Jewkes for about 60
contributors to the Royal Academy of Music.
   John Curley, president of Gannett Co. Inc., and his wife, Ann,
said the Princess seemed at ease and stuck to small talk, mainly
about her visit, while she circulated among the groups of guests.
   ``She listened as much as she spoke,'' Curley said. ``And she
talked to everybody in the group.''
   When she was excusing herself from Curley's group, he recalled
her saying: ``I've to put on my skates and move on.''

<HEAD>Commission Vice Chair Doubts Sullivan Tried To Buy Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Georgia county commissioner has told
the FBI he doubts that Health and Human Services Secretary-designate
Louis Sullivan was trying to buy influence when his medical school
put another county commissioner on its payroll.
   Lee J. Roach, vice chairman of the Fulton County Commission, said
Friday the FBI, which is conducting a background investigation on
Sullivan, questioned him about the nominee's connection with
Reginald Eaves, a commissioner who was suspended upon conviction of
extortion last May.
   Roach and other Atlanta public figures interviewed by the FBI say
agents have concentrated on Sullivan's links to Eaves.
   It is this continuing inquiry that prompted the White House
earlier this week to get Congress to indefinitely postpone
Sullivan's confirmation hearing.
   Eaves was paid more than $34,000 over four years as a guest
lecturer at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta while he
promoted school issues before the commission. Sullivan is president
of Morehouse. Published reports has said Eaves gave only two
lectures.
   Roach dismissed the idea that Sullivan hired Eaves to increase
Morehouse's influence on commission votes.
   ``I was not aware of whether Dr. Sullivan knew or did not know
about Eaves' being hired. I guessed that he did not,'' Roach told
The Associated Press in recounting his interview with FBI agents,
which he said lasted 10-15 minutes.
   Eaves, who knew Sullivan from their undergraduate days at
Morehouse College, was an active supporter of the medical school
which Sullivan founded, but Roach said the rest of the commissioners
also strongly backed the school.
   ``The support for Morehouse was solid. We were committed to do
what we had to do for Morehouse,'' Roach said. ``There was nothing
Eaves could do to make that more solid.''
   Roach said commissioners were unaware Eaves was on the school's
payroll during the four years, but the link between Eaves and the
school became public last July after Eaves was convicted.
   Roach said he did not know how much direct contact Eaves had with
Sullivan.
   ``An old-time seasoned politician might have looked at that and
might have asked, `What's going on?' But Sullivan is not a
politician. He's an administrator,'' Roach said. ``If there's any
sin on Dr. Sullivan's part, it's that he's not a seasoned
politician,'' Roach said.
   Few issues involving Morehouse came before the board, though the
ones that did were important and usually involved large
appropriations to the school, Roach said.
   Earlier, Eaves told the FBI he was unsure whether Sullivan, his
friend and associate, knew he was being paid as a lecturer at the
school and that the nominee had never tried to influence him
improperly, according to Eaves' lawyer, Charles R. Floyd Jr.
   Eaves was questioned by the FBI earlier this week at a federal
prison in Montgomery, Ala., where he is serving a six-year sentence,
Floyd said.
   Eaves was convicted of accepting $35,000 from an FBI undercover
agent in exchange for votes on zoning issues.
   Reached by telephone at the prison Friday, Eaves declined to
discuss his relationship with Sullivan, whom he said he has known
since 1952. He said he is not granting any interviews because his
case is on appeal.
   The FBI has refused to discuss its background investigation.
   On Capitol Hill, the questions about Sullivan's link to Eaves do
not appear to threaten his nomination to head the largest federal
department.
   ``We don't read anything into this at all,'' said a Senate
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

   Space shuttle Discovery moved to the
launch pad Friday but it may have to be taken back to a hangar if
technicians on a tight schedule can't replace three engine pumps in
time for a mid-March liftoff.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission rode partway to the
launch pad with their spaceship, and later swooped low over the pad
in three T-38 jets as they headed back to their training base in
Houston. The shuttle arrived at the pad about 1 p.m.
   Tip Talone, Discovery's processing director, said March 10 is the
earliest possible launch for the planned five-day mission.
   Officials had said earlier that if Discovery could not be
launched by March 18, it would have to yield the pad to Atlantis,
set for liftoff on April 28. But on Friday, NASA officials said they
might extend that March 18 deadline a few days by trimming the
potential number of launch days available to Atlantis.
   Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available while a second
is being refurbished.
   Atlantis has priority over Discovery for use of that launch pad
because it is to send the Magellan probe to Venus. If Atlantis is
not launched April 28 to May 23, Venus will not be in the proper
alignment with Earth for the Magellan project again until 1991. By
contrast, the Discovery flight could be rescheduled relatively
quickly if it has to be postponed.
   ``If we can get (Discovery) out of here in mid-March, we will
protect the Magellan `window,''' Talone said, referring to the
period available for the Atlantis launch. ``We're going to make it.''
   NASA would like to have the entire launch period available for
Atlantis in case problems develop. But it might be willing to
shorten that window slightly if Discovery is nearly ready March 18.
   If Discovery's three suspect turbopumps can't be replaced in
time, its mission with a communications satellite would be put off
until later this year.
   Talone acknowledged there is a lot of work to be done and some
uncertainty about how long the pump replacement will take, because
technicians have never made such a changeout with a shuttle in the
vertical position.
   He said he expects all three of the old pumps to be out by next
Friday. The new units will arrive here the week of Feb. 12 and the
plan is to have all installed and checked out by the end of February.
   ``We don't feel any pressure on this,'' he said.
   After Atlantis flew in December, an inspection of the shuttle's
engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing housing in one of
three high-speed turbopumps that convert liquid oxygen to a gas.
   Engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion
resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the
manufacturing process. Because two of Discovery's turbopumps
underwent the same processing, NASA decided to replace all three
pumps with new, carefully inspected units, and to delay a planned
Feb. 23 launch.
   Shuttle engineers said Friday they think the corrosion resulted
when the trapped moisture mixed with chlorine from a common
household cleaner. They said the cleaning material probably was not
thoroughly wiped off after a scrub-down.
   The pumps are critical because the shuttle could explode if one
failed during liftoff.
   Attached to its two solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel
tank, Discovery moved out of an assembly building into the darkness
at 6 a.m. to begin a four-mile trip that ended seven hours later at
Launch Pad 39B. The transporter, a giant tracked vehicle called a
crawler, traveled at a maximum speed of 1 mph.
   The astronauts rode part of the way on the crawler. They are
commander Michael Coats, John Blaha, James Buchli, Bob Springer and
James Bagian. As they left for Houston, they swung their jets in a
wide circle over Discovery, then about half a mile from the pad.

<HEAD>Bush Envoy Choice Draws Criticism In Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders said Friday that the man
who may be the next U.S. ambassador to Mexico helped orchestrate the
civil war in Nicaragua and is a master of meddling in other nations'
affairs.
   Right-wing and leftist groups said relations with Washington
would worsen if President Bush selects John Negroponte as the next
ambassador.
   Sources in Washington said this week that Negroponte, a deputy
national security adviser, will be picked to replace Ambassador
Charles Pilliod.
   When he served as U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1982 to 1985,
Negroponte had a major role in assisting the U.S.-backed rebels
seeking to overthrow the leftist government in Nicaragua. Honduras
was a major base of operations for the rebels, known as Contras.
   Critics also said Negroponte also sought unduly to influence the
Honduran government.
   The Foreign Ministry said it would not comment publicly on the
selection until it had advised the U.S. government of its views. But
leftist and conservative parties suggested Mexico investigate
allegations about Negroponte and consider rejecting him.
   ``National authorities have the right to keep officials who are
highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming
posts in Mexican territory,'' Diego Fernandez, a leader of the
conservative National Action Party, was quoted as saying by the
liberal daily La Jornada on Friday.
   Amalia Garcia of the Mexican Socialist Party, the largest leftist
party, urged the government not to accept the appointment, the
newspaper said.
   She was quoted as saying it ``will make problems more complex and
deepen differences between the two nations.''
   Oscar Mauro Ramirez Ayala, leader of the congressional delegation
of the center-left Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, also
called for a thorough analysis of Negroponte's background, saying,
``according to reports about him, he's an expert in combating the
libertarian forces of the Latin American countries.''
   Jorge Bustamante of the Colegio del Norte, a northern think tank
in Tijuana, said in a television interview on Friday that the choice
was ``bad news for bilateral relations'' and worked against Mexico's
efforts to achieve peace in Central America.
   Mexico opposes U.S. support for the Contras.
   The independent but pro-government daily Excelsior ran a lengthy
front-page story on Thursday describing Negroponte as a diplomat who
``has earned the reputation of being more astute and calculating
than Machiavelli.''
   La Jornada, in a front-page editorial on Thursday, called the
appointment ``an ominous decision'' and began a three-part series
called ``The Path of an Ultra-Hawk.''
   The government newspaper El Nacional said Negroponte ``simply
complied, like a good ambassador, with orders from Washington'' in
the rebel effort.
   Negroponte had a close relationship with Gen. Gustavo Alvarez
Martinez, who was head of the Honduran military from 1982 until his
overthrow in 1984 and for a time was considered for a time the most
powerful figure in the country.
   As head of the national police in 1981, Alvarez told CIA director
William Casey the Nicaraguan rebels could operate from Honduran
territory, allowing the movement to take root.
   Alvarez was assassinated in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, in
January. A leftist group claimed responsibility for the killing.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of narcotics police seized more than
1,500 pounds of partially processed cocaine after a jungle shootout
in which two traffickers were killed and four wounded, officials
reported Friday.
   The U.S. Embassy said U.S. helicopters ferried Peruvian police,
but neither the aircraft nor U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agents were present during the fight.
   Police said the 1,570 pounds of cocaine base, which can be
refined into an an approximately equal quantity of pure cocaine, was
one of the largest single seizures of the drug in Peru.
   They said the raid took place Thursday at an airfield on the
outskirts of Uchiza in the cocaine-producing Huallaga Valley, about
265 miles northeast of Lima.
   Officials said police moved in while traffickers were loading the
drugs on a plane. They said 15 were arrested after the gunfight, and
no police were injured.
   About 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material of
cocaine, is grown in Peru. It usually is processed into cocaine base
and flown to Colombia, to be refined and delivered to the United
States and Europe.
   Washington is providing increased support for Peru's
anti-narcotics effort. The embassy said nine helicopters, operated
by U.S. civilian pilots, have been loaned to Peruvian authorities
and more than a dozen DEA agents are stationed in the jungle to
advise and train police.
   U.S. officials say cocaine trafficking generates at least $700
million annually in Peru. Police said the drugs seized Thursday were
worth $14 million locally but several times more when refined and
sold abroad.

   A statement from the Northumbria police force identified the man

Marsh, no hometown given, was believed to be traveling with him.
   Sarah Jane, 8, and David, 7, vanished from their home in
Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England after Lowery called to see

their mother, Barbara Lowery, was in the bathroom, according to the
statement.
   Lowery and his wife emigrated to the United States several years
ago, but they separated and she returned to Britain with the
children, police said.

   Federal regulators Friday announced the
resignation of Stuart D. Root, the executive director of the fund
that insures saving and loan deposits.
   Root, appointed to head the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. in October 1987, submitted his resignation on Monday. It will
be effective Feb. 10.
   Replacing Root as acting director will be Mary A. Creedon,
currently principal deputy director of operations, according to a
statement released Friday evening by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, the FSLIC's parent agency.
   The statement said Root, an attorney, would ``return to the
private sector.'' The telephone at Root's office was not answered
Friday evening.
   A bank board official, who declined to be identified, said Root
had decided earlier that he would step down after regulators'
completed their year-end rush to sell insolvent S&amp;Ls before
lucrative tax breaks were halved on Jan. 1.
   The official noted that top FSLIC officials maintained a brutal
work pace, including a 16-hour day on Chistmas. ``He just thought it
was time to go back to the private sector,'' the official said.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, praised Root for his
``substantial personal sacrifice'' and ``invaluable service.''
   Root, previously a lawyer at the New York firm of Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft, presided over roughly the first half of what will
be the largest government rescue of an industry ever. He had been a
top officer of Bowery Savings Bank in New York from 1981 to 1983.
   Under Root's direction, the FSLIC last year pledged $38 billion
to merge or close 205 insolvent institutions and keep 18 others
afloat. Seventy-five of the resolutions came in a final frenzy
during December. About 350 insolvent institutions remain.
   Creedon has been a bank board career employee since 1973, with
intervening service in what was then the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare and the Department of Commerce. She had
previously served as acting FSLIC director from December 1983 until
March 1987.
   She plans to return to her career position as deputy director
when the bank board finds a permanent FSLIC director, which is a
politically-appointed post, the statement said.

<HEAD>Soviet And American Military Academies May Exchange Cadets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet cadets may be strolling around the
West Point campus next fall while American cadets study at Russian
military academies, officials said Friday.
   An exchange of cadets between the two superpowers has been
approved by top government officials, according to West Point
officials. The idea was first proposed last July by the deputy
commander of the Soviet ground force, Col. Gen. Dmitri A.
Grinkevich, during a visit to West Point.
   The exchange of military cadets would be for brief periods,
probably lasting two weeks initially, according to Col. James
Hawthorne, director of academy relations at West Point.
   ``Anything can happen, of course, but there is no plan for it to
develop into anything longer than a short-term program,'' Hawthorne
said.
   The purpose of the exchange would be to help American and Soviet
cadets better understand each other.
   ``It's a cultural exchange program with military implications, of
course,'' said Hawthorne. ``The purpose is ... not for us to learn
the inner workings of the Red Army.''
   He said the program's benefits may be decades away.
   ``These will be 19 and 20 year olds. It will not be for some
years that they will be in any position to make decisions that might
result in an easing of tensions, but who knows? This may pay
dividends in the future.''
   He said U.S. and Soviet officials were to meet in Moscow to
negotiate the timing of the exchange.
   The proposed program reflects a significant change in
Soviet-American relations at West Point.
   Two years ago Soviet astronaut Vladimir A. Dzhanibekov was
forbidden by the Army to speak at West Point, and an invitation to
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was withdrawn on orders from the Pentagon.
   For 100 years, West Point has been training foreign cadets in a
four-year program. Currently, 30 cadets from foreign countries are
at the military academy.

   The mayor ordered 11 photographs in a
Vietnam War exhibit that made some people ``literally sick to their
stomach'' moved from City Hall lobbies to a less traveled corridor,
an official said Friday.
   Joseph Carbone, an aide to Mayor Biagio DiLieto, said the rest of
the exhibit, 56 photographs, remained in the lobbies.
   DiLieto feared the material was too graphic for children who
regularly visit the building on tours, Carbone said. In addition, he
said, some city employees complained after seeing the photographs.
   ``Some were literally sick to their stomach,'' he said.
   But veterans said the point of the traveling exhibit is to
illustrate the horrors of war, and that moving the offending
photographs undermined the message.
   ``I think the exhibit is the most powerful anti-war statement
I've seen. If people have to be made a little uncomfortable to
understand what war is about, I think that's fine. It's worth the
jolt,'' said Ernest Amabile, director of the New York State Vietnam
Memorial, which owns the collection.
   Joe Tomorrow, an artist and Vietnam veteran who helped city
officials hang the exhibit earlier this week, said the mayor's
action was ``very insulting to the spirit of the photographers who
died to take the pictures.''
   All 67 photographs were taken by news photographers who were
killed in the war or are listed as missing in action.
   ``I can respect that some people may be disturbed by it, but I
think they should also realize there is freedom of speech,''
Tomorrow said.
   The 11 photos show dead or wounded soldiers and civilians,
including one of bodies of 13 Vietnamese lying face down on a mud
flat and another of a medic attending to a young girl with a hole in
her thigh.
   Carbone said the mayor, by not removing the 11 photographs
entirely, sought to accommodate people who wanted to see the entire
exhibit and those who may find the most graphic pictures too painful.
   Most of the 15 previous exhibits of the collection have been at
art galleries or museums, but the show has been displayed at a
private high school and in a lobby of the state government complex
in Albany, N.Y.
   Visitors to galleries or museums are ``tacitly agreeing they will
accept being shocked, surprised or delighted,'' said Tamara Real,
New Haven's cultural affairs director. ``When people walk into City
Hall, they may end up being shocked or surprised, but that's not why
they are coming.''

   Gunmen in South Korea fired at a North Korean
military post in the demilitarized zone and ``committed a grave
military provocation,'' the North Korean Central News Agency
reported Saturday.
   The government-controlled news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said
``some 10 armed bandits'' fired several rounds of machine-gun fire
toward the post on the North Korean side on Friday.
   Radio Pyongyang also reported the alleged incident, saying it
``seriously threatened'' the North Korean security guards on duty,
and destroyed some facilities at the military post.
   ``The South Korean puppets committed a grave military provocation
by firing large-caliber machine-gun bullets at a post of our side in
the DMZ,'' southeast of Mount Sobang in the central part of the DMZ
that divides South Korea from its communist neighbor to the north,
the North Korean news agency said.
   The ``military provocation'' of the South Koreans ``fully shows
that they seek confrontation and war, not detente and dialogue,''
the news agency said.
   The North Korean news agency also reported North Korea seized two
South Korean ships that allegedly trespassed into North Korean
waters northwest of Changsan Cape on Jan. 29.
   The news agency said the alleged intrusion into North Korean
territorial waters was a ``deliberate plot,'' and that North Korea
captured the ships in ``self-defense.''
   South Korea has protested the apprehension of the two ships, and
an investigation of the incident was in progress, the news agency
said.
   It did not say how many crew members were aboard the Taeyang No.
37 and Taeyang No. 39, owned by the Taeyang Fisheries Association in
Inchon, South Korea.
   South Korea and North Korea reportedly have held a series of
secret talks on measures to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula,
including a possible summit meeting.
   The two countries technically remain at war since no peace treaty
was signed at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953. Each
claims to be the sole legitimate government of Korea.
   The shooting came on the same day the Seoul government announced
that an unprecedented economic agreement between a South Korean
business tycoon and North Korea ``could contribute to efforts to
acheive national unification.''
   The Seoul government Friday said it would propose special
legislation to facilitate the agreement between the nation's largest
business group and a state-run North Korean corporation to jointly
develop a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad plant in the
communist North.
   Chung Ju-Yung, founder and honorary chairman of the giant Hyndai
group, visited North Korea last month to discuss economic
cooperation between the two Koreas.

   Princess Diana, who returned Friday from her
two-day visit to New York, won praise from British newspapers for
making it a success, but some said the city expected a combination
of superstar and girl next door.
   ``The Big Apple Goes Bananas Over Princess,'' the Sun tabloid
crowed in a headline. The Daily Mail called her the ``Queen of New
York'' in glowing coverage.
   Some papers reported cool spots in a warm reception, and one said
Americans are over-eager and don't understand real royalty.
   ``Americans love a star with a generosity that is not quite
British,'' Charles Laurence wrote in the conservative Daily
Telegraph.
   ``They are imbued with an egalitarian streak that demands their
stars be as human as the boy or girl next door.
   ``This creates a sense of impatience that the royals insist on
the protocols of address and seniority even `off-screen' and a
refusal to accept that in such delicate matters as love and marriage
they are different from that boy and girl next door.''
   He and other British reporters said Americans had asked whether
making the trip alone meant Diana and was having marriage problems
with her husband, Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
   That sort of speculation was front-page news in Britain for a
time last year.
   The Telegraph gave first honors for what it called royal
exploitation to a shop that displayed ``crude'' mannequins of the
royal family with boxes for heads.
   To The Times, Diana's reception was ``hot and cold'' and
interpreted critical reports as anti-British. ``While small crowds
of fans gathered to cheer and socialites gathered for eleventh-hour
tickets'' to a reception, it said, ``others were declaring their
distaste for royal fuss.''
   ``New York's welcome for the princess veered to the extremes for
which the city is famous,'' the august journal pronounced.
   Reports in most papers ooohed and aaahed over both Diana's poise
and the fans who praised her glamour or waited for a quick glimpse.
   ``Leaving Prince Charles behind on her first visit to New York,
she enchanted hardened New Yorkers and turned thousands of ordinary
Americans into avid royalists,'' the tabloid Daily Mail said. It
printed a picture of Diana with the caption ``Instant hit.''
   Columnist Pete Hammill called Diana the ``most famous welfare
mother in the world,'' they said, an apparent reference to the fact
that her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, and other members of the
royal family receive government allowances.
   Diana and Charles, the Prince of Wales, live on his income from
from land and investments and do not receive such an allowance.

<HEAD>Arctic Air Blasts Into Northeast, Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Arctic air blasted its way into the Northeast and Texas on
Friday, bringing widespread freezing rain.
   Below-zero temperatures spread as far south as northern Oklahoma
and the Texas Panhandle. Temperatures fell to 30 below zero or
colder from northern Minnesota across parts of the Dakotas to
Montana and northern Wyoming.
   Some of the colder morning temperatures included 52 degrees below
zero at Wisdom, Mont., 43 below at Thorhult, Minn., and 42 below at
Roseau, Minn.
   The cold wave was expected to continue because the core of arctic
air remained over southern Yukon Territory in northwest Canada.
   Freeze warnings were issued for much of Louisiana and southern
Texas.
   Freezing rain and sleet made roads icy from New England across
parts of New York, Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley to eastern parts
of the southern Plains.
   Tree and utility line icing occurred in northeast Texas and
southeast Oklahoma, while up to 2 inches of snow and ice in the
mountains of southeast Oklahoma made roads nearly impassable.
   Snow piled up in some Western mountains, including 15 to 30
inches overnight in the Lake Tahoe area of western Nevada.
   Snow also blanketed parts of the Northeast, where 1 to 4 inches
fell across parts of New York state and throughout Vermont, New
Hampshire and Maine. Along the southern edge of Lake Michigan, 1 to
4 inches of snow fell and up to 6 inches fell at Hammond, Ind.
   Winds gusted up to 58 mph at Portland, Ore. and high wind
warnings were issued foor much of western Washington and western
Oregon.
   Heavy rain fell in parts of the lower Mississippi Valley across
the Tennessee Valley to Kentucky. A flash flood watch was posted for
southeast Kentucky.
   Record-low temperatures for the date were broken or tied in 20
cities, including Amarillo, Texas, and Valentine, Neb., which both
broke records set in 1905. Amarillo broke a 1-below record with a
reading of 4 below zero, and Valentine's record of 23 below was
supplanted by a 26-below reading.
   Meanwhile, record highs for the date were set or tied in 14
cities, including Augusta, Ga., which broke a 1956 record of 77 with
a 79-degree reading Friday.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 27 degrees
below zero at Bozeman and Butte, Mont., to 84 at Mayport Naval Air
station in Florida.
   The forecast for Saturday called for arctic air continuing to
spread slowly to the South and East; snow across much of the
Rockies; light snow from the southern Plains across the middle
Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley to New York state; snow,
sleet and freezing rain mixed from Arkansas across the Tennessee
Valley and the central Appalachians to the middle Atlantic Coast;
rain from the central Gulf Coast across the Carolinas to southeast
Virginia; showers across much of California.
   Predicted highs: below zero from the northern Rockies across the
northern and central Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley, and no
higher than 20 below zero across much of Montana and northern
Wyoming; above zero but below freezing from New England across the
central Appalachians, the Ohio Valley, the lower Tennessee Valley
and much of the Mississippi Valley to the southern Plains; also
below freezing from the central Plateau to the Pacific Northwest;
60s in southern Georgia and the desert Southwest; and 70s and 80s in
Florida.

   A member of the Soviet trade mission in
the Swiss capital has been expelled for spying, the Federal
Prosecutor's Office said Friday.
   The Foreign Ministry protested to the Soviet Embassy over illegal
activities by the diplomat, who had sought access to secret military
and other advanced technology in Switzerland since 1987, the office
said.
   The Soviet official, whose name and position were not published,
built contacts with Swiss companies and individuals with the aim of
gaining access to Western high technology and placing agents in
industries targeted by Moscow, the prosecutor's office statement
said.
   The diplomat has been recalled by Moscow and was barred from
re-entering Switzerland, the statement said.
   The last Soviet spy case in Switzerland was uncovered in May.
Communist agents account for about two thirds of all spies expelled
from Switzerland since 1970. Most cases in the 1980s have involved
economic espionage.

<HEAD>Bar Association President Calls For Waiting Period For Gun Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the American Bar Association said
Friday he has asked Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to recommend
a federal waiting period for the purchase of firearms, saying
loopholes in gun laws make it easy to buy semiautomatic weapons.
   Robert Raven, a San Francisco attorney and president of an
organization that represents 350,000 lawyers nationwide, said at a
news conference that the growing civilian use of military assault
weapons has focused attention on ``a problem which our nation cannot
afford to ignore.'' The association is meeting this weekend in
Denver.
   He cited the recent slaying of five schoolchildren and wounding
of 30 others in Stockton, Calif., and a shooting last week at a
Washington, D.C., school in which four were wounded.
   Raven said that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 gives Thornburgh
the power to develop and begin a federal system to identify
potential purchasers of handguns who are ineligible by federal law
to own firearms.
   ``We urge you to conduct the necessary study and swiftly complete
your recommendations, and we specifically urge you to recommend a
federal waiting period prior to the purchase of firearms,'' he wrote
in his Feb. 2 letter to Thornburgh. In the letter, Raven did not
recommend a time frame for a waiting period.
   Raven said he has not heard from Thornburgh, but that he hopes to
talk with him Saturday when the attorney general is scheduled to
attend the meeting.
   Raven said recent reports indicate the number of assault rifle
sales has risen from 4,000 in 1985 to nearly 40,000 last year.
   He said there is a ``glaring loophole in federal gun laws'' that
has created easy public access to the assault weapons, which can be
easily modified to be fully automatic.
   ``This problem is not going to go away on its own. After the
Stockton incident, people flocked to gun shops to buy AK-47
lookalikes or other semiautomatic military weapons,'' he said.
   ``Just last week, a gunman opened fire on 200 students at a
Washington, D.C., school, wounding four. Our nation must take
immediate action to put an end to such gun-related violence.''
   Also Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart
addressed the conference and urged lawyers to support a national
community service program. He said it would replace student loan
programs with a program that requires two to four years of community
service in return for a college education.

<HEAD>Why It Happened: Stroessner Tried To Retire To Top Officer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Paraguay, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's long tenure
as dictator ended because he tampered too much with the institution
that propelled him into power 34 years ago: the military.
   Stroessner tried to force his most powerful military leader, Gen.
Andres Rodriguez, into retirement, and his recent shakeups of the
army caused widespread resentment among his officers.
   That, combined with Stroessner's ultimate plans to have his son
succeed him as president, led to the violent coup that ended the
76-year-old general's rule and vaulted Rodriguez to power on Friday.
   ``Stroessner tried to take away some of the regiments controlled
by Rodriguez and thus reduce his power _ a technique he (Stroessner)
has used for years. But this time he committed a very big
indiscretion,'' Edgar Insfran, an interior minister for 10 years
during the 1950s and 1960s, said in an interview.
   Rodriguez was bolstered by disaffected officers who resented a
reshuffling last month that resulted in the retirement of about 100
army colonels and 35 navy captains, said opposition leader Domingo
Laino, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party and leader
of the National Accord opposition coalition.
   ``(Rodriguez) took advantage of the general ill feeling within
most of the military units to deal Stroessner a lethal blow,'' said
Laino, who returned in 1987 from a long period of exile and now is
Paraguay's best-known human rights activist.
   Conflict between the two generals had been simmering since 1984,
when the ruling Colorado Party split divisively into two factions:
the militants who supported Stroessner unconditionally, and the
traditionalists who favored democratic reforms and a distancing of
the 101-year-old party from the unpopular, authoritarian ruler.
   Differences between Stroessner and Rodriguez reportedly came to a
head in 1987, when the militant faction wrested leadership of the
party from traditionalists by using strong-arm tactics, including
the barring of traditionalist delegates from entering the congress
where leaders were elected.
   At that congress, Juan Ramon Chaves, in his 25th year as party
chairman, was unseated by Sabino Montonaro, Stroessner's interior
minister. On Friday, Rodriguez replaced Chaves, 87, as chairman to
the cheers of 15,000 people who gathered outside the party
headquarters.
   In the five months since Stroessner underwent a prostate
operation, from which he has been slow to recover, his militant
supporters have promoted his son Gustavo, a lieutenant colonel in
the air force, to succeed him. That, too, alienated the military.
   ``Rodriguez wanted to break away from the militant group that was
pushing for the continuance of Stroessner line by saying, `After
Stroessner, Another Stroessner,''' said Laino.
   In the perspective of Acevedo, ``The detonating factor was the
threat of retiring Rodriguez.''
   In spite of the predominantly military motives for the rebellion,
opposition leaders remain optimistic that Rodriguez could bring
greater democratization of Paraguay.
   ``We have firm hopes ... a government of transition cannot
survive without a democratic opening,'' said Euclides Acevedo of the
Revolutionary Febrerista Party.
   Other factors, such as Paraguay's deteriorating economy and
Stroessner's apparent failing health, played a role in the rebellion.
   ``The military crisis alone could not have done this,'' said Juan
Carlos Galaverna of the dissident Popular Colorado Movement. ``It's
important to remember the real protagonists are the people and the
military has simply been the instrument.''
   Said Insfran, ``The military issue is over now. Now they have to
deal with the political problem.''

<UNK>1988 Average Global Temperature Was Warmest</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year's global average temperature was the
warmest of the century, and the six warmest years of the century all
have occurred in this decade, a study shows.
   Meteorological officials said it was too early to conclusively
blame the greenhouse effect, by which heat from the sun is trapped
in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a
greenhouse.
   ``While a warming of this amount is consistent with the
greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide
and other man-made gases in the atmosphere, the earth's temperature
fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious
connection can yet be made,'' said David Parker, a climate expert at
Britain's Meterological Office headquarters in Bracknell, southern
England.
   It could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse
effect could be detected with much certainty, he said in a recent
interview.
   The apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global
weather records by the Meteorological Office and the University of
East Anglia in Norwich, southeast England.
   Their work showed that 1988's global average temperature was 57.2
degrees Fahrenheit, 0.5 degrees higher than the 30-year global
average ending in 1979.
   Since 1979, the succession of tiny increases has been too steady
for the weathermen to ignore, Parker said.
   The six warmest years in the century have all been in this
decade, he said. They were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986, in
descending order of warmth.
   Global temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees since the
beginning of the century, he said.
   Britain has had a mild winter, with temperatures averaging 5
degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in December and
January.
   Spring flowers are shooting up and blooming, and a blackbird
nested and reared its young two months early in a department store's
outdoor Christmas tree in Cheltenham, southwest England.
   The debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been
fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years, including a
serious drought in the United States last summer.
   Last week, U.S. scientists said they could find no evidence of
any overall temperature increases for the United States from 1895 to
1987.
   But they stressed that the United States makes up only 6 percent
of the earth's surface and said studies of other portions of the
earth could have different results.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry on Friday accused
the CIA and Salvadoran navy officers of plotting to falsely portray
the Nicaraguan government as an arms supplier to leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas.
   Officials said four Nicaraguan criminals were hired to steal
weapons from the Nicaraguan army and smuggle them into El Salvador,
where the arms were to be ``intercepted'' and shown as proof that
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government was aiding the rebels.
   The Nicaraguan government has long denied that it has shipped
weapons to the guerrillas fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed
government.
   The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the Interior
Ministry charges and no spokesmen were immediately available at the
U.S. Embassy in San Salvador, because of Vice President Dan Quayle's
visit.
   A Salvadoran navy spokesman, Lt. Jose Castellanos, said he knew
nothing about the accusations.
   Oscar Loza, operations chief for Nicaragua's State Security
Agency, said the alleged plot came to light after the four
Nicaraguans were arrested in December and January during an
investigation of a crime streak in Chinandega and Leon, two
provinces close to El Salvador.
   Loza said the men never got a chance to actually steal any
weapons.
   ``This is a group of delinquents used by the CIA and Salvadoran
naval intelligence in subversive acts against Nicaragua,'' Loza
said. ``That's the only type of people they can hire now.''
   Loza spoke at a news conference at the Interior Ministry, which
includes the security agency.
   He said the men were robbery suspects who fled to El Salvador in
November. El Salvador is across the Gulf of Fonseca from Nicaragua,
on the Pacific coast.
   After being arrested in El Salvador, the men allegedly were
approached by CIA agents and Salvadoran officials who offered them
$10,000 and told to return to Nicaragua and steal weapons from a
military installation on Los Castanones, a small island off the
northwestern port of Corinto.
   He said the men also were promised $5,000 for each Redeye
surface-to-air heat-seeking missile they stole and about $200 for
each AK-47 assault rifle.

   Some danced, some sang, some merely
gaped at the pools of blood in the street. Thousands cheered the end
of a 34-year-old dictatorship, and others wondered whether a new one
had begun.
   Thousands of people poured out of the homes on Friday, the
morning after the night that Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was overthrown
by his second-in-command, Gen. Andres Rodriguez.
   For many, Stroessner was the only leader they have ever had, a
man who snatched power in a 1954 coup, then lost it more than three
decades later to another military leader.
   But Paraguayans of all ages and political persuasions left their
homes to celebrate, to satisfy curiousity and to simply stare at the
damage left by nearly five hours of heavy fighting between rebels
and loyalist troops.
   An estimated 5,000 people gathered in downtown Asuncion. Two
blocks from the rallying crowd, wreckers towed away bullet-riddled
cars that were caught when rebel tanks and troops attacked police
loyal to Stroessner.
   Five hundred yards away, about 100 troops guarded the gray, 19th
century presidential palace overlooking the Paraguay River where
Stroessner ruled and where Rodriguez was sworn in.
   Two miles from downtown, small groups of citizens gathered in
front of the presidential escort battalion which remained loyal to
Stroessner and was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting
throughout the night.
   The roof of one of the four buildings had collapsed, and there
were gaping holes in the brick walls.
   Caravans of cars, many flying the red, white and blue Paraguayan
flag _ or the crimson banner of the ruling Colorado Party, or the
blue banner of the opposition Liberal Party _ drove through
downtown, horns honking.
   The nation's principal radio stations and their mobile units
carried on a marathon of interviews with politicians and citizens,
many of whom suffered at the hands of the Stroessner regime.
   ``I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected
our country for so long has come to an end, thanks to the armed
forces,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of ABC Color, the
country's biggest newspaper at the time it was shut down by the
Stroessner government in 1984 for, among other reasons, ``preaching
hatred among Paraguayans.''
   Zuccolillo said he will reopen the paper as soon as he can obtain
printing paper and ink.
   ``I'm happy that this man (Stroessner) is gone for good, but I'm
sad about the dead,'' said a young waitress who spent the night
huddled in a restaurant near the police headquarters. Estimates of
the dead ranged up to 200.
   ``I don't know if we're going too have democracy and liberty now,
but we've taken the first step,'' said Humberto Rubin, owner of
Radio Nanduti, forced to close in 1987 for its criticism of the
government.

<HEAD>Democratic Chief Reportedly Considering Massachusetts Run</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the outgoing Democratic national
party chairman, is considering a run for governor of Massachusetts
next year, two newspapers reported Friday.
   Kirk, who is well known in national political circles but not a
household name in his home state, was described as weighing a run
for governor in stories that appeared on Friday's front pages of The
Boston Globe and The Wall Street Journal.
   Kirk, who has never held elected office, is stepping down next
week as DNC chairman. He was traveling in Hawaii on Friday and could
not be reached.
   In Massachusetts, Democratic professionals said Kirk could be a
formidable candidate.
   The apparently orchestrated effort to float his name as a
contender took some Democratic political veterans by surprise, but
nearly all agreed that he would be a serious candidate.
   ``I'm surprised. My own sense of Paul's decision was he wanted to
return to private life,'' said political pollster and consultant
John Marttila. But he added, ``He's a capable, talented human
being.''
   Kirk, 51, was born in the Boston suburb of Newton and owns a home
in Marston Mills on Cape Cod. He had worked for a Boston law firm
and was expected to return there.
   Kirk, who turned down a chance for another four years as
committee chairman, would be seeking the post of Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, the former Democratic presidential nominee who has said he
will not seek re-election next year.
   Likely Democratic candidates for governor include Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy and former Massachusetts Attorney General Francis X.
Bellotti. In addition, there is great suspense surrounding the plans
of U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II.
   Kirk was a longtime aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
served as political director in the senator's 1980 presidential
race. According to Marttila and others, it is highly unlikely that
Kirk would enter a Democratic primary for governor if the race
included Joseph Kennedy, the senator's nephew.
   The younger Kennedy has topped the list of preliminary polls of
likely candidates for governor, but he has not revealed his plans.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out SATs As Sole Criterion In Awarding Scholarships</HEAD>

   In a sex discrimination challenge to the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, a federal judge ruled Friday that New York
state may not use SAT scores as the sole criterion in determining
scholarship winners.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker said it apparently was the first
case in which female students sought to use federal civil rights
statutes to challenge a state's reliance upon standardized tests.
   ``The evidence is clear that females score significantly below
males on the SAT while they perform equally or slightly better than
males in high school,'' Walker wrote.
   The judge said the state Education Department and its
commissioner, Thomas Sobol, both named in the suit, rely solely upon
the SAT in awarding Regents and Empire scholarships. He said that
practice ``deprives young women of the opportunity to compete
equally for these prestigious scholarships.''
   The judge ordered the state to change its method of awarding the
scholarships.
   State officials said they had no immediate comment on the ruling.
   Isabelle Katz Pinzler, director of the Women's Rights Project for
the American Civil Liberties Union and lead attorney for the case,
hailed the decision.
   ``It's really a very important, precedent-setting case,'' she
said. ``It's really not fair to anybody to give a scholarship based
on a three-hour test given on a Saturday afternoon rather than
(basing it upon) four years of high school.''
   Stanford vonMayrhauser, general counsel for the Educational
Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., the creator of the SAT, said:
``I think it (the ruling) will have limited application. Critics of
the SAT will have false comfort'' if they think the test is doomed.
   New York and Massachusetts are the only states that give state
scholarships based solely upon SAT scores.
   The suit was filed by the ACLU on behalf of the New York chapter
of the National Organization for Women, the Girls Club of America
and 10 female students.

   Director-actor John Cassavetes, known for his
free-wheeling, improvisational style in such movies as ``Faces'' and
``A Woman Under the Influence,'' died Friday. He was 59.
   Gena Rowlands, his wife of three decades and the star of most of
his films, was at his side when he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, said his publicist, Esme Chandlee.
   He died of complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver,
Ms. Chandlee said.
   Cassavetes was one of only four entertainers ever to be nominated
for an Academy Award in three different categories, Ms. Chandlee
said. He was nominated as best writer for his original screenplay of
``Faces'' in 1968; as best supporting actor in ``The Dirty Dozen''
in 1967; and as best director for his original film ``A Woman Under
the Influence'' in 1974.
   Among Cassavetes' best-known acting roles was as the husband of a
woman who conceives a baby by the devil in ``Rosemary's Baby,'' a
1968 film that also starred Mia Farrow.
   He also starred with Miss Rowlands, Susan Sarandon and Molly
Ringwald in ``Tempest,'' director Paul Mazursky's film adaptation of
Shakespeare's play, among other films.
   ``Faces,'' which he also directed, was a personal, probing study
of loneliness. The film won three Oscar nominations and five Venice
Film Festival awards.
   ``A Woman Under the Influence'' is the story of the souring of a
middle-class marriage, which starred his wife.
   ``I think they both had a great fondness for `A Woman Under the
Influence,''' Ms. Chandlee said of Cassavetes and Miss Rowlands.
``It was certainly his most commercial film.''
   The movie earned Miss Rowlands a Golden Globe as best actress and
an Academy Award nomination for best actress.
   His first movie as a director was ``Shadows,'' filmed from
1957-60 on what amounted to pennies, using a hand-held 16mm camera.
Technically, the film was a misfit. But as an art form, it has been
referred to by film buffs as a masterpiece. The movie is about a
fair-skinned black girl living in New York with her two brothers.
   ``The type of films we do are different,'' Cassavetes once said
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Commercial movies have
no feeling, no sensitivity. Most people tell me that people won't
understand films with feeling. But everyone can feel.
   ``I think people are very stiff. Money makes people stiff and we
want it and we have to pay the penalty. I never agreed with
stiffness. I think people have an understanding of what their life
is. I define success by being a realist and not humiliating people.
I'm a revolutionary _ but not in the political sense.''
   In 1980, he was honored by the Museum of Modern Art with a
retrospective of his works. That same year, he was also honored by
Filmex, the Los Angeles Film Festival. He was 50 at the time.
   ``By the age of 50, I would like to know that I'm not dead _ that
there's some continuity to my life,'' he said.
   Cassavetes, a native of New York, grew up poor. His break in
acting came when he played a brooding young bullfighter in a
production of the old ``Omnibus'' TV series in 1953. That led to
roles in ``Playhouse 90,'' ``Studio One,'' ``Kraft Theater'' and
``Climax.'' His official debut on the silver screen was as an extra
in ``14 Hours'' in 1951. He starred in ``Taxi'' in 1953 and was in
``The Night Holds Terror'' in 1955.
   He remained an independent filmmaker who marched to the tune of a
different drummer. ``If it came to a good film or what makes
feeling, I'd take feeling,'' he once said.
   Cassavetes developed close friendships with a few actors,
including Peter Falk. A spokeswoman for Falk said he was
``devastated'' by Cassavetes' death, and production of the reprised
``Columbo'' television series was halted so Falk could be at home
alone.
   ``This has been a terrible jolt for Peter,'' said his assistant,
April Araynell. ``There was a very strong bond between them, a love
between them. Peter is just trying to hold up any way he can.''
   Cassavetes and Miss Rowlands were married in March 1958 and their
careers were seldom separate after that. They had three children:
Nicholas, Alexandra and Zoe.
   Cassavetes had a vast enthusiasm for films, especially his own.
   ```A Woman Under the Influence' rips your guts out,'' he said.
``I have seen it 30 times and I can't look at it any more. It is too
powerful an experience.''
   Private funeral services were scheduled for Monday in Los Angeles.

   The Chinese government has officially invited
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China, setting the stage
for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   The Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen extended the invitation in talks with his
visiting Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze, who ``accepted the
invitation and expressed his gratitude.''
   No date for the visit was given, although it is widely expected
to take place this spring. Qian said earlier today that Shevardnadze
would announce a date at a news conference Saturday before he leaves
China for Pakistan.
   Gorbachev will be the first Soviet leader to visit China since
Nikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959, a year before
rapidly deteriorating bilateral relations led to an end of Soviet
technical and military aid to China.

   One-sixth of America's 1988 measles patients
came from Los Angeles County, where an ongoing outbreak among mostly
Hispanic toddlers demonstrates a nationwide need to vaccinate 1- to
4-year-olds, experts say.
   ``We seem to have a toddler immunization gap,'' said Dr. Stephen
Waterman, chief of acute communicable disease control for the county
Department of Health Services. ``A lot of those kids don't get
vaccinated until they go to school,'' where measles shots are
mandatory.
   The extent of the outbreak of the virus-caused respiratory
disease in Los Angeles County was reported by the national Centers
for Disease Control in today's issue of the agency's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report.
   The county last year reported 513 measles cases, 17.5 percent _
or more than one-sixth _ of the nation's total of 2,933, the
Atlanta-based CDC said. Two of the patients, ages 8 months and 23
months, died.

   Jack Kemp blunted last-minute ethical questions
about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding House limits to win
unanimous Senate confirmation as secretary of housing and urban
development.
   The Senate voted unanimously to confirm Kemp, the former
professional football player who served 18 years as a congressman
from Buffalo, N.Y., and unsuccessfully ran for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1988.
   The vote followed by hours the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Development Committee's vote to recommend Kemp's nomination to the
full Senate.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the housing and urban
affairs subcommittee, said Democrats on the committee and the
committee's staff concluded that Kemp's acceptance of thousands of
dollars in speaking fees above House limits was ``part of a
misunderstanding'' and no bar to his confirmation.

   Riot police arrested nine people during a
second night of arson and rock-and-bottle throwing that erupted in a
mostly black neighborhood following reports a suspected drug dealer
died in police custody.
   ``The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots,
you're going to get arrested,'' said Mayor Sandy Freedman after
police controlled the disturbance Thursday.
   About 70 police officers cordoned off the College Hill
neighorhood for nearly three hours after sunset. An officer hit by a
brick, Sgt. B.J. Curry, was treated at Tampa General Hospital and
released.
   ``It was very sporadic. Nothing on a major scale. It was kind of
hit and run,'' said Sgt. Walter Sluga.

   U.S. experts were en route today to
Antarctica to clean an oil spill that threatens the delicate
ecosystem, but an environmentalist said only a few weeks remain
before the area's frigid waters begin to freeze.
   A giant C-5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gear
to the southern port of Punta Arenas on Thursday. The crew was to
board on a U.S. research ship departing today for the spill, about
590 miles south of the Cape Horn.
   Anton Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, said the vessel Polar
Duke would take about four days to reach the spill, just off the
Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S. scientific
base Palmer Station.
   However, a Greenpeace spokesman cautioned that less than two
months remain to contain the damage.

<HEAD>Are Bush and Greenspan in Disagreement?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While critics say he has broadcast dissonant
signals about the economy's health, Alan Greenspan has made it clear
beyond any misunderstanding that his No. 1 fear is inflation.
   Based on Greenspan's repeated acknowledgment of that fear, and
his actions in allowing interest rates to rise substantially since
becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Greenspan might appear to be at
odds with the White House.
   Is he?
   On January 24, Greenspan told Congress that in his view inflation
was too high _ from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth of 1988
the gross national product deflator, a measure of inflation, rose
4.1 percent compared with 3.1 percent a year earlier. He said it
might have been even worse were it not for higher interest rates.
   The next day President Bush stated that his fears of inflation
were not as acute as those apparently held by Greenspan, igniting
rumors of a rift between the Fed and the White House.
   Greenspan denies it, stating that such notions are exaggerations.
The White House hasn't declared itself on whether there is a
disagreement but there are signs that a fundamental one could
develop.
   It lies in differing priorities.
   Greenspan has a lot of experience with inflation, having honed
his advisory skills during the days of the great and unlamented
inflation of the 1970s. He knows that when it gets a head of steam
it can't be stopped short of a crash.
   In his view, that point may be approaching. There is evidence
that labor is beginning to press for more costly benefits if not
higher wages. The jobless rate is down to very low 5.3 percent and
perhaps falling still. There may be little idle industrial capacity
that can accommodate further growth.
   Bush's economic plan is based on economic growth, which rising
interest rates generally obstruct. There are many reasons, political
and economic, for seeking that growth. None is more important than
this: Growth means revenues.
   Nobody needs to be reminded how important higher revenues are for
reducing a budget deficit, which the administration is commanded by
law to do. Higher revenues improve your options; you don't need cut
politically popular projects.
   Higher interest rates can cause a lot more problems for the
administration, if only for the reason that nobody owes more money
and pays more interest than Uncle Sam. Interest costs today are
about 15 percent of budget outlays.
   Higher interest rates also impact business development. The
answer to capacity restraints is for industry to expand production
facilities. But will that happen if business fears interest rates
will continue to climb?
   The expansion issue touches on two more important considerations,
the value of the dollar and the trade deficit. Higher interest rates
might strengthen the dollar. A stronger dollar would hurt U.S.
exports, and might raise imports.
   Higher interest costs also would add difficulties to an already
impossibly complex and politically tricky issue, that of bailing out
the failed savings and loan associations. As it is, this issue is a
no-win situation anyway.
   Nobody yet knows, for example, where the scores of billions of
dollars needed will come from. Now consider that just tiny increases
in interest rates could make that job billions of dollars more
difficult to manage.
   It might be, as Greenspan indicates, that any differences of
opinion with the White House are exaggerated. But the potential is
there, and if only minor differences now exist they could become
exaggerated by events.

<HEAD>`Kermitterrand' the Frog Knocks French Politicians on TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For millions of French television viewers, the
nightly news begins when Kermitterrand the Frog discusses the day's
events over aperitifs with a long-haired pig in pearls and an
anxious eagle called Black Jack.
   This is the Babete Show (Dumb Animals Show), five minutes of
Gallic wit and sarcasm broadcast nightly on the private TF1 station
before the 8 p.m. news and featuring France's favorite political
puppets.
   The takeoff on Sesame Street's Muppets is not intended for
children only.
   The undisputed star of the show is Kermitterrand, a wide-mouthed
bright green frog, who combines the face of President Francois
Mitterrand with the body of the Muppets' Kermit. He also is known as
God.
   The show has become a must for some 36 percent of the television
audience _ 7.2 million homes _ making it France's most-watched show.
Taxi drivers and doctors tune in, but no one follows it as closely
as politicians.
   A single episode can touch on a half-dozen news items ranging
from the firing of Daniel Barenboim as artistic director of the new
Opera-Bastille to an insider trading scandal.
   ``We take the news, then twist and torture it,'' Jean Amadou, a
well-known satirist and one of the show's creators, said in an
interview.
   ``By having the puppets talk in down-to-earth, everyday language
we show that the coded, esoteric talk of politicians is worn out.''
   Mitterrand, who is a Socialist, reportedly is amused by
Kermitterrand's ranting and raving and has aides record his antics
when he can't watch them himself. The president has also been known
to regale intimates with imitations of Kermitterrand, and references
to the show have crept into his speeches.
   The anxious eagle, Black Jack, is a play on former Premier
Jacques Chirac. The long-haired pig in pearls (Miss Piggie in the
Muppets) is supposed to be Georges Marchais, the French Communist
leader.
   Their colorful cohorts include Rocroa the crow (Premier Michel
Rocard, also a Socialist); Barzy, the kind, cuddly bear (former
Premier Raymond Barre), and a curly haired goat (Culture Minister
Jack Lang).
   ``Please excuse this question which might seem idiotic, Oh Great
Monarch of Triumph, but weren't you supposed to be in Bulgaria
today, bah-bah,'' Lang-the-goat asked Kermitterrand in a recent
episode.
   ``Of course I'm in Bulgaria, puerile lamb,'' Kermitterrand snaps.
``What's the point of being God, if you can't be in two different
places at the same time, eh?''
   Another memorable segment found humor in the release of the last
three French hostages from Lebanon a few days before the first round
of presidential elections last May.
   Charles Pasqua, interior minister in Chirac's conservative
government then in office, took the credit. Chirac was criticized on
grounds he was trying to manipulate voters.
   ``How did you get them to release the hostages?'' one incredulous
puppet asked a long-tusked walrus (Pasqua).
   ``Simple,'' the walrus replied. ``I promised to give them back on
Monday.'' Amadou said he never dreamed the show would be so
successful.
   Kermitterrand has graced magazine covers, Babete watches are the
latest chic souvenir and co-creator Jean Roucas, who appears on the
screen with the puppets, is stopped frequently for autographs.
   ``People realize more and more that politicians are conniving
wheeler-dealers, on the left and the right, and we say so on the
show,'' said Roucas, 36, who does the voices for all the puppets.
   ``The political press in France is at the service of politicians.
We're saying things the way they are.''
   The Bebete Show _ its title plays on the twin meanings of the
word ``bete,'' stupid and animal _ is written the same day it's
broadcast, taking final form in midafternoon. By the time they meet,
Amadou and Roucas have already combed the newspapers and the jokes
fly.
   France recently has been following the news of an insider trading
scandal that touched friends and associates of Mitterrand and forced
the resignation of a high-ranking Finance Ministry official.
   On the final show before a break _ it will return in late
February _ Kermitterrand appeared as a machine-gun toting
Kermitterambo.
   Furious because he could neither stop his political enemies from
fueling the insider scandal nor prevent Amadou and Roucas from
writing it into their script, Kermitterambo gunned them all down.
   Alone at last, he quickly reassured viewers.
   ``Don't worry, on Feb. 27, God will bring them all back to life.''

   The Spanish-language television networks
Univision and Telemundo are convinced they have more viewers than
Nielsen and Arbitron ratings show, so they may pay for a special
survey of Hispanic viewers.
   The competing networks joined last year to explore better ways of
charting Hispanic viewing habits. Much is at stake, because ratings
are used as a basis of negotiating advertising rates.
   ``I don't think that it's any secret that the Hispanic
representation of households (included in the survey samples) is far
less than it should be,'' said Univision Vice President Emma
Carrasco.
   Both A.C. Nielsen Co. and Arbitron Ratings Co., the leading
television audience rating services, bid on a possible contract that
could total $40 million over the next five years, said Norman Hecht,
chairman of the Spanish Television Research Committee formed by the
two networks.
   Tests of the Hispanic ratings could start next fall.
   Both ratings companies propose using ``people meters,'' hand-held
devices viewers use to punch in individual code numbers as they
watch television to allow tracking by age and gender.
   Univision and Telemundo have competed for Hispanic viewers with
increased newscasts and new entertainment shows since 1987. They
hope a tailormade rating service will come up with higher audience
numbers.
   ``The payoff will be that we will get our share of the general
market advertising budget,'' said Milagros Carrasquillo, Univision's
director of network research. ``Right now we're less than 1 percent
of the total revenue to television, and we're 8 percent of the total
marketplace.''
   Hispanic broadcasters have long contended differences in
language, culture, and viewing habits have led to low Hispanic
representation by the rating services.
   ``They're underreporting our core audience,'' said Mike Martinez,
sales manager for Los Angeles' KMEX. He said only 17 percent of
Hispanics responded to Arbitron's May ratings survey in Spanish, but
station-commissioned surveys show Spanish is preferred by about 80
percent of the area's Hispanics.
   The rating services don't admit they're shortchanging
Spanish-language stations, pointing to bilingual materials and other
adjustments. In Arbitron's November ratings for Los Angeles, 19.8
percent of households were listed as Hispanic, slightly below the
area's 20.7 percent Hispanic representation in the general
population, a spokeswoman said.
   A national survey targeted at Hispanics and fine-tuned to their
language and culture could produce a better picture of Hispanic
viewing. But Arbitron research chief Jim Peacock doesn't think it
will mean a big ratings jump for Spanish-language stations.
   ``The (Hispanic) market is coming of age. There is a lot more
money, real or potential, at stake,'' said Donald Travis, Telemundo
general sales vice president in New York. U.S. Hispanics number 18.5
million and their number is growing at a faster rate than the U.S.
population overall, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
   Hispanics are projected to spend $141 billion in 1989, according
to Hispanic Business magazine, and are being targeted by more big
companies. Last year, advertisers spent $550 million to reach
Hispanics, about 46 percent going to Spanish-language television,
the magazine reported.
   For several years Univision has paid Miami's Strategy Research
Corp. to measure Hispanic TV viewing through personal interviews.
These surveys show greater numbers for Hispanic television stations
than Arbitron's ratings of the same markets.
   Arbitron's May book showed KMEX averaged 170,000 homes in
prime-time evening hours, while the Strategy Research figures
estimated 470,000 homes, Martinez said.
   ``Many advertisers say Strategy Research overstates the numbers
and Arbitron understates them,'' said Telemundo's Travis. ``There is
a sizable market out there. We have to have that measured by a
rating system that is accepted throughout the country.''
   Univision's Carrasco called Strategy Research's approach ``the
most effective technique that is currently available'' and said its
figures are widely accepted by advertisers most familiar with the
Hispanic audience.
   Strategy Research is not bidding on the possible new contract.
Instead, the two Spanish-language networks are reviewing Arbitron
and Nielsen proposals that addressed their concerns.
   A new rating tool could also break out Hispanic viewing for ABC,
NBC and CBS, not just Univision and Telemundo. Telemundo's Travis is
willing to take the risk, apparently confident his network's numbers
will increase.
   ``We're not interested in loading the deck. What we want is an
accurate cross-section of the U.S. Hispanic population,'' said
Travis. ``Any service we have will include ratings for the Anglo
networks. It would give us an idea of where the crossover is and
what we're up against.''

   The syndicated travel show ``The Great
Escape'' takes you to wonderful places around the world, but co-host
Bob Chandler admits that everything is not quite what it seems.
   ``This show is geared for the consumer,'' said Chandler, a former
pro football player who is co-host with Michelle Russell. ``We don't
offer vicarious travel, like `The Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.' We occasionally do an upscale place, but mostly we tell
people about places they can afford to visit. A part of any
successful show is knowing what your direction is. Our direction is
to go to places that are easily accessible and that are good.''
   So, you will rarely hear a discouraging word.
   ``We don't go out of our way tosay something is bad or to be
critical,'' said Chandler. ``If we run into a situation we don't
like, we'll handle it by omission. We're not selling out, and it's
not because we're afraid of losing our tradeoff. It's just that our
goal is that we're looking only for the great places to visit.
   ``We get tradeoffs in the form of free travel and accommodations.
We're up-front about that. We've got two hosts and four camera crews
going all over the world and it's the only way we could afford it.''
   It's common practice for television shows to accept free travel
and accommodations, but federal regulations require that such
arrangements be acknowledged on the air.
   Each weekly half-hour show visits three places: a feature
destination that's usually foreign, a Discover America segment and a
weekend escape.
   Chandler has spent a large part of the past few years on the
road. First as co-host of ``Two on the Town,'' a magazine show for
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, and for ``The Great Escape.''
   He had been a been a sportscaster after his football career. He
was a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills and played in Super Bowl
XV for the Oakland Raiders. He earned a law degree while playing
professional football.
   ``For this show we're on the road 10 to 15 days, then we're home
for about the same time,'' he said. ``It's tough to complain about
this job. People say, `You kidding? You get to travel everywhere.'
They don't see us packing 18 trunks of equipment, checking into a
different hotel every night. I was out once last year for 27 days.
We were in seven different locations.''
   Chandler said ``The Great Escape'' uses only original footage,
taped around the world. The only exception was one minute of the
Follies Bergere at Las Vegas.
   ``We get offered a lot of footage,'' said Chandler, ``but one of
our strengths is our cameramen. We have four crews and they
frequently work without a host or correspondent. Besides Michelle
and myself, we have used correspondents in Australia and Europe.''
   Chandler and Russell go to different places so they can cover
more places.
   ``I've been just about everywhere,'' he said, ``but when we start
traveling again in March I hope we go to the Orient. The funny thing
is, before this I'd only been out of the United States once.
   ``The great thing is you learn a lot about the areas. You have to
do research. And when you get there you get involved with the
people. You get to see a lot more than tourists do.
   ``I do have some favorite places,'' he said. ``The Northern
Island of New Zealand, at the Huka Lodge. It's like an old-fashioned
hunting club. There's a wonderful lake for trout fishing and you can
go skiing only a few hours away. I also love the eastern coast of
Australia, from Sydney to the Great Barrier Reef. The third place is
the South of France, from the Burgundy region and the Loire Valley
to the Mediterranean.''
   Where does Chandler go on vacations? ``I usually stay home,'' he
said. He has two children and he and his wife, Marilyn, are
expecting another child.

   When George Bailey's savings and loan verged on
collapse, it escaped a conniving financier's takeover plot with help
from depositors who donated cash to help the thrift account for
thousands of missing dollars.
   That happens only in the movies.
   The script from the 1940s Hollywood classic ``It's A Wonderful
Life,'' starring Jimmy Stewart as the virtuous smalltown banker,
would have to be revamped today to dramatize the frightening world
of failing thrifts.
   While Washington may eventually require depositors or taxpayers
to help rescue the country's most beleaguered savings institutions,
few George Baileys have emerged to rally the little people.
   Instead, the government has embraced some of Wall Street's
biggest dealmakers _ people known for multibillion-dollar buyouts
and takeovers, not low-risk lending and Christmas clubs.
   They include such names as Texas tycoon Robert M. Bass and Revlon
Group Inc. Chairman Ronald O. Perelman, both ranked among Forbes
magazine's richest 400 Americans.
   In exchange for passing off the rescue effort to these
financiers, the government has offered them guarantees against
losses and in some cases magnanimous tax benefits. But the tradeoff
is raising questions about the buyers' motives and their impact on
the industry's long-term survival.
   ``It's very unclear whether many of these investors want to be in
the S&amp;L business on an on-going basis,'' said John J. Kriz, a thrift
and banking analyst at Moody's Investors Service. ``A number of
them, no doubt, have exit strategies which call for flipping the
businesses to others.''
   Critics of the bailouts have implied that the low-paid
bureaucrats who rushed to seal many of these deals at the end of
1988 were no match for the shrewd investors who entered bids.
   Some of those critics now worry that sickly thrifts could be used
by their new owners as government-backed vehicles to engage in the
kind of business adventurism that originally sucked the institutions
into insolvency.
   Others believe the buyers simply saw short-term opportunities to
exploit the grandiose tax benefits, which in some cases are worth
more than the government's sale price of an institution.
   John Buchanan, a First Boston Corp. thrift analyst and former
chief of staff at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the government's
S&amp;L regulator, said takeover artists look at failed S&amp;Ls ``as an
opportunity to make money, quite frankly. Given the nature of the
transactions they struck, I'm certain they're not going to do it for
free.''
   By far the two deals that best symbolize these concerns were the
board's biggest sale, the American Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Stockton, Calif., to a group run by Bass; and the sale of five
bankrupt Texas thrifts to a concern run by Perelman.
   In the American Savings arrangement, the Bass group is putting up
$500 million, receiving $1.7 billion in government aid and obtaining
control of a vast network of assets worth more than $30 billion.
   Perelman's group is putting up $315 million and getting $5.1
billion of government aid in exchange for savings units with assets
of more than $12 billion.
   Bass, 40, is one of four Texas billionaire brothers, known as
``the boys,'' in their hometown Fort Worth, who control an empire of
businesses that include oil wells, real estate and stocks.
   Over the last few years, Bass has dabbled in broadcasting and
publishing, with strategic investments in Taft Broadcasting Co.,
Macmillan Inc. and, most recently, Houghton Mifflin Co.
   Perelman, 45, is known as a ruthless negotiator and Manhattan
party-circuit celebrity, whose sprawling MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
Holdings Inc. has interests ranging from jewelry to licorice extract.
   By far Perelman's most flamboyant acquisition has been Revlon,
the cosmetics maker. He's also made unsuccessful, but lucrative,
runs at Gillette Co., the men's toiletry maker.
   Both men rarely grant interviews and have said little about their
reasons for buying S&amp;Ls, an area in which they've had no experience.
   But the financiers have hired highly respected, conservative
thrift managers to run the businesses, an outward indication they
want them to pursue the historic strength of the thrift industry:
low-risk home mortgages.
   That would be a welcome change from the ambitious commercial real
estate lending and generous rates of interest on deposits offered by
hundreds of now-insolvent thrifts, primarily in the Southwest, that
resulted from deregulation in the early 1980s.
   Perelman and his aides declined to respond to three telephone
requests for comment. Bass likewise failed to respond to requests,
but people familiar with his S&amp;L venture said Bass was in it for the
long term.
   The Bass negotiations weren't without controversy. In September
he proposed creating a thrift subsidiary that would use $1.5 billion
in assets to engage in merchant banking activities such as
takeovers. The proposal created such a stir it was hastily scrapped
and the merchant banking plans were scaled way back at the behest of
government regulators.
   The Bass and Perelman deals differ in a number of key ways; those
differences may determine how well the two S&amp;L ventures perform and
how long they survive. For one thing, Bass will get relatively few
tax advantages, while Perelman can apply previous losses from the
thrifts as tax deductions for his other businesses.
   Those deductions are considered so valuable that a rival takeover
strategist, Saul Steinberg, sued the government and Perelman,
claiming his offer for the same S&amp;Ls was unfairly rejected from
consideration.
   On the other hand, some analysts have said, Bass's acquisition
has a greater chance of success over the long haul, partly because
of government-imposed restrictions on the types of investments it
can make.
   American Savings' 187 branches also provide a well-established
lending network, and the government itself has a 30 percent
profit-participation interest.
   ``American Savings is somewhat tarnished but it's not a bad one.
Assuming the deal holds together from the government end, Bass
should do fairly well,'' said Bert Ely, a thrift industry consultant.
   Ely dismissed much of the criticism leveled at the financiers who
have purchased thrifts, saying any blame must be shared by
regulators and Congress.
   ``We can beat up on the Perelmans of the world; these guys are
getting rich, and maybe they are, but only because a federal agency
went into these deals and did them the way they did,'' he said.

   A posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago
for emperors awaits President and Mrs. Bush when they come to China
Feb. 25. The guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs
$20,000 a night for regular guests.
   An electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main
bedroom.
   The Diaoyutai State Guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction
to the austerity of today's China.
   ``Yes, we are socialist,'' explains Sun Guotong, one of the
officials who run the place, ``but for heads of state you must have
such things.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will stay
there if he accepts China's invitation to visit this spring. So will
Prince Charles and Princess Diana when they come in November.
   The 26-room guesthouse on the complex, simply called No. 18, was
remodeled for Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Beijing in 1986.
   The Chinese government pays the bill for official and state
guests such as these, but others have to come up with $20,000 a
night.
   Diaoyutai, which means ``fishing terrace,'' sits on 100 acres of
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond.
   The complex is made up of 15 large guest villas. No. 18 is the
most sumptuous.
   From its gold-plated bathroom fixtures and silk-covered walls to
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne, the villa
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby, gray city where
egalitarianism so lately was in style.
   But ideology seems to stop at the gates to Diaoyutai. Even during
the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Chairman Mao
Tse-tung's wife, Jiang Qing, relaxed in villa No. 17 by watching
Western movies.
   China's shifting foreign policy can be charted, however, from the
guest list. In 1959, when the separate villas were built, most of
the guests were communist comrades.
   Now, Director Cheng Shaoliang said, most guests are Americans and
Japanese.
   The Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Presidents
Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were among the
parade of world leaders who stayed at Diaoyutai.
   ``Other hotels in Beijing may be more convenient _ guests can
come and go more freely,'' Cheng said in a recent interview. ``But
we offer quiet and security they can't match.''
   Diaoyutai's telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls
to guests if the caller doesn't know their room number. The police
who stand at attention at the compound's gates admit only cars whose
license plates have been cleared in advance.
   For the guests, however, almost anything is possible. Cheng tells
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the
winter, when they were out of season. The guesthouse sent Peoples'
Liberation Army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and
try to find some, he said.
   ``Now we wouldn't do that,'' Cheng said. But almost. Diaoyutai
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has
special ingredients flown in from all over the country.
   It pays 1,000 yuan ($270) a pound for a rare herb necessary for a
special scallop soup.
   ``Hotels won't do that,'' Cheng said.
   With that kind of overhead, rates start surprisingly low at $140
a night for a standard room. Presidential suites cost $500 a night.
   But the fanciest villas, No. 12 and No. 18, must be rented in
their entirety for $20,000 a night.
   Among other recent users of No. 18 were Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi of India and Armand Hammer, the American industrialist.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana are booked for Nov. 1.
   No. 18's presidential suite includes separate his-and-her
bedrooms and bathrooms, each thickly carpeted and decorated with
costly art works.
   ``He'' gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath.
``She'' gets a sunken tub with brass rails.
   To help cover its annual 28-million-yuan ($7.5-million) budget,
Diaoyutai began selectively accepting non-VIP tourists and
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign
businessmen last year.
   But non-VIPs need connections to get a room reservation.
   ``People can't come in off the street,'' said Sun Guotong,
Cheng's deputy.
   The club, with a $40,000 membership fee, also is intended only
for ``the leading people,'' Sun said.
   ``If a lot of people come, the air is not so fresh,'' he added,
while walking through the deserted exercise room, three-lane bowling
alley and billiards room. The indoor swimming pool is only four feet
deep _ ``very safe'' for visiting leaders, Sun said.
   He paused in front of a green felt-covered table used for playing
the Chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new
game.
   Mahjong in China is practically synonymous with gambling, which
is illegal. Do guests gamble?
   ``I don't know,'' Sun said diplomatically.

<HEAD>North Trial Comes Two Years After Disclosure of Iran-Contra Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By his own account, Oliver L. North would have
fallen on his sword for President Reagan more than two years ago if
it weren't for the prospect of the Iran-Contra indictment which
finally has gone to trial in U.S. District Court.
   Now, North and his attorneys have made clear that none of his
former superiors is immune from their strategy for beating a
criminal rap in Reagan's worst scandal. Reagan himself may be called
to the dock; only President Bush has been excused, so far, by Judge
Gerhard Gesell.
   After exhaustive investigations by a presidential commission and
the Congress, it remains to be seen whether North's trial, expected
to last five months, will produce any startling new revelations
about the bizarre sale of weapons to Iran and the transfer of
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But North, armed with reams of previously undisclosed documents,
has vowed a ``fight to the end'' to prove that his actions in the
case were authorized by others.
   As far as Reagan and Bush are concerned, neither North nor other
Iran-Contra defendants could produce in the previous investigations
any conclusive evidence to undermine the then-president and vice
president's mutual disclaimer of any prior knowledge about the
diversion of some of the Iranian arms money to the Contras, at a
time when Congress forbade U.S. assistance to the rebels.
   But North repeatedly told Congress he ``presumed'' Reagan knew,
and that he had sent several memos up the line from his National
Security Council desk. Others have wondered how Bush, who attended
many meetings where the arms deal was discussed, could have been
``out of the loop,'' as he has said.
   North also told Congress that the Iran-Contra caper was fully
supported not only by his former immediate bosses, National Security
Advisers Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter, but then-CIA Director
William J. Casey, who died on May 7, 1987, a month before North
broke his silence. Casey had acknowledged the CIA played a role in
the shipment of arms to Iran, but denied knowing anything about the
Contra end of the scheme.
   ``I was not the only one who was enthusiastic about the idea,''
said North in his Capitol Hill testimony. ``The director used many
words, all effusive.''
   According to North, Casey looked upon the Iran-Contra operation
as just the beginning of things to come. ``He had in mind an
overseas entity capable of conducting operations or activities in
assistance of U.S. foreign-policy goals,'' North said.
   In Casey's view, North said, it would be``stand-alone,
self-financing and independent of appropriations.''
   North said Casey and other top administration officials wanted
North to ``take the hit'' if and when the scheme unraveled. And the
former Marine lieutenant colonel said he was prepared to do just
that _ to a point. ``I do honestly believe that they expected Ollie
would go quietly,'' North testified. ``And Ollie intended to do so,
right up until the day that somebody decided to start a criminal
prosecution.''
   It is a case which had its beginnings, not in the United States
or Iran or Nicaragua, but in Lebanon. And that is where it blew up
in the administration's face, when a pr-Syrian magazine first
reported, in early November of 1987, McFarlane's secret trip to
Tehran in 1985.
   Here is a chronology of events, according to various reports and
testimony:

   March 7 _ Cable News Network correspondent Jeremy Levin is
kidnapped in Beirut. Levin, freed 11 months later, is the first of
16 Americans to be taken hostage. Five were either freed or escaped.
University librarian Peter Kilburn and CIA Beirut station chief
William Buckley were murdered. Among the nine still held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.

   July _ An Israeli official suggests a deal with Iran to
McFarlane, saying the transfer of arms could lead to release of the
hostages in Lebanon. McFarlane takes the message to President Reagan.
   Aug. 30 _ The first planeload of U.S.-made weapons is sent from
Israel to Tehran. McFarlane and Donald Regan, White House chief of
staff, later disagree on whether Reagan approved the shipment.
Reagan says he does not remember.
   Sept. 14 _ A second arms shipment is sent to Tehran.
   Sept. 15 _ An American hostage, the Rev. Benjamin Weir, is
released.
   Dec. 4 _ McFarlane resigns as national security adviser and is
succeeded by Rear Adm. Poindexter.
   Dec. 5 _ Reagan signs a presidential ``finding'' describing the
operation with Iran as an arms-for-hostages deal. Poindexter later
testifies that on Nov. 21, 1986, he tore up the only copy of the
finding.
   Dec. 5 _ In discussions with Israeli officials about Iran arms
shipments, North mentions plans to use the profits to support the
Contras.

   Jan. 17 _ Reagan signs a secret intelligence finding authorizing
CIA participation in the sales and ordering the process kept secret
from Congress.
   February _ The first direct shipment of arms from Pentagon stocks
is sent to Iran.
   April _ North writes a memo outlining plans to use $12 million in
profits from Iran arms sales for Contra aid.
   May 25 _ North and McFarlane fly to Tehran with shipment of spare
parts, expecting hostages to be freed. Negotiations break down and
they return to Washington.
   Sept. 26 _ Iranian middlemen deposit $7 million into a Swiss bank
account. More spare parts and TOWs are prepared for shipment.
   Oct. 5 _ North flies to West Germany to meet with an Iranian
contact who says he can obtain release of one hostage for 500 TOWs.
   Nov. 2 _ American hostage David Jacobsen, held since June 1985,
is freed.
   Nov. 4 _ A pro-Syrian news magazine in Beirut breaks the news
that McFarlane had flown to Iran to meet and negotiate with
officials there.
   Nov. 13 _ The White House admits selling arms to Iran, despite a
public policy of supporting an international arms boycott of the
nation, which it has branded a terrorist state. Reagan denies that
the administration has bargained with terrorists or sold arms for
hostages.
   Nov. 21 _ CIA Director Casey briefs the Senate Intelligence
Committee on the arms deal, but makes no mention of the diversion of
funds. North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, shred, alter and remove
documents from his office.
   Nov. 25 _ Reagan announces North has been fired and Poindexter
has resigned. Attorney General Edwin Meese discloses that $10
million to $30 million in arms-sale profits were diverted to Contras.
   Nov. 26 _ Reagan sets up the Tower Commission to review the role
of National Security Council.
   Dec. 1-3 _ The Senate Intelligence Committee begins an inquiry by
questioning McFarlane. North and Poindexter, meanwhile, invoke the
Fifth Amendment.
   Dec. 19 _ Lawrence E. Walsh is appointed independent counsel to
investigate the deal. Both houses of Congress select investigating
committees.

   Feb. 18 _ The Tower Commission rebukes Reagan for failing to
control the national security staff.
   March 4 _ Reagan acknowledges in a televised speech his Iranian
initiative deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages deal. ``It was a
mistake,'' he says.
   May 5 _ Congressional Iran-Contra hearings begin with testimony
from retired Air Force Gen. Richard Secord, who describes how $3.5
million in proceeds from arms sales to Iran were diverted to Contras.
   May 6 _ Casey dies.
   May 11 _ McFarlane begins four days of testimony, during which he
says Reagan instructed his staff in 1984 to find ways around the
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to Contras.
   July 7 _ North testifies that he had authorization from his
superiors to divert arms-sale money to the Contras, and that Casey
knew of it all along. North says he always assumed Reagan knew about
it. But he says he never discussed the plan with the president or
received written presidential authorization for it.
   July 15 _ Poindexter testifies he never told Reagan that the arms
sale proceeds were being diverted to the Contras. Poindexter says
Reagan, in writing, authorized a straight arms-for-hostages swap in
December 1985.
   Nov. 18 _ The final report of House and Senate investigating
committeesconcludes Reagan bears ultimate responsibility for the
Iran-Contra affair because he allowed a ``cabal of the zealots'' to
seize control of policy and bypass the law. Committee Republicans
dissent, saying the mistakes amounted only to errors of judgment.

   March 16 _ North, Poindexter and two others are indicted on
charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to the
Contras. ``I can assure you I will never give up, we will win, I
just cannot tell you how soon,'' North says.
   March 18 _ North announces his retirement from the Marine Corps
because he may subpoena ''the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   March 25 _ Reagan refers to ``the so-called scandal'' and says he
still considers North ``my hero.''
   June 6 _ Gesell, who authorized turning over 300,000 documents to
the defense, warns that the danger of exposing the nation's most
sensitive secrets poses a serious obstacle to pursuing the
conspiracy charges against the four defendants.
   June 8 _ Gesell orders separate trials for the four defendants;
Walsh, the next day, chooses North for the leadoff trial.
   Sept. 30 _ An appeals court rebuffs an attempt by North and two
other defendants to stop the prosecution.
   Nov. 7 _ One of 16 criminal counts, fabricating a document, is
dismissed.
   Nov. 21 _ Gesell warns that if North stands trial, the court will
have little control over the testimony of witnesses ``acquainted
with high security matters.'' He appeals to Reagan to decide whether
North is to be pardoned.
   Nov. 29 _ Gesell refuses to dismiss two of the central charges
against North, conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of
government property. He dismisses a third, wire fraud.
   Dec. 1 _ President Reagan rules out a North pardon but says
``duty requires'' his administration to block release of secret
documents North wants for his trial.
   Dec. 1 _ Mexican officials disclosed that Amiram Nir, the Israeli
go-between in secret U.S. arms deals with Iran, died Nov. 30 in a
plane crash in Mexico while traveling under an assumed name.
   Dec. 12 _ Gesell tells North he can't use 3,500 secret documents,
that he can use more than 300, roughly the same number planned to be
introduced as evidence by the prosecution. The decision removes a
major obstacle to the trial going forward.
   Dec. 30 _ North subpoenas President Reagan and President-elect
Bush as defense witnesses. Gesell, after Bush is sworn in, rules
that the sitting president cannot be called. He postpones a decision
regarding Reagan, pending further hearings.
   Jan. 5 _ Prosecutors ask Gesell to dismiss conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled North would need. Gesell later
dismisses those counts.
   North remains charged with 12 crimes, including lying to Congress
in 1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Contras and
lying to the attorney general about the National Security Council's
role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales.
   He also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero, and conspiring to defraud the government of tax
revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the
Contras.
   Jan. 31 _ Jury selection begins.

   While a dozen congressional committees grope
publicly for ways to raise an estimated $85 billion to end the
savings and loan crisis, the most important decisions will likely be
made by a handful of players far from the television lights.
   Foremost, according to others involved in the process, are likely
to be President Bush himself; Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   Rostenkowski and Bentsen chair, respectively, the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.
These two men will be Capitol Hill's brokers with the Bush White
House on who will pay for the cleanup of the ailing industry.
   ``We'll hold our hearings and other committees will hold theirs,
but Ways and Means will grab it in the end,'' says Rep. Henry
Gonzalez, D-Texas, who heads the House Banking Committee. That
panel, along with the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., have jurisdiction over the savings and loan
industry.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady already is Bush's point man in
the dealings with Congress, requesting weekly meetings with the four
committee chairmen, the senior Republicans on those panels and the
speaker of the House, Jim Wright.
   Brady's credibility was badly damaged in floating one of the
major ingredients of the rescue package as a ``user fee'' on bank
and S&amp;L depositors instead of as higher federal insurance premiums
on the institutions themselves.
   One source close to the back-and-forth floating of ideas said
Rostenkowski expects to bargain any compromise directly with Bush,
who as a Texas congressman two decades ago served on the Ways and
Means panel with Rostenkowski.
   The Illinois Democrat, after meeting with Brady, Gonzalez and
Wright recently, described Brady's proposed 25-cent user fee on each
$100 of deposit as ``flat as a pancake.'' He said he is concerned
that whatever agreement is reached, the administration will say it
was Congress' doing.
   Briefly, here are sketches of some of the central figures in
resolving the S&amp;L crisis:
   _M. Danny Wall, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
who said when he took the job 18 months ago that he was confident of
resolving the industry's problems. Now he has lost the confidence of
key House Republicans because of the manner in which the bank board
rescued 75 institutions in December at a cost of nearly $20 billion
to the government over the next decade.
   _L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., the relatively flush fund that insures deposits in commercial
banks carrying an FDIC sticker on their windows. He supports the
separation of the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corp. from the
bank board and opposes charging banks higher insurance fees to raise
money to resolve the S&amp;L problems. Some industry and government
officials say Siedman wants to take over the government's deposit
insurance programs covering savings and loans and credit unions as
well as banks.
   _Wright, criticized by Wall's predecessor, Edwin Gray, for
intervening in 1986 on behalf of savings and loan institutions in
his home state. It was that action, Gray says, that delayed for
nearly two years legislation that gave FSLIC an infusion of $10.8
billion in new money to close insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   Wright contends he was seeking only a hearing on behalf of his
constituents. His intervention is one of six allegations of
wrongdoing under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.
   _Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, a former banking committee chairman and
now its senior Republican. He was the prime author _ along with
ex-Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I. and one-time chairman of the
House Banking Committee _ of the 1982 law deregulating the thrift
industry.
   Critics blame part of the current crisis on that legislation,
which allowed S&amp;Ls to expand their lending activities away from home
mortgages into more risky commercial ventures.
   _Gonzalez, a 72-year-old outspoken maverick who succeeded St
Germain as the banking committee chairman after St Germain was
defeated last November. Gonzalez wants to separate FSLIC, which
insures accounts in thrift institutions, from the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, the government's umbrella agency for S&amp;L regulation. He
is sympathetic, however, to the plight of S&amp;Ls in Texas, the center
of the industry's insolvency.
   _Riegle, a one-time Republican with one of the most liberal
records in Congress. He is a relative neophyte on savings and loan
issues despite 12 years on the banking committee. While he has been
unsympathetic to allowing banks and S&amp;Ls to venture into new areas
of investment, he says it would be ``an enormous shift backwards''
to require thrift institutions to return to what was once their
prime line of business _ home mortgages.
   _Bentsen, whose home state is at the heart of the S&amp;L crisis, has
called the depositor fee proposal ``really very foolish.'' As
chairman of the Finance Committee, Bentsen will wield considerable
influence over any eventual solution to the S&amp;L crisis.

<TEXT>
   It was a bank examiner's nightmare: an
electronic run at American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton,
Calif., the nation's largest insolvent S&amp;L a year ago.
   Big depositors, worried that the long-troubled institution was on
the verge of toppling, sent wire orders yanking out nearly half a
billion dollars in the first two months of 1988 alone.
   Regulators ended the nightmare with a few soothing words. They
waved a magic wand called deposit insurance.
   The episode symbolizes both the great strength and the underlying
weakness of the U.S. system of insuring bank and S&amp;L deposits, a
system created half a century ago as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
New Deal.
   Bank run. The very words make financial regulators queasy and
evoke Depression-era memories of long lines of depositors anxiously
clutching savings passbooks.
   But the run at American Savings and Loan was straight from the
high-tech '80s. There were no mobs pressing at the institution's
doors; only clacking computer terminal keys and whirring magnetic
discs as money brokers withdrew their wealthy clients' cash.
   Officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agency that
regulates nearly 3,000 federally insured S&amp;Ls, stopped the run in
mid-March with the simple announcement that they would protect all
depositors, even those with accounts exceeding the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp.'s $100,000 limit.
   Ironically, the deposit insurance that saved the California S&amp;L
also helped create the industry's mess. The insurance allows savings
and loan owners to put up a little of their own money, take in a lot
of deposits and gamble on risky loans, potentially at the taxpayers'
expense.
   That's what occurred with American Savings and Loan. Once a
conservative mortgage lender, new management took over in 1983 and
embarked on a program of rapid growth and aggressive real estate
lending. Bad loans grew and last December the FSLIC had to pay $1.7
billion to have the institution taken over by a new owner.
   If deposit insurance is part of the problem, it has also been a
source of security for millions and the only thing that has staved
off disaster for people who found that the repositories of their
life savings had gone under.
   `People have an almost mystical degree of confidence in the
federal sticker on the wall,'' says Robert Litan, a banking expert
at the Brookings Institution, a liberal Washington think tank.
   ``Even though the FSLIC is insolvent, they believe the government
can come up with the money somehow. George Bush just told them
that.''
   One week into his term, Bush made a point in his nationally
televised news conference of reassuring S&amp;L customers. Deposits in
the nation's S&amp;Ls ``are sound, they are good ... nothing is going to
change in that regard,'' the president said.
   How, then, did a once sleepy, seemingly secure industry come to
the point that it needed presidential pronouncements to steady its
customers' nerves? How did it sink so low that regulators would
pledge $31 billion to rescue 205 institutions in 1988 and still have
350 insolvent, but still open, institutions to babysit?
   The seeds of the ailment have been buried deep within from the
start. They lay in the inherent instability of borrowing short (from
depositors) and lending long (to home buyers for 20 or 30 years).
   That was fine during the long economic boom and stable interest
rates that followed World War II. S&amp;L executives lived by the 3-6-3
rule: Take in deposits at 3 percent interest, lend the money to home
buyers at 6 percent and hit the golf course by 3 p.m.
   By the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the industry's
underpinnings had become wobbly. Inflation was soaring into double
digits and the Federal Reserve Board responded by pushing interest
rates past 20 percent. Money poured out of the thrifts, with their
low interest rates, and into high-yield money market mutual funds
offered by brokerage firms.
   By 1980, Congress felt it had little choice but to lift the 5.5
percent cap on interest paid to S&amp;L depositors or watch thrift
institutions shrivel. At the same time, the limit on federal
insurance was raised from $40,000 to $100,000 per account.
   Then, two year later, new laws gave thrift owners fresh
investment opportunities: commercial and consumer loans,
construction lending and direct investments in development projects.
   The idea was that diversification would give S&amp;Ls a chance to
enter more lucrative fields and grow less dependent on the roller
coaster housing market.
   Regulators also lifted rules limiting brokered deposits to 5
percent of the total. Brokers divy up the money of wealthy clients
and institutions into $100,000 chunks, parceling them out to
institutions paying the highest rates.
   Some thrifts thrived in the new climate, but many didn't have the
experience to succeed and saw their portfolios grow ever more shaky.
   Even more bedeviling were laws lying dormant in states such as
Texas, California and Florida giving thrifts power to make risky
investments. As long as the federal interest rate cap and the limit
on brokered deposits remained in place, institutions couldn't
attract enough deposits to get into risky areas in a big way.
   After 1982, that changed. Enter a new breed of player: the high
flier.
   Men like Don Dixon and Ed McBirney, who purchased small, staid
institutions such as Dixon's Vernon Savings and Loan and McBirney's
Sunbelt Savings, both in Texas and both later bailed out for
billions of dollars. These new owners opened up the phone lines,
scooped up brokered deposits and shoveled the money into risky
construction and development projects.
   Along the way they lived well and made powerful political friends
such as House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. McBirney threw lavish
parties at his North Dallas home, serving exotic game and dressing
servants in costume. He flew important customers on a Las Vegas
junket in a borrowed jet.
   Dixon lent his yacht, High Spirits, to California Rep. Tony
Coehlo, chief of the Democrats' congressional campaign committee,
for lucrative Democratic fund-raisers.
   The party lasted until 1986, when oil prices collapsed. Across
Texas, real estate projects begun on projections of $70-a-barrel oil
fell apart. Borrowers defaulted but the collateral they turned over
was now worth only a fraction of what they owed. Regulators estimate
that about half of the nation's S&amp;L problem is centered in Texas and
other oil states.
   As the comptroller of the currency, Robert Clarke, says of bank
failures, ``When the economic tide goes out, you find out who is
swimming naked.''
   And while more and more S&amp;Ls were becoming financially shaky, the
government had fewer cops _ S&amp;L examiners _ on the beat.
   The Reagan administration's budget office rebuffed Edwin Gray,
then chairman of the bank board, when he pleaded for money to hire
more and better-qualified examiners.
   In 1985, he did some administrative maneuvering, freeing the
examination force from White House budget controls. He raised
examiners' salaries and by last year the force had doubled.

   Gray also began the process of requiring S&amp;L owners to put more
of their own money into their institutions. By 1991, the capital
requirement will be 6 percent.
   Previous regulators had relaxed the requirement from 5 percent to
3 percent, seeing the move as a way to give struggling thrifts
greater latitude to work out their problems. In the end, it just
created an incentive to gamble because S&amp;L owners had less of their
own money at risk. Economists call it ``moral hazard.''
   In fact, owners of the 350 insolvent institutions still open have
nothing left to lose, a situation ripe for fraud.
   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall says fraud contributes
significantly to 20 percent of all S&amp;L failures and plays some part
in 70 percent as managers swing for the bleachers in an attempt to
hit a financial home run and prevent bankruptcy.
   While the bank board's push for tougher capital rules and
supervision will help prevent future problems, it came too late to
head off today's crisis. By 1986, the FSLIC was broke.
   Early that year, the Reagan administration proposed selling bonds
to raise $15 billion and then assessing S&amp;Ls to pay off the bonds.
   The industry's biggest trade association, the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, one of the most effective lobbies in
Washington, balked and found a good deal of sympathy on Captiol Hill.
   When Congress thought of thrift executives, the image was not of
Dixon and McBirney, but of George Bailey, the small town, idealistic
building and loan officer played by Jimmy Stewart in the 1946 movie
classic ``It's A Wonderful Life.''
   Congress dithered and finally, in August 1987, authorized $10.8
billion in industry-funded borrowing. By then, almost everyone knew
that would be only a down payment.
   Today, the General Accounting Office, the congressional auditing
agency, estimates it will cost $85 billion to close or merge all the
insolvent S&amp;Ls _ roughly $500 for every taxpayer in the nation.
   ``If you roll back the clock (to) five years ago, this was a $10
billion to $20 billion problem,'' said Litan of the Brookings
Institution. ``If we had shut them down then, we wouldn't have a
$100 billion problem today.''
   In the meantime, the bank board has been selling insolvent S&amp;Ls
to new owners, using as little government cash as possible. It
handled 205 last year _ a post-Depression record.
   Bank board members say they don't have the money to simply shut
down S&amp;Ls and pay off the depositors and that it's better to arrange
a rescue than to let an insolvent institution hemorrhage further.
   But private analysts say such deals, some of which offer large
tax benefits to the new owners, may come back to haunt the
government by requiring a second and more expensive generation of
rescues.
   Typically, a large part of the bank board's assistance is in the
form of a promissory note, on which it pays the acquiring
institution interest.
   At year's end, the FSLIC had $20.3 billion in such notes
outstanding. In 1988 alone, the agency issued $14.5 billion in the
bonds. The government is also guaranteeing owners of rescued S&amp;Ls
against loss on the existing loan portfolio.
   ``The risks to the government are unlimited,'' said Lowell L.
Bryan, an analyst for McKinsey &amp; Company Inc.
   Now, Congress and the White House are struggling to raise $85
billion to $100 billion to deal with the remaining 350 insolvent
thrifts, to pay off the promissory notes and make good on the loss
guarantees.
   Treasury Department officials have told members of Congress they
will propose another bond issue. The difficulty comes in deciding
where to get the $7 billion to $9 billion a year to pay off the
bonds.
   There are basically three choices, all painful:
   _Depositors could pay through a fee, but that could send money
pouring out of federally insured institutions and into money market
funds.
   _The institutions themselves could pay, but that means either
further erosion of fragile profit margins or depositors end up
paying through a lower return on their savings, which in turn could
also send them to money market funds.
   _The taxpayer could pay, but that would either cut President
Bush's already slim chances of keeping his ``no new taxes'' pledge
or mean deep cuts in other government programs.
   Meanwhile, troubles aren't over for S&amp;Ls, which lost a
post-Depression record of $9.4 billion in the first nine months of
1988.
   For one thing, the once-hot Northeast real estate market is
cooling, a potentially ominous sign for that region.
   For another, interest rates have been heading higher since last
spring, threatening to recreate on a smaller scale the interest rate
spread problems of a decade ago that got thrifts into trouble in the
first place.
   Moreover, the debate in Washington over how to solve the problem
of insolvent S&amp;Ls may in itself be making the situation worse as the
public becomes increasingly aware of the problem.
   ``The fear and uncertainty are growing with each succeeding
article. ... It's a real land mine,'' said Mark Riedy, president of
the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   ``If consumers get it in their heads that `I'm going to play it
safe and put my money under my pillow,' you have a real problem that
you're not going to stop very easily,'' he said.
   Public officials, including the president, need to drive home
again and again that the debate in Washington is over the best way
to raise the money to end the crisis, not over whether to protect
the deposits, he said.
   Along with finding the money, Congress must also look at some
sort of ``never again'' reforms guaranteeing that the government
will not be asked again to bail out the S&amp;L industry.
   There is some sentiment for turning back the clock, returning
thrifts to their traditional role of home mortgage lending and
steering them out of speculative commercial ventures.
   However, that ignores that overspecialization in housing is at
the root of the industry's trouble. Private analysts say it's both
too late and unwise to return to the days of George Bailey and the
Bedford Falls Building and Loan.
   ``Thrift viability in the long run is threatened by a return to
traditional mortgage lending, which according to my research has not
shown a profit in five years,'' said Andrew S. Carron, an analyst
with First Boston Corp.
   The bank board has already moved toward a number of key reforms _
bigger capital cushions and more vigorous regulatory supervision _
and Congress likely will reinforce that in some way.
   As to administrative changes, the bank board is almost sure to
lose some of its independence and may lose control over its
insurance fund.

   Britain is in danger of losing many important art
works _ some hanging in hallowed halls for centuries _ because
national museums can't match the high prices offered by foreign
buyers, art critics say.
   One such work is Mappa Mundi, a 13th-century world map on vellum
that is one of the country's greatest medieval treasures. It now is
held by the Hereford Cathedral, which plans to put it up for auction
in June because it needs money for extensive building repairs.
   Some experts say the work could fetch 2.5 million pounds _ $4.4
million at recent exchange rates.
   In 1952, the government set up a ``safety net'' in an effort to
keep important art treasures in Britain.
   Under the plan, export licenses are required for objects more
than 50 years old and, in most cases, worth more than 16,000 pounds
($28,000). But if an object is more than 50 years old and also has
been in Britain for 50 years or more, a panel of experts is called
in.
   If the experts conclude the item should stay in Britain, a
government reviewing committee can delay its export for up to six
months while museums try to match the buyer's price.
   Works are judged by their aesthetic, historic and scholarly
importance.
   One painting that met all three criteria was ``Self-Portrait as
Saint Matthew'' by the Dutch artist Anthony Van Dyck. It had hung in
England for centuries and went on sale in 1987. The experts
concluded that its departure would be a great loss to the nation.
   But no British museum could match the price of 430,000 pounds
(then $785,000) offered by a foreigner. The painting then was
shipped to its new owner in Zurich, Switzerland, identified only as
P. Nathan.
   Another such setback may be in store this year.
   ``Seascape Folkestone'' by the famous landscape painter J.M.W.
Turner (1775-1851) sold in 1984 to an anonymous private buyer for a
British record of 7.3 million pounds ($10 million). Not until
recently was an export license applied for. Since no museum has been
able to match the record price, the export license is expected to be
issued soon.
   Art critics say the problem derives partly from spiraling market
prices that have placed some works out of reach of all but the
Gettys of the United States and the Japanese, the latest rising
force on the international art market.
   But many critics increasingly blame the Conservative government
of Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher for failing to help local museums
keep pace. They suggest that government strategies for keeping
treasures at home aren't working.
   The rising prices appeal to private collectors faced with high
inheritance taxes or rising costs of maintaining stately homes.
Universities and similar institutions are tempted to sell their art
collections because of government budget cuts.
   The likelihood that the Mappa Mundi will wind up overseas has
prompted one member of the House of Lords to propose an outright ban
on exporting some objects.
   Government officials acknowledge that British rules are among the
most flexible in Europe, but they argue that tightening them would
stifle an export market than brings $2.1 billion a year to Britain.
   ``The system ... to safeguard this country's treasures is coming
dangerously close to being a pointless sham,'' Anna Somers-Cocks,
editor of the respected art monthly ``Apollo,'' wrote in a recent
editorial, ``The Collapsing Safety Net.''
   It was time, she said, for the government to decide ``whether we
are at all serious about trying to keep great works of art in this
country.''
   The export review system created in 1952 endeavored to balance
the art market's needs with that of the nation's, art critic Kevin
Conru wrote in a survey of the systems used by more than 50 other
nations.
   France, he said, has a reputation for having ``arbitrary and
unpredictable'' rules, which auctioneers believe have inhibited
trade; the Netherlands bans entire collections from foreign
ownership.
   Nowadays, major museums simply can't afford to compete with the
big foreign buyers. The Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., for
instance, spends more each year on purchases than the combined
purchasing budgets of Britain's 13 state museums.
   Conru and others say the export review system, one of the first
of its kind in the world, now is in need of reappraisal.
   In 1986-87, the government reviewing committee considered 26
objects and delayed the export of 15. Eight of them, worth a total
of $2.6 million, stayed in Britain. The other seven, worth $60
million, went abroad.
   Those that went abroad included Old Masters drawings, from the
Chatsworth stately home, whose export was ``one of the greatest
artistic losses to this country this century,'' the committee noted.
   In the last year, 12 objects worth $18 million were saved, while
a dozen worth $14 million went abroad.
   Sir Peter Wakefield, director of the only private ``art charity''
helping public collections, says the small number of objects
reviewed indicates something is wrong.
   ``The great bulk of art objects are flowing out without any
restraint at all,'' he said in an interview.
   Ms. Somers-Cocks says the expert advisers tend to lack vigilance,
knowing that ``their efforts will be useless'' since the museums
lack the money to buy objects back.
   Museum purchase grants, many smaller than the cost of a single
Impressionist painting nowadays, have been frozen since 1982 and
will remain so until 1991.
   Arts Minister Richard Luce has agreed to review the grant system,
although not necessarily to strengthen it, said the government's
Office of Arts and Libraries.
   The money shortage has increased the burden on Britain's two main
art funding groups, Wakefield's private National Art-Collections
Fund and the larger, quasi-governmental National Heritage Memorial
Fund.
   The latter, created in 1980, has spent more than 100 million
pounds ($175 million) saving important art objects.
   But art accounts only for a fraction of its work, which ranges
from coastal scenery to endangered butterflies and stately homes.
   Brian Morris, a fund trustee, says the fund so far has not failed
to save an important object from being exported.
   But this year, he said in an interview, ``if things go on
increasing in price and number as they have, then the collision
course between demand and lack of funds is likely to come.''
   Lord Blake, chairman of the Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts, has called for a ban on exporting objects like the
Mappa Mundi, but doubts it will happen.
   Memorial Fund Chairman Lord Charteris opposes a ban.
   ``One of the beauties of London is that it's the center of the
art trade and I wouldn't want that changed,'' he said. ``Still, I'm
worried about the future.''

<HEAD>Bush and Administration Both Finding Voices</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a long-running serial with no final
installment, every president tries to find a formula that will
produce a smooth, mutually satisfactory system for dealing with the
White House press.
   President Bush and his advisers have been working on it, and
there already is some sniping from an institution that probably is
impossible to satisfy. Reporters always will have another question
and presidents won't always answer.
   That conflict is built into their jobs. It can be controlled but
it can't be eliminated.
   Before laryngitis temporarily stilled his voice, Bush held an
informal press conference his first day in office, then a pooled
interview, then a 43-minute televised news conference.
   Critics in the media promptly complained that reporters hadn't
been tough enough in their questions and that Bush hadn't been
specific enough in his answers.
   Vice President Dan Quayle held a briefing for reporters the other
day and stirred a micro-controversy because he wouldn't be quoted by
name.
   Bush asked White House reporters to advise him on press
conference ground rules but got no clear answer.
   There's a message in all this: Accessibility does not guarantee
satisfaction.
   Access was an issue, and a valid complaint, when Bush was waging
his winning campaign. There was virtually none because his managers
were determined to keep control of the news agenda.
   But during the transition, and in his first weeks as president,
Bush has proven far more accessible than Ronald Reagan ever was.
   There is a tradeoff. The Bush formula precludes questions shouted
on the White House lawn, or at picture-taking sessions or, as of
Wednesday night, by pool reporters representing the rest of the
press at White House social events.
   Reagan took questions at such events but seldom provided
meaningful information. Nevertheless, that made him appear
accessible to questioning newsmen.
   Bush has said he'd provide opportunities for meaningful questions
in place of the shouted ones. The news, of course, is not in the
questions anyhow. It is in the answers.
   The willingness of presidents to meet with reporters and answer
their questions varies with circumstances. In the best of times,
most presidents are very accessible. In the worst, they usually
avoid questions.
   Lyndon B. Johnson sometimes seemed bent on non-stop news
conferences, indoors and out, until Vietnam policy became an
overriding and tormenting issue. Richard M. Nixon clammed up during
the scandal that ended his presidency, save for periodic news
conferences he convened to protest his innocence and say that one,
then two years of Watergate was enough. Reagan's low access became
just about no access while the Iran-Contra scandal was unfolding.
   Bush openness will face its real trial when something goes badly
wrong.
   That latest Quayle controversy, hardly a blip compared with those
that hit him during the campaign, came when he took part in a
background briefing for reporters who covered his three-day trip to
Latin America.
   Such briefings are traditional prior to presidential and vice
presidential travels. They usually are conducted by members of the
National Security Council staff and by State Department experts on
the areas involved. They speak on condition that they be identified
only as administration officials. The briefings cover logistics and
explain U.S. policy in the areas involved.
   Quayle appeared at the briefing on his own trip, but couldn't be
identified by the reporters who attended. He could and was by
reporters who did not attend, and the background rules drew
criticism.
   But Quayle isn't the first top-level traveler to take a hand in a
trip briefing. Presidents sometimes have done so themselves.
   At the same time, the incident teaches one of the lessons of
politics at the top. If it's said, it might as well be said on the
record, because background rules, even off-the-record strictures are
must about impossible to keep.
   Spiro T. Agnew learned that the hard way in 1971, after a
midnight conversation in a Williamsburg, Va., hotel suite. He
invited a handful of reporters there for a nightcap, conversed off
the record for an hour or so _ and expressed misgivings about U.S.
overtures toward China. Nixon was just beginning the process that
restored U.S. ties to the Communist mainland. The vice president's
comments didn't stay off the record for long _ they found a way into
print the next day.

<HEAD>Catherine Mary Stewart Stars in Story of Bizarre Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wealthy Sir Harry Oakes was murdered in 1943
at his home in the Bahamas during an apparent voodoo ritual, and,
although the scandal reached the level of the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor, his killer is still unknown.
   Not that there was a lack of suspects. They ranged from his
son-in-law to the Mafia, from gamblers angered by his opposition to
their plans for casinos in the islands to a rabble-rousing native
revolutionary.
   The murder of Oakes and the cast of suspects, detectives and
royalty might have been put together by Agatha Christie. But the
story is true and is told in the four-hour, two-part miniseries
``Passion and Paradise,'' which airs Sunday and Tuesday on ABC.
   ``The murder was very big in the headlines,'' said Catherine Mary
Stewart, who plays Oakes' daughter, Nancy. ``People were very
anxious to read anything that would take their minds off World War
II.''
   Nancy's husband, Alfred De Marigny, played by Armand Assante, was
a major suspect in the murder. He was penniless and reputedly had
been a gigolo.
   ``He was a playboy who had married several wealthy women,'' said
Stewart. ``When he started hanging out with Nancy, the immediate
suspicion was that he was after the money. Her parents were totally
opposed to the marriage. He and the father were alike in some ways
and even advised each other. But my husband felt my father had too
much control over me.
   ``It's a fascinating story and what attracted me to Nancy is that
she's such a complex character. She starts out as a teen-ager,
raised in this protected environment in paradise. She's bored and
when she meets this man of the world he sweeps her off her feet.
Apparently it was a very passionate relationship.''
   Despite the title, Oakes was an American who had made a fortune
as a gold miner in the Klondike. He moved to the Bahamas to take
advantage of its lenient tax laws.
   The miniseries was filmed in Jamaica. Harvey Hart directed from a
screenplay by Andrew Laskos.
   Rod Steiger plays Oakes. Mariette Hartley is his wife. Michael
Sarrazin is an island gangster, and Kevin McCarthy is a real estate
dealer. Wayne Rogers plays Raymond Schindler, an American detective
called in to investigate the murder.
   ``Schindler was a detective Nancy brought in because he had been
a friend of her father's,'' said Stewart. ``He's not your typical
private eye. He was frumpy, rumpled, a lot like Lt. Colombo. Wayne
Rogers played him as rather sarcastic. Wayne himself is the king of
bad jokes. He was always telling these terrible jokes.
   ``I was with some real pros. In a courtroom scene, all we had to
do was sit there and react. Kevin, Wayne, Mariette and I. Watching
these people perform, I got so distracted, I was dead in the water.
Kevin would cough and pull at his hankerchief, then turn and look
around. Mariette was doing all her little things. It was magnetic.''
   Stewart said she was pleased that she was openly welcomed by the
other actors. ``They made me feel a part of the group,'' she said.
``So often you work with older stars and they keep to themselves.''
   She said working opposite Assante helped her performance. ``He's
a very disciplined actor,'' she said. ``He kept me on my toes. You
can't let up when you work with Armand.''
   Oakes' murder occurred while the Duke of Windsor was governor of
the Bahamas. The scandal, including a police conspiracy, reached
into his government. But mainly he is pictured as inept. When the
scandal heated up, the Duke and Duchess left the islands to avoid
the publicity.
   ``The legal investigation was very shoddy,'' said Stewart. ``The
Duke hired a couple of detectives from Miami who already had very
bad reputations. That's why Nancy took it upon herself to hire an
investigator. The murder was made to look like a voodoo ritual.
There were bloody handprints on the walls and chicken feathers
everywhere. The bed had been burned.
   ``The next day the murder scene had been cleaned up. All the
evidence was removed. The only fingerprint found was Nancy's
husband's, but that was suspect. There were so many loose ends, even
today.''
   One theory was that Oakes had been killed because he was blocking
legalized gambling in the Bahamas. Mafia gangsters wanted to expand
their profitable casinos in Havana to the Bahamas.
   Immediately after his death gambling was approved for the Bahamas
and the largest casino of all was built on the site of his mansion.

   Ronald Reagan's last day in office was quiet,
the White House press room mostly empty. But Sam Donaldson had not
given up even though it was his last day, too.
   ``Let's see what's in the driveway,'' he said, and trotted
outside into the bright sunshine of the crisp January morning.
``That's one of the things I told Brit (Hume, his successor). If you
hang around outside, you see a lot of things.''
   But there was nothing to see, even though Reagan had conducted an
East Room ceremony and a small motorcade was lined up in the West
Wing parking lot.
   Donaldson stood on a curb, shielding his eyes against the glare
of the sun, and searched for signs of the principals. Two White
House guards walked by, amused. ``There's Sam on a stakeout,'' said
one, laughing.
   Donaldson moved to another vantage point opposite the door to the
West Wing. A vague smile seemed to drift across the face of the
Marine guard stationed at the entrance as Donaldson strained on
tiptoes and shouted at the empty doorway, ``Come out! Come out!''
   He finally gave up.
   The prevailing mood in the White House seemed to be boredom. In
the press room, there was nostalgia: it was the end of ``the
Donaldson administration.''
   Donaldson, 54, had been ABC's chief White House correspondent for
12 years and was leaving the beat for a new, prime-time news program
scheduled to debut later this year.
   During his White House years, especially during the Reagan
administration, Donaldson became synonymous in the public mind with
the pushy reporter. It was Donaldson who most often shouted
questions at Reagan from the press corral during public appearances.
Donaldson's shouting seemed to many viewers rude, unseemly,
disrespectful.
   For some right-wing columnists, Donaldson even became shorthand
for what they saw as a biased, liberal, Eastern press.
   ``The height of this,'' recalled Donaldson, sitting on the curb
of the West Wing drive, came shortly after the Republican
convention; reporters were with then-vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle in his hometown, Huntington, Ind. ``And there was this sort
of confrontation as he tried to answer reporters' questions. People,
I'm told, were booing me _ `Go on Donaldson! Go home! Get out of
here, Sam!'
   ``I wasn't there. I wasn't within a thousand miles of there. I
don't think there's anyone who looks like me, and vice versa. So you
see, the reaction was simply to find my name and use my name as a
symbol.
   ``I do not welcome this,'' he said. ``I will be delighted as this
recedes.
   ``But I understood it, because these people who loved Ronald
Reagan as a political hero would condemn me and other reporters. And
because of my nature and my visible platform, particularly the
(David) Brinkley show's roundtable, it was easier to find me than
Bill Plante or Chris Wallace or somebody else. I'd also been here
longer.
   ``I put it to you this way. Yes, I'm aggressive by nature, and I
do not believe in the adage, `One should be seen but not heard.'
   ``No one ever heard me yell at Jimmy Carter. ... Because it was
unnecessary. To talk to Jimmy Carter, except in the last few years
of his presidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis, he
was available.
   ``For Reagan, the alternatives were go for months, or speak out,
and if, as they always did when he was in public, keep him 50 yards
away, to speak out meant that you had to raise your voice. I trust
from what we know about him, no one will have to yell at George
Bush. But what I'm saying, I've used whatever tools I felt I needed
at the time to do my job as a television reporter, no more _ but no
less.''
   If he raised the ire of viewers, Donaldson earned the respect of
his colleagues, despite a healthy ego that once prompted Washington
Post reporter Marty Schram to observe that if there were no such
thing as television, ``Donaldson would go door to door.''
   Sanford Socolow, former executive producer of the rival ``CBS
Evening News,'' says Donaldson ``served a very important function _
insisting on openness in a Reagan administration that increasingly
tried to close up.''
   ``Everybody fought that battle,'' Socolow said, ``but Donaldson
was always up there unremitting, uncompromising, two-fisted,
fighting for everybody.''
   ``I had a negative impression of him before I went to the White
House,'' said Maureen Santini, who has covered the White House for
10 years, first for the Associated Press and now for the New York
Daily News. ``Once I got there and met him and got to know him a
little bit, I totally changed my impression. I've seen that happen
time after time after time. People get to know him and realize he's
this delightful character.''
   It was Donaldson, she said, who most often stood up for the other
reporters' rights.
   ``When (presidential spokesman Larry) Speakes was there, Speakes'
style of dealing with the press was to pit everybody against each
other,'' she said. ``He would make fun of the person asking the
question, and his ridicule was really very cruel oftentimes. It used
to anger me that the press corps would just sit there and let him do
that to one of us. Sam is one of the few people who on occasion
would come to someone's defense.''
   ABC News last week signed CBS correspondent Diane Sawyer to be
co-anchor with Donaldson on the new program, as yet untitled.
Looking forward to the new assignment seemed to have muted any
sentimentality Donaldson might have felt on his last day at the
White House.
   ``I want to go. I've wanted to go now for some time,'' he said.
``If you were to say to me, `You're going to walk out that gate, and
you're never going to do anything again that's going to be as
interesting or as important in your business,' yeah, I'd be upset.
But I don't think that's the case.''
   Nevertheless, as he roamed the White House on his last day,
colleagues and staffers continually told him how much they would
miss him. ``I'm not leaving ABC News!'' he insisted in response.
   As he checked in at the tiny ABC booth in the far corner of the
White House press room, correspondent Lark McCarthy informed him
that the crew out on the lawn was demanding that he come out for a
rehearsal of an exchange with anchor Peter Jennings.
   Donaldson said they would have to wait. ``Tell them,'' he said,
``they can fire me as White House correspondent if they don't like
it!''

   New home sales edged up a meager 0.9 percent
last year, the government said in a report analysts cited as
evidence that higher mortgage interest rates continue to dampen
activity in the housing market.
   Sales for all of 1988 totaled 677,000 dwellings, up from 671,000
sold during the previous year, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday. Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the drop
blamed on rising interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five
strong sales years.
   Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from
10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

<HEAD>Retailers Ring Up Good January Sales</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers shopping for discounts at general merchandise and
apparel stores in January probably were disappointed _ inventories
were so tight after Christmas that many merchants didn't have to
mark down prices to clear out goods.
   The nation's largest retailers on Thursday reported they had good
sales gains last month, but some industry analysts speculated that
if stores had more merchandise to sell, their January volume might
have been better.
   This trend may continue. Retailers were still wary about demand
prospects when they placed their orders for the next several months,
so their stock will remain low.
   ``Consumers looking for heavy markdowns may be disappointed,''
said Edward Johnson, a retail specialist with the investment firm
Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. ``I don't think you will see them in the
spring 1989 season either.''
   Goods were sharply depleted during December as business surpassed
expectations. Also, stores didn't have much merchandise left over
after Christmas because they had held inventories in check to avoid
having to run clearance sales with drastic price cuts.
   Unseasonably warm weather throughout much of the country probably
encouraged people to go out shopping last month, analysts said.
   By far, the brightest spot in the industry was women's apparel.
   Jeffrey Feiner, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
apparel retailers have enjoyed a resurgence over the past few months
and will probably continue to benefit from women's favorable
reactions to the more conservative styles now in the stores.
   Johnson, of Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, believes higher outlays for
women's clothes will lead the turnaround in general merchandise
spending. People will steer a larger share of their spendable income
toward general merchandisers and away from autodealers, for instance.
   As he put it, ``Women have stopped sitting on their hands.''
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
reported a 34 percent jump in overall sales last month, while sales
at stores open at least a year _ known as same-store sales in the
industry _ rose 28 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate measure of a company's performance than figures that
include sales from new stores.
   Analysts recommended against attaching too much significance to
the tallies because January is the least important month on the
industry's calendar.
   ``January is such an insignificant month. January's a cleanup
month after Christmas. If you had a couple of good days, that makes
a big difference,'' observed Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that at
least part of the percentage increase reflected the fact that this
January's sales were being compared to last year's fairly anemic
amounts.
   Analysts expressed optimism about the retailers' earnings for the
fourth quarter of their fiscal year, which for many of them ended
January 28. The financial results are due out later this month.
   Among the major retailers reporting Thursday, the nation's
largest, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its overall sales rose 11.4
percent in January and 7.3 percent for its entire fiscal year. Its
same-store sales were up 6.2 percent for the month and 3.4 percent
over the course of the year.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 6.9 percent in January
and 6.5 percent over the year. Its same-store sales rose 2.5 percent
last month and 2.8 percent for the full year.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s overall sales rose 30 percent last month
and 29 percent for the year. The discount retailer's same-store
sales rose 13 percent in January and 12 percent for the year.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a 2.4 percent gain for January and a
decline of 0.1 percent over the year. The company's same-store sales
rose 0.2 percent last month while falling 1.8 percent for the year.
   The decline in Penney's sales occurred in part because the
company discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., a big department store owner, reported a
15.2 percent overall sales gain in January and a 14.4 percent rise
for the full year. Its same-store stores rose 9.4 percent in the
month and 3.1 percent in the year.
   May Department Stores Co.'s January sales rose 25.8 percent and
full-year sales rose 18.9 percent. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percent
last month and 3.7 percent last year.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall sales increased 12.2 percent
in January and 12.3 percent in the 12 months. Same-store sales rose
6 percent in the month and 6.4 percent in the year.
   Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. reported an 8.3 percent January sales
increase and a 4.6 percent rise for the year. It did not provide
same-store sales figures.
   Despite strong results in December and January, many stores were
unable to keep place with inflation during the year. For all of
1988, inflation grew at a rate of 4.4. percent.
   The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise
and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released
by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto
dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>Chrysler Signs Deal With Renault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has announced its second foreign
joint venture this week, an estimated $500 million deal with
France's Renault to build a four-wheel drive sport vehicle
code-named ``JJ.''
   The deal, announced Thursday by Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca,
heralds the first European production for the nation's No. 2
automaker in more than a decade.
   Chrysler also said it posted a 23.8 percent fourth-quarter
earnings increase, although annual profits for 1988 shrank 18.6
percent, and announced its workers would receive $720 in
profit-sharing this year.
   Iacocca said joint production of the JJ, called a ``mini-sport
utility vehicle,'' was scheduled to begin in July 1992 at an
existing U.S. plant and one in either Portugal or Spain. The
Jeep-like vehicle would cost under $10,000, he said.
   ``You look at it and it's a `wow' car,'' Iacocca told a New York
news conference.
   Chrysler earlier this week announced it would market autos made
in Canada by South Korea's Hyundai Motor Corp., beginning in 1991.
   Iacocca said the 50-50 venture with France's state-owned
automaker aims to sell 100,000 vehicles in the United States and
50,000 in Europe. He said the companies' contribution to the deal
would total about $500 million.
   Chrysler will handle North American sales while Renault will be
responsible for France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
   Iacocca also said hourly and salaried workers would receive
profit-sharing payments averaging about $720 in March. The payments
would be the company's first under a profit-sharing agreement signed
last year with the United Auto Workers.
   General Motors Corp. late last year announced profit-sharing of
about $200 per employee. Officials at No. 2 Ford Motor Co. are
expected to announce profit-sharing well over $1,000 per worker.
   Chrysler closed at $28.50, down 37{ cents a share in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday.
   Iacocca also renewed his argument that the U.S. Treasury
Department should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks,
including minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Some foreign
automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars, such
as the popular minivans, and thereby have to pay only a 2.5 percent
tariff.
   Iacocca, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and Ford Chairman Donald
Peterson have called on the Treasury to slap the truck tariff on
light-utility vehicles.
   ``If it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a
truck, then it's a truck,'' Iacocca said.
   Chrysler reported a profit of $433.6 million, or $1.85 a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31. That compared with earnings of
$350.2 million, or $1.57 a share, in fourth quarter 1987.
   Revenue totaled $9.69 billion, up 13.6 percent from $8.53 billion
in the corresponding 1987 quarter.
   For the full year, Chrysler had a profit of $1.05 billion, or
$4.66 cents a share, down 18.6 percent from $1.29 billion, or $5.90
a share in 1987. Annual revenue rose to $35.5 billion from $29.3
billion the previous year.
   The 1988 results were reduced by $93.1 million due to a $150
million charge for previously announced plant closings in Chrysler's
Acustar parts subsidiary.
   Iacocca said annual results also were affected by the company's
strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and
offering sales incentives.
   Chrysler's share of the U.S. car and truck market rose to 14
percent from 12.3 percent in 1987. Chrysler said it sold 2.21
million vehicles _ the first time it sold a million cars and a
million trucks in the same year _ compared with 1.92 million in 1987.
   Chrysler Financial Corp., the automaker's financing arm, reported
a fourth- quarter profit of $74 million, up from $60 million a year
earlier. For the full year, Chrysler Financial had a profit of $259
million, up from $226 million in 1987.
   Automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the
industry's best earnings year ever, with the Big Three posting
combined profits of $11 billion. The previous record was the
combined $9.8 billion profit in 1984.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to release
their fourth-quarter earnings in mid-February.

<TEXT>
   For more than 10 years, General Motors
Corp.'s sprawling assembly plant here has been lurching and stalling
like an old duster.
   So frequent have been the layoffs and start-ups, union officials
said Thursday, that many of the 2,100 workers are skeptical about
GM's announcement that the plant will shut down indefinitely in
August.
   ``They're still in a wait-and-see mode,'' said Arthur T. Grniet,
a 24-year veteran of the plant. ``Because there have been so many
layoffs, the perception in everyone's mind is that, `I'll get called
back.'''
   But GM officials and industry analysts threw cold water on that
perception Thursday.
   ``I'd say the chances of that plant reopening are very low,
because GM still has too much production capacity,'' said Douglas
Laughlin, who follows the automaker for the Wall Street investment
firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   The plant, built in 1948, assembles two of GM's A-body cars, the
Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and Buick Century. It was hit by temporary
shutdowns, ranging from a few weeks to several months, in 1977,
1981, 1982 and 1987.
   Adding to workers' optimism that this shutdown, too, will prove
to be temporary was the wording of GM's announcement. The automaker
said it would ``idle the plant for an indefinite period,'' rather
than shut it down permanently.
   But that wording in fact was dictated largely by the company's
contract with the United Auto Workers, which prevents it from
permanently shutting most factories.
   GM spokesman Dee Allen sought Thursday to underline that the
coming shutdown differs fundamentally from earlier ones.
   ``The real difference is that in the past, when the plant has had
to be shut down or a shift taken off, it's been because of a
temporary volume related adjustment,'' he said.
   This time, Allen said, GM has decided to reduce its productive
overcapacity and bring down costs by building A-cars only at its
plants in St. Therese, Quebec; Oklahoma City, Okla.; and Ramos
Aripze, Mexico.
   Those plants, which already build A-cars, can easily meet the
demand for the Olds Cutlass, Buick Century and other models in 1990
and beyond, he said.
   ``What that means is, we don't have a product to build in
Framingham anymore. That's very different from the simple volume
adjustments that we've had to make in the past,'' Allen said.
   Philip B. Ernst, chairman of Framingham's board of selectmen,
said Thursday he was optimistic GM would eventually decide to build
some other models in Framingham. But Allen was skeptical about that,
too.
   ``It isn't as if there is a shelf with a lot of products and all
you have to do is get someone to give you one,'' he said. ``There
aren't those products out there.''
   The plant's high point in recent years came in August 1987, when
GM invested $240 million in a new paint shop.
   Until this week's announcement, the low point was in November
1987, when the plant shut down indefinitely, laying off 3,700
workers. It reopened last May with the current 2,100 employees, more
than half of whom have 20 years or more of service.
   Allen refused to explain why GM chose to close the Framingham
operation rather than one of the other three A-car plants.
   ``Each facility has certain advantages and disadvantages _ some
are material, some are physical, some have to do with human factors.
You have to weigh all of those things when you make one of these
decisions,'' he said. ``GM is not going to discuss the specific
reasons behind its evaluation of a facility.''

   The investigation into alleged fraud at the
nation's major futures markets may have doomed the time-honored and
lucrative practice of dual trading on at least one of the exchanges,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Chicago Tribune quoted unidentified sources as saying Chicago
Board of Trade officials are drafting a plan that would force
traders to trade either for themselves or customers, but not both,
on a given day.
   Dual trading, under which a trader buys or sells futures
contracts for himself and for customers, has come under attack as a
potential conflict of interest.
   One complaint against the practice is that it creates a situation
which allows a trader, who has a customer order for a large
transaction, to first trade his own account in a way that would
profit from price swings resulting from filing the customer's order.
This practice would violate the current law.
   The Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange both
permit dual trading. However some traders who fill orders for
brokerage houses are prohibited by the firms from trading their own
accounts.
   Brokers and traders at both the Merc and the Board of Trade have
been under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect
customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars.
   In addition to restrictions on dual trading, the Board of Trade
officials also are expected to propose a deadline for bringing large
orders to the trading pits, the Tribune said.
   As it is now, large orders sometimes show up just seconds before
closing, creating frantic buying and selling, as well as completion
of deals after the closing bell has sounded.
   The Tribune said the Board of Trade is expected to announce these
and other proposed reforms next week.
   Meanwhile at the Merc, Richard Lowrance resigned from the
exchange's 24-member board of governors.
   The exchange said Thursday that the resignation was for personal
reasons.
   The resignation was not related to the continuing federal
investigation of suspected trading fraud, said Merc spokesman Andrew
Yemma.
   In Washington, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee
said Thursday that Congress could reauthorize the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission more quickly if the FBI would share findings from
its trading-fraud investigation in Chicago.
   ``We're not asking to be part of the criminal investigation,''
said Rep. E ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas. ``All we want is
information that will help us do our job.''
   The CFTC's authority to regulate the nation's commodity markets
expires this year, and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation
to reauthorize the commission through 1994, de la Garza said
Thursday.
   Their plans were altered by disclosure of the FBI's undercover
investigation of the futures markets.
   De la Garza said he contacted the FBI once the probe was
disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in
the committee's review of the CFTC reauthorization.
   ``We haven't seen a thing,'' he said. ``Zilch at this time.''
   The FBI had no immediate comment.

<TEXT>
   Nineteen percent of European airline
flights suffered delays of at least 15 minutes during 1988, up from
14.9 percent the previous year, a trade association reported Friday.
   The Association of European Airlines said the delays affected 13
million passengers, compared with 9.5 million in 1987.
   In its annual report, the group also said its 21-member airlines
posted a 6.1 percent growth in passenger traffic worldwide in 1988.
Growth was strongest on the European and Far Eastern routes, where
traffic rose 8.5 and 7.2 percent respectively, the report said.
   The annual report said the AEA airlines posted a 9.4 percent rise
in freight traffic ``with all regions except the Near and Middle
East contributing to the increase.''

<HEAD>Shaklee To Sell Stake In Japanese Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shaklee Corp., a nutritional goods and
consumer products company, has agreed to sell its 78 percent stake
in Shaklee Japan KK to Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. for about $350
million.
   The sale, announced on Thursday, may help Shaklee thwart a
challenge from an investor group led by financier Irwin Jackobs,
which disclosed late last year that it holds a 6.4 percent stake in
Shaklee and may seek control of the company.
   Shaklee President David Chamblerlain told the Wall Street Journal
in today's editions that the sale wasn't a defensive move, although
he indicated it could work in the company's favor.
   Shaklee said it would realize a $180 million profit from the sale
of the Japanese subsidiary and will continue to receive royalty
payments under a licensing agreement.
   Shaklee Japan KK had contributed 28 percent of its parent's sales
and 48 percent of its profits last year.
   Chamberlain said the subsidiary sold for about 31 times earnings,
or double the price it could have fetched in the United States.
   Following the news of the sale, Shaklee's stock jumped $4 to
close at $30.75 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Yamanouchi is Japan's third-largest pharmaceutical company with
sales of about $1.5 billion.

   Co-workers probably tumbled in laughter when
someone not too long ago adjusted his tie, stood up in the boardroom
and said with a straight face, ``I predict people will actually pay
real money to watch fake wrestling on television.''
   But the idea was so crazy it was brilliant. In today's expanding
universe of pay-per-view television, no programming concoction is
too outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new video
fix.
   With pay-per-view, cable television subscribers can wolf down a
buffet of television ``events'' _ including movies, concerts, boxing
and more than enough wrestling _ without winching themselves off the
sofa. Seats are front-row and, best of all, there are usually no
stupid commercials.
   Car-race fanatics with $13 to spare can see the Miller High Life
500 on June 17 with no breaks in the action.
   Stir-crazy businessmen, taking shelter in some Holiday Inn, can
fork over $7 for a private television broadcast of a soft-core porno
movie.
   Thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in April
to watch Evel Knievel's son go motorcycle jumping.
   And in 1992, NBC will offer up to 200 hours of selected Summer
Olympic events on a pay-per-view basis, the network announced Dec.
22.
   With so many options, there's a heap of money coming through the
door. Pay-per-view will become a billion-dollar industry within 10
years, up from less than $100 million in 1988, according to industry
estimates.
   ``It's completely convenient,'' said Jerry Hartman, vice
president of marketing and sales for Universal Pay TV. ``At eight
o'clock, if you're bored, you can watch something. You don't have to
get up. You don't have to go to the video store or anywhere else.''
   In theory, the pay-per-view process is simple enough: you order
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' at 7 p.m., it arrives de-scrambled on your
television set an hour later, and the movie's charged on your next
bill. In practice, however, it can be a more frustrating experience.
   While most of today's pay-per-view transactions (from $5 to $40)
are conducted over the phone, future technologies may streamline the
process to a single remote control. Optical-fiber
``video-on-demand'' cable systems, now being tested in Southern
California by GTE Corp., will supply hundreds more titles at any
time in the day.
   For pay-per-view companies, the easier the transaction, the
brighter the future. Parents, beware.
   Pay-per-view caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheap
pens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts _ never
realizing they could probably do without until it's too late. With
pay-per-view, though, there's the added chance that, just once, the
purchase could be electrifying.
   About 600,000 fans optimistically coughed up $35 per home to
watch last June's ``fight'' between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks,
which ended abruptly after 91 seconds. The Nov. 7 title match
between Sugar Ray Leonard and Donny Lalonde brought in close to $20
million in pay-per-view grosses, just behind the Tyson-Spinks
receipts.
   ``I think people love the excitement of a big championship
fight,'' said Jeffrey Reiss, chairman of pay-per-view giant Request
Television. ``You can have a group of people over to the house for
the price of one ticket ... and have a beer and popcorn party.''
   Nielsen ratings that would make network programmers scribble out
suicide notes can be solid gold on pay-per-view, due to higher
profit margins. ``We can make money on one rating point,'' said
Scott Kurnit, president of Showtime Event Television.
   Although pay-per-view has been workable throughout the 1980s,
only 21 percent of the country's 45 million cable households now
have equipment permitting phone orders. That figure may double by
1990, and 40 million homes may have access to pay-per-view by 1994,
according to estimates by Paul Kagan Associates, a media research
firm.
   Yet the long-touted promise of pay-per-view has been slow in
arriving, stalled by poor marketing, film-studio fears and
technological obstacles.
   Cable television's reputation for poor customer service hasn't
encouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicated
product. ``There's still a long way to go in consumer marketing,''
said Tim Clott, executive vice president of the video division at
Paramount Pictures. ``And we want to find a technology that
prohibits home taping.''
   The studios don't want pay-per-view broadcasts to undermine the
$2 billion home video market. Worried that pay-per-view customers
will videotape their purchases, the studios typically offer movies
to pay-per-view systems more than a month after their home-video
debut, thereby dulling the excitement.
   Meanwhile, pay-per-view program options continue expanding.
   Robbie Knievel, Evel's son, will try to hurdle the Caesar's
Palace fountains on April 14. ABC, CBS and NBC won't have it, but
you can see the leap (or crash) on Showtime Event Television. On
Feb. 10, Request Television will carry a taped concert of Frank
Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis Jr., at $14.95.
   Leaders in the pay-per-view business are predicting that Broadway
openings, more pop music concerts, art auctions, business seminars
and possibly the Super Bowl and the World Series soon could become
pay-per-view staples.
   So, in the end, pay-per-view's future may lie in giving customers
those unusual attractions they can't find at theaters, in video
stores, or on any other broadcast or cable television channel.
   Said Showtime's Kurnit: ``We've always looked at the event
business as where we'll make our money.''
   What the word ``event'' comes to mean, though, is anybody's guess.

<HEAD>Four Kidder Investment Bankers Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four top executives at General Electric Co.'s
Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. have resigned in what one described as a
``difference of opinion regarding the firm's future,'' according to
published reports today.
   The resignations came less than two weeks after General Electric
put the head of its own investment banking unit in charge of
Kidder's profitable division.
   Michael D. Madden, head of investment banking and the
highest-ranking Kidder veteran, was among those who submitted his
resignation Thursday, according to today's editions of the Wall
Street Journal and the New York Times.
   Madden and other sources told the newspapers that other Kidder
executives besides the four also were considering resigning and that
the firm was paralyzed over concerns about the firm's future, the
newspapers said.
   However, Kidder Chairman Silas S. Cathcart was quoted as saying
the situation was not so serious.
   ``We're going to miss a few people, but life will go on,'' the
Journal quoted Cathcart as saying. He also added that GE and Kidder
are developing a new business strategy and that ``it's a good plan
and everybody agrees with it.''
   Others who resigned were Douglas V. Brown, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions; Thomas W. Ostrander, a managing director who worked on
new business development; and Steven P. Baum, managing director of
mortgage trading.
   Analysts have said that the recent senior management changes by
GE reflected the parent company's desire to exert greater control
over Kidder's day-to-day operations, as well as GE's latest attempt
to deal with difficulties posed by the firm.
   Since GE purchased 80 percent of Kidder in 1986, the Wall Street
firm has lost clients and employees. Some Kidder executives have
complained about GE's investment banking strategy and about changes
that apparently reduced employee bonuses.
   Two weeks ago, GE installed Michael A. Carpenter, an executive
vice president of GE Capital Corp., part of GE Financial Services,
as president and chief executive officer of the securities firm.
   That led to the resignation of Max C. Chapman Jr. as president
and chief operating officer of Kidder, Peabody Group and president
and chief executive of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., the brokerage unit.
Chapman, a 20-year veteran of the brokerage, had been running the
group's daily operations.
   Following Madden's resignation Thursday, Carpenter issued a
statement saying, ``While we regret his decision, he leaves behind a
strong organization that will continue to function as an important
part of this firm.
   ``It is our intention to find a most appropriate leader for
investment banking for the 1990s.''

   Manufacturers and importers are recalling some
lawn mowers, dolls, toy boats, baby rattles and toy kitchens,
according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Here is a rundown of several commission announcements Thursday:
   _Lawn mowers: Toro Co. of Minneapolis is recalling 19,000
rear-engine riding mowers made between 1972 and 1979 because of the
danger that users can sit on or fall on rotating starter parts.
Mowers made for the 1973 model year can be started in gear, and
1972-1976 mowers may be accidentally bumped into gear. The company
is paying a fine of $75,000 to settle charges of violating defect
reporting requirements of federal law, charges it denies.
   Model numbers 56575, 56025, 56030, 56027, 56033 and 56044 may be
affected.
   _Dolls: Rite-Aide Corp. of Harrisburg, Pa., is recalling about
1,000 ``L'il Bonnie 'n Beth'' dolls of Style No. 303 because some of
the dolls' arms and legs may come off and choke young children. The
dolls are seated in a pull-toy car bearing the word ``LOVEE'' on
each wheel and front and rear license plates.
   _Rattles: M. Adler's Son, Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y., is recalling
93,000 plastic flower-shaped rattles, No. M6588, because they may
break, with the pieces posing a choking hazard.
   _Boats: Target Stores of Minneapolis is recalling about 1,300
``Press'n Roll Boats'' of Model No. 2311 because the smokestack of
the toy vessel may break off and choke young children.
   _Kitchens: Amloid Co. of Saddle Brook, N.J., is recalling 75,000
``Cook N Clean Kitchen'' small plastic toy kitchen components
because parts could come off and choke young children.
   The commission said parents should take the dolls, rattles and
boats away from children, returning them for refunds _ rattles and
kitchens to the store where purchased, dolls to the nearest Rite-Aid
store and boats to the nearest Target store.
   Mower owners who have not received a recall notice should contact
the nearest Toro Service dealer.
   The commission's hotline is 1-800-638-2772.

   Stock prices were mixed today, faced with news of
stronger-than-expected employment growth at the start of 1989.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.11 to 2,337.86 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 i8n nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchanger-listed issues, with 354 up, 508 down and
555 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.62 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that payroll
employment grew by 408,000 jobs in January, well above advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   That evidence of continued strong momentum in economic growth
quickly increased expectations of further credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   However, traders' fears of higher interest rates apparently were
offset to a significant extent by the dollar's rise in foreign
exchange after the report was issued.
   A sustained rally by the dollar would stand to attract money from
overseas into U.S. investments.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up [ at 46; DuPont,
up ] at 101{; Philip Morris, up ~ at 109], and Dow Chemical, up \ at
98\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.18 to 166.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .26 at 324.78.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.46 to
2,333.75.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 755 up, 648 down and 546 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 183.43 million shares, against 215.64
million in the previous session.

   President Bush said today that any plan to
rescue the troubled savings and loan industry ``will not be
popular'' but he pledged that the government will continue to
guarantee the safety of insured deposits.
   Bush met at the White House with Democratic and Republican
leaders of Congress to seek their ideas on how to resolve the crisis
of failing savings and loans. A bailout may cost the public upwards
of $100 billion.
   ``We've got a big problem in the savings and loan'' industry,
Bush told the lawmakers, meeting in the Cabinet Room. ``There are no
easy answers, no worrying about blame _ plenty to go around. I want
to see the problem solved.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, pledged their cooperation in seeking a
solution.
   After the meeting, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on
the Senate Banking Committee, said an idea floated by the
administration last week for a fee on savings deposits ``is not a
live option'' even though the White House has not disavowed it
publicly.
   However, Garn said he believes savings institutions will have to
pay a higher premium to obtain federal insurance for deposits.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Banking Committee,
said Bush did not give a clue about what he would propose. ``I
wouldn't say he gave an indication where his thinking is going. He
did take a lot of notes'' on the points raised by participants.
   ``We're going to look to find a way to put together a funding
package that is as fair as it can be,'' Riegle said. ``We're going
to look to the taxpayers absolutely as a last resort.''
   Setting out a timetable for producing an administration plan,
Bush said he will meet Saturday with Treasury Department officials
to hear their final recommendations and then early next week reveal
the course he will take.
   Nevertheless, Bush told the congressional leaders, ``you're not
being presented here with a stacked deck. We need ideas and if we're
overlooking something, we want to know what it is.''
   The president said, ``Whatever we come up with will not be
popular. And I expect then whatever you come up with will not be
popular. But we've got to get on and get the problem solved.''
   ``We want to work with you. This is a serious problem,'' Mitchell
told Bush.
   The administration is worried that advertisements from banks in
three states questioning the safety of savings and loan accounts may
needlessly scare depositors who are already worried.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who was present at
today's meeting, criticized the ads Thursday at a private, hour-long
meeting of Bush and five S&amp;L and bank trade associations, said
Frederick Webber, president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, who attended the meeting.
   Sununu, waving copies of several of the ads, said, ``Gentlemen,
it is absolutely, unequivocally irresponsible to have placed those
ads,'' according to another participant, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   At today's meeting, Bush did not mention the ads but said, ``The
safety of those deposits is guaranteed, will continue to be
guaranteed and there should be no feeling around the country that
some solution will do anything to diminish the credit of the United
States being behind the deposits, the FSLIC, FDIC, whatever it is.''
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation insures
deposits at S&amp;Ls and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insures those at commercial banks.
   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, said Sununu gave the association copies of
advertisements placed by banks in Texas, Arkansas and Kansas.
   ``We are going to call the banks and inform them of the concern
in Washington and the sensitivity that they might not be aware of,''
she said. ``We made a promise to the administration that we would
certainly monitor it and we agreed with their concern.''
   Bush did not speak at the meeting about the ads or reveal any
preference among the many options for addressing the S&amp;L crisis,
according to participants.
   ``He was there to learn from us and he's a good listener,''
Webber said. ``It was very gratifying. The man is personally
involved in this.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said proposals in the
president's address to Congress Thursday ``will be pretty specific.
You'll know exactly what our proposal is.''
   The spokesman outlined the ``basic points'' guiding the president:
   _insured savings must be protected.
   _current problems must be solved and losses stopped.
   _permanent reforms preventing a recurrence must be enacted.
   _the deposit insurance system should be put on a sound financial
footing.
   _cleanup costs must be equitably allocated.
   Sununu's anger over the advertisements underscores the
administration's concern that the debate in Washington over how to
pay for the S&amp;L crisis has unnerved some thrift depositors.
   Last week, regional Federal Home Loan Banks reported
higher-than-expected S&amp;L withdrawals after Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and other administration officials discussed a
suggestion that depositors pay a fee to raise money for the S&amp;L
bailout.
   Meeting participants said Bush stressed, as he did a week ago in
a nationally televised news conference, that the deposits are backed
by the full faith and credit of the federal government. He planned
to make the same point in his speech next week.
   But Mark Riedy, president of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, added: ``The feeling in the meeting was this is a
serious situation. By the time it gets to be a real run, it's too
late.''
   On Capitol Hill, Charles O. Bowsher, head of the General
Accounting Office, urged the government to take prompt control of
the 350 remaining insolvent, but still open, S&amp;Ls after agreement is
reached later this year on a bailout and reform package.
   The congressional auditing and investigative agency said Congress
should provide a plan to raise $85 billion over three years, coupled
with a reform package. At that point _ which some senators say may
be as late as the fall _ regulators should take control of
institutions, placing them into receivership as necessary.
   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Bowsher
criticized regulators' current approach of using promissory notes
and loss guarantees to conserve cash and spread rescue costs over 10
years.
   In another development, the House Banking Committee released a
long-awaited report from the GAO that turned up six instances in
which independent accounting firms ``did not adequately audit''
institutions that later failed.
   The GAO said ``auditing and reporting problems (were) significant
enough (in six cases) to warrant our referring the CPA firms
performing the audits to regulatory and professional bodies for
their review.''

<TEXT>
   Unemployment rose slightly in January to 5.4 percent, but the
number of jobs created last month shot up to 408,000, the government
said today in a report that indicated strong economic growth.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate rose by
0.1 percentage point from the December rate of 5.3 percent.
   But the first major report of the economy's 1989 performance
showed continued strong growth, something analysts have predicted
would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince the Federal
Reserve Board to tighten its reins on credit.
   In another report signaling vibrant economic growth, the Commerce
Department said orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six months.
   Bond prices were modestly lower after the reports, indicating
investors' concerns about inflation caused by overheating. The yield
on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which rises when the price
falls, climbed to 8.84 percent from 8.80 percent late Thursday.
   The dollar rose on speculation that the Federal Reserve would
push up short-term rates to hold down inflation, making short-term
dollar-denominated securities more attractive to global investors.
   Not willing to let the dollar climb too high, central banks of
the United States, West Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria and
Belgium all reportedly intervened in the market to sell dollars.
   At midmorning in New York, the central banks' sales managed to
hold the dollar below the psychologically important level of 1.89
West German marks. The dollar rose, nevertheless, against the mark
and the British pound, while declining slightly against the Japanese
yen.
   Stock prices were mixed. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 8.93 to 2,342.68 in the first hour of trading.
   The 408,000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a gain
of 279,000 in December and nearly matched November's robust gain of
440,000 new jobs.
   Analysts had predicted that January job growth would be in the
250,000 range and that any growth of more than 300,000 could trouble
the markets.
   The Labor Department said the unemployment rate rose because the
number of people in the labor force grew even faster than the number
of people with jobs. The labor force expanded by nearly 900,000
people, with about 700,000 of them finding jobs. A record 62.9
percent of the working-age population had jobs.
   On Thursday, reports indicated that higher interest rates are
hurting the housing market but haven't dissuaded consumers from a
generous spending spree at the nation's big department stores.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday new home sales rose a
meager 0.9 percent last year to 677,000 dwellings, vs. 671,000 sold
in 1987. Housing industry analysts said they expected continued
increases in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy to result
in decreased new home sales this year.
   ``The bottom's not falling out of the market by any means but we
do expect a modest slowing,'' said economist Richard Peach of the
Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from
10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Many economists are predicting interest
rates could hit 11.5 percent by the middle of this year.
   Tighter credit evidently isn't hurting the nation's biggest
retailers, however. Most said Thursday in reporting January sales
that they benefited from light inventories and an unusually warm
winter.
   The low inventory levels, due to unexpectedly brisk Christmas
business and tight control of stocks, saved general merchandise and
apparel retailers from having to slash prices to move out the excess
goods.
   Patterns of retail purchases are closely watched for indications
of overall consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the
country's overall economic activity.
   In other economic news Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil
import fee in the event Congress cannot meet its deficit-reduction
targets through spending cuts alone.
   Greenspan told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in
Washington he would most prefer that Congress cut spending to meet
the fiscal 1990 deficit target of $100 billion.
   None of the Thursday developments had much effect on the
financial markets. Stocks meandered and the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 4.46 to 2,333.75; bond prices barely budged; and the
dollar ended mixed in slow trading.

   Unemployment rose slightly in January to 5.4
percent, but an unexpectedly high 408,000 jobs were created at the
same time, the government said today in the first major economic
report for the new year.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate rose by
0.1 percentage point from the December rate of 5.3 percent.
   But the report showed continued strong growth, something analysts
have predicted would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince
the Federal Reserve Board to tighten its reins on credit.
   The 408,000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a
revised gain of 221,000 in December and nearly matched November's
robust gain of 440,000 new jobs.
   Anaysts had predicted that January job growth would be in the
250,000 range and that any growth of more than 300,000 could trouble
the markets.
   ``It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said Davis Wyss,
chief economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``It
suggests we are going into the first quarter (of 1989) a lot
stronger than we thought, the Fed is going to tighten (credit) and
short-term interest rates will be going up.''
   In another report today signifying strength in the U.S. economy,
the Commerce Department said orders to factories for manufactured
goods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six months
and a sharp upturn from the increases of 0.5 percent in November and
2.0 percent in October.
   The Labor Department said the labor force expanded by nearly
900,000 people, with about 700,000 of them finding jobs, and that a
record 62.9 percent of the working-age population had jobs.
   The unseasonably warm weather in much of the country helped
contruction employment rise by 102,000 jobs last month, the
department said. Manufacturing employment also was up for the fourth
month in a row, with 45,000 new January jobs split virtually evenly
between the durable and non-durable goods industries.
   There were 260,000 new jobs in the service-producing sector of
the economy, with the 135,000 in retail trades accounting for more
than half of that figure. Service industries reported adding 75,000
new jobs last month, down from an average monthly gain of 110,000 in
that sector throughout 1988.
   In data closely watched for signs of inflation, the Labor
Department reported that average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory
employees climbed by 0.6 percent, or 9 cents, while average weekly
earnings rose 1.2 percent in January. Those figures are adjusted to
reflect traditional seasonal changes in the employment picture.
   In another sign of continued economic strength, the manufacturing
work week rose by 0.1 hour to 41.0 hours and average factory
overtime held steady at 3.9 hours.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said it was difficult to interpret the January data
because of the seasonal pressures on the economy usually triggered
by colder weather and the passing of the Christmas season.
   ``Supported by January's mild weather and an economy that
continues to grow, many of the usual seasonal job reductions did not
take place this year,'' Ms. Norwood said in testimony prepared for
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
   Because of the 865,000 gain in the number of Americans seeking
jobs last month, the unemployment rate edged up slightly despite the
job growth. Of the 123.4 million people in the labor force last
month, 116.7 million had jobs and 6.7 million were seeking
employment, the government said.
   A separate government unemployment rate that includes the nearly
1.7 million members of the armed services stationed in the United
States also was 5.4 percent in January, like the civilian rate up
0.1 percentage point from December.
   In the civilian economy, the jobless rate among whites remained
unchanged in January at 4.6 percent; the rate was 4 percent for
white men and 3.9 percent for white women.
   The civilian unemployment rate among blacks climbed to 12 percent
in January from 11.6 percent in December, while the jobless rate
among black teen-agers jumped to 34.5 percent from 29.6 percent.
   There also was an increase in unemployment among Hispanics, from
7.6 percent in December to 8.4 percent last month.
   The robust report on the job market comes on the heels of several
other reports this week suggesting continued economic growth _ at
rates some economists believer are too high to ward off inflation.
   Today's unemployment report was the first of the Bush presidency
and came just four days before the Federal Reserve's open market
committee meets to set monetary targets for the new year.
   Earlier this week, the government reported its index of leading
indicators, its main economic forecasting gauge, climbed 0.6 percent
in December. Also out this week were reports that construction
spending rebounded and jumped 2.2 percent in December and that
personal income rose 0.9 percent in the final month of 1988.
   Last week, the government reported a 2 percent gain in the gross
national product for the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 6.4 percent
December jump in durable goods orders.
   ``Their statistics on the economy continue to flash green,''
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said Thursday.
``There is no stopping this economy.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed early today on the Chicago Board of Trade with bullish fears
of cold-weather damage to the winter wheat crop offset by slack
foreign demand for U.S. grains.
   The winter wheat crop appeared to be most vulnerable in Kansas
and Nebraska, where temperatures have plunged after rising in the
past week to levels high enough to cause some seed germination.
   ``The biggest threat is heaving of the ground where you have
alternate hot and cold,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``We've certainly had the warm part of it and now it looks like
we'll have the cold,'' he said.
   Export sales of U.S. grains and soybeans have slowed to a crawl,
and there was little news to influence corn and soybean prices.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.27 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.71} a bushel; oats were {
cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.16 a bushel; soybeans were
2{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with March at $7.62{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .13 cent higher with February at
75.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with March at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to
.50 cent higher with February at 43.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent to .25 cent higher with February at 39.80
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bush Tax Proposal Piques Wall Street's Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors in the securities markets will have a
special interest in the budget proposal President Bush makes to
Congress this week.
   Of course, anyone with a stake in stocks and bonds will be eager
to see what the new administration and the legislators can do to
deal with the government's deficit problems.
   But beyond that, Bush's message, scheduled to be delivered
Thursday, is expected to contain a proposal dear to the hearts of
many Wall Streeters _ restoring a tax break for long-term capital
gains.
   Before passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the maximum tax
rate on capital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds and other
assets held for more than six months was 20 percent, while other
types of income fell into tax brackets as high as 50 percent.
   Tax reform lumped all income, including capital gains, into a
single category with a maximum tax rate that now stands at 33
percent.
   Bush has said he would like to cut the top rate on long-term
gains to 15 percent.
   Such a change would seem to go against the spirit of the nation's
new tax system. In addition, preferential treatment of capital gains
has long been opposed by some members of Congress and others who say
its benefits go disproportionately to the wealthy.
   Yet many observers believe Bush's idea will get serious
consideration. ``I think there's a very good chance'' it or
something like it will be enacted, said Wallace Head, a tax expert
at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
   The present tax system provides no incentive for long-term
investment, Head observed, and ``that's not what we should do.''
   The tax law now defines ``long term'' as more than one year
between the date of purchase and sale. A single maximum rate could
be established for assets held that long.
   Alternatively, capital gains rates could be set on a sliding
scale, declining as the holding period for an investment increases.
   Proponents of a break for long-term gains say it would help
maintain a stable base of capital for business and perhaps
discourage the kind of short-term, roll-of-the-dice trading that
contributes to market volatility.
   Of course, given the problem of the budget deficit, this is not a
likely time for politicians to be handing out new tax breaks.
   Before any change is made in the tax system these days, a
persuasive case must be made that the new setup will add to tax
receipts or at minimum be ``revenue neutral.''
   In the current discussion, Head acknowledges, ``people will
allege that the wealthy are getting something, so they ought to give
something back.''
   Advocates of lower capital gains rates insist, however, that they
actually increase revenues to the Treasury by encouraging more
people to pursue and realize long-term gains.
   It is even possible, analysts say, that the talk generated by
Bush's proposal has contributed to the improved mood of the stock
market in recent weeks.
   The prospect of a change in the rules has begun to carry some
weight in the investment decisions people make.
   For anyone planning to sell an investment or other property in
the next year or two, the debate certainly bears watching.

   North Korea's economy is facing
difficulties with its growing foreign debt, sluggish exports and
deteriorating productivity resulting from tight government controls,
reports say.
   Figures published Friday and attributed to the South Korean
government showed North Korea had a trade deficit of $720 million in
1987. Exports were listed at $1.67 billion and imports at $2.39
billion.
   No figures for 1988 were available.
   The Joong-ang Daily News quoted government officials in Seoul as
saying North Korea's economy is nearly bankrupt, forcing the
communist North to seek economic cooperation with other nations
including capitalist South Korea, its archrival since the Korea
peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.
   North Korea's trade has been highly dependent on its communist
allies, especialth Korea's trade volume was estimated at
$88.3 billion, compared with North Korea's $4 billion.

   Congress could give the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission its reauthorization more quickly if the FBI would
share its findings from a trading-fraud investigation in Chicago,
the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says.
   ``We're not asking to be part of the criminal investigation,''
said Rep. Eligio ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas. ``All we want is
information that will help us do our job.''
   The CFTC's authority to regulate the nation's commodity markets
expires this year, and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation
to reauthorize the commission through 1994, de la Garza said
Thursday.
   But their plans were altered by disclosure of a two-year,
undercover FBI investigation of alleged widespread fraud and illegal
trading practices in the Chicago futures markets.
   De la Garza said he contacted the FBI once the probe was
disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in
the committee's review of the CFTC reauthorization.
   ``We haven't seen a thing,'' he said. ``Zilch at this time.''
   The FBI acknowledged receipt of the request from de la Garza in a
Jan. 19 letter and said it had contacted his office today.
   However, a spokesman said the bureau could not reveal the nature
of the response and also refused to discuss the investigation of
allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of
millions of dollars in deals on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Chicago Board of Trade.
   De la Garza assigned an agriculture subcommittee headed by Rep.
Glenn English, D-Okla., to conduct its own investigation of the
Chicago trading scandal to see if the CFTC's regulatory authority
needs to be strengthened.
   Congressional critics have challenged the CFTC's effectiveness as
a regulator and contend it should become part of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   A CFTC spokeswoman said the Chicago investigation places an added
burden on proponents of an independent futures commission.
   ``It puts us in a defensive position, and that's not the position
we'd like to be in,'' spokeswoman Kate Hathaway said. ``But I think
the issue that is more important, rather than whether or not we have
to defend our image, is what this is doing to market confidence...''
   ``We do have some very serious concerns _ and have reason for
them based on responses we're getting from people in the industry _
about public perceptions of the markets and confidence in those
markets.''
   The CFTC was established in 1974 to enforce federal laws relating
to commodities futures and options, including gold and silver.
   The House and Senate agriculture committees have jurisdiction
over the commission because futures and options trading originally
involved only agricultural commodities.
   The Chicago Merc and Board of Trade account for thousands of
dollars given annually to members of Congress, either in honoraria
for visits or in campaign contributions through political action
committees. However, English said financial contributions would not
affect lawmakers' handling of the exchanges' regulators.
   Lawmakers agreed the congressional investigation was unlikely to
result in elimination of the commission and said the CFTC probably
would be reauthorized even with the delay.
   ``If the investigation does not give us information that we need
for our reauthorization by the end of May, then we may have to
proceed,'' de la Garza said. ``Then, if information is given that
means we need to change law, we can do that. But it would be better
for all concerned if we did it all at one time.''
   Separately, the CFTC voted unanimously Thursday to allow the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange to implement its planned Globex
electronic trading system, which would permit worldwide computerized
trading during hours when the exchange floors are closed.
   The commission authorized the exchange to begin using the system
this fall.
   Initially, trading would be limited to gold futures contracts,
U.S. Treasury bills and various currencies, but all existing and
subsequent Merc futures and options contracts eventually would be
eligible for trading through Globex, the CFTC said.
   Supporters of the system say that in addition to making the U.S.
exchange more competitive in world markets, electronic trading could
enhance the ability to police and detect trading abuses.

<HEAD>Textile Company Puts Itself Up For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc.'s directors put the
company up for sale today, saying a sweetened bid of $1.54 billion
from Farley Inc. was unacceptable but they would entertain higher
bids from others.
   ``It is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the
company, assuming that an acceptable proposal is received,'' said a
statement from the West Point, Ga.-based textile giant. It said the
board has authorized its advisers to notify parties that have
expressed an interest in a possible buyout that it would consider
their bids.
   The announcement marked a significant shift in the Pepperell
board's position on the matter of a takeover. In a filing last week
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it was
not for sale but indicated it was talking with third parties that
might be interested in a purchase.
   Chicago-based Farley, which originally offered $48 per share for
Pepperell's outstanding stock last October, increased its bid to
$52, or a total of $1.54 billion, on Wednesday.
   The Pepperell board today considered Farley's new offer and
decided ``that values in excess of $52 per share could be realized
in a sale of the company,'' the statement said.
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine was out of his office today and
could not be reached for comment on Pepperell's announcement.
   On Thursday, Farley Chairman
House passed it last week and it now goes to Gov. Joe Frank Harris.
   Tidwell upheld the Georgia Business Combination Statute, which
was passed last year at the urging of the state's textile industry.
Under the statute, a company cannot buy another firm and then merge
with it for five years unless it acquires 90 percent of the
outstanding stock of the target firm.
   Farley had challenged the statute as part of its hostile attempt
to take over West Point.
   Farley in a statement Thursday said he remained undeterred by the
ruling.
   A statement from Pepperell said the company was ``pleased'' with
Tidwell's ruling, but did not elaborate.
   Tidwell, in his ruling, said Farley failed to show that the
statute prevents hostile bidders ``from enjoying a meaningful
opportunity'' to complete buyouts of Georgia-based companies.
   Farley declined to say whether it would appeal Tidwell's ruling,
but indicated that it is counting on a special meeting of West
Point's shareholders Feb. 25 to win the three-month takeover fight.
   At that meeting Farley will seek to replace West Point's board
members with its own directors, who would remove the poison pill and
coverage of the state statute.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Dips In '88, But Progress Petering
Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's massive current account surplus shrank in
1988 for the first time in seven years, but progress toward reducing
it petered out at the end of the year, a government report showed
Friday.
   The Finance Ministry's report showed that Japan continues to
export far more than it imports and no end to the imbalance is in
sight.
   The current account surplus fell 8.7 percent to $79.5 billion
from $87 billion in 1987, the ministry said. In December, the
surplus shrank to $9.27 billion from $9.44 billion a year earlier.
   But the December surplus was sharply higher than November 1988's
$6.76 billion, the ministry said.
   The current account is the broadest measure of a nation's
international financial flows, and includes trade, investment
income, tourism and other transactions.
   Japan's trade surplus also declined 1.7 percent during the year
to $94.8 billion from $96.4 billion the previous year. It was the
first annual drop in the trade surplus in six years, ministry
officials said.
   But December's trade surplus continued a recent upward trend,
rising to a record $10.9 billion from $9.96 billion a year earlier
and $7.56 billion in November 1988.
   The ministry announcement did not include breakdowns of trade
figures by country or region.
   The decline in the current account surplus was due primarily to
the growing number of Japanese traveling overseas and increasing
payments of patent royalties, ministry officials said.
   A record 8.40 million Japanese travelers spent a record $15.8
billion abroad in 1988, compared to the previous year's $8.66
billion, they said.
   The year-to-year drop in the current account surplus during
December came as a relief to the government, which had expressed
concern when the gap grew for two months in a row in October and
November.
   The recent increases in the surplus raised the prospect that the
government's attempt to restore balance to its external accounts may
have begun faltering after months of steady declines resulting
partly from the appreciation of the Japanese yen.
   The drop in the current account surplus in 1988 does not
necessarily give reason for optimism, according to Finance Ministry
officials. ``We can't say whether the downtrend is going to
continue,'' one ministry official said. ``It depends on a lot of
things, like oil prices.''
   A rise in oil prices would increase Japan's import bills and
result in a reduction in the current account surplus.
   Exports and imports last year, as measured when contracts were
settled, were at record highs, with exports reaching $259.6 billion,
surpassing the previous record of $224.6 billion in 1987. Imports
came to $164.8 billion, far more than the prior record of $129.6
billion in 1981.
   Japan includes freight and insurance costs in its import figures,
but not in its exports. That method makes imports look bigger and
thus makes the trade surplus appear smaller.
   The 1988 statistics showed that vigorous domestic demand in Japan
has pushed up imports, Finance Ministry officials said. Oil prices
drifted down most of the year, but strong domestic demand for
manufactured goods led to an increase in imports and helped reduce
external surpluses, they said.
   December was the third consecutive month in which Japan's trade
surplus showed an increase. In addition, the surplus was a record
high, exceeding the previous record of $10.2 billion set in December
1986.
   Confounding predictions, the record monthly surplus came at a
time when the yen was at one of its highest points against the U.S.
dollar, making Japanese products more expensive overseas. Since
then, the dollar has rebounded against the yen, possibly leading to
further increases in Japanese exports in coming months.
   The decrease in the current account surplus in 1988 was the first
since the account began showing a surplus in 1981, ministry
officials said.

<HEAD>Economists: New Tax Laws To Boost Japan's Luxury Imports, Consumption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New tax laws to take effect here April 1 are likely
to boost sales of automobiles, liquor, jewelry and high-tech
electronics _ good news for companies exporting to Japan.
   Economists say although the mainstay of the tax reform, a 3
percent sales tax, will raise many prices in this most expensive of
nations, the overall impact of the reform on the Japanese economy
will be positive.
   The new laws, the first major overhaul of Japan's tax system
since 1949, will reduce income, residential, corporate and
inheritance taxes by $45 billion in fiscal 1989, which begins April
1.
   In line with government policy, the reform will encourage
consumption of luxury products through the elimination of a variety
of special taxes on cars, liquor, jewelry, golf equipment and
electronics.
   This step is expected to inject an additional $26 billion into
Japan's robust economy in fiscal 1989.
   Japan also is trying to get its people to work shorter hours.
Banks that used to be open on alternate Saturdays will now be closed
all Saturdays, starting with this one, under a plan to move key
institutions to a five-day work week.
   Reflecting Japan's economic strength, the government said Friday
that the jobless rate fell to a 6{-year low of 2.3 percent in
December, while the surplus in the broadest measure of foreign trade
rose again because of booming exports.
   Japan's 40-year-old tax structure no longer suited the needs of
an affluent, aging society, Shigeo Ohara, director of the Finance
Ministry's Research Division, said Friday.
   The system, drafted by U.S. occupation authorities while Japan
was rebuilding after its defeat in World War II, slapped high taxes
on purchases of liquor, tobacco, furs, jewelry, large appliances and
other items considered to be luxury goods.
   ``Now, it's hard to decide what goods are luxury items,'' Ohara
said.
   Retailers will see sales increase when commodity taxes as high as
23 percent are replaced by the 3 percent sales tax, says Richard C.
Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute.
   ``Its a positive step in encouraging consumption. ...It should
make a big difference,'' Koo said.
   The reform also is intended to help cut Japan's trade surplus and
respond to foreign criticism of taxes on high-quality liquor and
other goods that boost import prices, Ohara said.
   The Finance Ministry estimates the new tax laws alone, by
slashing prices on luxury imports, will cut Japan's current account
surplus by $2 billion in 1991.
   Overall, the tax reform is expected to boost Japan's output of
goods and services by about 0.2 percent.
   Although consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.2 percent as a
result of a new sales tax, taxes overall will decline by $20
billion, the government estimates.
   However, some predict the government will quickly raise the sales
tax rate from the initial 3 percent, resulting in an increase in
total taxes.
   The main goal of the reform, the government maintains, is to
distribute the tax burden more equitably. The tax cuts favor
middle-aged salary earners through special deductions for dependents
aged 16 to 22.
   ``The middle-aged salary workers felt their tax burdens were
heavy and unfair, given the high educational expenses for their
children,'' Ohara said.
   Critics say the new sales tax is a virtual sieve of loopholes
that favors the rich while squeezing lower-income earners. Ohara
responded that while higher- and middle-income earners will benefit
most, all taxpayers will benefit from the cuts.
   The new sales tax exempts small businesses, a feature that gained
the tax's acceptance among the shopkeepers associations which had
helped defeat earlier attempts at tax reform.

<HEAD>Inflation Inevitable? Maybe Not</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Resending to fix cycle designator.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When you're looking for signs of inflation, as
everyone seems to be these days, you'll find them. There are always
little pimples that have the potential to become open sores.
   The jobless figures are one of them.
   Unemployment is now down to 5.2 percent of the labor force, a
level that many economists feel is scraping the bottom of the
barrel. It is, after all, less than half the unemployment rate at
which the current expansion began.
   When you scrape bottom you tend to get inferior workers. They
have fewer skills, and probably none at all. They require expensive
training, and even then tend to perform poorly. They are costly.
   Such a situation puts pressure on profits and, according to
inflation theorists, causes employers to raise prices. Thus, an
inflationary spiral is begun.
   But is there an alternative to that thesis? That's just one of
the questions being asked by a small number of economists who are
questioning a lot of the conventional thinking of late.
   One of those challenges to convention is that a labor shortgage,
rather than forcing up prices, will finally force some industries to
do without additional labor and, instead, institute more efficient
procedures.
   Some of those industries, it is argued, have had it too good. In
some of the retail service industries, for example, employers have
been able to tap a huge supply of unskilled workers and homemakers
seeking part-time jobs.
   Tremendous numbers of workers have been hired by fast-food
outlets, for example, because there was an available supply of
teenagers and adult women seeking part-time jobs. It was easier to
hire than to improve efficiency.
   Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache economist, observes that from
1968 to 1988, when payroll employment rose by 38 million,
service-producing jobs accounted for an astounding 95 percent of the
total gain.
   These employers are now facing a critical situation. Do they seek
to hire more workers from a smaller labor supply and pay them
ever-higher wages? Or will they be forced to reconsider the
situation and take another course?
   Giving urgency to that consideration is another factor: Many
service companies are facing a profits squeeze because of consumer
resistance to higher prices. If puts them in the position of being
unable to tolerate higher costs.
   Looking for a solution to the problem, many companies might be
forced to reconsider their labor policies. They might seek, instead,
to obtain higher productivity through better systems for producing
and delivering products.
   There is nothing new in this, and it might have been forced on
service companies long ago were it not for the availability of
low-cost labor. But now that pool may be drying up; and no matter,
it is getting more costly.
   If this occurs, says Yardeni and like-thinkers, then low jobless
rates in effect will boost national productivity, which should
reduce inflationary pressures.
   ``During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and high
inflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment and
low inflation,'' he says.
   It is something to think about when you hear the inflation
alarmists shouting their equivalent of ``fire.'' They have been at
it for several years now, and one day they might be right.
   But, as Yardeni and others remind us, inflation is not an
inevitable and automatic response to any uncomfortable news.
Sometimes we put the proper salve on the pimple. Sometimes inflation
doesn't happen.

   Factory orders shot up 4.1 percent in December
as American manufacturers, bolstered by a boom in export sales, last
year posted their best showing since 1979, the government said
Friday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
manufactured goods reached a seasonally adjusted total of $237.6
billion in December after making more modest gains of 0.5 percent in
November and 2.0 percent in October.
   While many analysts are expecting economic growth to slow during
the coming year, 1988 closed on a strong note, with many year-end
reports showing vigorous activity in December.
   December's rise, much of it pinned on increased orders for cars,
ships and planes, was the biggest monthly gain since a 5.4 increase
in June.
   Orders for manufactured goods were up a strong 9.7 percent to
$2.66 trillion for all of 1988, the best showing since a 12.1
percent increase in 1979.
   ``The overall picture is of an economy that is quite bouyant,
robust, humming along,'' said Boston Co. chief economist Allen Sinai.
   Factory orders also had been up sharply in 1987, rising 7.1
percent after falling 1.2 percent in 1986 and 0.6 percent in 1985.
   American manufacturers rebounded in the last two years as the
decline of dollar against foreign currencies made American products
more competitive overseas. In the previous two years, manufacturers
had lost both domestic and overseas sales to foreign manufacturers.
   Robert Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York, said that while the latest factory
orders report was positive, ``we are not producing goods at a rapid
enough rate to make progress on the trade deficit.''
   ``As good as it is,'' Brusca said of the report, ``it's not good
enough.''
   The U.S. trade deficit ballooned to a five-month high in
November, reflecting a surge in imports and a slight drop in exports.
   The volatile category of defense orders surged 19 percent in
December to $10 billion after plunging 21.5 percent during the
previous month.
   Even excluding the militarysector, however, manufacturers' orders
in December still were up a healthy 3.6 percent after a 1.6 percent
gain in November.
   Transportation orders, another area subject to wide swings,
jumped 19.7 percent to $38.8 billion after falling 7.2 percent in
November. The motor vehicle, aircraft and shipbuilding industries
all showed large gains.
   Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.6 percent in December
after a 1.8 percent rise in November.
   ``Even taking out some of the increases in airlines and
automobiles and transportation, total orders look to be taking off
toward the end of the year,'' Sinai said.
   Meanwhile, the key category of non-defense capital goods,
considered a barometer of industry investment plans, rose 8.2
percent to $38.7 billion in December.
   ``Big ticket'' durable goods _ items expected to last three years
or longer _ posted a robust 6.4 percent increase in December to a
seasonally adjusted $131 billion, largely on the strength of the
transportation orders.
   Non-durable goods, meanwhile, were up 1.4 percent to $106.6
billion, with the largest gains occurring in rubber and plastics,
paper and apparel.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were up 2.4 percent in December
to a seasonally adjusted $230.1 billion. Shipments for the year
totaled $2.61 trillion, up 9.2 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>Pepperell Puts Company Up For Sale, Urges Rejection Of Farley Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of West Point-Pepperell Inc. put the
textile giant on the auction block Friday while urging stockholders
to reject a sweetened $1.54 billion bid from Farley Inc.
   Farley, which offered $48 a share when it started its hostile
takeover bid in October, raised the offer to $52 Wednesday. But the
West Point-Pepperell board decided they think stockholders can do
better.
   ``It is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the
company, assuming that an acceptable proposal is received,'' said a
statement from the West Point, Ga.-based company.
   It said the board has authorized its advisers, Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., to tell interested parties that it would consider their bids.
Pepperell has said it has no other bids in hand.
   Trading of Pepperell stock was halted Friday morning, as is usual
when a company has an announcement to make that could affect its
stock price. When trading resumed, the stock rose $1.25 a share to
$54.87{.
   Patricia Ryan, a textile analyst with Raymond James and
Associates of St. Petersburg, Fla., said the formal decision to seek
a buyer was a logical progression of events that started in October,
when West Point's board authorized management to look into a
possible sale after Farley's original bid.
   She said the statement urging shareholders not to accept the
Farley offer does not mean Farley will not end up with West
Point-Pepperell.
   ``Once the price is right they really have to think of their
shareholders,'' she said. Based on public information, a sale price
of around $55 a share is reasonable, she said, adding that a
spirited bidding war is at least a possibility.
   In a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Pepperell's officers had said the company was not for
sale, but they indicated they were talking with third parties that
might be interested in a purchase.
   The Pepperell board considered Farley's new offer Friday and
decided ``that values in excess of $52 per share could be realized
in a sale of the company,'' the Pepperell statement said.
   Jack Albertine, a spokesman for Chicago-based Farley, was out of
his office Friday and could not be reached for comment on the
announcement.
   West Point-Pepperell, founded in 1866, is the nation's largest
publicly tradd textile company and makes such products as Martex
sheets and towels and Gold Toe socks. It has 41,000 employees and
22,000 stockholders.
   Farley, one of the nation's largest privately held textile firms,
controls Fruit of the Loom Inc. and Acme Boot Co.

   EDITORS NOTE _ Before Christmas, the Associated Press looked at
how two stores were handling the holiday rush, in side-by-side
stories from New York and Grand Rapids, Mich. The AP went back to
those same stores after the selling season to get their outlook for
1989.

   Forecasters warn retailers to be
cautious about 1989, but Jean Hougard is planning expansion,
renovation and an aggressive advertising strategy for the two
Lazarus department stores she manages.
   ``We're not looking at doom and gloom in 1989,'' she said,
basking in better-than-expected holiday sales. ``We're going to make
sure we're in business to do business.''
   That means big inventories, more advertising and swank additions,
such as a Godiva chocolate counter to boost sales for Valentine's
Day. Hougard manages two Lazarus apparel stores, in downtown Grand
Rapids and the suburb of Wyoming.
   Jerry Gafford, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the
stores, part of the Cincinnati-based Federated retail chain, said
higher levels of stockpiled merchandise in 1989 reflects company
optimism.
   ``We're very, very bullish about '89,'' Gafford said. ``Not to a
point of doing anything stupid, but we'll be very aggressive,
increasing the breadth and width of our stock.''
   Gafford said Christmas sales met the company's expectations,
which he described as ``pretty optimistic.''
   The only thing conservative about Lazarus' approach to 1989 is
the traditional latticework decorations that will go up in the
company's 43 stores in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky and West
Virginia.
   Hougard dismisses the warnings of economic forecasters, who have
predicted sluggish retail sales this year.
   ``You can hear just about anything listening to economic
forecasters,'' Hougard said. ``You have to go forward and do
business.''
   Lazarus' approach to competing for limited dollars is simple:
customer service.
   The idea is to combine the large selection and competitive prices
of a department store with the personal attention a shopper might
expect to find only at a small boutique. The anticipated result: a
loyal customer.
   The Lazarus emphasis on customer service ``is something that's
been highly prioritized in the last two or three years,'' Gafford
said. ``And we've already seen the returns on it. That's what the
customer needs and wants.''
   Lazarus, as well as other department stores, is plugging its
personal shopper program, whereby a customer can make an appointment
and have a salesperson help build a wardrobe to fit the customer's
tastes.
   ``The customer can come in before we open and have the whole
store to herself,'' Hougard said. ``The sales associate keeps a file
on each shopper and can call if something the customer has been
looking at goes on sale. ... With people being so busy, this is
really catching on.''
   While many stores conduct customer surveys, Lazarus likes
management to talk to customers in person.
   Four times a year, a focus group composed of randomly chosen
customers lunches with store officials to discuss suggested changes
in merchandise and service.
   Hougard hopes the strong performance of her stores during the
holiday season will put her in good standing when corporate
executives review proposals from store managers for alterations at
individual stores.
   ``Stores are out there fighting for available dollars; it's the
same as (government) agencies fighting for grants,'' Hougard said.
   She is requesting that her apparel-only stores be expanded and
turned into home stores with linens, gifts and house wares.
   An added plus is a new companywide advertising campaign, which
will distribute a Sunday newspaper insert for the apparel-only
stores as it does for its larger home stores. Most promotions,
instead of beginning midweek and running through the weekend, will
begin on Sunday and continue through the following weekend.
   ``It's what the customer wants, and that's what it's all about,''
Hougard said.

   Fixed-rate home mortgages are currently

Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   That rate was down from a rate of 10.6 percent last week.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 8.56 percent this week, up from 8.54 percent

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybeans Advance On Soviet Evacuation Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in late buying partially
prompted by a report that the Soviet Union had ordered the
evacuation of 20 villages contaminated by radiation from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   The wire-service report said residents of the unidentified
Ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of
the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly
contaminated soil.
   The Chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in U.S. grain futures
in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of Soviet crops.
   No new radiation leakage was reported on Friday ``but when you
start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation, people start thinking
`Chernobyl' and `Are we going to have another incident,''' said
Jerry Zusel, manager of floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.31 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.72 a bushel; oats were 1}
cents to 2{ cents higher with March at $2.18} a bushel; soybeans

<BYLINE>Banker Says Public Ignored Bank's Ads On Deposit Safety</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A banker who has run advertisements asking consumers if they were
worried about the safety of savings and loan accounts says Bush
administration criticism of such ads may stir up depositors' worries
rather than quell them.
   Industry officials in several states report little local concern
about the ads, which the American Bankers Association says have run
in Texas, Arkansas and Kansas.
   ``Locally, that ad stirred up nothing whatsoever and was not
intended to stir up anything,'' says Thomas R. Lee, president of the
Union State Bank in Clay Center, Kan.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu criticized the ads as
``irresponsible,'' according to an industry official who met
privately Thursday in Washington with Sununu, Bush and five thrift
and bank trade associations.
   On Jan. 24, Union State Bank of Clay Center, Kan., placed an ad
in the daily Clay Center Dispatch asking, ``Are you questioning how
secure your money is with all the stories being published about the
thrift industry?'' The ad also detailed the bank's stability and the
security of deposits there.
   Lee said in a telephone interview that he wanted to reassure
people who had questions about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which insures bank deposits up to $100,000.
   ``When you're in a small, rural, conservative community, people
are very conscious about the security of their money,'' he said.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures
thrift deposits to $100,000, is insolvent because of soaring outlays
in recent years to compensate depositors in failed thrifts.
   Depositors apparently ignored the Union State ad, Lee said. No
one in the north central Kansas town of about 5,000 mentioned it to
bank officials, and many of the bank's 22 employees didn't even know
it ran, he said.
   ``I'm not so sure they (Bush administration officials) haven't
created more excitement about it just by bringing it up. Locally
it's a dead issue,'' he said.
   Chuck Stones, research director for the Kansas Bankers
Association, said he hadn't heard of any similar ads by the state's
589 other banks.
   The Washington-based ABA said it could not disclose the names of
banks that ran the ads. The banking industry in past years has run
its own ad campaigns aimed at differentiating itself from the thrift
industry in the eyes of consumers.
   ``It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under
siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are
trying to compete with below-market rates,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, an
ABA spokeswoman.
   ``Credit unions are now claiming in their ads that they have the
healthiest insurance fund,'' she said. ``So bankers are extremely
sensitive and they are likely to continue to be in this case.''
   She said the association was soon going ``to communicate the
concerns expressed in Washington to these institutions'' running the
ads.
   ``The gist of one of the ads was, `You sure have read a lot of
information in the press about thrifts, and if you have any
concerns, you should definitely keep your money in a bank,''' said
Ms. Meany.
   FDIC spokesman Stephen Katsanos said the agency has no policy on
the ad tactics and wasn't aware of them before Thursday.
   At least one Arkansas bank ran an ad recently contrasting the
security of its deposits with those in thrifts, according to state
industry officials.
   ``That was reported to me, but we have 255 banks in this state,''
said Bo Carvill, executive director of the Arkansas State Bankers
Association. ``It did happen but I don't know anything more about
it.''
   One thrift official said he was not surprised by the ads.
   ``Perhaps those banks feel comfortable in making that
distinction, but many of the banks have not been all that healthy,''
said Jerry Crenshaw, Sunbelt Savings marketing manager in Dallas.
``Any funds institution has to be careful in today's environment in
talking about another.''

<HEAD>Shugrue Quits as President of Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin R. Shugrue quit his job as president of
Continental Airlines on Friday, a year and a day after joining the
carrier.
   Continental said it had no plans to seek a successor to Shugrue,
who joined the airline as president following a long career with Pan
Am Corp.
   Shugrue's departure comes two months after D. Joseph Corr, a
former Trans World Airlines Inc. president and close associate of
financier Carl Icahn, became the new chairman of Continental, a
subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp.
   The move enabled former Continental chairman Frank Lorenzo to
concentrate on his duties as chief of Texas Air.
   ``Speaking for the nearly 35,000 employees of Continental, I want
to express our sincere appreciation to Marty for his untiring
efforts on behalf of the airline,'' Corr said in a statement.
   In another statement, Shugrue said: ``The marked improvements in
performance and service at the airline are a tribute to all the
members of the Continental family. I know the future will show only
more of the same.''
   Shugrue was ousted as the No. 2 executive at Pan Am in January
1988 after 19 years with the airline. That sweeping management
reshuffle also brought the departure of former Pan Am chairman C.
Edward Acker and other senior officials.
   Houston-based Texas Air also owns Eastern Airlines, which is
based in Miami. Continental is based in Houston.

<TEXT>
   Being a savings and loan customer in Texas means
never being able to say, ``It's over.''
   So far, the four S&amp;Ls and one bank with which I've done business
have gone through six bailouts, buyouts or failures. All of them
have changed names, a few twice. One branch is now a frozen yogurt
store _ with a drive-up window.
   The tally so far: I've lost money only once.
   Like most people in Texas these days, my interest in the savings
and loan crisis goes beyond a casual interest in reading about
debates in Washington to a gut issue: What's it mean for me?
   In Texas, the crisis is part of daily conversation.
   ``How do I make the check out now?'' I ask. ``Another one of
those letters came today,'' my wife tells me. ``Maybe that's the end
of it,'' I say, hopefully.
   Not so far.
   Letters telling us that our accounts had new owners and
reassuring us that all was well became so frequent that we treated
them like junk mail.
   Now I wish I had saved them to show my daughter. She'll never
understand why people joke that when you buy a toaster these days,
you get a S&amp;L for free.
   I even believe there's a strange sort of charm in driving up to a
financial institution that has a giant plastic banner across the
front, hiding any sign of its failed past.
   One day I pulled up to First Texas Savings Association and saw a
red sign telling customers the thrift would be closed for four days.
``That must be it,'' I thought; the end had come.
   Wrong. First Texas was closing for the Veteran's Day holiday.
   Later, after it was announced that New York financier Ronald O.
Perelman had bought the insolvent First Texas _ it had now changed
names twice in a week _ I asked a teller how to make out the check.
She had to ask someone.
   First Texas, by the way, used to boast, ``We have ways to beat
the '80s.'' Call me a cynic, but I think the '80s won.
   My wife and I opened a money market account at a somewhat
notoriously high-flying S&amp;L, which was paying high rates but had
already been taken over by the regulators.
   Maybe that's the end of trouble there, we thought. Not so. Lamar
Savings was declared insolvent and sold under the Southwest Plan.
   And we got another letter.
   We financed a mortgage at an S&amp;L that had already had action
taken against it by regulators. That should be stable, we thought.
Three days before Christmas, it was sold to an investor from
Phoenix. Now we joke about how to make out the mortgage check.
   My only loss came from a small investment in an InterFirst Bank
bond. InterFirst was once the largest bank in Texas, but it was
crushed by the oil and real estate collapse. RepublicBank, another
Texas giant, bought InterFirst, and my bond became a FirstRepublic
bond.
   That wasn't so bad _ until FirstRepublic failed, too. It was
bought by North Carolina National Bank.
   That wasn't so bad _ until NCNB decided it wasn't going to be so
charitable this time. The bondholders were wiped out, and I was left
with nothing but a little more wisdom and a loss to declare on my
taxes.
   And, probably, another piece of junk mail.

<HEAD>Cautious and Uncertain: The Outlook at a Boutique</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   EDITORS NOTE _ Before Christmas, the Associated Press looked at
how two stores were handling the holiday rush, in side-by-side
stories from New York and Grand Rapids, Mich. The AP went back to
those same stores after the selling season to get their outlook for
1989.

<TEXT>
   A customer at Osidi, a small Manhattan boutique,
held a mini-debate with herself: Should she spend $35 on a scarf or
save the money for a different item of clothing?
   Marcia Massa, the store's owner, listened to the soliloquy. She's
heard a lot of that kind of second-guessing from customers lately.
   ``People are getting very discriminating in what they are
buying,'' she said.
   Customer caution has made it hard for Mrs. Massa to get a handle
on how business will fare this year. But she knows this much: If
customers are playing it safe, she had better do the same.
   Osidi, a moderate-priced clothing store named after one of Mrs.
Massa's friends, is in Manhattan's residential Gramercy Park section
southeast of midtown. The boutique's customers, for the most part,
are working women who live in the largely middle-class neighborhood.
   Mrs. Massa's customers have grown increasingly uncertain about
the economy over the last two years, and she's watched her business
change dramatically and unpredictably.
   ``1988 was a very bad year for 98 percent of the people I came in
contact with,'' Mrs. Massa said shortly after New Year's. She
included herself in the majority.
   The holiday spirit seemed to pass Osidi by. While the season had
some bright spots, business never really took off, even in the final
week before Christmas when many other retailers enjoyed a
last-minute surge.
   ``It was not a good Christmas season,'' Mrs. Massa said. ``The
whole attitude of people was just to get it over with.''
   Yet, in the first days of 1989, the mood of her customers seemed
to pick up and business improved.
   Several new lines of red, black and navy sportswear just about
blew out the door. One woman spent $200 one Saturday morning on
several pieces, and returned that afternoon for more.
   Customers snapped up a rack of hand-painted scarves that sold for
$35 apiece. Mrs. Massa filled it with new stock that disappeared
just as fast. Jewelry cases also had to be refilled.
   ``I have a good feeling about spring,'' she said in mid-January.
``I have the feeling that people are going to start opening up their
pocketbooks soon.''
   But two weeks later, a slow Saturday was a reminder of how fickle
the retail business can be. Mrs. Massa shook her head as she counted
the day's receipts and talked again about the economy.
   Her outlook appears to move in tandem with sales, yet Mrs.
Massa's underlying optimism seems to keep her going. Even when she
sensed customers were feeling down during the holidays, she knew
they'd buy again.
   ``You go through a cycle of emotional depression,'' she said.
``You withdraw for a while _ and then you come out.''
   Mrs. Massa's understanding of her customers may be the secret of
her success and Osidi's ability to weather uncertainty. She gets to
know the women who enter the store, talks with them, treats them
like friends.
   People walking into Osidi are met with a smile. Mrs. Massa asks
regulars how last night's party went or how work is going. One
woman, who had promised to stop by several days earlier but didn't,
was greeted with a concerned ``Where were you?''
   That kind of rapport keeps them coming back. ``They kept me in
business this past year,'' Mrs. Massa said of her regulars, and it
helps her gauge how confident shoppers feel and what merchandise
they might buy.
   Their caution has led Mrs. Massa to sell a different type of
clothing than in the past.
   She used to buy entire ensembles that would sell for several
hundred dollars. These days, accessories and mix-and-match skirts,
sweaters and slacks are her staples. Osidi offers fewer lines of
clothing, priced lower than the merchandise of past years.
   The shift also has led Mrs. Massa to have some merchandise made
to order. She's no stranger to that end of the apparel industry,
having been a manufacturer before she opened her store four years
ago.
   ``It's more economical to do it yourself,'' she said. By creating
the specifications for her own merchandise, she is sure to get the
kinds of fabrics and colors she knows will sell.
   The watchword for this venture is caution _ the same caution
she's applying to her store.
   ``We'll see how it goes,'' she said.

<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with later activity, closing index;
No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed broadly higher in active
trading Friday on the London Stock Exchange, as the market resumed
its steep climb after a brief pause earlier this week.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 26.5 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,069.9.
   The 100-share index was up as much as 34.6 points at midday. At
its lowest, the index was up 3.8 points at the opening.
   Stock was still in short supply, and that accentuated the gains,
dealers said. In addition, shares were led higher by a brisk run in
the stock futures market, which dealers said ignited a sharp jump in
equity prices shortly after the opening.
   ``Once again the futures did seem to lead the market up,'' a
dealer said. ``There was no way (the market) was going to stay
down.''
   Volume expanded to 768.7 million shares from 571.2 million on
Thursday.
   Wall Street's resilience to apparently negative U.S. economic
figures also encouraged the London market to advance, dealers said.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials opened lower following news
that U.S. employment gained at a faster-than-expected rate in
January. But a turnaround by the Dow Jones index into positive
territory spurred the London market to hold on to most of its early
gains.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 21.2 points at 1,689.0
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 16.46 points
to close at 1,167.78.

<HEAD>Board Nominees Announced for Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc., which is waging a
proxy fight for control of Polaroid Corp., on Friday announced a
slate of 14 candidates for the board of the instant-camera company.
   Shamrock, the investment vehicle for Roy E. Disney, nephew of the
late animator Walt Disney, has been pressing an unsolicited $3.2
billion buyout of Polaroid, and last month buttressed that strategy
by launching the proxy war.
   Disney's nominees will stand for election to the Polaroid board
at the Cambridge, Mass., company's annual shareholders' meeting May
9.
   Polaroid's board has 13 members; a 14th management candidate is
to be nominated before the meeting.
   Disney is offering Polaroid shareholders $45 a share for their
stock.
   In July, the California investor made an unsolicited friendly
offer of $40 a share to buy Polaroid with the consent of management.
When that offer was spurned, he made a tender offer to shareholders
in September of $42 a share. That price was sweetened to $45 a share
on Jan. 19.
   Among those on Shamrock's slate of nominees are Disney, Stanley
P. Gold, president and chief executive of Shamrock, and Frank G.
Wells, president and chief operating officer of The Walt Disney Co.,
in which Shamrock holds stock.

   The dollar closed little changed Friday after
central banks choked off a rally in the currency brought on by
bullish news on the U.S. economy.
   After a strong surge after the release of the economic reports,
the dollar ended narrowly higher against the West German mark and
British pound but lower against the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
   Gold prices, after dipping as low as $387 a troy ounce, ended up
slightly higher. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $391.50 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from
$391.10 late Thursday.
   The Labor Department said non-farm payrolls rose by 408,000 jobs
in January, well above market expectations. The strong job growth
overshadowed the announcement that the unemployment rate rose 0.1
percentage point to 5.4 percent in January.
   Also, the Commerce Department said factory orders shot up 4.1
percent in December, the biggest monthly gain since June.
   The twin reports indicated to investors that the Federal Reserve
would have to keep short-term interest rates high to prevent the
economy from overheating. ``There's still very strong short-term
rates here, and that's what's bringing money into the country,''
said Dan Brooks, chief dealer of Westpac Banking Corp. in New York.
   Traders in Europe and the United States said the dollar's upward
move was countered by coordinated dollar sales by the central banks
of the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy,
Belgium, Switzerland and Austria.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the release of the U.S.
economic reports, the dollar fell 0.48 yen to a closing 129.27 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.40 yen. In New York, the
dollar dipped to 129.40 from 129.58 late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the pound, which cost $1.7410,
cheaper than $1.7515 on Thursday. In New York the dollar also
strengthened. The pound fell to $1.7420 from $1.7452 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8790 West German marks, up from
1.8775; 1.5949 Swiss francs, up from 1.5945; 1.1833 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1894; 6.3880 French francs, unchanged; and
1,371.8 Italian lire, up from 1,371.3.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, up from 1.8700; 1.5983
Swiss francs, up from 1.5923; 6.3950 French francs, up from 6.3735;
2.1240 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1135; 1,374.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,368.50; and 1.1885 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1882.
   Gold prices were lower in Europe but rose by the end of trading
in New York.
   In London, gold traded at a late bid price of $388.25 a troy
ounce, down from $392.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the bid price
for gold was $389.90, down from $391.50 bid late Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $393.10 a troy ounce, up from $392.30 late
Thursday.
   Silver was quoted in London on Friday at a bid price of $5.83 a
troy ounce, down from Thursday's $5.86. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.835 an ounce from $5.823.

   Federal authorities are increasing their pressure
on traders and brokers in an effort to win cooperation in their
investigation of fraud in the world's two largest commodities
exchanges, sources said Friday.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago has shown some futures
traders evidence of at least one type of trading offense and has
invited them to share information in exchange for immunity from
prosecution, reduced charges or a recommendation for a lenient
sentence, say attorneys for some of those subpoenaed over the past
two weeks.
   The pressure increasingly applied being to selected traders and
brokers is helping to sharpen the focus of the government's two-year
undercover investigation of the Chicago Board of the Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lawyers said.
   ``It tells me they need cooperation,'' said John Troelstrup, an
attorney with a number of clients who have been contacted by the
U.S. attorney's office.
   ``It tells me that the eerie feeling that they're not focusing on
anything more than a routine trade-practices investigation may be on
the mark,'' he said.
   Anton Valukas, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of
Illinois, has refused to confirm the existence of the investigation,
which was disclosed by the Chicago Tribune on Jan. 19. Speculation
about the purpose of the probe has ranged from rooting out trading
fraud to documenting the laundering of drug money.
   Defense lawyers said federal prosecutors have shown some traders
evidence of ``bag trading.'' In the illegal technique, a floor
broker conspires with another trader _ the ``bag man'' _ to sell a
customer's futures contract at the low end of an official price
range and to buy it back for a different customer at the high end of
the range.
   The transaction produces a profit for the bag man, which he
splits with his trading.
   Futures are binding contracts for delivery of a commodity at a
specified price on a specified date. Producers and consumers of
commodities use the futures markets to lock in prices in advance,
while speculators use them to bet on price movements.
   Prosecutors also have told some brokers or their attorneys they
were prepared to accept ``proffer letters,'' from people under
investigation, defense attorneys said.
   In a proffer letter, a potential defendant lays out the
information he is willing to provide in exchange for immunity, a
lesser charge or prosecutor's recommendation for leniency. If no
such deal is struck, prosecutors agree not to use the information to
prosecute the individual.
   One lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said proffer
letters were fairly routine in criminal investigations.
   But Troelstrup said it was unusual for federal authorities to let
it be known publicly, albeit through unofficial channels, that they
were willing to negotiate plea bargains.
   The government also is seeking handwriting samples from some of
those subpoenaed by asking them to write down the trading-badge
numbers of certain other traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
defense lawyers said.
   Troelstrup said federal authorities may want to compare the
handwriting samples with the handwriting on trading cards obtained
by subpoena. Futures traders record on trading cards the price,
quantity, time and badge number of the opposing buyer or seller for
each trade they make.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago Tribune reported Friday that Chicago Board
of Trade officials were drafting a document that would prohibit
floor brokers from trading both for their own accounts and on behalf
of customers. Dual trading, which is unique to futures markets, has
been criticized as inviting trading abuse.
   Board of Trade spokesman Michael O'Connell would not confirm the
report, saying only that dual trading was one of the issues being
examined by an internal committee formed earlier this week to make
recommendations to the exchange's board of directors.
   In a statement unrelated to the investigation, the Chicago Merc
said Friday it had fined Timothy S. Fox, a trader in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit, $50,000 for making pre-arranged
trades.

<HEAD>PSNH to Pay $2 Million To Former Seabrook Owners So They Won't Sue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire
disclosed Friday it has agreed to pay $2 million to four former
owners of the Seabrook nuclear power plant so that they won't sue
the utility over its management of the stalled project.
   The agreement is part of a deal under which Public Service, which
sought bankruptcy protection a year ago because of its 36 percent
Seabrook share, would assume $30 million in plant payments being
skipped by the owner of the fourth-largest share, Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co.
   In return for making MMWEC's payments _ which would keep the
project afloat through May 1990 _ Public Service wanted all present
and former Seabrook owners to agree not to sue it. Public Service
denies mismanaging the project but says it wants to avoid expensive
litigation over it.
   Central Maine Power Co., which formerly owned 6 percent of
Seabrook and initially refused to waive its right to sue Public
Service, now has signed on.
   But Vermont Electric Cooperative, New Hampshire Electric
Cooperative and Hudson Power &amp; Light Co. of Massachusetts _ which
own a total of about 4 percent of Seabrook _ won't go along, Public
Service spokesman Nicholas Ashooh confirmed Friday.
   Public Service's bankruptcy judge, James Yacos, must approve the
agreement for assuming the MMWEC payments, and the utility on Friday
told him how it got Central Maine and the other former owners to
sign on.
   Public Service said it would pay $1.2 million in cash to Central
Maine, Maine Public Service Co., Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. of Maine
and Central Vermont Public Service Co. Ashooh said Public Service
also would waive $800,000 in debt from Central Maine.
   Those companies sold their Seabrook shares, totaling 12 percent
of the project, to a subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates of
Massachusetts in 1986.
   Public Service disclosed some details of its Seabrook funding
deal as it asked Yacos for another extension of the deadline for the
project's past and present owners to file claims against it in
bankruptcy court.
   Yacos previously had granted three extensions of the deadline for
claims against Public Service, and said last month there would be
``no further extensions'' beyond Feb. 9. But on Friday he granted
one more extension, to Feb. 24.
   Seabrook, its pricetag now $5.8 billion, was completed in July
1986 but remains idle because of problems with finances and
evacuation planning.
   MMWEC, which owns 12 percent of Seabrook, stopped making payments
of about $1.5 million a month to the project last summer. Plant
officials initially said they hoped to complete arrangements for
assuming $30 million of MMWEC's payments by Sept. 15.
   An interim funding arrangment expired Nov. 30; plant officials
say some owners have been making the payments since, but they won't
give specifics.
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled in December that
Seabrook's financial problems do not pose a safety concern for
low-power atomic tests, but appeared to leave the issue open for
commercial licensing. Seabrook officials hope to start low-power
tests within the next month and gain a commercial license by year
end.

   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks rose 5.6
percent in late January, bolstered by a strong performance by Ford
Motor Co. and continued solid truck sales, the manufacturers
reported Friday.
   One analyst suggested that Ford's 14.8 percent increase in sales
of domestically made cars may stem from late-January fleet sales.
Fleet customers include all those who buy more than 10 vehicles a
year, such as rental car companies, police forces and firms that
provide employees with cars.
   The automakers reported they sold cars and light trucks at a
daily rate of 41,798 vehicles during the Jan. 21-31 period this
year, compared with a rate of 39,571 during the same period a year
ago.
   Car sales were up 5.3 percent, based on Ford's performance, and
truck sales rose 6.3 percent during the period, in which there were
nine selling days both years. General Motors Corp.'s U.S.-made car
sales rose 2.1 percent while Chrysler Corp.'s fell 11.9 percent in
late January compared with the same period last year.
   ``I think there might have been a little blip in their number
from fleets,'' said analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman
Hutton in New York. ``You normally see that in the latter part of
the year.''
   Sales in December of last year were very strong while the
car-selling market softened somewhat in the first part of January.
   ``There is still a great deal of concern that strong fleet sales
throughout the fourth quarter may have been masking some possible
deterioration in the retail marketplace,'' Phillippi said.
   Another analyst, David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
New York, said Ford's share of the domestic car market _ about 30.7
percent _ is nearly the same as it has been lately.
   ``I think if you take the month as a whole, the weak early
January and the late strength, I think if you smooth out the last
few months, car sales are a little weaker,'' he said. ``But there's
so much noise in these numbers that it's hard to tell.''
   Industry-wide, car and truck sales in the United States dropped 5
percent during January. Sales of imported vehicles dropped 18.2
percent while sales of vehicles made in the United States fell 0.4
percent.
   Ford said its car sales rose 14.8 percent during the period to a
daily rate of 8,426 during late January this year, compared with a
daily rate of 7,339 during the same time last year. Meantime, sales
of U.S.-made trucks by Ford rose 4.9 percent to a daily rate of
5,115 this year from a rate of 4,873 during late January last year.
   For the entire month, Ford's car sales have risen 3.6 percent
while its truck sales increased 4.9 percent.
   Chrysler showed the biggest decline in late-January car sales,
dipping 11.9 percent to a daily rate of 3,180 this year compared
with a rate of 3,607 last year.
   But truck sales for Chrysler led the Big Three, going up 8.1
percent in late January 1989 to a rate of 3,452 compared with a rate
of 3,193 last year.
   For all of January this year, Chrysler's car sales were 6.7
percent lower than January last year, while truck sales were up 12
percent.
   GM said its car sales rose 2.1 percent in late January, to a
daily rate of 12,899 this year from a rate of 12,631 last year.
Truck sales rose 4.1 percent to a daily rate of 5,213 this year from
5,009 last year.
   For the month, GM sold 11.1 percent fewer cars this year compared
with last year and 1.7 percent more trucks.

   Stock prices were little changed Friday in a
indecisive appraisal of stronger-than-expected employment growth at
the start of 1989.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25,
reducing its gain for the week to 8.39 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
792 up, 642 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.98 million
shares, down from 183.43 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 207.15 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that payroll
employment grew by 408,000 jobs in January, well above advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   That evidence of continued strong momentum in economic growth
quickly increased expectations of further credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   However, traders' fears of higher interest rates apparently were
offset to a significant extent by the dollar's rise in foreign
exchange after the report was issued.
   A sustained rally by the dollar would stand to attract money from
overseas into U.S. investments.
   Brokers also said money managers who had been left behind in the
market's recent rally were still engaged in ``catch-up'' buying each
time stock prices pulled back a bit.
   West Point-Pepperell climbed 2 to 55| in active trading. The
company, which is opposing a $52-a-share takeover bid by Farley
Inc., said it would solicit offers from others in an effort to get a
better price.
   Eli Lilly gained 3 to 95{, trading at new 52-week highs. The
company reported fourth quarter earnings of $1.24 a share, up from
96 cents a share in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, Philip Morris gained { to 109;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose [ to 32[; International Business
Machines dropped | to 127}, and General Electric lost \ to 47~.
   Some airline issues added to their recent gains. Delta Air Lines
rose } to 57~; AMR 2| to 62, and Pan Am [ to 3{. But UAL dropped [
to 123|.
   Japanese stocks gained ground as the Tokyo market hit another new
high. Matsushita picked up 2{ to 195{ and Honda Motor \ to 163.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.25 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .15 to 166.50.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .22 to 343.84, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .13 at 296.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
1.19 to 406.35, climbing back above its close on the eve of Black
Monday Oct. 19, 1987. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 324.88, up .36.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell slightly in active trading
Friday as the market shrugged off inflationary fears triggered by a
government unemployment report indicating robust economic expansion.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell \ point, or about
$2.50 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, rose to 8.83 percent from 8.80 percent
late Thursday.
   Analysts said the bond market climbed in afternoon trading after
an early sell-off in response to the Labor Department's report that
408,000 new nonfarm jobs were created last month, well above
expectations of about 300,000.
   The report was viewed as a sign of rapid economic expansion,
triggering some inflationary fears, analysts said. But many traders
attributed the increase to unseasonably warm January weather that
created more construction jobs.
   ``The market seems to want to be fairly strong,'' said Robert
Chandross, chief economist with Lloyds Bank PLC in New York. ``Part
of the rise of employment was excused away because of the weather
and its impact on construction.''
   He said the market also was buoyed by rumors that the weekly
nationwide survey of purchasing managers, a key economic indicator
released on Mondays, would show a lower reading, implying an
economic slowdown.
   But William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the employment data were strong enough to
force the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates to slow
the economy as a hedge against higher inflation.
   ``Even if you exclude (construction) you see a very buoyant set
of labor data and it does suggest the economy is taking a strong
tick in the new year,'' he said. ``Against that data I would look
for some tightening in credit policy.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 3-16 point, intermediate maturities fell 3-16 point
and long-term issues also were down 3-16 point, according to
Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.90 to 1,137.90.
   In corporate trading, industrials inched up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.04
to 299.77.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was down 3-32 point at 92 5-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.57 percent from 7.56 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.76 percent as the
discount rose nine basis points to 8.47 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.01 percent as the discount rose 11 basis points to
8.52 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.14 percent as the
discount rose 11 basis points to 8.47 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was unchanged at 9 percent.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel to Close Wire Rope Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Friday it
will close its wire rope division in Williamsport, cutting 250 jobs,
because the Federal Trade Commission would not grant early approval
for selling the plant to a competitor.
   ``We believe the planned transaction was entirely appropriate so
that timely clearance should have been granted,'' said Robert M.
Funk, division president.
   ``An authorization by the commission would have permitted an
orderly transfer of the Williamsport plant to (Bridon American).
This would have allowed Bridon to complete the purchase, to maintain
many local jobs and to minimize the impact on our customers and the
area's economy,'' Funk said in a statement.
   The commission rejected an early termination of its investigation
into possible antitrust implications of the deal Bethlehem announced
in September. The federal agency has had the proposed sale under
review since November.
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Tricknor declined comment.
   Bridon American, located in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., is a division of
Bridon &amp; Small PLC of Britain, the world's largest producer of wire
rope and related products. It operates in Europe, Canada, Puerto
Rico and the Dominican Republic.
   Bethlehem said it could wait no longer to close the deal because
it was losing money at the plant and had no indication how long the
FTC might study the proposed sale.
   ``Williamsport has been losing money for a long time,'' said
company spokesman Gary Graham. ``We were down to the wire.''
   Also, the Williamsport plant does not fit Bethlehem's long-range
plan to concentrate on basic steel operations, the company said.
   The plant employs about 250 hourly and salaried employees. The
workforce has been reduced from about 500 people in early 1988.
   Bethlehem said it plans to continue limited operations at the
plant for about 60 days so that customers will not be inconvenienced.

<HEAD>Copper's Slide Continues On Perceieved Easing Of Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell markedly Friday, the fourth
significant decline in the last five trading sessions, on
perceptions of easing labor tensions in several copper-producing
countries and expectations of an increase in supplies.
   On other markets, precious-metals futures prices rose;
agricultural futures were mostly higher; and energy futures
retreated.
   Copper settled 1.35 cents to 2.50 cents lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in March at
$1.3235 a pound.
   The spot February contract finished at $1.34 a pound, the lowest
spot copper price on the Commodity Exchange since Oct. 13 and more
than 30 cents below the record high of $1.6475 a pound reached on
Dec. 8.
   The March contract lost nearly 10 percent of its value during the
past week. The setback was largely a reaction to labor settlements
that averted refinery strikes in Chile, Peru and Mexico.
   ``Not only were these (labor problems) resolved, they were
resolved in a very short period of time, and that caught a lot of
people off guard,'' said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst in New York
with PaineWebber Inc.
   The dollar's strength during the week, effectively raising the
price of U.S. goods to foreign buyers, also weighed on copper
prices, analysts said.
   But experts said demand for copper remained strong and at least
one analyst cautioned that labor tensions in Chile and Peru have not
disappeared.
   ``You can always bandage a cut, but if you have internal
hemorrhaging you can still die,'' said George Anagnos of Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Gold and silver futures posted modest gains on the Commodity
Exchange in lackluster trading.
   Gold settled 40 cents to 80 cents higher with April at $396.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.3 cents higher with March at
$5.875 a troy ounce.
   Wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in late buying partially prompted by a report that
the Soviet Union had ordered the evacuation of 20 villages
contaminated by radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   The wire-service report said residents of the unidentified
Ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of
the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly
contaminated soil.
   The Chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in U.S. grain futures
in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of Soviet crops.
   No new radiation leakage was reported on Friday ``but when you
start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation, people start thinking
`Chernobyl' and `Are we going to have another incident,''' said
Jerry Zusel, manager of floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher.
   Wheat settled } cent to 3 cents higher with March at $4.30\
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March at
$2.71} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{ cents higher with March at
$2.18} a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10\ cents higher with
March at $7.70{ a bushel.
   The arctic cold front chilling the nation's midsection prompted
new buying of livestock and meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in anticipation of weight losses and possibly some
livestock deaths.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent to .48 cent higher with February at
75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with March at 84.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent to
.62 cent higher with February at 44.02 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .80 cent to 1.80 cents higher with February at 40.82
cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices slipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in thin trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 46 cents
lower with March at $17.53 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .54
cent lower with March at 50.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.45 cent to 1.10 cents lower with March at 49.17 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Pepsi Fires Back, Coca-Cola Says Pepsi Panicking in Cola Wars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maybe somebody should send Coke and Pepsi to
their rooms until they cool off.
   In the latest volley of the cola wars, Pepsi-Cola Co. is running
a new commercial tweaking Diet Coke's recent 3-D ads and disputing
claims about how many Pepsi drinkers are switching to Diet Coke.
   Coca-Cola Co. fired back, saying its campaign to position
third-ranked Diet Coke as a challenger to regular Pepsi's spot as
the nation's No. 2 soft drink ``apparently has set off a panic at
Pepsi.''
   ``We've struck a sensitive chord,'' said Michael A. Beindorff,
vice president for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
   That's not the way Pepsi sees it. Spokesman Tod MacKenzie said
late Friday it appeared that Pepsi's new ads scored ``a solid right
to the corporate chin'' with its ads attacking the credibility of
Coke's claims.
   Pepsi has complained about Coke's ad claims to the three major
television networks, which are reviewing them. Coca-Cola says it
plans to complain to the networks about Pepsi's new ad, which began
running Thursday night.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade newsletter Beverage Digest,
said the attention that the two soft drink giants are paying to
their diet colas illustrates the growing importance of the diet
segment of the $43 billion retail soda market as the population ages
and becomes more weight conscious.
   Diet Coke started the latest exchange with commercials on last
month's broadcast of the Super Bowl football game that took the
unusual approach of going against regular Pepsi rather than Diet
Pepsi.
   ``Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying Pepsi and
more of them moved to Diet Coke than any other major soft drink,''
the ads say.
   The campaign theme is ``The move is on to Diet Coke'' and the ads
employ ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, an ex-Pepsi pitchman, to
reinforce the point.
   The ads attracted heightened attention because they first aired
in connection with Coke's sponsorship of the Super Bowl halftime
show, the first live network broadcast in three-dimensions.
Coca-Cola bottlers distributed about 20 million pairs of special
glasses so viewers could get the 3-D effect in both the show and an
ad for Diet Coke.
   Pepsi said Coca-Cola's claim was misleading because millions of
families switch to other brands every year, and asked the networks
to pull the ads or demand modifications.
   According to the trade newsletter Beverage Digest, Pepsi's market
share fell 0.1 percentage point to 18.7 percent in 1988, while Diet
Coke and its caffeine-free version rose to 10.2 percent from 9.4
percent in 1987 and Diet Pepsi and its caffeine-free version rose to
6.6 percent from 6.1 percent.
   Pepsi also developed an ad that it began airing Thursday on
network TV.
   It shows a man making a presentation in a boardroom, his back to
the camera as he gestures at a chart that shows Diet Coke sales
rising.
   As the presentation proceeds, a narrator says, ``Last year, two
million families stopped buying Diet Coke and over a million new
families started buying Diet Pepsi. So what's giving Diet Coke such
a distorted view?''
   The answer becomes obvious, as the man turns toward the camera,
wearing 3-D glasses. ``Gentlemen, I trust we are all seeing this the
same way,'' he said as viewers see the other executives are also
wearing the 3-D glasses.
   Meyers said there are elements of truth in both campaigns. Diet
Coke's market share closed the lead on regular Pepsi last year, he
said. But by some measures, he said Diet Pepsi has grown more
rapidly than Diet Coke.
   But, he added, ``You can't have `cola wars' without skirmishes.''

   The resignations of four top executives at
Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. are a blow to attempts by Kidder's parent
General Electric Co. to stem internal problems at the venerable
investment firm, analysts said Friday.
   Michael D. Madden, head of investment banking at the securities
firm and the highest-ranking senior Kidder executive, was among the
four resignations announced Thursday.
   Kidder sources said more departures were expected at the nation's
15th-largest securities firm.
   The latest resignations came less than two weeks after GE named
one of its own executives to head Kidder, prompting the resignation
of 20-year veteran Max C. Chapman Jr., who had been running the
securities group's daily operations.
   In a statement, GE said Friday the departures were
``understandable'' because of disagreements over new directions for
124-year-old Kidder.
   ``While it is disappointing to note the recent departure of
several Kidder officials, employment changes following receipt of
bonuses is not an unusual occurrence in the securities industry,''
said Lawrence A. Bossidy, vice chairman and chief executive officer
of GE's financial services unit.
   Kidder has experienced internal disenchantment, corporate
embarrassment at its involvement in the Wall Street insider trading
scandal, and a loss of stature and clients since GE bought an 80
percent stake in the firm in 1986.
   ``The presence of GE and some of the decisions that have resulted
has contributed to some of the problems,'' said Brenda Davis McCoy,
who follows the securities industry for PaineWebber Inc. ``They've
had numerous management changes and repeated changes in strategy.''
   The other executives who left Thursday are Douglas V. Brown,
co-head of mergers and acquisitions; Thomas W. Ostrander, a managing
director who worked on new business development; and Steven P. Baum,
managing director of mortgage trading.
   Madden said in a telephone interview Friday he had difficulty
maintaining confidence among his bankers because of perceived
inequities in compensation.
   ``The real linchpin of the decision was that I think that
Kidder-GE can ultimately succeed. However, there are a number of
fundamental structural and cultural differences between the two
organizations that need to be addressed,'' he said.
   Kidder sources said there is widespread dissatisfaction at the
firm with reductions in employee bonuses, plus a conflict between GE
management and Kidder's investment bankers over the department's
strategy.
   Analysts said the recent senior management changes by GE
reflected the parent company's desire to exert greater control over
Kidder's day-to-day operations, as well as GE's latest attempt to
deal with difficulties posed by the firm.
   Michael A. Carpenter, the former executive vice president of GE
Capital Corp. who was named Kidder's president and chief executive
officer two weeks ago, declined to comment directly on the impact of
Madden's departure.
   ``While we regret his decision, he leaves behind a strong
organization that will continue to function as an important part of
this firm,'' Carpenter said in a statement.
   Kidder's reputation was tainted when it became embroiled in the
Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. The firm agreed in 1987 to pay
a then-record $25.3 million to settle civil charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   GE made a number of high-level management changes at Kidder
following the settlement, in what was seen as an attempt to repair
what GE perceived as management weaknesses that led to Kidder's
involvement in the scandal.
   Madden said the publicity over insider trading and GE had made it
more difficult for Kidder to sign on new clients.
   ``There comes a point when all the press and all the uncertainty
over the GE-Kidder situation causes directors to start to question
the wisdom of management. It just wears you down. It makes you play
defense,'' he said.

   Energy futures prices slumped Friday amid
conflicting reports from OPEC.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 20
cents to close the day at $17.53 a barrel. The contract had settled
22 cents higher on Thursday after flipflopping earlier in the week.
Other contract months also fell.
   Heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices were among the refined
products that declined on the exchange. The March contract for
domestic heating oil settled 0.24 cent lower at 50.31 cents a
gallon, while unleaded gasoline closed down 0.45 cent at 49.17 cents
a gallon.
   Analysts said crude prices had risen on Thursday, spurred by a
report in an Arabic-language newspaper that Dubai was considering a
10 percent cut in its oil production starting March 1.
   A second report on Friday contradicting the earlier statements
pushed prices down, said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy
investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``It shows the market is still very prone to rumors,'' Barakat
said.
   Barakat said Thursday's report had been perceived as positive
because it suggested Dubai was willing to cooperate to help
stabilize world oil prices. Dubai has refused to cut its production
since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' new quota
system took effect Jan. 1.
   Dubai is one of several emirates in the United Arab Emirates, one
of the 13 OPEC nations. Experts estimate the UAE is exceeding its
quota by about 400,000 barrels a day. It was assigned a quota of
988,000 barrels out of a total 18.5 million barrels for the entire
cartel.
   Investors have remained skittish despite OPEC's new agreement
because in the past the cartel has had problems sticking to similar
accords. Although prices have risen fairly steadily since Jan. 1,
recent reports indicate that several members of the cartel are
continuing to overproduce.
   Analysts said the latest reports from Dubai provided further
evidence that OPEC's agreement remains shaky.

<HEAD>Administration Assures Allies of Commitment to Lowering Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration assured American allies
Friday of the president's commitment to lowering the U.S. budget
deficit but no decisions were reached on a new approach to the
troubling issue of Third World debt, participants in the discussions
said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was the host for the
administration's first international gathering, said the discussions
had been productive with participants expressing the general view
that the global economy is peforming well.
   The meetings, involving finance ministers and central bank
presidents of the industrial world's largest economies _ the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada _
were billed as a get-acquainted session for the new administration
to present its ideas on international matters.
   Participants said Brady assured the other nations of President
Bush's commitment to lowering the budget deficit, promising to
reduce the deficit by more than $60 billion in the next fiscal year,
which begins on Oct. 1.
   A senior Treasury Department official, briefing reporters on
condition that his name not be used, said Brady stressed that Bush
was working to cooperate with Congress in finding a successful
approach to reducing the deficit.
   Brady told reporters that the effort to better coordinate
economic policies between countries was working well with the
participants holding a ``positive view'' about the current state of
the global economy.
   Brady said that the seven countries also had a ``thorough
discussion'' regarding the $1.3 trillion Third World debt burden.
   ``Several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreed-on
strategy based on the same principles that we consider valid,''
Brady said.
   The meetings lasted for 11 hours over Thursday and Friday.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson told reporters that a
number of proposals on Third World debt had been reviewed, including
recommendations by the Japanese and the French for liberalized
lending policies.
   ``We looked at a number of options that have been put on the
table,'' Wilson said. ``We looked at options today and that will
continue, but no decisions were made.''
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, briefing reporters,
said that Brady gave the group assurances that the new
administration viewed reducing the budget deficit as ``very
important.''
   The deficit, which is expected to reach $161 billion this year,
has long been a source of unhappiness for U.S. allies who blame it
for siphoning off capital needed for investment in their own
countries.
   Brady assured the finance ministers that Bush intended to meet
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets, which call for a deficit
of $100 billion in 1990 declining to zero by 1993. Bush will present
his own budget plans before a joint session of Congress next
Thursday.
   A Canadian official, briefing reporters on the condition that the
official's name not be used, said that there was skepticism about
Bush's ``flexible freeze'' approach to reducing the deficit through
spending restraint, without the aid of new taxes.
   The Canadian official said that there were doubts about the
optimistic economic assumptions underpinning the flexible freeze,
especially projections of sharp declines in interest rates.
   Officials said that in addition to the U.S. budget deficit, the
finance officials discussed the apparent stall in further
improvements in huge world trade imbalances.
   The United States trade deficit, after posting big improvements
early in 1988, has been frozen over the past six months while the
Japanese and West German trade surpluses have begun rising again.
   Officials said that the countries remained committed to the
economic policy coordination process begun by Brady's predecessor,
James A. Baker III, who is now secretary of state in the Bush
administration.
   They said that this process still held out the best hope of
narrowing the trade differences by keeping currency rates from
fluctuating. Unlike past sessions of the Group of Seven, as the
countries are known, this week's meetings were held during a period
of relative calm in currency markets.
   The dollar, which has undergone periods of heavy selling pressure
over the past two years, has strengthened and in fact the Federal
Reserve and central banks of the other countries have been selling
dollars to keep it from appreciating too much in value in relation
to other currencies.
   Officials indicated that no consideration had been given to
changing the trading ranges established for the dollar and other
currencies. When the currencies trade outside those ranges, central
banks engage in a process known as intervention, the massive buying
or selling of a currency by a government to influence its price.
   On Third World debt, the countries discussed modifications to the
so-called Baker plan, which has governed handling of the $1.3
trillion Third World debt burden since Baker unveiled it in
September 1985.
   The discussions focused on ways to encourage commercial banks to
voluntarily reduce the debt they hold. Officials predicted the
negotiations would continue with the hope that concrete proposals
could be unveiled at the spring meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, scheduled from March 31 to April 4 in
Washington.
   Bush has pledged to review the American policy on Third World
debt. The United States has found itself increasingly isolated on
the debt issue as political stresses have increased in debtor
countries suffering declining standards of living as they struggled
to meet a rising burden of loan repayments.

<HEAD>Nissan Agrees To Settlement In Bias Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Corp.'s American arm will
distribute $605,600 in back pay to settle a race and age bias case
involving 92 workers in agreement announced Friday.
   The settlement ends an investigation begun in 1984 to determine
if Nissan U.S.A. violated laws against racial and age discrimination
at its headquarters and regional distribution and sales offices.
   The agreement was announced jointly by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in Washington and Nissan in California.
   ``This agreement is significant because Nissan has committed to
providing increased opportunities in high-level sales and management
positions for blacks, Hispanics, women and persons covered'' by age
discrimination laws, EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas said.
   The EEOC said the back pay would be distributed among 92 blacks,
Hispanics, women and Nissan employees over 40 years old covered by
the agency's investigation.
   Ronald Cabibi, Nissan U.S.A.'s vice president of human resources
and administration, said the company denies violating the laws in
question.
   ``While we believe we have always upheld the principles espoused
by the EEOC, we also recognized there was room for improvement in
the way we developed opportunities for protected employees, and in
that regard we are specifically committed to implementing several
changes in our practices,'' a Nissan statement said.
   Nissan U.S.A., the American marketing arm of the Japanese
carmaker, has headquarters in Carson, Calif.
   Nissan also agreed to revise recruitment and hiring procedures to
ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of potential employees; eliminate
college degree requirements for most sales and management positions;
conduct annual training for management on anti-discrimination laws;
and submit compliance reports to the EEOC.

<HEAD>Bic To Market $5 French Perfume In Supermarkets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bic Corp. is confident about plans to
market a $5 French spritz perfume alongside its ballpoint pens,
throwaway razors and cigarette lighters, but some fragrance experts
think the idea stinks.
   Bic officially will inaugurate its new product next month in the
same retailers where it sells the other items, and an advertising
campaign will start in early April, Bic spokeswoman Sharon DuPuy
said Friday.
   The quarter-ounce spray perfumes _ to be called Jour and Nuit _
will be offered at a price comparable to that of cologne, a much
less concentrated form of fragrance.
   Bic, a subsidiary of Societe Bic of France, launched the perfume
business a year ago in France with a new $25 million factory.
Firmenich, one of Europe's top four fragrance makers, is supplying
the essences for Parfum Bic.
   European sales have been strong, according to company officials
and cosmetic analysts.
   In the United States, Parfum Bic will be sold in the usual Bic
outlets: drug stores, discount stores, supermarkets, convenience
stores.
   ``The concept is vintage Bic. If you, as a consumer, have an
opportunity to buy perfume for a price which is less than you might
spend on toilet water, would there be much reason not to?'' said
David Liebowitz, an analyst at American Securities in New York.
   But others had doubts.
   J.T. Botindari, fragrance buyer at Colonial Drug in Cambridge,
Mass., calls the planned Parfum Bic a ``junky idea.'' He said the
success of the product will depend ``on how sophisticated your buyer
is and whether he wants to buy perfume from a company that makes
lighter fluid.''
   Jay Salzman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment
firm, said other failed efforts to market low-budget perfumes
included one by Revlon in the early 1980s. He said one of the
problems is pilferage, and another is that $5 may be more than women
may want to spend for such a product in a supermarket or convenience
store.
   ``If they are successful, they will be the first,'' Salzman said.
``It's been tried. It's very tough. My visceral reaction is that, if
it is ultimately successful, it will be an uphill battle. It might
be more expensive than Bic thinks.''
   ``This is the same thing people told us about shavers,'' DuPuy
responded. ``No one has been able to combine this quality and this
price and this packaging.''

<TEXT>
   E.W. Scripps Co. on Friday announced an
agreement to sell The Sun-Tattler to a media organization affiliated
with the Dallas Times Herald. Terms were not disclosed.
   The buyer is DTH Media Inc., which bought the Dallas newspaper in
June 1988.
   Scripps, which is based in Cincinnati, has owned the Sun-Tattler,
a morning newspaper published Monday-through-Saturday, since 1965
and will continue to publish it as usual until the transfer of
ownership is complete.
   Scripps had announced its intention to sell the paper on Oct. 26,
saying its newspaper operations had been unprofitable.
   The Sun-Tattler, with 164 employees and a circulation of 31,000,
was founded as the Weekly Sun in 1935, and merged with the South
Broward Tattler in 1942. It expanded to five days a week in 1959 and
six days in 1963.
   Scripps is a diversified media company which operates 19 daily
newspapers, nine television stations, 5 radio stations and cable
television systens in 10 states.
